 crossing here for the tubular tenth series today and tomorrow if you like was nothing forever we were going to get aboard everyone together so Jack is now distinguished professor at Penn State information sciences and technology he is in the Khan Academy is a cm fellow he won the Lifetime Achievement Award very early in the body history he's a true pioneer in HCI it's Beth when there wasn't a feel like this it was an IBM Research if you know anything about scenario based design design rationale scaffolding training wheels that's all jack and some of it Merida this waffle he was very early in getting communities to be online was a blaxican village project and I think he's going to talk some more today about that kind of community infrastructure welcome so I have too many slides as you can see from the count there so my one way of dealing with this is to tell you with the old talk is about cases of it to be about yeah and basically I'm talking about I want to ponder two views of community one is kind of almost a meme really which is that community informatics and the community for that matter is about last-ditch social remediation communities in trouble it's going away and you know community informatics could be a set of strategies to use technology to slow that or reverse it but another way of looking at community when I want to push in this context is the idea that community is a place for routine socio technical innovation and and the idea there is that it's a it's a it's a comfortable place where you live it's right outside your door and that maybe you can work with your neighbors on something beside stasis which is sort of conventional view of community so I'm sort of urging pushing community if you love something set it free all right so what is community well it's a foundation for society for human society for citizenship and community structures trace them back to Paleolithic coming bands and Neolithic villages although the connection of what we know is community to these early structures is rather metaphorical since hunting bands are 50 people and early villages for 150 and our communities when they're small and intimate there are several tens of thousands of people and that's a small town but it's very important or has been alleged be very important for the development of identity for our emergence as humans adults learning to work together learning the skills that will enable us to work together a life and it's also an interesting kind of social support structure people usually play more than one role which is called multiplex and they're also highly brokered organizations in the sense of Raoul burdens claim that term so people are very connected more than average Lee connected certainly more than the kinds of brokering burnt describes so the return to this crisis and loss of mean it goes back two tourneys who is the the German sociologist who first distinguished community in society or combined shaft and gazelle shaft excuse me alfreton say a farm where they can perhaps but but there are echoes of this all through the sociology of community which was the main business of American sociology for the first of 80 years or so Warren talks about the great change that occurred in the 1900s of integrating all of our social institutions vertically instead of horizontally meaning that for example school is no longer the business of a local community it's integrated vertically through the through the whole society everybody gets an instance of a national school of course it's not so true in the United States but and watch place its most other places and then all the way to Putnam who famously realize everybody's Bowling Alone and watching television and community has kind of gone away what's what's most salient about this is there really isn't any program for fixing any of this in fact far from this program from fixing it it's it's really argued that there are no remedies and that basically community will continue to be lost although if you have a mathematical been to your mind that can't be true things can't keep debiting in 30 but anyway setting that aside one of the great articulations of this is james coleman who we all know for the social capital construct but in his book community conflict in 1957 he talked about patterns of community conflict and trajectories for conflict and they actually all end up with the community dissembling so there are no remedies for this so this isn't a very comfortable view to hold and it's hard to see where to go with it so i know i'm making a slightly exaggerated distinction but another way of looking at community is more of a collection of practices and skills and one place you can look at a start for that is Alexis de Tocqueville who visited the United States in the early 1830s wrote a book called democracy in America which was it's constructed in various ways when you look at references to it but it's actually like this talk in fact it's a kind of an exploration of looking for ideas so he's not I don't think he's really arguing for a point of view so much as asking after the Democratic blizzard works its way through the earth you know what are we going to do because there's a certain stability in fuel as it was implemented in Europe and everywhere else and he realized that was not going to last and he's asking what's going to what's going to happen in the future and one thing he noticed in American society that excited him was the voluntary local associations the way Americans got a lot of business done by working together in a local level which was not true in Europe of course just to put things in context a Frenchman in 1835 was in middle age if you think about it is lived through the French Revolution and the Napoleonic era so he's pretty traumatized person anyway so you could look more at these skills like the he called them habits at the heart that says Tocqueville's phrase look at these voluntary associations how they work what kind of skills they consist of what kind of things they do or in the psychology of community which had emerged later than the sociology of community were people like Saracen and his students and their students were working on the experience of community the consequences of belonging and investment I think one problem I have with this work is it was over influenced by cognitive dissonance which is another one of these traumatic ideas that swept through psychology and sort of dismal in a lot of ways it's also right you know look at Sur will extend but anyway I want to circle back to Rockville and think more about these possibilities for doing community and implications of that so my plan is to take another look at community networks which is the original movement of community informatics which took place between roughly between 1973 in 1998 and reconstruct that as an innovation movement which is not the way it's always looked at and then I want to push community with technology with these six themes and i'll tell you in advance this is a working agenda these aren't really independent or optimally factored their six things i thought of because as I said like toc'v align I'm I see this as something we inevitably have to come to terms with but I don't know how to do that so I'm looking for lenses to do it better and then of course wrap up the talk if I get that far so community networks um this is a really odd idea that somebody had in 1973 which was to connect the community to itself with networking it's not idea for several reasons again putting on a historical context to this the internet did not exist in 1973 in fact almost no one was aware that networking was a possibility for using computers and networking itself really meant a coaxial cable so that's how you met with Network things and that was the only way anyway there were mixed motives for this and part of them are a communitarian in the usual sense which I mentioned leads this mean little community loss and that is reminding us of our values and bringing us closer giving us ways of relating to one another but they also had a very strong activist agenda things they wanted to do to change society and that's what i want to emphasize so here are a few that i'd pick in this period or bad thousand community networks in north america they're related projects and other continents but i'm not going to talk about them today and they really weren't like this at all the berkeley community memory is the first of community network this is the one that's mainframe based you could start a community forum for a quarter they had very famous projects as we look back like online remembrances of people who died in the Vietnam War which was one of the Tron's of that society and and also an agenda of how to democratize society further through information that's the kind of activist agenda that I wanted to call attention to also talk briefly about the Cleveland freenet Big Sky Telegraph saunemin Santa Monica public electronic Network she's very close to you guys Santa Monica being a beach town west of LA and they had a community network which was a closed networking system very interesting idea course in predating the internet who would have thought you wanted to connect to the whole world but so it wouldn't have had it wouldn't have had access to our extensive experience with doing that but this is this is a case where there were direct dialogues between homeless people and mayor at Santa Monica it's really unprecedented kind of thing that couldn't even happen today but it happened then and it was also productive since it led to better facilities for homeless in that town at that time and Judy mentioned the black Blacksburg electronic village which I was part of and it's mainly famous because it was the first community network to be implemented in the web infrastructure so just a quick look back at some of these projects this is the Berkeley community memory only a few of you will recognize this kind of committing equipment as possibly having ever existed but it did exist and in fact our term which has been adapted in several ways the electronic bulletin board comes from the terminal which looked like this it's not this one but it was a it was in Leopold's record store in Berkeley right underneath the bulletin board Alton board me cork board with pins and so forth so the electronic bulletin board was right under it the Cleveland farina had a few years later is quite an interesting and active innovation project in several ways first of all their idea was that public health information should be accessible to everybody through network computing quite a radical idea from 1985 and also interestingly they abstracted the software framework that this was built in and provided it to people to win to start community networks in any other community so it's really end user programming also way ahead of its time and then the blacksburg electronic village again innovative for its time although many of you even the younger people here might have had experiences with this web one which is kind of clunky this is essentially a way of making information hierarchies not as awful to interact with but in enabled activism to for one thing the ease of incorporating images into this kind of a community networking infrastructure had a big impact in this case this very scary picture of what could happen in south central Virginia was enough to make interstate 73 not happen interstate 73 to this day is in North Carolina but isn't that violated Virginia I don't know that this was the reason but but it could possibly have heard so my point is to observe that however these infrastructures may have drawn people in the communities together made the more interdependent value one another more developed social ties and so forth they were also innovative they were new ways to do new sorts of things and they were operating in the community context and as we look back they were they were they were creating new vitality and new sources of power in a community whatever else they were doing so I want to push community with technology in this spirit and so inspired by this earlier work I want to suggest ways we could move community informatics to be more innovative and to be more about innovation so what i've done here is i've listed six distinctive themes or commitments of community informatics sort of let's say the established view of it on the wall and see it's my left I guess it's your left to and and on the right ones i suggest we could try to move toward or or push and they include learning and trying new things together recruiting people who will change things critically enter it in integrating information sources instead of just being aware some some more active kind of awareness to make conflict in a more visible instead of less visible as if you've read James Coleman's book you want to make it less visible because you know it will cause your community to die but that may not be right it may be a matter of whether you want to be driven by descriptive study conflicts that occurred whether you want to be innovated and take a chance on a new way of doing things and identifying and better leveraging resources and finally co-production which I want to distinguish from just being supportive or even being altruistic okay so learning and trying new things together this is a an old project from that blacksburg electronic village infrastructure so this would be a 1995 effort and I was very inspired by a statement by Andrew Cohill who I otherwise thought was not a very nice person but it was the director of this project and he once very offhandedly said to me that the real meaning of this is is it's a very large scale learning project and well I still remember it now and I think that's really true so here's an example where when I met the the blacksburg seniors group they were sharing emails about what we might call oral history or personal history so these people are all over 60 years old and when they think about what the town was like when they were young that's history it's also really inaccessible to a lot of younger people so we thought this would be a good thing to share they wanted to share it and it was actually fairly easy to share through the web and had a much bigger impact on the whole community through doing it creating a dialogue so this is just a simple forum system where you can tell a story and then people can post comments and what we found is a lot of these stories didn't vote comments people were amazed at things that had happened in places that they were familiar with although years before this also had some indirect effects that made the seniors much more visible they had the fairly outlandish ambition to be technology leaders in the town although they were always able to articulate what that might mean but this actually caused it to happen so people look to them as source of innovative ideas about what to do with the bed besides as I showed you that earlier a couple of slides ideas what to do with it um it also had interesting we had the opportunity to discover interesting and I think innovative things that weren't possible before so this phenomenon of lost hokies you probably know people from Virginia Tech call themselves Hokies the Lost Hokies were people who no longer lived in Virginia Tech but with this web-based infrastructure they could look at these pages as easily as anybody else could and so they could continue to participate in the community at least this extent despite being far away okay and more recently this is 2014 we're still still looking at innovative ways to do similar things one reason for this is that is part of this old view of communities communities are about making places making community places and imbuing them with meaning and our law state college app is of course able to do things that we could do it just that simple web site so if you walk to a place like this is the hotel state college and a photograph from the 1930s it's still there doesn't look that different actually and but when you walk there you can access this information and you can also participate in the usual social social media interactions like commenting and liking and people were interested in this they could use it anytime anywhere we did a study sort of walking people mound for the first 14 sites we documented and found that you know of course people who live there longer related to it differently than people who live there less but people were very interested in sort of unique quirky history of things they'd seen possibly every day for years and had no idea what it was for example there's a one collection of small statues there it's a family of pigs and I saw it many times it's a landmark in the town of course I've met why were why a family of pigs and it turns out it has something to do with when animals were allowed to run free in the town house he has changed so yeah similarly there's a sinkhole which became a football field but it earlier been the town dump because the Pennsylvania geology is one of these sinkholes that open up in the earth you probably read about them they're horrifying because of live anywhere else but I don't know they open up that can be very deep and very inviting to throw your trash in there I guess and so that's what they did so another so I should say that more or less all the other examples that are going to talk about are also examples of learning and trying new things together so that's an example of how these are not you know independent themes but second theme second done independent theme is recruiting people who will change things and this is an interesting perspective on community if you think about innovation for example Big Sky telegraph was one of the first implementations of online courses but it had a big sky telegraph was in Montana the United States but it had kind of a down side effect kids took the courses and began to begin to think about going to MIT and then they did and of course they don't come back to Montana so you know I don't know if that's not all good but it's not all bad either but it does make the challenge of recruiting people who will change things more complex and these stressors are very apparent nowadays you can see them as a sign of you know you know may live in interesting times or worse than that but there's a lot of economic turbulence everybody knows in the world population shifts that are going on is from the news every day now because they're got it so horrible and of course weather and climate changes such as I don't know is your is your lack of rain an example of that or was that always true anyway there's examples of it everywhere well what this requires is a different kind of thinking so resilient strategies convert stressors into social resources for example just being aware of problems could be a source of strength to be a resource you know but you don't always problematize it that way because you need to be aware and confront problems as opposed to those you prevention and mitigation are not going to be sufficient strategies for for those an example in small towns like the one I live in is that we used to talk about town-gown tensions but really the Newtown down crisis is called graduation because we lose just like Montana we lose all of our innovative young people every year they finish up and because they have never become engaged in the local community it's not even a possibility that they're going to stay in our area they just leave now in a previous day people wouldn't have even thought that was a problem they would think well isn't that what happens now they think it's a problem and there are strategies my town to recruit and retain graduates which i think is really interesting but it shows how some of these stressors are forcing innovation forcing us to think differently about in our case of the undergraduate population passing through here's in another earlier project this is from the later period in that Blacksburg electronic village project and the idea here was to make the town seem more innovative to people or that's one of the ideas anyway the project we called moose Berg was a web-based move that visualized the town could be navigated like a virtual reality space and we weren't directly enabling certain things we wanted people to do like build your own neighborhood into this infrastructure or we work directly with some groups like save our streams so they could use this map widget to annotate water quality readings Blacksburg is one of these towns that buried a stream that used to run through it struggles great which is a terrible idea and now they can't go back from that idea but they select the live with a stress and deteriorating stream so water quality is a big interest there but they indirectly enable other things for example this is the virginia museum of natural history exists in Blacksburg and some students created a tool that allowed you to disperse artifacts from the museum throughout the the town actually throughout the town's virtual double ganger and actually one of those students was James Fogarty professor is me coming here yes yes so you can ask him about that yeah he was an undergraduate when he did this and also an apartment company an apartment complex in blacksburg made virtual walkthroughs is fairly common thing to do now you are going on sabbatical you rent apartments this way but wasn't that common in 99 you know so this is the theme of recruiting people who will change things is one of the concepts that other people have have come up with is the idea of community animation community animation is enabling and facilitating community level innovation so it's so you've learned a new term if nothing else but this is this has had an interesting effect and again I'm drawing on my own town a lot of my researches is really placed in in the town i live in this new leaf initiative was started by a couple of penn state alumni didn't leave but who stayed and they are community animators i mean they don't really do anything but they facilitate everything and it may sound I don't know it's a it can sound a puzzling you're you know how could that be but they've been so effective they actually were given a big studio in town hall so they could do it more but it has been effective and it led to it another thing called the co space which is a residential arrangement where 12 attempted to say young people i'm sure they're younger than me but they may not be really young but there are 12 people who want to live and breathe innovation live together in this co space for periods of time working on innovations and then other people move in to take their places so these kinds of institutions weren't standard equipment and communities even in 20 years ago and finally the town itself and this wasn't I mean I'm wearing this because I worked with the town but i also just read this in the newspaper they want they have the perennial problem that municipal government has of how to prioritize what's going to be done you know in fact dickering over this is pretty much what you Nissa piment is about but their their approach which I thought was extremely innovative it hasn't been implemented yet but was to use a kind of crowd funding or you know mechanism where if you want to do something you put it out there as a proposal and see how many people are actually willing to pony up money or sweat equity or something to do it as opposed to just trying to influence the town council to do it from the top down but I think that's a highly innovative way to do this on the more the technology side we created the sincerity project which is a very simple idea it simply aggregates feeds so at this point of the project there were 50 community feeds that were aggregated and redisplay one thing that happens when you do that is that a display of updates and initiatives that could seem very more of them and lacking in all life becomes 50 times more exciting because purely through aggregation so this actually matters the people who look at information so it takes information that's often sub-threshold makes it above threshold makes it more noticeable it also makes the resources in the community more visible like and resources could be opportunities what's happening who's doing something and so forth and the latest application of this is that new leaf used this kind of thing when you walk into their space in town hall to inform people who are showing up to do co work that things are happening and what they might work on together we also have this app called community animator where the idea is make everybody a community animator you declare your interests and your state of animation in this app and then as you wander around if you are animated you're visible than everybody else and you can have a third place on your phone since unfortunately you know this idea of third places you know it's not it's not your family and not where your work it's the other place and it used to be taverns and I guess taverns is a main example where you go and talk with your your other working-class male comrades I don't know so it's also kind of a cartoonish idea but but the the idea of a third place is that this is a sort of a accord institution of community to get together and talk about things that aren't work in our family because that's the shared interest in the community so in community animator we've explored you know what what kinds of rubrics would be effective what rubrics are people interested in for example people don't want to focus on news they want to focus on activity or interests you know commitments but not news items which is interesting you'll see other systems that are about news and we the method we're using to study this is through community animation happenings which is good for me and something I can contribute since I was alive in the 1960s when there were happenings but what we do is we gather a bunch of people together and let them animate each other some this is this is worth its it's underway future State College is an idea that was caused by the idea of law state college actually I should have mentioned when I went through the store the law state college story that la state college was a term that one of my one of the leaders in the community came up with and we were inspired us to build the app but I actually think it should be called found state college because it's a way of discovering the history of the community it's not the lost part I think is what we shouldn't be emphasizing in that but that's the way names go it's called la State College the future state college project besides just being a routine creativity where you try to turn things upside down was inspired by a discussion going on in the community about the 12th year master plan and most municipalities have a long-term planning horizon process they go through and nobody pays any attention to it except the usual suspects which are three people that you know try to out have outsized influence everybody else ignores it until it's been approved and then they start complaining but that's how democracy works but we thought a way to make this more approachable for people would be instead of having a large document to have small vision vision ments of how it would change particular places you could go to so the way this works is you walk around the community there's a part of a master plan that pertains to where you are future State College tells you what's going to go there and even think about it standing in the place where the change will occur and people found this very stimulating and made a lot of comments and in fact this let us discover another interesting thing about our community government partners which is a how thin a line there is between the concern that people aren't engaged aren't playing role aren't being creative aren't pushing government and the concern that they are and this was an example of case in point so people went from having no interest in the master plan to giving lots of suggestions and then that became a problem for the municipal government all it was probably 11 guests over time they'd be happy to adjust to we also used a slightly different kind of method here which was costing people as they walk through the street which worked very well people are actually very happy to be a cost of course you have to be somewhat careful critically integrate information sources so a traditional proxy measure of community in studies of community is whether you read the local newspaper which is really not a good measure anymore since we know that people it's more a marker of age than engaging in the community people don't read papers anymore so it's not really a good proxy measure but it's also asking too little in a way because this age or that age of community awareness was really just a passive kind of awareness like knowing what's happening knowing that there's a meeting knowing that there was a result but it's not an active engagement it's not like future state college where you push your comments to the town council so when exploring this we come up with the concept of local news chatter this system integrates two sorts of feeds Twitter feeds from local accounts and local news feeds from formal media like we have a we have a newspaper and we also have a student newspaper it's often hard to figure out which one is which but we have two papers and we also have a public public media and other well we have five in total that we use for this and what we do is we classify the tweets and the news stories by text analysis using a term frequency inverse document frequency counts and this this tag cloud here indicates the topics that are extracted the larger ones are in the the top frequency quartile and then we have ones in the lower frequency quartile which would be more the top ones would be more like following up things you've heard about already and the bottom would be more discovery oriented things you might very well not have heard about but the so basically we have is a news story year so this could be from the local newspaper and then these are the tweets that using tf-idf are are diagnosed as being about the same thing right namely the tag that you selected to initiate this somebody get this arrangement it's not too complicated um so there's continual text analysis going on and background and actually even in the scale of our town which is rather small this changes all the time it's probably the tweets that are driving to change and it integrates formal and informal community news and facilitates a discussion uses word hyperlocal it's news about the place used by the people in the place and directed to people in the place and for this we deployed this for a trial try to get people to use it and 35 people we worked with 27 were susceptible to that and and so i have here their usage characteristics anyway what we found is that this co presentation of tweets and who's was in fact interesting to people that they found that there was a lot of a lot of additional insight generated by seeing the two news sources animated together here's a person who was very negative about Twitter but got more interested in when they saw this kind of use of it and it raised interest in tweeting and retweeting because people would find things that struck them and then retweet something of course that is also part of the feed and we did get some comments also about people who were surprised to know that tweets are publicly available and can be repurposed and so that's a privacy issue of people already analyzed but I wouldn't say that was so much a concern but a surprise to people the fourth theme that I wanted to expand a bit is making conflict and synthesis more visible and we studied this by investigating some large-scale community can really call in deliberations they were issues morning up was very exciting was this high pressure gas pipeline routing issue you probably know that the way the gas network works is there's a trunk line of high pipes and the one in your house isn't that but the one out your street might be that and of course if you're thinking about very worst thing that can happen the higher pressure pipes blow up a lot more with more violence so the debate in the community classics not my backyard kind of thing in one side was where to root the gas pipeline and it's very interesting to see this discussion from start to finish since it involved all the things that worry Coleman you know people escalating and how uncivil and nasty they were to get their way and doing things that can never be undone socially but nevertheless this is really for us Grist we're interested in putting in place methods that are different one of the things that's happening here and it was through the gas pipeline issue and really in spades is that because people think issues like this will engender conflict they submerge them but of course that just means that when people discuss discover them they they it's like exponentially greater everybody is much more mad so so what our position is things should be more visible we studied the citizen initiative review in Oregon which is mandated by state law organs one of these states that has a lot of ballot initiatives where people vote on lawns directly that this is important because this is not how town governments work most time governments in the US are what's called the council and mayor model and laws are voted by councils so you can try to influence councillors but you have no influence on the law I'm not sure about California I would expect you probably have ballot initiative but it's not sure where I live anyway so in Oregon they had this model it was documented state law we studied their practice it's interesting because what they do is convene a panel of citizens who are not supposed to they're allowed to have positions but their job is to create high-quality proton analyses for voters so the target of the citizen initiative review is a voter's guide it's very brief very succinct and calls out the important issues pro and con and because this is done at a state level they the panel of citizens is informed by experts really international experts so does it's it's done at a scale really in some ways would not scale to a town nevertheless we scaled it to a town we call ours community issue review it's aimed a little differently because citizens don't pass ballot initiatives in Pennsylvania or more specifically in state college we focused it on analysis of plans so for example there's a plan to put surveillance cameras in a residential neighborhood that's near the campus who they're going to pick up as probably students that are throwing beer bottles in their backyard and stuff like major crimes like that but anyway that's that's it one discussion another one was a proposal for a mixed-use development project but so that's what we're focusing on is the analysis of plans so at an early stage try to get people involved in the process but in other ways the mandate to people is similar we want them to create a high quality procon analysis not justify the extreme decision that the most extreme decision they can see themselves occupying and I'd say this is a work in progress but I we've also made a lot of headway people people do try to people are used to working the system and what we do with those people is we put him on the panel because that's really the best way to learn that things can be resolved in their own stakeholders beside you so that's that's our approach to making conflict more visible the fifth one I had was identifying better leveraging resources and communities have a lot of resources they don't know about so I allowed this earlier but in studies i did in blacksburg the rate of community brokers where a broker is somebody who is a member of two or more organizations is exactly analogous to burt's definition of a corporate broker is a nine times higher it's forty seven percent of participants instead of five percent which is what bird found also the longevity of brokers in a community context that's how long you continue to participate in in two or more associations municipal associations of some sort is about four and a half times longer so after two years we found ninety percent were still active bird finds twenty percent so these are interesting resources that are not really taking advantage of if a corporation had a rate of brokers and longevity of brokers like this would assume based on what earth found that they be the most innovative organization on earth but that's not what communities expect nor do they have any way of utilizing these is multifaceted connections here's another one which is a workshop that we started with the help of the NSF and this is taking Andrew Cowell's idea about community learning very seriously we were we worked with groups to find what their big challenge was and then get them together in a workshop setting to talk about their challenge what we found is that for a lot of these challenges there is expertise to address them in the community it's just not being leveraged very well because it's not visible so there have been eight of these workshops now and this is this is I call this the shared challenge resource if everybody is aware that there's a need that's a resource not you know it's not it doesn't make things worse it makes them better to get together and find out other people have that problem too like that yeah well it's not going to work well anyway I already told you what talk is about same recipe left as an exercise I've also been working at thi banking which is another approach to identifying resources in the community here the idea is first one kind of resource is your participation that's a resource but another very important resource very easy to miss is your willingness to accept help from somebody else that's a huge resource and time banking makes these resources more visible time banking is an exchange mechanism where what you exchanged is valued by the time it takes to share it so you know I mow your lawn takes an hour and you know that gives me an hour credit at the time bank and somebody else can give me a violin lesson for that and this it's a very it's an interesting kind of institution it can almost strike you as a wacky idea at first especially if you know Edgar Khan who is totally wacky and invented it but it's spread across the world there are thousands of time banks in the world and it's actually been favored also by the turbulence in the global economy in Spain just to pick a troubled country time banking tripled in five years participation in time banking so a lot of it looks like this it's on the web you post these offers to do things for others and needs that you would like to have fulfilled and we developed mobile time banking our motive for doing that was to make time banking more flexible so that the less transactional less have to be less playful a web-based interaction is something you're planning what you're going to do tomorrow or next week a nap interaction you could be thinking what you're going to do in an hour and and you know side of the scenario here young mothers stuck at home with a said kid runs out of aspirin if that person can ask the community who's near the pharmacy is a good chance somebody is so that's just one kind of example but there would be many others so we we've worked with our world which is the largest time bank aggregator in the US and with several thousand users of this mobile time banking app now in a survey we've just finished I think we finished data collection but we haven't analyzed it yet yeah I should I should also say in terms of the growth of time banking our world in the two years we worked with them and deployed this app and possibly the app was a factor but I doubt it they doubled in size so time making you know it seems a little bit counterintuitive it's definitely a happening thing so I'm going to skip the study and Trading spheres this is just this finding like your your your factory game people trade with their friends and all the ones that don't have friends trade as if they were in a friend group and then there's also some movement from acquaintances upgrading to friends and strangers upgrading to acquaintances so I just say a few words about co-production the interesting thing to notice here and again it can be subtle is there are a lot of services that can't be delivered we often talk about service delivery I've kind of think this really is a mistaken view because in all these domains I've listed here learning emotion health and well-being social support you can't deliver services you have to have the co active cooperation of the person you're delivering the service to you can ignore that contribution but that may not be a good idea if you want to understand what's happening just I can't resist it describing this example from the British National Health Service where in some time banks in Britain you can be prescribed time bank service for mood disorders so so if you have mild depression your National Health Service doctor of course that really saving a lot of money than health and England you could prescribe service at a time bank so what do you do you you end up walking with an elderly person to do food shopping you're providing that person with a service and you're also getting to fulfilling the prescription you had to serve in a time bank that's really a good value equation for medical service so I call it hyper efficient because it's it's much better than cost ain't nothing it actually produces value as people get healthier and so we're working on a an app which I also described this is time banking without the time or the bank and in this app you basically hook up with somebody to go to lunch or walk your dog or other common co-productions where the key thing here I promised I'd tell you this but running out of time to do it is that this is not a matter of altruism being a nice person it's really for co-production to actually be occurring you have to get value and the person you're interacting with gets value and there's also an indirect effect of social capital so it's hyper efficient and just like the National Health Service example and so this one I have no idea of this going to work it's not it's not deployed at all yet okay so this is a slide you already saw before so I won't spend any time on it to someone it was my point and these are the six things that I mentioned I'm for them a few times I mentioned they're not properly factored yet but a view of ideas for doing that I'd be happy to co-produce something with you and then just to say that this idea of the community as an innovation laboratory it's not a new idea the knows the term living laboratory at least as I've been able to determine comes from Robert Park in 1925 so it's pretty much the foundations of American sociology and as I also mentioned the three decades of community networking were arguably all about technology driven innovation this is also not hard to do maybe I've conveyed that perhaps not but it's a lot of fun to work with your neighbors and local government and things like that there are very interesting external factors we all despair about them or talking about things at dinner last night's or making ourselves sad and of course that's easy it's easy to get that way but you could also say we live interesting times and social innovations are the only way we're going to get through it or you can get through it at all so current in it well can they do this or shy executives get this I guess you see this okay thank you where do you see the role of the big social networks in this like do you think that do you think that it's possible in the future mini basis will take up the role is providing more like real communities people that are locally around you well I mean Facebook itself is pretty innovative and has engendered lots of innovations I think it's I think my answer is more it's just operating at a different scale and again I think in the community informatics world I think there's way too much defensive sensitivity about you know global tools like Facebook I think if people if there's a tool it causes people to interact and trust more and you know know more about others and perhaps be more innovative that can't be all bad so so I think that's all good it's just at a different scale so my my work is all focusing on locales and trying to find the resources and locales and make them make them useful innovatively make them useful so we have red states and blue states and communities are purple and so the visibility in the conflict that you've been addressing but you know these are issues that are more not not so deep seeded as political differences or people's attitudes toward race and right have you ever thought about trying to address more deep-seated differences among people on community has anyone ever tried to have and well I get answered I can answer for talk though i think i think that the argument would be that if you can build more cooperation and do more productive things in a local level that that will provide a foundation for more for respect for liberty and equality at higher levels I mean that's the like you you just framed it community is purple and so I think it's a resource for dealing with that higher level conflict and I think if people develop habits of the heart for example debating inter spectral way local issues like the gas pipeline then they might be that those skills might translate to other kinds of discussions but but what we see is that there's a shortage of those skills at the local level so I think you know one answer is we've got a lot to do just there and then we could see if that provided a better foundation for making a more functioning society otherwise the other point also coming from parkville is that our form of government really is designed to make this happen to it you know you know i mean the design of divers ya know I talk about the design ranch you know democracy I mean if you look at the the design of Congress it's designed to work exactly as it works so I think the problem is it's not only the people you know I think you've designed a system to screw ourselves working you
