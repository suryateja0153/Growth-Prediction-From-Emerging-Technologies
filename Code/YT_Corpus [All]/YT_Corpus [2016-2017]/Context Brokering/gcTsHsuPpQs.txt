 well let's go ahead and start once again that we have a very distinguished group to address us starting with moment immediately to my left is in a black who I'd never met physically before but she's actually one of the editors of Providence magazine and her most recent work is possibly includes a exchange with her family friend the actor Richard Dreyfuss which is a fascinating overview of engagement in the public life instead of looking forward to hearing about love Susannah Rebecca hi Rex from a senior fellow but the Hudson Institute has an article in current issue of Providence on nuclear weapons she's a wonderful Nash security expert and so we're delighted that she can join us in finally Paul foyer the one of our contributing editors also a professor here or a fellow I should say that the Institute of research paula fischer research fellow and a regular rider at forbes.com and it has been that particularly with a special penetration insight about the role of Russian orthodoxy and russian foreign policy that she'll be touching on today so I believe we're going to start with you Susanna that your understanding we're going to be anything promptly than one hours lets everyone could stick to the more than 50 minutes the question I'm astonished and but frankly speaking after the doctor broke out on a parallel topic and the only way that I dare to do this is that I'm not speaking as an academic that's a sort of journalists to what we do is we go from ignorance to knowledge my experience has been that understanding the Islamic state is essentially possum revising ones earlier oversimplified ideas in light of the almost infinite number of ways there are to be wrong and so I'm calling this getting less wrong about the Calvin the days after the friday the 13th chats in Paris a vivid set of images made it to a comedian first there was the darkened eiffel tower paris itself in the morning it gave you the city's central belle époque identity in advance second what there were photographs of iconic structures and cities around the globe lit up in the blue white and red of the tricolor and solidarity these parallel images the darkness in one city the blazing colors and the others highlight a particular feature of the war that this incarnation of Islamism is declaring it's a war not on one particular nation state but when I was but on one jihadi writing would and does call one of the Crusaders capitals as controls a defined geographical area has more or less established political structures the Western powers nevertheless don't want to dignify it by calling it a nation-state what we missed though is that the dignity that in itself is not the dignity of they should take the acronym Isis call mistake they're off in Syria with a misleading one is il-2 is misleading as this seems to limit the group's ambitions to the lot the group has recently changed its self description to is Islamic state which at least starts to clear things up but all these acronyms are also misleading because of the assumptions that we have about four distinct as does not consider itself a nation-state over against Iraq and Syria or over against other nation-states it does not want to join a community of nations Russia Muslims to your state Baghdad the advanced felony resulting you proclaimed Calif in 2014 is your state Syria is not for Syrians and Iraq is not for a rocket the land is for the Muslims all Muslims in other words there is no intended overlap between a nation and a state rather the intended overlap is between the global community of all Muslims fiamma and the territory health I Daktronics armies and the territory is not of course confined areas of the Middle East story into territories like Spain once held by muscle has been taken back from the north of Houston fact Avenue does not mince words in his call this is my advice to you that he holds you at you will conquer Rome and owned the world of lol's Isis is a conventional english-language rendition of the arabic acronym dash d standing for dolla dolla homers not well married estate instead it is something closer to dynasty or regime and the kind of regime it is is of course the countless the primary reaction of al-qaeda not to mention other less radical political Islamist groups whose our cobby's group's original and vigorous declaration of the Islamic state in or of Iraq in 2006 it seems to have been embarrassment many understood abu umar all day going to be claiming to be reestablishing mchale event or rather having was claimed for him by his handler who i use on my street how many successor of a kind of impresario of terror who had cast the first beg daddy in the rural Calif there was a slight element of cosplay in this claim in the view of mainstream G hotties like those MLK to central it was extreme over reaching grandiose this is though a break a field of Ottawa house Berg who brought up in Notting Hill or somewhere and gotten a doctorate and then had been moved to Vienna and declared the rebirth of the Holy Roman Empire and amended the allegiance of Heinz Fisher and Jana Sadler and all the people of Austria and Hungary and set his sights on I acai then nails a leaky Kelly whole point of actually controlling territory this was not a minor flaw it was at that point in internet state what you might call the Caliphate in speech and this does not do it once you declare the Caliph if you have to behave like Calvin otherwise you can essentially shot your wad and the AG has felt that by 2009 I has had quite definitively done this now imagine that our Habsburg claimant ad in the wake of an architect civil war throughout Central Europe actually managed to establish functioning state taxes to enforce justice the implied came to claim to be a caliph it was silly in 2006 it is not silly now and it is no longer merely implied is is certainly enacting a monopoly on force in the region taming the other way for jihadi groups and going a long way to eliminate the anarchic criminality that prevailed in Syria during the Civil War it is also providing many of the other services of a modern state it picks up trash collects taxes at run centralized energy services it beautifies Street Gideon's and it enforces a legal code a hyper rigorous version of Sharia which seems to specialize in finding opportunities to employ the grisliest of limited punishments they'd like beheading crucifixion severing of hands from what I can tell for all its harshness Shahriyar can be thought of as originally as something of a rescue the Arabian Peninsula of Muhammad's time was a sea of tribal blood feuds nearly as chaotic the Syrian is now sherry on that context was the operating system civilization gods revealed law revealed through the words of the Quran and the example of Muhammad at his companions whereas tribalism then and nation states now are chaotic at hawk positivist messes in enforcing cherry otters an element is installing the code napoléon over the complex web of local law and unequal justice and simple energy for those who furnished area today democracy is as a political system that coughs off legislators absurd is morning that is idolatrous things that applies that God is logging would have had a human legislate but a monarch who sought to legislate to do anything but apply Sharia would be equally offensive this is not again that a state that seeks to coexist ultimately with other states expansion is in its very nature because these jihadist believe God's justice demands that this legal code enforced by outfit ultimately extended we earth to work and fight for this enforcement and extension is the way that human beings are meant to carry out their task in this world it is a mission that capitalizes on the genuine human mission as Christians understanding of reflecting and ascending God's rules God's kingdom over all creation in other words the call to ultimately enforce the hood of punishments and herald square fits into the spiritual receptors that humans have to form and fill to be God's bias jareds in the cosmos someone in the way that our retrovirus can come off the spot in your DNA you could almost be thought of as a Muslim version of one of the Christian tradition would be called the animus twist ilysm it's just that what this looks like did I ask turns actually quite a bit grisly ER than anything that carried amar ever imagined to clarify it's not as though it's a coincidence that France and Russia have been the targets of recent attacks or that the u.s. is threatened is recognizes that national governments are the decision-making centers of power its generals understand the concepts of Australians and they act in part using its logic and ideas but they don't act in agreement with those concepts nationalism indeed is one of the manifestations of Western decadence that by dottie seeks to overturn he is quoted in the second latest issue of to be going from the west to comprehend here at understand the meaning of terrorism which will tranquil the idol of nationalism and uncover its debate nature when I asked jointly bulldoze ass XP cut line there was something in that joy that went beyond the joy we went there are three felts in the West when the Berlin Wall fell it was not the divided the state was now reunited it was that one example of an illegitimate conflict national boundaries eliminate a key example we feel irritated at historically resident one to be sure but just one the point was money than the September 11th attacks because in layton called the u.s. in particular the Great Satan in its own way the spotted our vanity they hate us we like to say for our freedom that it was a particularly American kind of freedom that in mind they probably specifically hate the Connecticut compromise or Federals and the Bill of Rights or other things we learned about in civics class the image we had was of jihadis with the beef against James Madison it's possible to go the same direction with the attack on Paris they hate friends for its lace attack or they hit it as the birthplace of Charles motel but this would be so much was the point the point is not that one nation state attacked another is precisely that the caliphate just have to order the cities and let's call it the Cosmopolis the collection of cities that are the capitals of what was once Christendom in the view of these hardest corazon us surely these two things blow into each other Christianity is polytheism idolatry is it any wonder that the idolatry of prisoners should have in the course of history become the idolatry of the debauched studies of the modern West the idolatry of the Cosmopolis I asked to some have a particular problem with friends or with the French has a problem with the Franks there's symbolic and emotionally gratifying to say knew some people easy but it is just a matter of realism to say that we're all friends that anyway is one widget own story and it's a simple and satisfying one there is also as far as I could tell true itch but there are other things they're true as well and we can't allow ourselves to ignore these other things iris would not have existed at all the the jihadi Salafi movement would of course still exist if the US had not invaded Iraq there would have been no power vacuum to fill we knew we knew even in 2003 something about the ideology of jihadism and the idea that Saddam Hussein was harboring of that sort of terrorists made about as much sense as having been told that Castro's government was secretly nurturing and Nesta hardcore carlist aficionados of the traditional Latin Mass in its bosom it has to be said not by the way obviously should be blame or anything but as a caution regarding our last attempt to steer advanced in the region American military power furthermore if there was a student incredibly obvious home say this to say that is is a quote not about Islam is silly but it was not quite as absurd as safe as long as a monolithic pole is barbaric or has no alternative mode of expression than is what is is relationship to Islam considered as a whole as the short answer seems to be facebook status it's complicated this is what I've been trying in this project to figure out we could at least say a couple of things traditional Islamic jurisprudence such as that emerged during viniculture is meticulous about not targeting on confidence not carrying out the kind of wholesale and indiscriminate attacks that were absolutely characteristic al-qaeda then which are now to a slightly less degree protective is it is meticulous about not spilling us in blood it is also horrified Roman himself and horrified by suicide and suicide bombing just does count as suicide in a way that throwing oneself into battle against impossible odds does not suicide bombing alerts offensively not a kind of boys birth that is from what I can tell considered legitimate the most different server the Muslim jurisprudence through most of Muslim history and even within the rights of suicide bombing approving jihadis is is something else this is not your daddy's chica its willingness to engage in a massive purifying war against civilians in its own territory provides they had nothing so much as the actions of the French Republic and armies because the royalist counter revolutionaries in the fun day in its brutality and its enthusiasm for declaring other Muslims heretics and an extrusion of the activists / jihadi and pop lift and stretch / pathetic strength of Muslim political thought in his controversial wildly so even amongst al Qaeda supporting jihadi jihadi audio logs above mohamed el monte see who is our college teacher has condemned ions for shedding blood it has always been mainstream month Islamic doctrine to fight physically against external enemies which friends certainly is in defense of jihad and at least a principal to establish Caliphate and to expand its borders in offensive jihad so in one sense to be too nuanced about this about the attacks on Paris is to miss the point and the original just so story about is fighting as Islam against Christian is true but it's also true that I ask has a deep ideology which lead fortified as well against their fellow Muslims even their fellow cities and that it is unusually innards you carry out the program especially conquest all these things are true in other words to understand something like this what we must not do is to be to either or in our search for causality yes they talk to Paris isn't evil because of the original sin which we share with them yes those individual men attacked because surely a specific personal histories loves and hates and desires and ambitions which we will never know yes not for nothin I is attacked France because the French bombed the territory they claimed and yes the wahhabis attacked the West in a long game attempt to reverse the car back with the Ottoman Empire to place a bloody ! on their erasure of sex people and yes there is this tomb that this was Islam attacking christened him at least in the understanding of those who are doing the attacking and surely male human nature being wonderfully ontological available everywhere there are Muslim men to go the historical residents of this struggle speaks as surely as it speaks to all my male Chester Tony and friends all of you out there who secretly want to sail into battle of the head of a fleet of dong zhuo of Austria and if I know this crowd at all you know there are people here who recognized that in themselves though I also suspect it might be slightly worst kind of first things if she really spent and we have to be wiser more our own urge to see the solution to this as reenacting with huntin and so we push on not just through the fog of war not just through the fog of politics but through the fog of political theology everybody hear me the way back is that is that good so I'm a as we mentioned as Mark mentioned earlier I'm a fellow at Hudson Institute i specialized in deterrence deterrence theory I'm mostly concerned about nuclear weapons chemical weapons biological weapons and I have this horrible habit of writing about things that I just need to get off my chest now and again that are in the public discussion and I have done that on the subject of Syrian refugees which has led me to be here to talk about this with you and it does overlap quite a bit with what I went up with why I study mostly which is what Russia is doing in the Middle East and how that affects alliances mainly but but what I'd like to talk about today is the Syrian refugee problem what is going on in Syria and then ask a question does it require the United States to bring in these 10,000 Syrian refugees that President Obama once wants to do so more than 250,000 Syrians have lost their lives in four and a half years of evolved armed conflict and 11 million which is half of the entire Syrian population have been forced from their homes president Syrian President Assad his forces rebels and a variety of jihadist everyone thinks it's just Isis there that's not true al Qaeda is there as well but a variety of Islamist forces are all vying for power there now so the image of the little Syrian boy washed ashore is now deeply associated with the plight of Syrian refugees if you just Google Syrian refugees your computer is just going to show you a bunch of just horrible images of human suffering and mainly focusing on women and children and that it was on with this backdrop that President Obama announced that the United States would be allowing in 10,000 more Syrian refugees and many politicians waxed eloquently about our foundings immigrant heritage in an effort to win support for the influx of refugees I kept seeing this quote from George Washington in 1785 he said quote let the poor the needy and oppressed of the earth and those who want land resort to the fertile plans of our western country the late the second land of promise and their dwell in peace fulfilling the first and Great Commandment end quote this sort of became the argument it is American to bring in these Syrian refugees in and frankly it is unamerican to close our doors so emotions run high it makes it difficult to look at the matter of clear eyes but i think it is certainly worth a try and that's what I hope to do in just a short time if I can so so where are we now what is going on in Syria well pro-democracy protests erupted in March of 2011 in the southern city of Daraa after the government's arrest and torture of some teenagers who painted some revolutionary slogans on a school wall that was the initial spark security forces after those teenagers were tortured and killed at the hands of the stock government security forces opened fire on demonstrators who were protesting this killing several more took to the streets and you began to see a true what looked like a revolution happening in Syria the unrest triggered nationwide protests demanding president sods resignation the government's use of force to crush the descent were nearly hardened the protesters resolve and by 2 by July of 2011 hundreds of thousands were taking to the streets across the country opposition were supporters began to take up arms first defend themselves and later to actually expel Assad security forces from their towns this was a no kidding civil war that had broken out between what we called moderate forces we should talk about what we mean when we say that this is Syria these are not Democrats small D so even the moderate forces who we were talking about who were actually trying to a post-assad they they what they wanted was they wanted somebody less authoritarian than Assad and they want a democratic vote to some degree in Syria and these were the folks that were actually willing to some of them willing to work with American operators in order to overthrow Assad so I do think this port this point is really important because especially now with this political climate or we're listening two presidential candidates talk about what's going on in Syria and Assad has been completely wrongly painted as a strong man who was actually pretty not so bad he was like Saddam who was not so bad and he was like Qaddafi was not so bad Assad is horrible he is a dictator he is brutal he's willing to use chemical weapons on his own people which I'd like to get to now and oh by the way this Syrian uprising is indigenous it was Syrian this was not the United States trying to kick off the Syrian civil war it was not our meddling that caused this this was a Syrian opposition that came up to oppose their own leader now the media began pressing President Obama what are you going to do about it were you going to do about it he said we're like I do anything about it at this point and they said what might change your mind what might change your calculus and he said quote we have been very clear to the Assad regime but also to other players in the ground that a red line for us is if we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized that would change my calculus that would change the equation and quote that redline statement will come back to haunt our presidents one year later there is evidence that the Assad regime did use chemical weapons and then another misinformation narrative began making it across the united states that actually wasn't assad that used chemical weapons this was just this was the opposition forces had gotten ahold of them it wasn't Assad but President Obama's spy agencies went in there they actually had indisputable proof that it was the Syrian government quoting for a newspaper now unknown to Syrian officials US spy agencies recorded each step in the alleged chemical attack from the extensive preparations to the launching of rockets to the after-action assessments by Syrian officials those records and intercepts would become the core of the Obama administration's evidentiary case linking the Syrian government to what one official called an indiscriminate inconceivable horror the use of outlawed toxins to kill nearly 1500 civilians including at least 426 documented children and both prison Obama condemned it and then sought Congress's approval to authorize force to strike back against Assad the problem was as is often the problem with our president he had he thinks out loud and he began thinking out loud in front of the American people to the American people as to what this would look like what would American intervention in Syria looked like he didn't know he wasn't sure but we would do it and then he did we didn't really understand what war termination would look like politicians like to say it's not war its war if you're going to use military force I'm not saying it's all-out total war but it is war once you're using military force in the country and the president was willing to do this but was not able to give a clear a compelling case as to what that would look like and what the objectives were the military objectives were that the United States would be achieving and so no surprise he could not get the support from Congress to authorize the use of force so he was really in a bind but lo and behold he had a hero who came in and that hero was Vladimir Putin who proposed brokering a deal with the Syrian dictator that would remove of chemical weapons and prevent a military strike by the United States so here's another player Russia is Assad how do I want to call it patriarchy it isn't there a great defender Vladimir Putin supports Assad and so you know one of the things one of my mentors has told me Rebecca is that when you when you watch things happen in international affairs a lot of people get caught up in what's happening in this region or this region and it's a very limited understanding what you want to look at these alliances watch alliances Russia Syria Iran watched that space who would have thought so that chemical weapons came in and gets that finish that thought the chemical weapons were supposedly going to be removed from Syria the OPCW is the international organization that will remove chemical weapons so they they go into Syria here's something to know about the OPCW it is there at the invitation of the government there for the chemical weapons that was that was were actually removed from Syria where the chemical weapons that Assad showed the OPCW one can imagine that Assad did not show the OPCW where all the chemical weapons works when the OPCW declared we removed all the chemical weapons if you look at what they actually said they removed all the chemical weapons that were disclosed to the OPCW and so months later Assad used chemical weapons again we have seen since that the media for some reason I don't know why it doesn't really cover this a whole lot but you watched that was not the last time that red line was drawn and we saw all this about the chemical weapons ahead chemical weapons have been used multiple times since then from the Assad government there is even some reports me only in the media reports that not to my knowledge the government has not confirmed them that that Isis has actually gotten ahold of some chemical weapons that were thought to be left over from Assad or they could be chlorine chemical weapons that they've made themselves and so now we have Russia directly inter meeting militarily in Syria against the will of the United States who would have thought and when this happened this told me absolutely no bones about it Russia is now the name of the game Syria it is not the United States us when Russia began shooting cruise missiles from the sea into Syria it did so in over the airspace of Iraq supposed to be an ally of the United States we went in there we we we took out Saddam and we set up its nation government and here we are with the Iraqis either allowing or powerless even with the backing of the United States to prevent thus the Russians from shooting cruise missiles over its airspace and over the airspace of Iran Russia did that so much for the Iran deal soothing relations between the United States and Iran so although Russia now claims to be fighting Isis and al-qaeda or Isis and al-qaeda in Syria US officials say that about seventy percent of Russian airstrikes have targeted more moderate Syrian rebel groups including some supported by the United States a buds believed that more than 1,000 civilians have been killed remember this is just in about the last several months from Schwimmer Quinn Russia went into Syria more than a thousand civilians have been killed by Russian indiscriminate airstrikes and now general Breedlove he's the commit combat commander of European Command just testified before the Senate a few days ago has said that over 25,000 foreign fighters have traveled to Syria to enlist with Islamist terrorist forces including at least 4,500 Westerners so this is the environment in which we find ourselves a country war-torn in which is almost impossible at this point to identify a side were supporting to a significant degree so what about those immigrants looking for peace as you can imagine is quite difficult to really get a good hands on the loyalties of the refugees but there was one seemingly balanced survey that made headlines I'm a big skeptic of poles like poles are they can tell her the story that you want it to tell I thought this one was interesting because it was done by the Arab opinion index team and it conducted a poll to try to understand is simply the opinions of the Syrian refugees and also and also just Muslims across the Middle East and it conducted this poll and then it sort of hailed it as proved that the Syrian refugees were benign and we're harmless it said that quote only thirteen percent of Syrian refugees had a positive or somewhat positive view of Isis only thirteen percent doesn't sound so bad they're teens a pretty long number it also found which the media never picked up that ten percent an additional ten percent headache negative to some extent opinion of Isis not exactly a denouncement only negative to some extent so twenty three percent of refugees polled had either a positive somewhat positive or negative to some degree opinion of the Islamic state so if we allow 10,000 refugees in France serious some of them will certainly be children of course it's still twenty three percent have at least some sympathies or at least some understanding towards Isis but I hate to break it to the Human Rights rooms Isis nice i already talked about the only power player and so the study did not ask how many of the refugees had sympathies towards Assad what about al-qaeda you get the point these folks are not Democrats with a small D okay so but do they like the United States are they at least sympathetic to the United States or the West do they yearn for freedom like that Washington quote and pluralism bill free like the director of the refugee rights program for Human Rights Watch said quote overwhelmingly we are talking about people who are seeking protection and bear no ill will and i would say in fact their gratitude to anyone who's willing to help them end quote if that is true it is not backed by the facts and the evidence before us that same poll that i mention also asked Syrian refugees who they believe is that fall for creating Isis sixty-six percent said that Isis is a product of foreign actors and the overwhelming majority is opposed to the United States being involved in Syria or the region at all and given the conservative anti secular Western nature of many devout Muslims of modern day many Muslim communities do not assimilate well and instead form pockets and in some cases whole communities so it does seem as though there is substantial evidence at least that admitting refugees from Syria is simply taking on a risk that is just too great but what about this original question I posed about the lofty sentiments expressed by the founders that many like to quote worth the founding fathers pro-immigrant isn't it an American idea to be pro-immigrant I think the short answer is yes it is but the founders did not throw prudence to the wind when they held this position they understood better than anybody certainly better than we do today that countries were not merely countries due to Geographic borders although that is important countries were also held together by common Heritage's traditions political ends tutions mores and immigration here and definitely citizenship were weighty privileges and it did not come without conditions and so it was very important to the fenders that immigrants assimilated and abandoned previous loyalties to their governments although this was an interesting example in my research the founders were especially concerned at the time about non-english immigrants like the Germans the French and the Dutch gotta watch out for those Germans those Heinrich sins of Sally but they did not visit because though the Germans the French and the Dutch that did not share the same heritage or traditions with the English or even with each other notably these immigrants settled together in large groups preserving for some time their own cultures and habits and it did not mix well with the rest of the population Jefferson thoughts quote they should distribute themselves sparsely among the natives or quicker of automation unquote Washington agreed and thought that by settling in groups immigrants would quote retaining the language habits and principles good or bad which they bring with them whereas by an inter mixture with our people they or their descendants get assimilated to our customs measures and laws in order soon become one people unquote so in conclusion and I hope we'll have time for questions having a pro-immigrant posture is truly American I have one myself I get in trouble sometimes I speak in these group women's group silent and I'll talk about this issue and as soon as I start talking about immigration everybody thinks that I'm lost my mind because I'm so pro-immigrant because I'm still pro-immigrant but immigration to the United States is a privilege and so I believe there are conditions on immigration and we do not do a good job of assimilating people well who come to the United States it is a right it is not a right is a privilege and there is ample evidence to suggest the risk for accepting more Syrian refugees at this time is simply unwise and so I've told many of my humanitarian friends who are still concerned about the plight of Syrian refugees there are many of NGOs who are doing wonderful work taking care stuff youjizz overseas in camps and i highly recommend contributing to the work that they're doing Samaritan's Purse and the imb are both to that I commend to my friends thank you I am going to take a little bit of different tack on things I'm going to talk on some assuming Rebecca's more accustomed to researching actually Russia's role in the Middle East and particularly the intersection between the Russian Orthodox Church now its influence Vladimir Putin's foreign policy and how that is interactive historically from Czar stays up to today in a rather consistent line of Russian policy and interaction with the Middle East so what we're seeing now is not India unique the intersection of religion geopolitics tends not to get a lot of tension among Western foreign policy liter Washington and in Europe which tend to be overly secular and not extremely comfortable with religion I've heard somebody say once and I think they're right that is some the the idea of trying to interact with religion and take a cabinet as its shapes statecraft of countries around the world including of our own and people that believe in religion in among many in the State Department it's it's kind of like if you believe if you have a devout faith you're also the kind of person that believes in dancing intercourse the local comes on that's almost a sense you get sometimes it's so it's not something that really comfortable with which makes it difficult to get to to get a grasp on what's going on in the Middle East but the role of religion in this case and particularly Russia's age-old perception of itself as a defender of Christianity in the Middle East has been a key feature in Russia's response to events in Syria and in Iraq as well as in Russia's current tensions with Turkey the sense of rushes and responsibility for Christmas the Middle East is closely tied to the Russian sense of itself as the third Rome I don't know if any of you ever ever heard that term before and as the defender of traditional Christian values in general I'm sure you've seen Putin he's and many of the people around him with the Kremlin particularly general Alexander dugan have made a lot of stages to that fact and try to position themselves as defenders provisional Christian values and that connects with what they're doing the Middle East and then also the the close relationship between the Russian statement Russian Orthodox Church is a term for called sinfonia that came from the Byzantine Empire and Russia has adopted that and it kind of denotes the church and state pulling together like two horses pulling a carrot sort of going in the same direction harmoniously and that's the concept that they have Putin's moved to too close coordination with ruffle Russian Orthodox Church to sac relies the Russian national identity has been a key factor in shaping the increasingly authoritarian vent of Russian government under proven strengthening his public support which he's needed to appeal to this sacralized sense of national identity in order to strengthen public support when people first protested it coming back to the presidency after mid yetev then with the price of oil tanking and the impact of Western sanctions the economy going down the tubes he's really needed bolster that this is one of the key ways he's done that during the days of the Czar the Russian ruler was seen as God's chosen ruler of a Russian nation tasked with representing a unique set of values embodied by Russian orthodoxy and the Russians are was then referred to in rear as the Holy Orthodox Tsar today you see the same thing Putin is referred to in many circles in Russia not all that surprisingly given history as people actually use that term the holy orthodox star he's not as hard but he's fulfilling that role in many ways the church for its partner you may already know some of this acts as the Russian state soft power arm so Putin has tried to boost the in terms of Russian Orthodox Church around the world to that end that was one of the reasons behind the meeting recently between Francis and Kiril it wasn't just to feel good leading in an attempt to try to bridge a thousand-year-old divide within Christianity there's lon g of politics going on behind the scenes in Putin has a very real goals for that meeting the messianic an apocalyptic character of the Russian narrative about sub its role in the world today has been around as I've indicated a long time when Constantinople the capital of a weekend Byzantine Empire fell to Muslim armies in 1453 Russia began to see itself as the inheritor at that mantle so their view was that the first room had had fallen the second row Constantinople had followed the Muslims Moscow was left to pick up the pieces and be what they call third Rome so that's what that means Russia therefore perceived itself as inheriting all of the Byzantine the Christian Byzantine Empire stood for all the values all the dreams and the visions seen in such texts and this is interesting as the apocryphal apocalypse of Daniel I suspect that many of you hadn't heard of that but is a key factor in Russia self-perception this text predicted the coming of a future Constantine who would liberate Orthodox Orthodox Christian world from quote the sons and Hagar in other words Muslims during the Russo war and there were many of them between 1768 and 1774 Katherine great actually christened one of her grandsons Constantine in reference to the prophecy so my point is that this mindset has been around and has been defining this Russian sense of national mission for a long long time um Imperial Russia has claimed back then as today to be the patron of Orthodox christened on targeted mainly its major regional rival the time of the Ottoman Empire following the Ottoman defeat in the russo-turkish war that I just mentioned the treaty there's a treaty called cuckoo Tanaka which was a critical turning point in Russia's role in the Middle East and also in Russia's reach around the Black Sea region strategically it gave Russia access to the Black Sea gave it the Crimean Peninsula but it also was a turning point in Russia's relations with the Middle East and with the Ottoman Empire because Russia was granted by the Ottomans who lost the legal right to intervene within their citizens Affairs within the Ottoman Empire on behalf of krish's Russia took that and ran that as far as they could take it and intervene constantly with the goal of not just for pious purposes obviously but the goal to eat away at the power the Ottoman Empire and that was one of the factors that over time did eat away at the ottoman empire together with Russian approaches from the north so that are gradually week and Russia was one of the big predators at that time and use religion in order to justify that over the following decades we rush to use that increasingly to meddle in the Sultan's relations with his Orthodox subjects in particular undermining Ottoman sovereignty and producing a lot of friction between Russia and the Ottomans that resulted in several wars between the end of the Korean War which we'll get to in just a minute in the 19th century Orthodox believers in the Ottoman Empire were relatively happy that rajat Russia pledges to look after their interests similarly Imperial France whereas trying to look after inflamed protection over Catholics in the Ottoman Empire and patron a poor patronage efforts based on co-religionists tatis went both ways did the same thing with Russians they tried to stoke anger at bazaar in a moment of tatars and when the other Muslim people's of accra me around the Black Sea so they were both doing it to each other Russia just have to be better at it um as I mentioned there were there were major Wars let's go up to because our time is rather short let's go up to the Crimean War which was another major turning point Korean War pitted the Russians on the one hand against the British the French and the Ottomans that might seem to be kind of strange bedfellows in many ways it was the Brits the French the Ottomans against the Russians the Russians had hoped under Tsar Nicholas the first when he had first when he bent a crown prince he had gone in the 1820s in London made a grand tour of the other European capitals and he had tried to get everybody to side with Russia against the Ottomans Britain as I'm sure you're all aware they always have this view the thing with a balancing power in Europe they didn't want to see anyone get hegemony Genevieve over Europe and they were afraid Zara Russia could do that he was expanding so quickly at that time it's there for Britain as a balancing act sided with the Ottomans the French for their own reasons sided with the Ottoman so we moved the korean war started in 1853 that's one obvious example where geo politics and religion intertwined quite powerfully Russia for its part as I said believe that God had given it a mission to protect Orthodox Christian believers there's a really good book for anybody who wants to follow up on this there's a guy named up Orlando Vegas he's a professor of history at birkbeck college and received London he wrote a book I think about three years ago called Crimea the last crusade which defines well what the war was bad wasn't just about geopolitics it was also about religion and the book highlights well the Russians sense of Messianic destiny and it's important to us today I think for obvious reasons we see very powerfully today still so this isn't just abstract dusty history this article is the first is it there's no parallel between him and Putin I went to rehab he had been viewed when he did his tour of the European capital in 80 20s as an enlightened young liberal rule when it became the Tsar everyone was quite disappointed because he turned out the ending buck turned out feet out of crack he turned out to crack down on anybody that remotely threatened him hung a lot of people shot a lot of people and set himself at variance with the rest of European powers the Europeans were hoping in my liberalised Russian put on a Western path to enlightenment sounds kind of silly what we would hope we were hoping would happen with Russia the 1990s under Boris Yeltsin then came Putin and another parallel is that under Nicholas the first the Russian Empire expanded to aspirated geographical extent it was seemingly on the surface getting more and more powerful when actually the foundations of the power is being were being undermined at the time so that most of the most insightful geopolitical panelists the time noticed that both politically and economically the Russian Empire foundation for weekend which is kind of similar to what we see today with blond rakuten you see someone who's seemingly made russia mighty again is strong again bringing that russian private at the same time as laid the foundations for are serious problems in the future which are going to harm not only Russia as a state but also the rest of us that thrush implodes what we're all going to be in trouble so going back to the 1850s so the Russians lost during the war both sides try to stir up their co-religionists brethren in the other person's lands neither side did so extremely effectively one of the long-term effects of this war however is to reinforce the sense that we see in Russia today that is being ganged up on the sense that everyone's against it Russia was quite angered by the fact that two European Christian powers allied with Muslims against holy holy russian empire that really incensed them that sense of grievance has been with a long time throughout the rest of the 19th century Russia continued to meddle with use of Christians in the Ottoman Empire to continue to try to weaken it fast-forward the First World War and there's a gentleman at Baylor named Philip Jenkins is written another book about the Korean War and one of the things he talks about is how that pseudo Daniel apocalyptic apocryphal book guided Russian actions all the way to the end of the Czarist era and including being one of the motivating factors for Russia being involved in the person world war not against Germans that that was a motivation providing the Ottomans the most spectacular efforts to employ the geopolitics religion were made by the Ottoman Empire during the First World War in 1914 the Sheikh al-islam who oversaw the Empire's Religious Affairs issued five fought was translated into many languages merging Muslims in the British French and Russian empires to revolt some cases I'm an agent's distributed not only pan-islamic pamphlets but also rifles so they actually try to help them same time Russia try to stir up the Sultan's Christian minorities neither side was very successful but my point is that what we're seeing today is not at all knew what we're seeing is the linkage in the linkage of sectarian and secular interests is return of the classic geopolitics of religion in the Middle East that has been dominat for a long long time Christians living moving up to today and authoritarian Muslim regimes such as Syria had learned over time to deal with police station which they lived such as asad's and survived they weren't thriving necessarily but they were surviving the Arab Spring brought about a major change in that in that it brought about the collapse of these before chain regimes that have kept a little matrix of in brewing for centuries between various ethnic and religious groups thus making Christian groups and again this isn't to defend those regimes rekha said they were heinous it's just one of the side effects however was that it made Christian groups somewhat more vulnerable because of the chaos that followed HDD States the ancientness of ties between Russia and the Russian Orthodox Church and between the Orthodox believers in Syria are coming into play now today one is the close relationship between the patriarchate of Moscow led by patriotic hero and they patriarchate of Antioch which as you probably know it was one of the four ancient centers of Christianity we had the center at Alexandria Egypt Constantinople Rome and Antioch so today there's still a religious access you can call it which is also geopolitical access between Moscow Damascus that is more than just a wedge between assad improvements also the relationship between carroll and the russian orthodox church with the Orthodox believers in in Antioch and in Damascus you can see that numerous waves of an many visits back and forth there is something called the Imperial Orthodox Palestine Society which many of you probably haven't heard of they've been very active they're based in Russia they sent seven seventy tons of aid to Damascus in 2013 on also a check for 1.3 million dollars came from the Russian Orthodox Church Kiril has visited Aleppo and 2011 patriarch John the tenth of any off visited Moscow two years ago etc etc etc so in other words as close as durable ties between these two CS which you can see again parallel the geopolitical alignment there many Syrian and Iraqi Christians will thank for Russia's more muscular role in the Syrian conflict which you can understand particularly given the fact that Washington and Europe seems to have been relatively doubt to their flight we're going to fast-forward past some of us because we're running out of time supplies assistance up supplies instead has close relationships between the North attacks believers in true believers in general Russian Orthodox Church and Putin has played that up on one of the things Putin was done in playing up his role as the protector Christians in Syria and Iraq is to contrast acclaimed effectiveness of Russian actions in Syria with the inaction of the west to help Syrians this plays well into the Kremlin's narrative that Vladimir Putin and Russian general represents traditional Christian values over against Islamic radicalism as well as against it politically correct seculars that we've seen the West Moscow accuses us of course not without some justification of abdicating the values upon which Western civilization was based not that Putin represents those values the best is propaganda it's interesting if any of you read the RT russia today just for entertainment value is entertaining but it also gives us some insight into Russian mindset and one of the things that they have their writers who are very close to Kremlin have said one of them is there's a gentleman who criticized the United States says thinking of itself as God's own country while highlighting the hypocrisy of ignoring the plight of Middle Eastern Christians that can resonate with some of us as having a curl truth however again Putin is hardly an exemplar of Christian virtue in 2012 is to show how much Putin is try to play this aspect of things up he vowed in a public meeting the restaurant that church Putin did that the protection of persecuted Christians all over the world would be a key issue in his foreign policy the Russian Orthodox Church has strongly supported Kremlin's actions in Syria that's kind of given a bad I just like their support of his actions in Ukraine has because of all the rendus things have taken place in both those areas is Rebecca said there's been many civilian deaths on part because of russian bombing in Syria likewise in the Ukraine we all know by now a lot of bad things happen the Russian Orthodox Church has been giving black guy because of that so kuril is kind of had to play a balancing act between supporting his patron who and at the same time not being so close that the Russian Orthodox Church has such a black eye that you know people are disgusted with it so I will try to finish up here quickly because we're already i'm hurrying past what i should have let's move up to the meeting in havana and i'll try to finish up shortly after that as I mess when we started the meeting between Francis and Carol it looked purely on the surface and much the media treated it as such as an attempt to bridge a thousand-year-old chasm between Eastern Orthodoxy and the Latin Church aside from the fact that was not the first time that a pope had met with the Eastern Orthodox leader there was a lot more going on than that and I would argue that the main purpose behind a meeting was geopolitical so there is one of our T's many interesting journalists was a gentleman who admitted that the purpose of the meeting was not ecclesiology or theology was actually for third Rome moscow to meet with first Rome Rome itself to neutralize the effects of second room in this case constant noble slashes and turkey so a lot of what's going on with that meeting was Russia trying to neutralize turkeys effective action in Syria in the Middle East the Kremlin was hoping that Francis would put his stamp of approval on Russia's use of air power in Syria which Moscow has portrayed as primarily in the restaurant the lecture two specialties with a lot about this giving theological cover the Kremlin and calling it a just war engaging Francis's aboard Kiril and Putin's goal was not really to undercut Turkey but also the West more general of course because they were contrasting rushes supposedly effective actions with the West in action as I mentioned before but also to give Russia the moral high ground and the Russian Orthodox Church moral high ground which it had lost because of Ukraine it would also hope Putin also hope that such a joint statement that the two issued would put pressure on the west and collaborate with Russia in Syria and of course as we all know what a brushes cheap goals has been to get the United States in particular but all of Europe as well to collaborate with Russia on Russia's terms so that they could maintain their basement artists that they could maintain their geostrategic position in Syria and the meeting with the Pope was one way of doing that clinging the moral high ground trying to maneuver sin the position where we have to accept that given Russia's long-held sense of messianic national identity is only Russia and its long history of playing a role of defender oppressions in the Middle East and of using that rule as a bleep up for reaching its geostrategic goals we should not be surprised that Russia's reprising that goal today it would be good if the usf Western allies were taking these religious factors into account as they attempted to determine an effective course of action in Syria one that could counter both Russian geostrategic goals and also at the same time more effectively defend the rights of Christians under threaten in Syria and Iraq unfortunately we're not doing that slm page left and we're over time sewing at hand there the bottom line is we need to have a more effective response and this goes a bit too what's bachelor get to talk about as well when he talked about how in our foreign policy making lead anjaana know you serve the poor service so you can like this it's very hard to grasp the role in religion and spiritual values in geopolitics and we need to do better at that if we're going to get a handle both on how to fight Islamic radical Islam and Isis but also on how to how to counteract Russia because it's a very deeply invented part of Russia sense of national identity that informs their actions in that market role rebecca has to leave in five minutes if there's a Rebecca directed question let's do that now mark you have a reflective questions yes you're talking about let the components Syria and specifically chlorine which if I understand right is not considered a chemical weapons be this planet is that right yeah it's in pools it's a bull vodka yeah it does think that I say that because the way we think that that might be where they're actually getting it from as them as Isis kind of abstraction taking corrine these facilities and weaponizing other chemical so how is you like so they're going and getting the pools how it easy is it for them to weaponize it it's hard okay it's hard to do but there it appears as though they're doing it it looks like they've used chemical weapons against the Kurds and the Germans who are helping the curves there has been some casualties there from chemical weapons how effective visited military use it's not the most effective way to do it but it's a terror weapon and that's why you should that's why we think about them as strategic weapons rather than conventional you know weapons for the territory indiscriminate very painful and there were horrible ways to inflict pain and death on I'm a student here one of my areas of interest has been post-conflict stabilization and to be I understand I understand political world is not there but just academically to be Syria and Iraq what are perfect solutions for kind of what we did Walton tonight go in there separate the fighting and essentially try to keep the ethnic groups from clashing that might be a better solution than trying to absorb all of the refugees will be different values yeah if I could talk for another 20 minutes what I what I would say is I would give my recommendation okay so what what should the United States do in Syria one of the best things you know if Christians here in the United States are upset about the refugees like I said you can donate to NGOs who are doing great work and I'm not being flip about that i D like you truly are doing great work you can you can follow your resources there and that's a great way to do it if the United States government won the best man united's government into at this point is to help al Assad Assad Assad is the main source of the terror that's that's occurring in Syria it also tracks rush well here the problem that we're royal and now is that is that it would actually be a proxy war with Russia should we do that because Russia is actually enforcing some no-fly zones and some Syria so it's hard to comment on where we go from here because I do believe this administration has lost so many opportunities to do something that it's gotten that a hand if we had gotten in or if we had assisted in the opposition forces in the beginning we would not be where we are today and it's the same with the green movement in Iran your could have assisted that something wrong so um it but your first point i think is good at what i try to talk to people about is there's a difference between what we the protracted nation building that when tempted in the rock and stability operations that are always going to be required any time the United States intervenes we can't just go kill people break things and leave it's not effective and then we'll just end up there in a year or two or more we won't leave the place that are often it was so stability operations are going to be a part of it but but I will say that it would go a long way politically if those who are arguing in favor of this intervention to admit that we need to take lessons learned from Iraq and not make the same mistakes and overshoot the military and political objectives in the region any other questions sorry nobody yeah how will we live in a pluralistic society in which we believe that we need to protect all religions that would respect the religions of one another so as long as we're doing that you should protect the rights of atheists and Muslims and Christians living in the United States does anybody have different question yes with the ecumenical council coming up later this year I think do you think there's a there's a goat that Kira was going to trying to subordinate all of Orthodoxy using that as an opportunity of able to do it away from the patriarchal by the real unity ecumenical patriarch across all the veil you know they rushin already succeed in getting that meeting move from Istanbul probably cook us on neutral ground and they see Baikal avail as being to probe lesser 22 provera canned food to probe Turkish they've done all those things are making the nekom up for them at the same time to try not to alien because they don't want him to recognize a completely an attendant Ukrainian Orthodox Church and hundreds if not thousands of local parishes have been leaving the Moscow Patriarchate they have any created Orthodox churches but they you know pleasee illogically they are under the authority of Moscow and obviously Putin's actions in Ukraine alienated many Ukrainians and so they've been leaving and then going to the key on an orthopod weapon upchurch Kevin patriarchy and that however that patriarchy is not recognizes autocephalous are independent by about 12 male however he's been hitting that he wants to recognize it as such so Carol is kind of dancing a fine line between trying to neutralize Bartolomeo and because he you know he has to toe the line of the Turkish government to a certain degree and because he is broke Turkish and also they don't want to alienate it to such a degree that he's going to wreck and relax church because what in Ukraine is once that happens right now the Russian Orthodox Church is like sixty seventy percent of total Eastern Orthodox churches answer to cure that gives them an enormous outsized influence in Eastern Orthodoxy if Ukrainian Orthodox Church would leave the Moscow Patriarchate that would immediately demote Kiril to minority status with an orthodoxy and therefore obviously that would have big implications for Putin's use of the russian orthodox church as a soft that work for me well we've had some wonderful presentations and fortunate they're going to appear in video format of the institute of world politics website next week and told and the periscope video version should appear on the Providence website by tomorrow what you said josip so look for that and we hope that all of the presentations in text format will appear on the Providence website or our heart healthy version and the coming days weeks or a month so thank you good for attending if you'll have a copy of Providence or some extra copies out in the lobby so please grab one thank you
