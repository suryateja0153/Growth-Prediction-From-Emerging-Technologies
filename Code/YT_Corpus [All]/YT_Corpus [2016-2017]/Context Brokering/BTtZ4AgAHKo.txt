 good afternoon again I am Erica van rosmalen as Denise I'm introduced and I work with eqao the education quality and accountability office here and I've been asked to rain these folks in in our conversation and discussion today so we really have and I think it reflected much and what Krista talked about them earlier this morning that we have seen a real surge in those working in the area presenting in the area debating in the area writing papers and coming to conference presentations around research to practice networks and looking at the idea of how do we use evidence for in practice evidence informed policy knowledge mobilization in the hopes of better understanding and improving policy development and service provision within education so within hour 45 minutes that we have this afternoon our objective really is to share some of the experiences and some of the thinking around research to practice networks such as those who are being represented here i'm at the panel and how they are working towards advancing evidence-based and evidence informed policies programs and practices across the education sector and beyond the education sector knowing full well that it is not just within education that we have many of these networks but how we are working collaboratively across other sectors as well so we have quite a distinct group of panelists here today really coming from different places in their work within networks and we'll see how that plays through so i'm going to introduce them everyone just briefly you do have a little pink sheet of paper in your packages which really outlines who the panelists are so I'll just introduce them or two so to my left the other left thank you we have Katina Pollock who is a co-chair of Nair which is the knowledge Network for applied educational research and there is a collaborative partnership between the Ministry of Education the University of in the University of Western Ontario next the Catena we have dragna Marky Novick from the University of Windsor and she's representing the shore network which is the school board university research exchange which is a network of five faculties of Education and 16 school districts who make part of the magic information for student achievement professional network center next to come dragna we have Maria Kenton leaney Williams and she's actually representing a group of researchers from Nipissing university who were who took on the evaluation of a network and that's the faceless network which is the family and community engagement strategy and that is a pilot project that was initiated and implemented by the Learning Partnership which is an Early Learning Network involving families and communities for for young families and young children in Durham Sudbury and Cornwall next Maria we have amanda cooper and amanda has more recently founded the ripple network which is the research informing policy practice and leadership in education which is how is at Queen's University and Amanda's work really is focusing on the whole k to 12 spectrum and last but not least we have Michael Johnny from the University of York and he's representing research impact which is a pan-canadian network involving 12 universities from Victoria British Columbia all the way to st. John's Newfoundland so that's what we have with us today so I'm going to get us started so I want to thank you all for joining us and I'm going to get us started by asking you really to reflect on some of chris's messages from this morning was there something in particular that resonated with you something that there was a key message a concept and articulation that you walked away with and so I got to take that back that is something that's going to help me understand the successes and challenges within my network or something that I going to use to really move the network work that we do or that we are engaged with going forward so I'm going to open it up who's ever going to jump right in and we'll see where we go I'm happy to start off firstly thank you very much Erica thanks for the organizers for the opportunity I work as a broker at York University within the which is part of the larger research impact network I was really impressed and validated by what dr. Brown had to say about relationships and how important and central they are too effective networking because for me from from where I sit within the research impact network relation relationships are really the currency that drive the value for for what we do so it was very impressive when you talked about issues of trust even more specific nuanced things like accountability and the learning conversations I saw the relationship component being embedded great for being here to represent a team of researchers the faces project and John Howard is here from the Learning Partnership he was one of the coordinators of this network and as was mentioned by dr. Brown this morning there is a need for a local leader a champion and those coordinators in those centers were well respected were well-informed we're passionate about their work and that made for the success of the the network I would think that again as dr. Brown mentioned we need opinion formers opinion transformers i would add who do champion the cause and i would say again that dr. Brown's point resonated and was certainly reflected in the network that we looked at okay I was really inspired by his doc for sure I found many connections with what we are doing here in Ontario he was talking about move from professional learning community is to research communities which was really something that we are trying to do as sure network and also me personally working with local school boards what I would like to problematize because we bring we were asked to ago I had a little bit of debate he was talking about he was using metaphor of driving and he was saying if you want to move from a state of nervous to the state of expert you go you go that naturally so that's the idea that you start by being very conscious about what you're doing so you have prescribed steps in what you're doing as a researcher maybe or as a teacher and then by learning more and by gaining more practice you move towards something that is more intuitive and then you become an expert and I was I wanted to problematize that because I consider myself as an expert researcher but I don't feel like when I start the project like when I'm driving somewhere at least not driving our roads usual roads for me research is problem solving it is about also developing that open mindset developing positive attitude being able to to stand critique of course working with with others which is the idea so I was just thinking because my my goal is to to work with teachers as researchers and that's what we are trying to do in vincer and ensure as well so i'm thinking that being an expert is more a process dennis date you don't stay there as an expert but every new challenges you challenge is something that is that where you have to start from from the beginning maybe or from somewhere so that's what i was going to put this to the panel respond to that okay hi everybody just to give you a little context about the knowledge Network I also wanted to point out that it's a systems it's an entire system network at least that's what we're hoping and we're trying to build it's a systems Network so in thinking about that in thinking about being the expert and the driving and we're constantly learning I would say as the mayor research team there are three of us myself and Carol and I would say the ministry is the other research partner in this we we have come to places where we are constantly learning and we think we have things figured out and a new element comes in and that comes from being reflective in our practices and I think that that is a is also what continues to create a network that moves forward and when I mean moving forward that depends on what the goal of the network is whether it's to expand whether it has particular goals and going forward or multiple goals i should say but i also wanted to talk about thinking about dr. Brown's presentation this morning it definitely relationships resonated with me but also thinking about some of the smaller more pragmatic elements of how do we work with practitioners and end users or educators and that can be quite broad because our network is not necessarily narrowly bounded so we're not necessarily looking at a school or a group of schools and what's happening in that school we're talking about networks that cross boundaries where the relationships our relationships are important but the binding of these relationships is not based on a educators in a particular school or educators in a particular school board we're thinking about relationships and networks that cross different sectors different stakeholders and that increases the complexity of our network and and those are the things that we try to work through I find that interesting the other part of that because you spoke to the idea of the systems not just the system so it's not just an education system but there are that multiple systems and how that link works together in terms of building those trusts trusting relationships across systems as well as within the education sector and I just wanted to jump in there and so first the caveat is my network which is ripple actually studies brokers when brokering and the process of networks and it does that across research producers research users as well as the brokers that mediate those interactions so I take it from a little bit i'm interested in how they measure their impact what does interactions with different stakeholders look like and all of this was driven from my experiences in a high school classroom as a teacher when I started realizing that there were different students that I wasn't serving well I didn't think and this specific example has to do with relation to autism and as a teacher I went and reached out to research to evidence-based strategies to make my classroom better to make the lives of that those students better and my my experiences as a teacher better so that's where my passion for knowledge mobilization and brokering came from it wasn't from a top-down system level it was from looking at knowledge mobilization and brokering as a way to go out in a systematic way and solve a particular problem of practice and I think when we talk about end-users and talk about teachers and talking about use on the front lines it has to be driven from there and I think that's a really critical element and as I look across networks the ones that embed users in real in tangible ways in and not in a damn meeting where you report to them you report back but in tangible ways that actually shape the network that's where you see impact happening also I'm and I'd like to you brought a really good point and that is around the problem i think i'm also a practitioner as a teacher in middle school and so you know we want the best for our our students and so often we are looking at strategies and thinking about oh I should apply that but we're not really clear about what the problem is and it takes a little bit of practice to pull back from going right into the strategy mode rather than sitting back and saying what really is going on here and what is the problem because if we haven't really figured out what the problem is the strategies we apply are not going to have the Intendant outcomes that we want and so I think that's one of the things when we're thinking about creating networks funding networks of thinking about okay so we might have to have a product we might have to have it and then go I think sometimes we need to pause and think about maybe we need to really sit around for a while and think about what what is the real problem that we're trying to address here and maybe it's the weekend with dress the exact problem but there are pieces of it that we can deal with in the capacity that we have and then moving forward we build from there I'm gonna jump in on that because that leads into where we wanted to go further but in terms of two questions really but the first is the impetus for and you started to talk about the development of your networks or the work that you're doing within networks and the impacts that you've realized or you hope to realize but particularly around and go back to to Chris this morning but in terms of bringing the research use to life and so you've started to talk about that but if you could dig a bit deeper and how are you actually going to measure or see the impact of bringing that research use to life based on the structure if you will or the impetus for the development of your network so I'll start off I mean our networks 10 years old and I really believe it took us 10 years to become an overnight success I mean I swear to God I wouldn't go outside my office for the first three months when I started working for fear someone would ask me what I do but the purposefulness of networks is something that always needs people need to be mindful of the value proposition I mean I'm sure all of us are either involved with or liaised with a network and we do it purposely with the assumption and the belief that there is going to be value from that our network we come together regularly and that does not mean often but we come together to redefine the value proposition for ourselves and people we work with I mean that notion of impact we could almost ask ourselves that every year because the our first year when it was just York and the University Victoria it's like oh I hope we can live past the first three years of our grant vs 10 years now or it's like we've got 12 universities it would be great to be able to double that within a couple years and have our network start to liaised with high-profile organizations that want to link with researchers and that could be folks like the canadian mortgage Housing Corporation or the Economic Development Association of Canada that are approaching us now how can we connect with researchers and even within Ontario there have been ministries that say we want to connect with universities in Ontario can you help enable that so it is this constant inward and outward focus yeah dragon so our network certain-sure network as its name says it's a collaboration between universities and school boards and how we started is we understood and research is telling us as well that there is a conception that these two organizations are different in a way and separated and that one may be more consumer of knowledge and the other may be more creator of knowledge so we started our our network in 2008 as as a way of starting that communication between these two different organizations or parts of education system I also like to to look at the education as the system understanding of their elementary schools and their secondary schools and universities and so on but I really believe that all of us are educators what keeps us together is that love for education and believe that we could help students so ultimately students are what connects sure and we we meet regular early at least four times a year we communicate frequently we have we organized writing retreats we organize events we communicate between each other and I think we are starting better to understand the nature of each of our organizations and by doing so we are able to do more in our own areas of of influence the other piece I want to add and build in on that is that whole notion though when we look at networks are we always looking at the development of our networks to ensure some sustainability of those networks but I also think there's a space in the conversation around networks that we establish for a particular reason and they may be short term networks but can have equal impact without having to think about constantly ways that we're going to continue that sustainability that not all networks need to be sustainable I add as dragon I was mentioning the sure network does definitely unite the separate worlds which are merged of universities and school boards the faces network was trying to unify the world of school with the world of the community and the community partners who are all involved in working with young children and it was really interesting to watch the network's form in each community the networks were very organic they developed in a different format they had similar partners but they operated in different formats with different processes they did have the compelling purpose of again having the focus on the child and as we often talk about it takes a village to raise a child at the end of this whole process of watching the network's work together we realize that actually it took a child to raise a village and because everyone was focused on what's best for young children they formed these networks that were very powerful they did sustain themselves sometimes they actually became normalized into their fabric of their operation so that they didn't become an add-on but it just enhanced and extended for example they have the you know the welcome to kindergarten program that the Learning Partnership has across Canada and now because of the faces network in the faces approach of bringing families and community partners together rather than just the teacher with the kindergarten children it has become practice to have some of the activities happen off-site so that it's not always parents coming to the school sometimes the teachers go to the library and that's where they have the activities they've also had early childhood educators be the ones that Co deliver these sessions so I think what you're saying is that sometimes sustainability means that actually it's a new norm exactly it's not one thing to add I've been thinking a lot about research impact both from an environmental scan looking at thousands of indicators across public service systems recently but then what those actually tangibly look like when they're being rolled out when they're being selected by the organization that's being studied as well how what did they think what are they interested in knowing and one of the things that we need more data of course across this but one of the trends I'm noticing across looking across many different organizations across Canada and many different networks across Canada is that the thing even on a very very small budget people seem to be able to have quite a large impact when the element that they're funding with that money is people to go and do that networking so when the dedicated role is just relationship building there seems to be greater impact so the joke is you know if a if a two-million-dollar research report falls in the forest and nobody reads it you know does it make us and no it doesn't right so if you it doesn't matter you have the Commission high quality research but the real what I'm noticing across empirically is that where there's that dedicated staff to just go out and do that networking and build those relationships that's where you seem to get the biggest bang for your for your buck continued did you wanna add in and then yeah well that makes sense because it's about relationships right but I just I was just reading this last night and it's a it's an article from all versa retinas last sentences lastly more research is needed and simple but effective means to evaluate performance thank you that's it it says the building okay I'm going to build on even further now then and based on we had our poll question as well but what do you see as the role of the current players if you will and however you may define those players within these research practice networks what is that role d what do you see the role in terms of creating the conditions for self-sustaining and self improving school systems so switching the rule from looking at the sustaining of the network versus the output and how do we help school systems become self-sustaining and self-improving I'll start firstly I thought what amanda was talking about thinking about research impact for such a long time I thought she was thinking about us I mean I just I just have sure I have to come clean with that our our network focuses on a broad array of subjects education being one of them so the the interesting point to your comment there for me eric is the notion of systems I think networks that are effective in their meaningful engagement not token participation and their ability to look upstream and downstream to see how the nature of their work can affect and inform people tend to do a really good job and I mean to to that point I think school based networks do a really good job we've had experience working with the York Region District School Board in the past and they've come up to pretty much everything we've done to the point where I'm like what why are you here and they're like well no this is important because as an edge co-educational organization we're also involved in community development so but there they are very aware of their role within a system and I mean to me that's the the word that's the most critical well and that becomes then when you see why were you here to them the network has become habit-forming it is what who and what they are and what they do as opposed to I belong to a network it is the way that I operate if there's anybody from the York Region District School that was always my indoor voice I just boarded that out now but well I just wanted to ask because what we're trying to do around knowledge mobilization and around each of these networks is actually incredibly challenging and I just like to do some audience participation at least one point so this is the moment I'm going to grab how many people just by show of hands know that daily physical activity is good for your health that there's research evidence to show that okay so if you know that put up your hand okay so now how many of you actually do it you don't have to raise your hand for that part um the idea here is we've got a large body of evidence that most people have consensus on most people would agree with that you could probably strap on your shoes and go for a run you know there's not a lot of barriers to money to being able to go and do that and the idea around habit or changing practice to align with evidence and this is a this is a pretty everyone agrees with this evidence let alone some of the contentious issues in education where there's not agreement on the evidence so across systems at a system level what we're trying to do to transform practice is really really challenging doesn't and so I think we need to also keep that in mind when we're talking about impact because if you even think about how you apply evidence that you know in your own practice personally so how difficult is what we're trying to do it's pretty difficult next year treadmills at the back of the rack or the front of the room yeah and dragons gonna add in on this mm-hmm as amanda was saying I think we it's it's a changing of a game that we are we are witnessing right now the way how we do things as educators as researchers is changing and networking is probably in some of the answers that we have right now I like today's speech about research networks and I think that's where we are going understanding that only together and exchanging information and and gaining knowledge together is what counts I like the idea of network as learning with each other learning from each other and learning or behalf of each other meaning that diversity in inside the network is important because that allows that of that exchange of of understanding and then of course we have to have some sort of common goal or separate goals which on which we are working and then we all of us become brokers of knowledge so whoever is the member of network they go and they create their own sub subnet networks and then they propagate that knowledge and I think that's the idea of how we work today's these are changing that definition as well interesting great I would say also there's really a need for tolerance for ambiguity as much as we all like to know what we're doing next in my experiences with the faces network but also with the sure network we had to continually reinvent ourselves and continually adjust and reflect and change your processes and decide how we're going to operate differently but turnover that happens in in any network the fact that almost every Network has other networks that are competing with the same kind of focus or initiative and also the fact that many times when we're involved in a network it's not our full-time job it's on top of other things that we do and that's what we heard in the evaluation was that there it became part of the their operations later it and as dr. Brown mentioned this morning you need to have control in the first year with a lot of support and a lot of resources but as time goes on the network changes itself and you need to give the network the opportunity to reinvent itself and become maybe a new a new kind of network but Google well I'm also thinking you know we need to also think about what do we mean by a network and how our networks different from service contracts or research contracts or partnerships and I think you know we've had to really sit down and think about you know what does this mean what is the network and whatever time to get here when is something uh network I mean something not a network and I think for me and for my colleagues the sit around the near table we really believe that an a network has a particular goal but I mean partnerships can have particular goal but it's when those parts come together and they're more than the whole so that there's some kind of synergy that people are bringing expertise that from individual stakeholders or groups coming together to move forward now obviously our our networks have some specific parameters like in the past we've had it so that there are researchers connected to our our networks that we have multiple stakeholders we say educator so that could be true early childhood educators could be teachers could be principles could be psychologists speech pathologists whoever touches education can be a part of this but we have some specific expectations around in what we expect a network to look like and that has been a challenge just trying to formalize well what do we mean by network when we're putting it out there here we want you to create a network well we want to be more than something where somebody goes around and gets other groups to sign a letter to say yeah we think it's a great idea we wrote champion and that's it they don't we don't see them anymore but there's actual engagement and sincere engagement and that there is that there is some kind of structure around decision-making and that there are some formal structures such as you know formal ways that the network's communicate amongst their participants and their members but also then how they share I mean there are informal networks and their formal networks and even with informal networks there are informal Proctor we all know that and sometimes it's the informal practices that might get us a little further along well I build on that though it is part of the what you're talking about though is networks being more than a structure mm-hmm that networks are a way of behaving and it's more than a partnership as well in realizing and appreciating and tapping into that behavior not just something that I attend to and I was struck also when you mentioned about you know we have day jobs as well but if it becomes a behavior it should infuse within that day job that's why it's so critical to embed these infrastructure like beyond networks things have to be embedded in infrastructure across systems and levels in a way that regardless of the problem that you know this year it's math we're focusing on regardless of what problem arises that infrastructure in order to be go out and reach to researchers and work with people is the same although the problems are different and yes that's going to mean different people at the table for different issues but building that infrastructure and building these into at the organizational level is absolutely critical both in schools in ministries in universities and I think there's an appetite and the will to do some of that work but it's hard work and it takes time and it takes trust and you have to work with someone over a number of years before you're really comfortable risk-taking with them and so I think that the building it into the organizational structure is absolutely critical I'd say structure and culture and culture right now and I think a part of that is thinking when we think my structure sometimes you know some people default around things like memorandums of understanding those kinds of things that are structure but I also think of structure as in people and relationships and we need to build trusting relationships sometimes it's key people who are in organizations that help to move networks along but we've also come to realize too that when I say we are meaning that the near team because we spent a lot of time promo tising these things um thinking about just not key people but you might want to call them a cluster or a group of people because we have found in the past and our experiences is that if we have solely relied on key informants if they leave because people do cycle in and out you know they change roles change positions retire various kinds of things sometimes momentum is lost because there's been an over-reliance on perhaps a key person and then we have to think about well how do we sustain people's motivation and part of that is having it as a habit as a part of you know a way of working and way a part of the culture but other parts of it is also incentivizing for people at different levels and you know we have to think well what does incentive us say what does that look like four different people you know so in thinking as a researcher that might be well somebody gets to publish about it you know researcher kissed actually published something from this it might be that for teachers it might be released home and we were having a conversation informal conversation about you know we say oh you know release time that's an easy kind of thing to do but it's so expensive so then we're draining on other kinds of resources but this is one of the things that we are thinking about you know how do you motivate and incentivize to continue with that enthusiasm when people get together cuz you know what it is a long difficult difficult road to be on at times because it's about working with different institutions that have might have different deadlines might have different decision making processes and strategies and you're also dealing with organizations that have different kinds of culture and bringing people together and working as a group requires particular kinds of skills for us our first few years it was just York University in the University of Victoria and it was great because you can kind of sit across the room like you might with your partner and just say what do you think about this she goes out that's great let's do that and off we go but now our network has has 11 partners and that completely has changed the dynamic for us and I know context in networks is completely different but what we've come to realize and this was something shared by the former CEO of the unite did way York Region it's really resonated for me within our network work is go slow in order to go far and the takeaway is process matters and I'm either have been times where I might have been doing this for 10 years I think I mean I I think I know what I know and off I go and I very nicely get reined in by colleagues it's like well that's great Michael but we haven't been doing this for 10 years and it's shared ownership we need to be able to talk about it and understand it and then we can move on together I mean the last thing for me the last real takeaway is communicate the heck out of successes honest-to-goodness do not be ashamed to wave your successes up the flagpole because it's not just yourself it's the folks you're working with them the folks you're working for almost like a prism one that the light is Sean in it kind of reflects out in all kinds of different directions that's important in it and I mean for me it took me a while to change my thinking about that coming from a modest place where it's like no we're doing something important we think we're doing something good let's talk about that dragnet Lemuria it's far for sure network it was certainly very important to have constant support from Mesa and also from Ministry of Education and it's not only because these funds were you we could use the funds to meet and to organize some events maybe but it is also recognition of our existence and of our importance and I think that is something that also may sustain some community be network or partnership and that's external recognition that you exist and therefore you may be important so that's one thing and of course we were looking for external grant we were supported by shirk we were supported by Clare and so on so we are always trying to to add but that constant support is I think very important when we talk about sustainability I think what government is doing for network he's very important Thank You Maria and we're going to have a guest was going to just mention the fact that we're looking at research to practice networks but I would also like to propose that we have practice to research networks and that it goes back and forth because certainly in my experiences with both sure and faces the networks were formed because of good practice and good practice was maybe in pockets and what the we did then was expanded and normalize it into a broader community and then conducted research to again validate and collect evidence and just a guess going back to the point of the release type that's so expensive in listening to dr. Brown speak today we have often conducted research with our partners in education I also was a teacher and still am a teacher and feel that certainly teacher as researchers an important concept to always have to give release time seems very expensive as Katina mentioned if we could change the paradigm a little bit and planning time became planning / research time we would have time to be able to engage teachers in teacher research so some of what I think that works do or communities do is again develop and enhance and extend what's already happening thank you invalidate duped me on my last question that's quite right it's the way that but my question is actually to the broader audience as well as to the panel and it's that very thing we talked frequently about research to practice networks but what about the practice to research networks and we have a panel of academic researchers here we heard from Chris this morning how would our conversation what would be the pieces that come forward because I know a number of you in the audience as well belong to different network some of you do belong to broader based community networks that have really percolated from the ground up and have reached out to academic some of you have actually maintained those networks as large scale any network so what would be the issues that would percolate how would the conversation be different if on this panel we had practitioners and or policymakers reflecting on the value the successes and the challenges of networks and the role that they play going forward so I do we have time we can open it up for a couple of reflections from the audience or from the panel is one comment about sharing successes or sharing I think it's really important we were in a meeting the other day talking about going to scale on a housing first the housing first initiative that's rolling out across Canada the idea that if we give someone a house before we actually make them meet all these benchmarks of sobriety all these different things to be deserve a house and that's a that's rolling out kind of across Canada and we were actually talking about as they try to go to scale there's it's actually really critical yes share successes but it's even more critical to have safe spaces to share what really didn't work what really went badly because some of those lessons when you're trying to roll out large initiatives are actually more instructive for the people that are then having to roll it out in their context I just want to okay but now back to my real question so you get to stardom and woven practice to research what would it look like I'll give Amanda a moment I mean I they I think the values would be the same if this if these were policy professionals or if these were practitioners I am convinced that the values that they would share around their network experience and why networks matter to them would probably be the same I think they're universal but I think their pain points the areas in which they get stuck the frustrations or or or the opportunities are highly contextual there I think you'd see some significant differences around whether it's around resourcing or capacity or or or what have you so there could be some differences there but I may be a little more similar than we realize yeah I guess I would question that any one of us is either or either a practitioner or researcher or a policymaker sort of seems like research plus policy plus practice includes and in does result in policy and many of us walked different fields and so I think that understanding is what we need to proclaim and need to celebrate and I found to that in working with teachers they really have lots of wonderful thoughts about what works and if we could just help them named it for Oakland proclaim it frame it it really does then become policy and become embedded in our practice so it's kind of cyclical ok and I'm going to wrap it up here one final note because I think we talked frequently about practitioners and we almost equate them with teachers and I think we also have a lot of researchers who are practitioners within communities within schools that we need to reflect on as well I want to thank you all and thank you for the audience everyone's going to be around for the course of the conference so if you want to hear more but also know that they have and then we're going to a question omit that that they have their space out in the research exhibit as well where you can connect with them as well and we've got one question from the audience and then we're close her down well perd I don't have a question it just the observation and just a feedback and mix over that I'm the first time here and I was really fascinated listening to you and I compared everything what you said with things I heard in Vienna or in Berlin or in Heidelberg or in Zurich and I just transformed it to in my background environment and I've felt that is completely the same you have the same topics the same dynamics and what I found out because I work a lot with networks and create networks am i'm part of networks and I love networks and at the same time the networks are sometimes are really a pain and absolutely and the question is how we can create a quality of interaction which is really something which is a difference which makes difference and this is it may ask an impact not only at the end of a research but in the moment if someone is there to present something which is remarkable this is a value if there's a communication which is different from what you have in everyday life it's a remarkable the quality of interaction the quality of communication is really a crucial point in my experience and I felt that is nearly the same and I want to thank you too can to listen to you and and to feel very close to your experience as a stranger in the field here thank you thank you
