 okay I'm just yeah I'll leave hours on mute until you introduce some tree Sikorsky thank you ok so I think we will have some more people in US but I'll get started first I'd like to say hello and welcome to those who are here so far for our webinar on philanthropy and roll Nova Scotia that's being hosted all right the rural communities foundation of Nova Scotia dalhousie faculty of agriculture and the rural policy learning commons my name is Maggie McMichael and I will be moderating today's webinar and we're going to have a really interesting webinar there's a good selection of panelists including researchers and I guess we would say some practitioner people who are doing work with philanthropy on the ground here in Nova Scotia so for those who are tuning in your microphone will be muted but at any time if you have a comment or question you can click on the chat button at the bottom of your screen and type that in and there will be hopefully lots of time at the end to have a discussion and we'll get to those bin um so just a overview of what the flow of things will be today first we'll have chris mcneil introducing the rural communities foundation of nova scotia and what that organization is and what they do and then we'll have two presentations looking at research on real philanthropy and community foundations first by Kathleen Kevin Annie and then Ryan Gibson and then finally Arthur bulb will be presenting the rural community foundation's new fund development strategy and then as i mentioned at the end we'll have time for a question and answer so I'll be mostly sitting back but i will be doing introductions of our panelists as we move through so first to introduce Teresa Teresa MacNeil lives in johnstown Richmond County and Cape Breton she's retired professor of adult education from Santa vexed University she joined the board of rural communities foundation ten years ago and has been active on the granting and fun development committees she currently serves as board chair so I'm going to stop sharing my screen at Teresa and you can start trimming yours shall I go ahead can you you're next yep thanks Meg well our role here this afternoon as you said is to tell you a little bit about rural community foundation of Nova Scotia we want you to ask questions about it too if you would because we want you to think about our organization and as we tell you more this afternoon especially when Arthur is speaking we're very very concerned about the whole philanthropy idea and will tell you a little bit what what we're doing and you might give us a few ideas about what's good or bad about about what we're trying to achieve our foundation was formed about actually in 2001 and it was done it's through a partnership between literacy Nova Scotia and the coastal communities not work of Nova Scotia these two organizations took some money approximately 350 thousand dollars that was left over from the tags I fond if those of us who live in this part of the country know that that was the Atlantic ground fish strategy and and it was coming to an end in 1999 and there was some money left over through the province and I guess it was through the bombs and it was a federal program DFO program and a hundred and fifty thousand of that was put into an endowment fund and out of that endowment fund which still exists we have been taking the earnings and you can imagine that these today's earnings are pretty slim one hundred fifty thousand dollars and using the money to grant to projects in local communities in rural communities of Nova Scotia for projects that would create some development in their communities and we now do they yes sorry enough did you have a PowerPoint no I do not not okay that's fine just tell Ron I'm glad not to have one actually yeah don't wanna know I'll just take about four or five four minutes more or so yeah no glory no but anyway the focus is it used to be on on anything that sounded good in the beginning whether nutrition or affordable housing and so on but after why we threw a lot of consultation we ended up with a focus that we are maintaining on local leadership development at any project that would be having in it an emphasis on developing local leadership is we give a priority to it we have some pretty excellent experience with grant making we've honed it fairly carefully way I've got some pretty good criteria we always have far more applications and we're excellent applications and we're able to fund we only fund to the extent of fifteen thousand dollars a year and a maximum of five thousand dollars per project so it's not it's not a great show is a more reason why we should retail telling you that philanthropy because we are going now in to try to raise money but always always always for us the emphasis is on having making a contribution to a community so it can develop in the rural areas all told since the beginning we've had 38 projects funded dealing with many make many local concerns and among them are the immigration the out-migration of youth the increasing population of seniors and the absence of employment opportunities in rural communities being 14 years old now as an organization we are where the older of two community foundations in Nova Scotia the other one is called the Community Foundation of Nova Scotia and where we're not at all the same and we we speak to each other and we even considered at one time by coming together but we've decided we have quite different functions and so we didn't go ahead with that we've just along the way we've had some projects because of money given to us through the problems of scotia one relating to innovative innovation in rural communities very successful two-year program and we were seen by the province as being competent in in granting and so we're able to have did I say 200 that I don't think I said how much was five hundred thousand dollars for two years and we gave virtually all of it out to projects some of them the maximum being $50,000 love to tell you about that but I'm not going to because this is not what we're about this afternoon we're about getting at rural philanthropy and as you will later hear from Arthur bull it is of critical importance for us to work in concert with other organizations whose interests is in the advancement and indeed in their survival of rural in Nova Scotia so to help make this happen we convened a group of about 15 individuals this it's this past spring to see if perhaps we could come together and and and say well what do we believe as rural people about this survival of rural Nova Scotia and we have a first draft of what we're calling the rural declaration and we're going to work on a process of refining that declaration but as a foundation we are not responsible for bringing all of the olive lova Scotia together around rural we are responsible for granting money and and therefore i'm coming back to the point of the need for rural charlotte philanthropy okay Maggie you hi sorry hello I think I know is it yeah we can hear you now okay so I'm just going to quickly introduce a Kathleen she's a professor agile houses Faculty of Agriculture and her research focuses on the intersections between agriculture food and well-being at both the community in individual levels she currently serves as director of what is currently in flux but the real research center of the Dalhousie faculty of agriculture so I'll stop sharing Kathleen so you can put up your PowerPoint great great well thank you for the opportunity to share some thoughts on a virile for it philanthropy particularly on how we're nurturing community through the work we all do in disparate ways some in raising funds some and raising awareness and raising friends so looking at all tourism as really the foundational piece in the literature it speaks about three elements about the importance of engaging people in community building giving to community in a variety of ways and volunteering in community and altruism has been the foundation for both the theories around charitable giving and Phil entropic giving and I'm going to speak to that in a moment but I think some of the elements that we can also lead from the literature on Philanthropy are the various forms of capital building and in fact almost in all the books I examined and many of the articles the terms philanthropy is not used and none of these books is it mentioned but other terms are like this formation of a human capital social capital cultural capital built capital and political capital and of course we could speak at length about any of these and how they relate to volunteering giving and engaging in community which are of course are part and parcel of what we're talking about for philanthropy interestingly also in the research that given to foundations is not an area that's extensively studied and that much more needs to be understood about factors that are involved in or in mediating the giving of wealth to improve community there are many families that are going through transitions in wealth from generation to generation and over the next 10 15 20 years we're going to see extensive bodies of funds potential pools transferred and land is certainly one of those considerations as well as other forms of legacy from family but it's an area that's under examined in terms of the research so for something to be considered altruistic or all tourism has five dimensions this is from 85 86 so I'm sure we've updated them in many ways and Ryan probably has more to speak to on some of these elements as well but five elements that are described or that it needs to be a benefit to others that it must be voluntary it must be intentional and that giving in fact is the goal itself and it's performed without a required reward and I think this last one probably many of us would update that many people now give with the expectation of the very least attacks received a charitable donation receipt I'm so at the very least I think five is likely tempered but it's possible that others also people on the webinar might have thoughts on that charitable giving has to do quite distinctly in the literature and in practice from philanthropic giving charitable giving often involves engaging with compassion and empathy check it around like more current critical issues looking at issues of disadvantage those in need unless some prosperous pockets of communities for example are often honed into around charitable giving and in many cases it has a strong religious foundation has an orientation towards the immediate time well-being of individuals and families like health concerns many of the organizations in Canadian society certainly were built by religious organizations like schools churches and hospitals with the intention that there was a strong charitable element to that work somewhat contrasting although very similar in some ways as well as philanthropic giving that involves giving to bed or humankind for more than the short term but having a longer-term orientation to it and it largely comes out of more secular foundations and it really reaches back to working in the development of democratic societies what did forming democratic societies require it required individuals also to own some of the responsibility to care for each other and to build nests if you like to assist those less advantaged and to build strategies around building on the Society's vision and the structure to make it all come to fruition so in comparing just some examples of giving this study largely comes out of Ontario the rural charitable sector research initiative and just a few examples that rural giving compared to urban giving that world members are more likely than urban to give at ninety-one percent versus 84 at rural are slightly more likely to give to a cause because they knew someone directly affected by the issue at seventy-six percent versus seventy-two percent and rural are less likely to donate for religious obligations or for more of a moral sense there's more reasons why rural members my gift although that difference is very slight there thirty-one percent versus 34% so is it values that are driving a lot of the philanthropic efforts and chicken around rural philanthropy are their rural values in relation to real life arel are these fables our own values and I just want to read to you a piece from the rural communities recent book actually it's a 2016 publication by a hora del dia but with Laura this is I just picked up at our recent rural conference in PEI that was well organised by Ryan Thank You Ryan I'm and these quotes come from this page 74 of their book that asks about are these rural values operating urban workers are lazy and rural people work heard urban people are secular and atheists while world people are religious and god-fearing cities are corrupt and rural people are honest and law-abiding urban areas are run by eight bosses and our undemocratic and rural areas are democratic cities are hotbeds of unamerican sentiment and rural areas are patriotic Wow some would argue that there may have been some foundation for such a perhaps disparate voices around Howard urban and rural identified themselves but I think we would many of us agree that many of those are fabled I will values and that we would constitute ourselves similar to have urban residents in many ways and we could also find some distinctions but it really is values that dried giving it its values that drive all the forms of altruism that we spoke about so neighborliness and helping out in times of need were described in 1955 as functional values that really have become much less functional in that things have become mechanized that we haven't needed our neighbor so much for some of these tasks that previously we used to do in concert with each other also studies have found that rural members valued benevolence universalism and self-direction and there's a strong call for recognizing the resiliency and the self-determination of many rural centres really argue and in fact in our own research maybe and I did some research in this area that they find themselves self-reliant out of necessity there were often ringing physically and otherwise from power center so they find themselves to be strongly self-directed but there hasn't there is some inconsistencies also in the findings around our values and that questions about tradition as these fabled values might suggest or about power not necessarily rural or urban and in fact there are many of these qualities that show up in both rural and urban settings of course so some of the evidence that's talking about the importance of feeling good to give factors that are most influential in giving is the involvement in community also giving is something that people want to contribute to where already we can see signs of it being positive and that the best investment would be well used to enhance to create even greater good I'm titanum speaks a lot about this very important focus on emphasizing the positive and we want to engage donors we want to build on the sentiments of community satisfaction attachment to that place and to pride those were found to be far more constructive or influential in engaging people to give I'm in terms of sum of two pieces on rural development at all and my piece and we'll pass over to Ryan are the consideration of collectivism philanthropy and perseverance were found to be very critical considerations in the work in developing countries and our colleagues from the Cody International Institute I have been working on asset based Community Development for many decades and building on the work of John McKnight and cressman and impoverished communities are able to build upon some of these earlier values we mentioned about being self-reliant and being compassionate but also um making that as a foundation for teaching about citizen engagement about the rule as members of a collective and that that forms a public spiritedness that I think um there are many examples in this book from clients to citizens that really speak to how powerful communities can be when they engage in their own active development so the last piece I just want to comment on is the important of appreciative communities and in the work that I do we often look at it challenges in society through an appreciative lens where can we already see successes so I think building on communities that have assets and gifts and that we are citizens not consumers and we are stronger rather than weaker and its really focusing on strengths and capacities rather than needs and deficiencies in his work McKnight and cressman i meant block and many others have written about this that organized professional systems are capable of delivering services but only Alice associational life is capable of delivering care and I think that distinction is a real I'm important subtle one for many but really an important one in terms of the human dimension and the humanization of our giving and visual of our organizations like a foundation that strives to bet their community and finally them sustainable transformation is constructed in those places where citizens choose to come together to produce a desired future so that is my bit that I want to contribute for today's conversation i look forward to conversation coming up Thank You Kathleen if you could just click stop sharing yes I can there you go perfect thank you and yes that was a great overview of some of the history and theory around full of philanthropic giving so next up we have Ryan Gibson and he's a former president of the Canadian rural revitalization foundation and current president of the Canadian Community Economic Development network he's also a professor in the geography department at CMU and his research focuses on rural development regional governments and philanthropy in rural Canada so go ahead Ryan thank you that introduction I'm just pulling everything up here I'm hoping you can now see the screen yeah excellent so I think hey where Kathleen left off is a great building point in the comments that Teresa provided at the very beginning paint a really good picture for the local context some of the theory of the history and the rationale behind why people are giving and I chuckled to myself and glad my mic was muted Kathleen when you mentioned that there was not a whole lot of research on philanthropy back in the 1980s and 90s and unfortunately it still is that case we do not have a strong understanding of what is happening and the causal relationships of why some things are happening and why some things don't happen and over the past 10 years this has been one of the passions of myself is trying to understand how do rural communities small communities agricultural communities northern remote isolated communities how is their future linked supported or facilitated by philanthropy in particular looking at Community Foundation's like the rural community foundation of Nova Scotia we know that rural communities whether it be here in Nova Scotia or elsewhere in the country have been witnessing just a decade's of dramatic changes whether it's been the dismantling of Merlin northern institutions whether it's been the out-migration of young people or skilled workers whether it's been economic restructuring or just simply the disappearance of economic opportunities and we've also seen a dramatic unevenness in federal investments in rural and northern communities and so all of these trends that have been taking place over the last 10 20 and 30 years and even longer in many instances have really fueled my interest in how philanthropy can be utilized to not only sis to revitalize but also to sustain and create sustainability for rural communities across the country and so this afternoon I wanted to share some of that research that I've been doing and it builds nicely with the information I've been shared previous to this before I get too far though I thought I would just do a quick plug for a report that was released recently by the Canadian rural revitalization foundation in September they launched the state of rural Canada it is a collection of about fifteen chapters and there is a chapter devoted to each province and territory of Canada outlining the rural reality that exists in those jurisdictions and the report I think speaks largely to the same thing that we've been talking about at its core the report is arguing that in Canada we need a new robust vision as well as policies to really support and enhance rural communities but at the same time rural communities need to be active participants they need to be a partner as Kathleen was describing and they need to be at the decision table when decisions about their future are actually being made and so if you haven't seen the report you can go to the website that's the bottom of the screen at the moment you can download the entire report for free or you can look at it and read it online what I wanted to give people a sense this afternoon is just some of the breadth of of philanthropy and rural engagement in Canada as Kathleen said philanthropy is not new rural especially in rural areas we've seen it historically over the last 100 150 years and we have an ability in rural communities to help out when when things are not going the way we like it whether it's been a reactive to a house burning down or even in celebrating new lighted being born into the community there's a long history of rural people being charitable we also notice that there is considerable wealth that is held within our rural regions but we often miss it we often don't see it because it's not in bank accounts today or tomorrow but it's in the form of land equipment mineral rights land rights and so forth excuse me so in my interest we've been looking at Community Foundation's in Canada there are a hundred and eighty five of them from coast to coast to coast there are approximately 3.5 billion dollars in assets that are currently in doubt in a community foundation and for those that may not be familiar with this language and endowment means that it's been money that has been gifted to a community foundation to manage over the long term and most Community Foundation's will invest that of initial money in an account and investment and never spend the original donated amount the foundation spends the interest that is generated off of that rev off of that investment which allows them to have a very much a sustainable long-term future and as you can see those 85 robust foundations in Canada a couple of years ago gave 143 million dollars in grants and these are grants to support of a wide variety of initiatives but these are initiatives that are determined and priorities that are set by local people that live in local communities and so whether that's supporting the culture and the arts whether it's supporting sports whether it's health care and social service delivery these are the decisions that the board of directors at Community Foundation's that are based in regions and in communities get to make what's interesting is that 92 of the 185 Community Foundation's in Canada are based with communities with less than 10,000 people that's almost half of them almost a half of all collectively owned bank accounts Community Foundation's are actually well which is absolutely phenomenal and a bit surprising considering that almost eighty percent of Canadians live in urban areas if we look just to the Atlantic region we have ten foundations in Atlantic Canada only have six foundations located in the province of New Brunswick we have the committee foundation of Pei with the Community Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador and here in Nova Scotia we have to Community Foundation's Community Foundation the rural community foundations of Nova Scotia and in the community foundation of Nova Scotia collectively these ten community foundations in Atlantic that I have 32 million dollars in doubt that's 32 million dollars in investments and bank accounts that every year generates interest and that interest is what our we're able not we I'm not on a foundation but the board members of Kennedy foundations are able to distribute to their communities to address local priorities and opportunities that emerge so when we look at some of this data around just where is this money this is from 2003 to 2011 and this is the total assets of the Atlantic Community Foundation's this is the total amount of money that they've been gifted and as you can see that for almost every year since 2003 we've seen a gradual increase in the amount of assets that are helped we see in 2008 a slight decline but if anybody recalls 2008 was not a great year for financial and money markets with the economic recession but the good news story is that we see Community Foundation's getting increasingly more assets this is important because it allows us then to look at what is the amount of gifts for grants that are provided by Community Foundation's to local organizations to individuals and what we see here is the fluctuation based on market return for investments but in 2011 and in 2012 over 1 million dollars was given back to local charities local causes and local priorities within the 10 community foundations of Atlantic Canada again 2009-2010 bit of an anomaly given the economic recession and it's aftermath and it's a tailing off over the next couple of years but you can see quite positively in 2011 the investments returning to be able to give a healthy return to their stakeholders so in terms of when we look at this notion that the beginning I'd mentioned there's an opportunity for rural communities to be supported to be sustained and to be revitalized by community foundations there are a few key opportunities and we've mentioned a few of these already but Rural Development and plans to be our natural companions we see increased wealth and many of our world communities whether it's coming from natural resources or if it's coming from afar but we also see that there are lots of assets in rural communities that we often forget about that are only mobilized at the end of life typically so the sale of a house or the sale of equipment on that front we also have in rural Canada a much stronger sense of community and a much stronger sense of attachment both by those that currently live in our communities and those that have grew up in our communities but no longer live there and this sense of community in the sense of place is a key attribute that community foundations need to figure out how to tap into how do they connect to people who used to live in their community that have maybe some well that they would like to give to that community foundation to help support the the quality of life the well-being to support the community apparatus the infrastructure that made it an enjoyable place to live and this becomes increasingly important as we see young people moving out of rural communities but also as we see two generations ago as people left rural communities that are now looking at retirement an opportunity to reconnect with those individuals that are out there to help the longevity and the revitalization of local communities we also have an opportunity in Canada and as I mentioned at the beginning we don't know we don't have a robust information or understanding of rural communities and the lands would be little ends be in general but we do have an opportunity to learn from other jurisdictions across Canada and across the world on how this is happening and we look particularly to our colleagues in the United States we see at the state level places are doing phenomenal innovative work to encourage the donations that are taking place to local community foundations to ensure that wealth that is in the community that it does not simply leave when we start to see intergeneration transfers of wealth so for example when my family my parents pass on I grew up in rural Manitoba their wealth is most likely going to be sent equally between my sister and myself but neither of us live in rural Manitoba so that means upon the death of my parents one hundred percent of their wealth the wealth that was generated from that community will leave and that wealth will leave and there are very few if any opportunities to bring that wealth back to the community and so in the United States we see very robust strategies and innovative methods to ensure that the wealth that's in our rural communities a portion of that remains in our rural communities to support the longevity and the revitalization for those areas but this as it was mentioning it is a time-sensitive window to capture this wealth we know that we have aging populations we know that young people are not always returning to their home community and so how do we find ways to actually figure out how to capture that well a first off to identify where that wealth is and beating figure out ways that we can capture that wealth so that we don't miss the opportunity when it does leave our community because often it is unplanned and we have very limited opportunities in some of my research I've been asking world community foundations there their familiarity with transverse of wealth from generation to generation as well as their their long-term planning around how philanthropy can be utilized to support rural communities and in general we find there is a very from lack of familiarity between Community Foundation's and philanthropy and other actors that are in our world communities are environmental groups are seniors groups are youth groups for example we also the challenge in many of our communities that there's a perception that many families are not rich enough to contribute to to the Community Foundation and a perception that it is only that of the elite and that many people simply don't qualify we see a concern throughout rural Canada and the community foundations that most of them have very limited opportunity to to tackle the transfer of wealth potential that's going to be out there and for example when we look to community foundations of Atlantic Canada out of the 10 only one of the 10 actually has a formalized strategy for how to capture the transfer of wealth between generations but Ted a five of the ten foundations think that they are well-positioned to capture that wealth but yet only one of them actually has a plan for how to do it and so this notion is is one that we can learn from our American colleagues around how to keep the wealth in our communities so that we can have long-term benefits from that and so this was a question I'm often asked is philanthropy the missing key to rural development or sustainability and my answer is always it's not the missing key it is it is one of the keys for the future of rural communities and it is a unique opportunity and a unique platform that can be utilized to really be creative around the long-term thinking and creating long-term priorities through the use of existing wealth this is a rare opportunity because too frequently rural communities are dependent on external funds whether it be from government or from business to do major development to make substantive and significant changes in their communities philanthropy and community foundations is one of the few opportunities that communities have almost complete control over how they go about collecting wealth and how they go about spending the interest that's generated there are a series of rules that come with charities in Canada however the decision-making is truly that that it is local and it is local people making local decisions about local priorities so I'm going to leave this key messages here but in a sense I'm going to wrap up with that there are a few resources that I've got listed here on this slide that have been done I see Josh Barrett is on this call Josh on my end done a lot of work throughout 2011 to 2014 on charitable giving and assets and looking at his intersection between philanthropy and rural communities in Atlantic Canada there's also some work that's taking place out of Manitoba that I can leave you with and all of that can be found at that website or if you want to drop me an email I'm more than happy to connect you with that but maybe I can turn it over to yourself maybe thank you so much fun it's really great to see some of the opportunities that are there for rural communities when it comes to rural philanthropy and i think that the rookies foundation in nova scotia is kind of jumping on some of those and we'll learn a little bit about that right now actually so it's my pleasure to introduce our final speaker Arthur bowl and after bowl is book chair of the rural communities foundation of Nova Scotia he's also the executive director of the bay of fundy marine resource center and member of the Coordinating Committee of the world forum of Fisher peoples in the past he's also been chair of the coastal communities network co-director of the rural communities impacting policy project and a senior policy analyst in the government of Nova Scotia and he's also a musician and writer so our three you can go ahead and share your screen in your PowerPoint thanks for that introduction Maggie um we've had really informative overview from from Kathleen and Ryan and I want to in a sense come back to Teresa's introduction because I'm going to be talking about the rural communities foundation that's notice kosha in particular I'm going to be talking about how we're going ahead with our fund development strategy so having got that overview we're now going to give an example of one particular rural foundation and how we're trying to navigate these waters and it's a good opportunity for us because this is very much early days and this fun development strategy so it's good opportunities to try and explain it for one thing but also an opportunity to get some feedback and questions from you so it's good to be here I'm Teresa did give get the overview in terms of the the foundation the community foundation itself I want to give a little bit of background of contacts for the fund development strategy in particular very briefly those of you who are on the webinar Nova Scotia will be very familiar with this list we have heard it recently loudly we've heard it for decades declining aging population health issues economic and fiscal issues questions about natural resources lack of economic growth reduce public services the list goes on it's a litany we're very familiar with and it's a serious one um we don't hear so much about is that rural communities are also a place where we find solutions to some of society's most pressing issues whether it's stewardship of Natural Resources questions of indigenous title questions above climate change and how to deal with changing demographics as citizen engagement transportation and questions of innovation that involves the social economic and environmental combined so these are these are things that rural communities are uniquely placed to address and these are these are not just rural issues their issues of all of society so one of the things that we believe is that local organizations throughout rural Nova Scotia are working on new ways to address challenges and take advantages of opportunities so that's one one assumption we are bringing in and it's based on our shared experience grant making over the last 15 years this work is happening innovative work is happening at the grassroots level but is the pot with very very little support of for this kind of work grassroots level so our job is about supporting rural grassroots innovation primary task rural communities foundation is to put funding and other resources into the hands of people who are making a difference we're all Nova Scotia so that sort of frames up the fund development strategy and this again is a little bit of background that Theresa covered as well so we're coming into this as not a huge grant maker but as a very well tested and experienced grant maker with 15 years of successful event making and world of discussion so we have taken a multi-faceted approach to our fund development strategy that is to say we're not just pushing on one particular aspect of fun development and we're not doing one thing and then the other and the other in a linear sense we're pushing forward actually on five different fronts one is about building an endowment one is about what we call conduit funding and that is about designing went making programs I'll come back to that one is about matching individual donors with individual community organizations one's about convening bringing together our grantees into communities of practice and one is what we call switchboard which is about how we act as an interface between rural communities and other funders in other words our goal is to get those resources into the communities it doesn't have to be us who puts it there we can play a facilitating role in in other resources coming in particularly coming from outside of Nova Scotia and sometimes even outside of Canada so I'm just going to go through those those five different functions and give a very quick overview of what we're trying to get out there the endowment one is is the very sort of standard mainstream approach that Community Foundation's take that Ryan talked about building an endowment so we are currently about to start a whole round of of fundraising meetings and the focus is going to be against on rural social innovation and leadership we have a goal over three years of building up three million dollar endowment um that is not a new piece but it's a piece that we're going to push forward because in the end world communities Community Foundation's are about having this kind of gift that keeps on giving so we're not went dropping that but what we are doing is adding some other functions in what we call conduit grant making this is when we actually tailor a grant program that is targeted to specific issues and populations in other words we are a grant maker with a good track record as a grant maker we know how to give money away and accountable and low probable way with low overhead and efficient and and it's it's something that we know how to do so what we want to do is turn that particular asset into a very specific kind of grant making where rather than just saying we're going to fund rural communities we will go to a donor and say for example let's say up chain of pharmacies and say wouldn't you like to have your name on a Grants program that supports seniors and mental health innovative programs that are out there so this isn't to go into a endowment is actually to go as a conduit in a sense to go right out the door but in a particularly focused way so this could relate to all kinds of different issues youth it could relate to seniors it could relate to the environment a whole range of issues and that would possibly appeal to a particular donor and the other aspect of this is that we might also go to a partner with with a non profit network our umbrella group who who work with a specific population whether the youth seniors indigenous Nova Scotians of persons disabilities or specific issues so that we might actually do some interesting work around new kinds of collaborations where the worth of philanthropic side of the house that is we now to make grants we now to give money away we know how to do that charitable stuff but we might go to a group that has a lot of experience and relationships in a particular area and then together go into a donor this is all theory at this point so we're about to launch this but it's a it's a something we're really looking forward to because we think there are people who have specific commitments and passions are on a specific aspects of we're all Nova Scotia and very quickly if I want to pick up on this point that both Kathleen and Ryan made about philanthropy being part of rural communities we know this is true here it's simply part of our way of life not necessarily because we're nicer people than urban people but simply because this is how things are done and for instance in my community world of viscacha if a child gets get some chronic disease if somebody's lost to see know immediately the community starts acting philanthropy is part of our culture question is how we mobilize that so we thought we also need to have a kind of grant making which is very very individualized which is a particular donor might say I would like to give some money to a big my used in the environment project and we are in a position because we have a database of hundreds of organizations to say well you know we've got one for you you know we've got one in esco Sony here here's a couple let's talk about it we would essentially take them by the hand and play a matchmaker role so this is a way for us to basically say to them scotians you know for all the talk about role of the Scotia we need we are providing a way to actually do something and it very much relates to the whole question about about the intergenerational transfer that line is talking about to to to make it possible for people to do this and sometimes people want to give to something very very specific so we we were able to play that role so what we call the switchboard function these names are just kind of shorthand for us but basically what this means is that we don't have to be the grantmaker we can actually connect a community organization to another grant maker another community foundation or maybe they're talking about social enterprise and they're looking for an investor and maybe there's a government program so we have a kind of information in their fur overall in our job is to get the resources out there not necessarily through us the other aspect of this is we want to play kind of a role as an interface between communities brooke amusing obscure and the larger field of rural philanthropy in canada and in the US and because we feel there's a there's a major gap there just on the environmental side just to pick that example we know that only three percent of philanthropic giving and canada comes east of montreal so there's a big gap there and we need to we need to play a role as a connector there and then finally you know as a convener we would we would basically bring together our grantees linked to community building opportunities especially relating to social innovation from in a weave a different approaches that that support new kinds of collaboration collective impact scaling impact development evaluation and so forth so that's not just about putting resources out there but I think it'll be a natural next step and by the way this webinar is really good example of convening for us and so we're looking forward to doing more these sorts of things so there are different ways of supporting this a marcin that I won't dwell on those so it's not just the different kinds of donations will be looking for so in the end you know what what's a success look like for us for this fun development strategy the measure of our success will be the extent to which bring funding and other resources to grassroots community organizations so that's that's a quick overview of that and thanks again for the opportunity to let you talk about Thank You Arthur I think that's a good slide to leave up there because we are moving into a discussion it was great to hear some of the details of a plan that I've known a little bit about but sounds like there's some real potential for success here so as I mentioned at the beginning of the webinar for all those who are participating painless included you can click on the chat button I select everyone and then write a question or comment that I will relay so I think just to get started I'm interested in hearing from Brian kind of his reaction to the plan from the drug nation and if he's seen something like this in his work researching Community Foundation's across nova scotia is this a strategy that's common or is this something a bit innovative great question I think first and foremost congratulations to the board and the supporters of the board and formulating that plan those don't come along quickly or easily a lot of time and effort goes into them and I think what what my notes I wrote down here are one is I think the day versity of the five prong approach for the lack of a better term is really really commendable because it's one thing to think that the foundation can do everything for everyone but the position of saying we might be a matchmaker and that might actually be a better use of our time effort and energy and money as opposed to trying to have all the fun centralized under one umbrella is a truly holistic and admirable and I think a lot of foundations can learn from that because some of them have very much a very narrow perspective on what they're looking to do and this is not that this is a very much a robust strategy and I think it'll be really interesting to see how it moves forward and I anticipate that as a bit of momentum is gathered it will simply pick up more and more momentous congratulations to Arthur and resend your colleagues great so there's no questions on here right now did any of the panelists have questions or comments for one another I do actually I have one for Arthur even though we're sitting here together again dr. oh my question would be about whether in these different roles would this help triage some of the applications that come in for the pool of funds and maybe direct folks to some other partnerships instead of considering them for the 5,000 possible a donation or are there other functions that you see in evolving yeah that's a that's a question we've actually just been talking about today in our board meeting in and it's it's going to be important question there was how do these different functions relate to each other and triage is a good where they think our hope is that all of them will eventually lead to us from unen down I mean if this is the thing that we really need to keep that sustainable giving it in play but in some cases somebody might come in and say well I really would like to do something very immediately with this group that we need to be a to say we respond to them and so it needs to be really driven by the donor what the donor wants but we might start a conversation for example on endowment we might end up actually saying sounds like you might want to be no designing and delivering a grand making program with us so it's going to be very interesting to see over the next specially the next six months where we're in a very experimental kind of period if that happens of my guess is just that well that that that in fact we're going to see sort of a migrations through these different categories I think we're going to have to be adapted great it's helpful thanks i'm gonna i'm wondering if anyone knows of foundations that are working around issues of food and health mm-hmm arthur arrived I don't know so I would help if i took my unmuted my microphone I guess yes talking to myself happens frequently there are a number of candy foundations Kathleen are looking at food health and well-being in particular most of the ones I'm familiar with are predominantly urban based so particularly the Winnipeg foundation and the vancouver city foundation have very robust a food and food security programming and that either they have done or that they've supported through their granting and it's predominantly more of a ladder if i'm not mistaken but we also see the community foundation and the name of it slips my mind in the interior of british columbia over toward castlegar grand forks and selkirk that neck of the woods but also in southern Ontario where we've seen some work being done whether it's on supporting grants troops to try to understand how community supported agriculture could be better utilized looking at kind of market related opportunities to expand agriculture to looking at children schools well-being utilization of local foods great those great examples thank you I have a question Megan for Ryan that's all right um we're actually to either run or Kathleen do you have any are you aware tall of any kind of overall rural grantmakers umbrella group or affinity group on a national scale or even on a canada-us scale is is there a forum where world grant makers get up get together connect I have a really quick ends and it's not the one you're looking for Arthur and that's no there is a few different umbrella or apex organizations one of which is the community foundations of Canada a very large umbrella organization that represents everybody from the smallest Community Foundation which is in Northern Ontario place called Hurst made fifty thousand dollars in doubt all the way up to the Vancouver foundation with over 850 million dollars in doubt and as I'm sure you've anticipated or even experienced the needs of their membership is eclectic on good days and so it's very difficult I think for many foundations to find an appropriate table to have those conversations around rural grantmakers best practices tips and pearls of wisdom in the United States there is a network largely convenient coordinated by the Nebraska Community Foundation they host a conference every year i believe it is if not its every second year on rural philanthropy and that conference typically takes place in nebraska city in the fall time it's well worth the visit to go down nebraska probably has the most robust most active and innovative community foundations in north america with not internationally and that an opportunity they typically have a lot of sessions at their conference around capacity building sharing frustration sharing opportunities and a great session which I attended one a couple years ago was around if if only I had known then what I know now that's great right you know I hope I'm not out of line saying this but you know looking ahead to other webinars it might be a very interesting ones left connect up some lady and then us girl philanthropy groups and community foundations and and you know being that conversation it might be interesting too because even later today there is a session that actually Theresa had to run out for she's talking at st. effects on rural predicament ken rural survive will rule survive and this question that Arthur raises is I'm related to that to you know how do we cultivate a sense of resiliency and longevity when we do have these other indicators of demise so we do know there is growth we do know there are people returning to rural settings and there are tremendous signs and hope as well that we need to build upon so that might be a quite a timely conversation follow-up to what we discussed further tonight I think we're close to our time Maggie yeah I was going to say just say that thank you for that comment I think that's gonna be a really interesting panel this evening i'm looking for a cheer notes from that so yeah we have reached the end of our time I could ask familia more questions I'm sure and number of you could too but I'd like to thank all of the panelists for their really interesting presentations and for the work that they're doing in rural communities and as well to our participants for coming in and listening a throughout that if you do have any questions for a panelist you should all have my email already so just contact me and I can get you in touch there we will be sending out a short survey for evaluation within the next week so it will receive that and be able to provide your thoughts so yes thank you to everyone for your time this afternoon thank you thanks for pulling this together baby Thanks market them yes thanks to everyone for joining yep take good care
