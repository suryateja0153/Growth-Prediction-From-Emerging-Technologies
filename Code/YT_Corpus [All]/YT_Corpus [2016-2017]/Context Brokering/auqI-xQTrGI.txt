 all right hello everyone I'm super excited to be here with you today I get the pleasure of showing you our vision for how we see intelligence integrated into one of the most popular ways that people communicate today skype the skype that you know and love is going to be smarter more helpful and entertaining we're moving into a world where you will soon be able to plan trips shop even talk to intelligent BOTS all from within your skype chats so I'm going to show you a demo of this next generation of skype since its skype it'll work on iOS android math web you name it but i'm going to show it to you on my windows phone so here i see that i have one miss notification let's see who that's from and aww it's from greedy for those of you that don't know drew deeps our corporate vice president for skype so i can ignore this so let's go into it and you see i have a visual video mail from from greedy i'm going to play it hey I just wanted you with us to keynote go dice again this year congratulations and thanks for everything you do for skype that is amazing I'm a huge fan of CODIS I'm going to send him a quick thank you so right away as you're seeing here there are some new things in this next generation of skype you see this visual video mail so we have a video message with the transcript right below this is one of the examples where we're taking intelligence from things like Skype translator and bringing them directly into everyday features like video messages and now Gertie was telling me the team has sent me a little something so that's really nice I'll send him a quick little happy emoticon I'm so in this next generation has had the other thing that you'll notice in the canvas is my personal assistant Cortana is always there in the upper right-hand corner Fortana is there if I want to talk to her at one-on-one or in a group or even as you can see here she subtly improving my messages by highlighting key points in my texts like kotas so I can tap on CODIS you see this rich card powered by Bing that's showing us that this is a real organization that Microsoft sponsors to really promote women in technology which is something that I'm very passionate about so now you see Cortana is actually sending me a private message I'm going to tap that and I go into the one-on-one conversation I have with Cortana so she's telling me the cups and cakes pot would like to know my location for delivery and yes I'll share it and would I like to track delivery also yes I'll share it so right away what you're seeing here is that the agent Cortana is actually brokering the conversation with the third-party bought the cups and cakes but now I see this rich card that is showing me that the cupcake is on its way and that it will be here within a few minutes all of this is happening within my skype chats this is just one example of the many ways that you're going to start seeing businesses using the power of skype and Cortana to interact with their customers now since I'm already talking to Cortana and I've committed to doing this keynote I'm going to go ahead and try to plan the rest of my trip please block my calendar for kotas from April 10th through April 12 so you saw there I use push to talk because I didn't feel like typing and right away the other thing you're in Lotus here is that Cortana actually has context from my previous chat with good eat so even though I just told it the dates it actually knows the location and you know that it's from the conversation with greedy now Cortana is proactively thinking about the next steps in coordinating my trip so she's actually suggesting that I connect with the westin bot anybody that knows me knows I normally stay at a westin but I'm so what you see here now is Cortana has actually introduced the west and bought into the conversation but not only has she done that she has given the west and bought context so I don't have to repeat myself the westin bot knows this is for Dublin and it's for those particular dates all of this saves me a lot of time and effort now there are suggested rooms I'm going to choose the normal room confirmation and just like that in two simple steps I was able to block my cam under and also booked my hotel room now now there's nothing else the westin bot can do for me so I am going to say no thank you and now because poor Tina has all my relevant details the westin bot can actually leave the conversation now we're seeing a third aspect of Cortana she knows my connection she knows who I communicate with and so here you're seeing her actually suggests that when I go on this trip to Dublin that I communicate with my friend Jani and I see this card I could call her directly from here or video call her but I don't know what time it is and so I'm going to choose to message her clicking that takes me to the conversation I have with Jani the other thing you'll notice is that Cortana because she has context about why I'm pinging Jenny as she's pre-populated the text with context around when I'm going to Dublin and basically why I want to talk to her and fantastic Jani is available and she's even going to show me around town so this is just a glimpse into how skype and Cortana powered by big can make our conversations more productive informed and fun
