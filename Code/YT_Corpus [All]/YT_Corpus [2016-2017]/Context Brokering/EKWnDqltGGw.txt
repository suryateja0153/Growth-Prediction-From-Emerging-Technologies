 Hi everybody Dave Sullivan here for the Credit Guy TV with special guest ... Charles Green of the Small Business Finances Institute Charles thanks for reaching out to me on Linkedin, I have really enjoyed our relationship you have found a niche, something that the commercial banking industry needs. Tell me a little bit more about that. Dave I have been a career banker since the late seventies and when I joined the industry I was given about eight weeks of training in my first two years of employment while I was really not worth much to the company that hired me but after the S&L crisis internal training programs for most banks sort of went away and it's never really come back although there have been some really good times since. I started a training operation to create content to train commercial lenders the fundamental skills needed to evaluate funding and close commercial loans across all different product types and we plan to deliver this through streaming video across the nation Training and so important and has been overlooked in the commercial space The mortgage lender has been really trained yo death today and comerical lending is ignored completely so that there is a real need for this don't you? i do, mortgage brokers are licensed and that gives them particularly standards that they have to adhere to and you know they can be evaluated much simpler against those standards, with commercial lending you have a diversity of product lines you've got regulated banks and non-regulated finance companies that provide different financing products so it's a big sea of  people floating around with different kinds of experience and information products to offer that just sort of gets lost to them in the fray and customers suffer consequences because they don't always know who can help them and the person that they find might not know where to send them if they can't deal with the situation sure many times they are really thrust into that position that little or no training so I think the product is very important and I flew down to Atlanta to meet with you and record a session on business credit very impresses with the professionalism of the organization you have down there talk a little bit about the teachers that you found for the program. well I have been away from active banking for almost five years so I had adopted the job title of recovering banker. I still retained quite a bit of this of course the knowledge from the 35 year career but also have recruited a lot of other leaders who have different perspective and experience in particular credit lines like asset based lending commercial real estate or government guaranteed products and in addition we're putting together a group of professionals who haven't been lending the money but they've been supporting the lending industry through providing their professional services for the due diligence you're joining us was one such instance where you're an expert on credit data and credit histories and how the FICO score stacks up and can be very accurate or sometimes not so accurate and it's explaining these kinds of lessons give commercial lenders more context around the job that they have to do every day similarly we have a working with a real estate appraiser and environmental engineer is going to help teach bankers how to evaluate property in terms of the environmental risk we have an attorney creating content about the different closing functions the different contracts banks use the different issues that can arise with the property title and so forth I think that is all key information and to have it all in a consice video format I don't think it has been done before for the commercial lender and I'm very excited to be a part of it.
