 my name is Jim hatela I'm a VP of business development and security with the open group and thank you for joining the webcast today we'll be introducing IT for IT I will be joined by Dave lounsbery with the open group and Stuart Alexander with enterprise architects Dave let me go ahead and make you the presenter and feel free to take it away great thank you Jim well welcome everybody to this presentation on IT for IT first I want to give folks a background on IT for IT and why we're doing this a few years ago a number of major IT consumers recognized the need to improve the efficiency of their IT operations and really organized themselves so they could face the challenges of the demands being put on them by the diverse business units in in their organizations and to do that they recognize they needed a new approach to improving their IT efficiency and in doing so they also wanted to make sure that they weren't locking themselves into any one particular solution we all know that there are a lot of IT trends around technology fads and things like that but these people recognize the need to create a standard that spanned not only their needs but also allowed them to get their IT services software and components from a large number of vendors and the real driving cost of this was in fact the always the dual costs are the the dual objective of improving their their operational capability in the IT world while controlling the cost so they can spend it on new products and services and and this is one of those areas where you know you think I t of course has all the tools and processes they need to to run their shop but sometimes it's the case where the phrase for use is that the children have no shoes IT focuses all his energy on delivering services to the line of business but not always so much on its own software for running its own business so that motivated these vendors and customers to come together to form the IT for IT forum under the open group they did that they were making good progress on their own but they recognize that if they were going to get a an open standard that was vendor neutral and headed enduring home that they would need to actually bring it to a standards organization they did that a couple of years ago and I'll talk a little bit more about the timeline for IT for IT in a bit but they have started that form under the open group and they are working very hard down to we've released the standard and we're working very hard now to make sure that that standard is available to the marketplace so that's that's what I t if righty is about at a high level I'll talk a little bit more about what's in the standard and the value propositions for all parts of the people who are in the IT support ecosystem to adopt the standard so what is IT for IT so the open group is a vendor a member-driven organization that helps organizations and businesses achieve their objectives to use of open standards and so I t4i t as it comes from the open group is an open group standard that's a vendor-neutral and technology agnostic operating model for IT how IT operates the business of IT and also a reference architecture for how the components that support that operating model will fit together and communicate and for people who implement that operating model it provides a coherent capability to manage that business of IT beginning to end all the all the ways that I T works and interoperates with the business so that they can operate more effectively and waste less money on internal operations and deliver more to the lines of business we think that's critical because we see not only is there as an area of fast change but we see that a lot of approaches to solving similar problems in the in the IT world and we want to make sure that there are standards that people can point to so that they can provide the components and also provide the people skills to actually work in that in that efficient way and this is of the standard that is not only based on current needs for IT operation but we've also tried very deliberately to look forward to the really emerging model of the agile world based on cloud infrastructures and that really rapid delivery of IP services now I mentioned we're a member based organization and that the group of people worked before they came to the open group there were a number of founders and you can see here we have major IT consumer organizations like shell IT supplier organizations like hewlett-packard and consultancies who help them achieve their objectives people like Accenture we also have academic participation to help help get them started and those were the seed group who came to the open group to create that to create the form and create the enduring home for the standard since they joined the open group they've made rapid progress and you can see the chain here from September 2011 and the launch of the open group to 2014 to the point where we have actually where we released the standard in in 2015 so the first version of that IP for IP standard is up and it's being actively evolved by the members not only in terms of moving to standard forward but also to creating the material for the supporting ecosystem things like reference cards and we're very actively working on creating a program by which people can be certified as proficient in IP for IT that's under the guidance as always of the members of the open group there's been very rapid growth in the membership of the IT for IT forum and I think now we're over 60 members and you can see some of the others here people like Armstrong process group you know buyers like BP ExxonMobil and origin energy suppliers like Microsoft IBM capgemini as a global supplier and consultancy it's a very rapid growth in that area because there's people really developing a lot of interest in how to do this transformation so that's the group that's who we are now how are we doing it and what problem are we solving these days in any business any business of any size really depends on IT to some extent and many are dependent entirely on IT for they are competitive business models you know in the in think of many examples here like Amazon or uber who are primarily delivered through their IT interactions with the world and of course it is very reasonable these days for CIOs to expect to use their IT as a differentiator but that's always been a point of friction between the people who are the business oriented people and people who have come up through the technology path and we've probably all heard the phrase you know business and IT don't speak the same language and so here we've got on one hand the rising expectations of the business that they can use IT to be a business differentiator and then the people who are NIT are struggling to both stay on top of technologies deliver that value to the business and actually you know run their business in efficient way so they can actually communicate to business in a businesslike way and so they're in a lot of stress it's a it's a tough position to be in and they need a business model to be able to do that in an affordable efficient businesslike way so I want to note that gartner has captured this actually quite well in their analysis of the in the space and I'll let people read this here but the the essence of this is that the IP functions companies are struggling to contain costs and any money they spend on their internal operations is money that isn't being invested into new IT to help differentiate the business and you can see here there their estimate is that if we can and you think about for a billion-dollar IT budget improvements in efficiency could be as much as five twenty percent of your total budget so you can do the math and see what that would mean to new investments in new programs and people to deliver that now I mentioned the need the the old saw about IT and business talking a different language if you want to talk to business and talk to that in their business like language one of the best places you can go for that is you go to the source on on business processes michael porter we've all seen the book competitive strategy for michael porter and it talks about how you organize for a business and really one of the things you will see in IT for IT is is that is that organization on a businesslike way so let me so what's in IT for IT and you see principally the major components of IT for IT that are presented in that standard our first and operating model in that operating model is based on Porter's value chain concept that that shows what the segments of the IT business are and how each step in in that process adds value as the information flows through the business out to services that are delivered to the lines of business now of course having a business model or an operating model is a good start but what you also need to achieve those efficiencies is the components that allow you to automate those processes for maximum efficiency and data models to know where you need to share information and the inner end of course specify the interactions between those systems so the other thing you will see in the IP for IT standard is the reference model that was derived using enterprise architecture methodology and of course that we always looked togaf for that and the model is in fact specified in the open groups archive eight modeling language so we can take a little bit of look at that in a little bit of detail here on the next slide we've got this sort of new viewpoint on how to run and deliver IT and we look at the traditional IT value chains of plan build deliver and run and we've mapped those into value chain segments a following Porter according to according to that that traditional model and so from an IT viewpoint that means you look at you know the first view the plan stage where in IP for IT that's the strategy to portfolio value stream and that's where you think about how do you make the right investments so that you can have things in your IT portfolio that deliver what your business strategy needs second phase is the requirements to deploy a value stream and that's about how you create and deploy quality services that are available to the lines of business for use how you actually take your strategy you've turned it into a portfolio now you put things into that portfolio one of the key concepts NIT for IT is is that it's a service model that it's its demand led that when you put things into your portfolio that your customers have a way to choose from a catalog or pull things out of the portfolio and deploy them for their business so the next phase of that is the deliver face and in IT for ITV requests to fulfill value chain and that is to provide that catalog of services for consumption to the user and give them a way that they can reach out and get those services when they need it they don't have to you know start a new project in hanging that they can just go and grab the services in and make them work and of course once those services are deployed well they need to be kept up and running the businesses come to rely on them and so you need a way to make sure that they are up and running and delivering on this service level agreements and that's captured in the last phase of IT for IT which is called the detector correct phase which is when there's some anomaly when the services aren't meeting expectations or something's not working that there's a mechanism by which that gets analyzed and and responded to and fix both in terms of service restoration and in terms of long term fixes which may feed all the way back to the beginning now we'll look at those in a bit more detail here on this next slide and you can see this is now starting to show the big meat of the IT variety operating model you see the four value streams their strategy to portfolio the requirement to deploy the request to fulfill detect occur and you'll see when you go into the IT for IP standards by the way I should mention you can download from from the open group bookstore site and I believe will provide a link for that later you can see the functions that need to be delivered in each one of those stages how you go from strategy to a service portfolio to demand and selection I won't read these all I want to get to the real heart of our presentation and the steps that are needed the key performance indicators for when you know you actually achieve those steps and the components of the architecture reference model that are needed to to make that happen so I won't go through all of these in detail I do want to show you however a bit more you can see here drilling down into moving from that that value stream and operating model view of IT for IT into what is the the actual components for the system of record now one of the key things here is that this is not an implementation guide this is an architecture reference model and what we're trying to identify at this level is what are the capabilities that the systems need in order to fulfill that that operating model and the interactions among them so again you see a fairly full set here and you can see that they are mapped to the various phases in the in the value chain strategy portfolio requirement to deploy a request to fulfill detect to correct so what are the capabilities you need from an IT perspective in order to deliver each one of those you know when you think about how you would procure this it's very likely that you'll see people aggregating some of these capabilities into a single service or a single piece of software again the essence here is do you know you've got everything you need so those are the capability level of you and of course we go beyond that to talk about the actual data items that need to be kept at each stage in order to know you are what you're doing things like for example you know your your your back layer is your portfolio backlog you know what do you still need to implement and how that information needs to flow among the capabilities which capability needs to know about that backlog in order to move it from you know the strategy portfolio planning stage into the implementation stage and required to deploy at at the next stage and so on now I'm sure a lot of you know that this is an area where there's a lot of IT operational standards in the world and one of the most important things one of the key principles of the open group is that when we create a new standard or new model like this that we make sure that we leverage existing standards it's a nobody's interest that we create new standards from scratch so where there are standards that are fit for purpose we will reuse them and IT for IT in particular has taken care to make use of the proven existing standards where they exist in our fit for purpose and also to make it clear how you how it positions itself with those other standards because you know you know you don't want to say I t4i T is the one true approach to doing these things you know we've got things like TOGAF for example which and when you look into IT for IT a key part of going from your business strategy to your portfolio is that you do enterprise architecture work well togaf is the premier standard for that so we would reference that to make sure that happen there are a number of others here I'll let you see them on the chart in terms of both industry standards for information sharing IT operational standards for supply chain finance HR marketing functions that I teach traditionally delivers a lot of value in how IT operates itself and then standards that are relevant to industry verticals what I specifically want to call out is I tell it's a particular note because we want IT let's take it4 it's-- business approach and make sure that's built on proven operational foundation I ITIL in particular is a very rich source of IP operational practices so we've referenced those in IT for IT we make sure that we note where such standards like I till and cobit are relevant to implementing the IT for IT standard and so if you're already familiar with ITIL and practice already as part of your IP operational discipline you can use that as a road map to to getting to know I t for IT and bringing that into the into the the larger business model you know if you if you take this if you adopt the operating model and you do the implementation you can do this from the standpoint of a vendor you can do it from the standpoint of a consumer and and so you can ask well what does that mean and for the value proposition for those kinds of organizations if your organization it consumes IT and of course shell and exxon mobil are big examples of that and for those of you who are open group members i would urge you to take a look at some of the case studies that are on the website and we can make some of those available on the public website that you know that increase in efficiency gives you the ability to track you know the metrics of IT cost performance the business value you're adding and the risk and use that have a have a sound methodology for making your operational decisions in doing continuous improvement and also reduce the cost of ownership for IT management tools in particular so you can take that money out of IT operations and take the efficiency and apply it to actually creating stuff to deliver value for the business if you're a software vendor this allows you to it's a guidepost for developing your integrated solution it's one where you know that there will be an industry target ready to consume some of that and you can focus instead of trying to you know cover the whole waterfront you can focus on the lace where you create competitive differentiation now of course people go out and they contract services for delivery of their IT function and so if you're a software integrator or consultancy you know you've got this methodology that you know that is openly available that you will have vendors lined up to provide the tools so that you can deliver and also customers who will be able to understand what you're what you're offering them and so you can move beyond that traditional process consulting where you're trying to differentiate based on you know your particular approach to things tell your customers that you've got something where you they can have some choice and work with you with confidence that there will be multiple vendors able to participate in that at the end that gives you the ability to deliver a higher quality product at the lower cost of the customer you know one of the things that everybody who's working I t4i tinos is it's all all about the people and getting skilled people as one of the biggest challenges for anybody who's in the IT world and one of the things that you'll see coming out of the IT for IT program is a certification where you can identify the people who have shown their knowledge of the IT for IT standards so that when you've got to get those individuals that you'll you'll know who's who's who's hit the books and if you are an IT professional of course you can use that that certification and the knowledge of IT for IT is a differentiated for you in developing your career this has been a kind of a whirlwind tour of IT for IT I want to turn this back over to Jim at this point to take it forward and hear the rest of our presentation great thanks Dave and so our next presenter is Stuart Alexander Stewart is a principal with enterprise architects international and he'll be talking to IT for IT and practical use so over to you Stewart so how everybody I'm currently in Amsterdam at the moment and it's twelve o'clock midnight as Jim mentioned member of a company from Iran which is the deal northern hemisphere operating company for X PRIZE architects principal here been working for companies about a year business architect previously been ahead of solutions at a software house delivering IT solutions to business directly so what I wanted to cover off today with some surreal life observations and implementation considerations some of the challenges around positioning mighty variety that you might experience and that we've observed and and really look at people and mindset and let's say some some key attributes that you might be looking for in people that some of the concepts of IT for IT describes them brings out so just want to describe a bit of context first what have we been doing with RT for IT so we've been building strategies operating models and roadmaps for IT organizations over the past number of years especially in the last year in the Northern Hemisphere and the discs are architecture thinking pattern it's really our methodology for how we go about transformation blueprinting and I just want to quickly speak to it and just as a consultancy describe how I to variety kind of can accelerate our process a little bit so we would always start our method by an architectural perspective understanding the strategy the motivation that's driving a business strategy and into playing that back in describing what's the business model that I t's trying to support so some of there's some really good concepts in the IT 4ic standard that kind of describe the conditions that a modern IT organization is facing so they're kind of the need to be brokering services and then what sort of capabilities do we need to actually be able to do that how do we build up our partnership models what's our core value proposition and I'll go through some of those in and it helps us we would then look to build out capability models there they've mentioned the actual standard provides them a quick start guide for actually modeling an operating model for IT and so it really accelerates our process as a consultancy to come in to be able to leverage leverage and proven thinking and then use that as a starting point to then oakman as required with any specific business context that the client faces so the world is changing so we know organizations are sort shifting from profit to purpose that organizations are becoming flatter and sort of networked that start for being empowered and trusted more that businesses are looking to experiment and become much more transparent in their in their ways of operating and if that's the case then how does if business models are changing then how does i.t need to respond and also when everyone's expectations and the work of consuming IT kind of very simple and easy to use mobile applications and web on the go the expectations from outside the workplace into the workplace and so how do we how do we do this and execute on an IT strategy and at the same time supporting your existing estate and just want to kind of put that frame that as a kind of a context point for what are the challenges of the IT organizations we've been dealing with so they're characterized by trying to enable great customer experiences so time to value is absolutely key around unlocking insight and value propositions from data optimising total cost of ownership which is one of the key drivers of the IT for IT standard and also developing new value networks so being able to build new business models through partnerships and ecosystems so the common challenges that we see where I t for IT actually kind of provides a great way of framing the conversation is how do we move to dbox ways of working how do we transition new role skills and mindsets how do we shift to the service broker models and how do we govern that from an architectural perspective ensuring that our services killed by design and how do we replay the invest in term investment of budgeting models and IT for IT speaks to all of these things in the actual data model and functional model that we'll see in a minute so let's dive in I've just framed that we know that enterprise IT should be bimodal in that on the one hand we need be able to kind of maintain the long-term planning and existing stability of our IT investments and at the same time we know that we need to be able to respond to the business and we need to be able to respond in a way that shows that we understand that we're ready we're ready as an IT organization to respond to deliver things quickly one of the things that will see is that that although we've seen is that IT setting likely up as a provider as an order taker creates a relationship where the business is in a position where it kind of its self fulfilling that you don't actually you are not able to influence the strategy and they can create longer-term complexity to control from investments where technology providers can go straight into business and it creates complexities around governance as you're trying to optimize your own idea state and ways of managing IT additional things come in into the business landscape that are less manageable so how do we move to a model and the strategy portfolio value stream is absolutely key in this that enables us to set up the IT operation as a partner into the business where we're able to control the leadership role within disruption to actually frame a conversation with eat the wider ecosystem and technology providers and its key as well to be able to frame value internally to internal members of staff within the IT organization so that everything that they're doing they feel motivated and that what they're doing is delivering a business value it's amazing when you go around ID organizations how you see the IT organizations that are performing can trace back the work that they're doing back to delivering value to the business getting that right is absolutely essential so getting the getting the strategy portfolio align to business value and being able to show how that is driving business strategy it's a key thing to focus on one of the things that's really important is positive engagement with the business so the model itself as a functional expression comes to life through people and there's this really nice concept in the IT for IT standards called a unique experience conviction which is in the requested fulfill value stream and it talks about an engagement experience portal which is really as a consumer of an IT service going in during the Service Catalog be able to either not space get self-service support what we've seen is that actually this experience engagement and this experience condition needs to transcend the point of which service is being consumed into the entire engagement with IT as an organization because every time there's a connection point without as I tip with IT it can reinforce the value how IT can support is aligned to the business strategy and supporting business so the business capabilities themselves whether it's when we're defining strategy when we're when we're supporting people we really need to be clear about and invest in good communication skills that go over and above in a way that is going to give that true sense of partnership when you look at the companies that you know great technology companies out there today that are running really good internal models the way that they end up communicating with their consumers through there through the experience is carefully curated and crafted and it's a key ingredient in the way that idea needs to establish itself moving forward what's in a name so with a meeting aighty for IT engineers in organizations and they've just got some free t-shirt so they're very happy and I've covered the name of the tool that they're using it would have been able to see what they are using because they kind of try to evangelize it in their organization but their job is to implement all's to enable their dev ops teams to be even leaner and I think that one of the things to be careful of is that we CIT variety is an overall integrated operating model not just specifically tooling for application teams or development teams that it goes all the way back from you know into enterprise architecture and the way that we create views and the we can communicate those views to policies and there are some areas of influence that these people that we've been meeting don't necessarily have direct influence over they do have influenced very strongly over you know whether it's automated build components or where test tools or you know automation engines that there could be a risk that I tea party could start getting shoehorned and I think it's really important that we're clear on the entire scope of what standards trying to communicate rather than just kind of picking off kind of key areas and what we see as well is that within the itm within IT organizations that are let's say more traditionally siloed there's an opportunity to use IT for IT as a catalyst to move towards more integrated I to the operating model so there's obviously lots of like surprises are on their journey to implement and clouds and we see the infrastructure organizations are kind of assuming the role of implementing cloud because it makes logical sense to move up the stack and it what where we see there's a there's a kind of an opportunity and also a risk is in in the space in the middle where the IT organization should be there could be less a considered a deviation of mandate or kind of people starting to step into other to each other's play so for instance if you were to I know this is a vendor agnostic as a standard but if we look at capabilities rather in the marketplace today there are some capabilities which would automate much of the detector correct himself with self-healing capability that would automate and remove the need to provide all of this in a comic a debilitating provided about the whole development and continuous delivery pipeline integration pipeline as standard and I think that is so the the people that we saw on the other page potentially you know it's concerning because it kind of do the values what they're doing currently so there's going to be a gap and a space and a conversation that needs to be had where when mandate is discussed and this is a really good standard for and framework for actually having benchmarking and having a conversation about what does our future IT organization need to look like and how do we how do we transition to that in a way that is most cost-effective and where everyone is able to kind of find out their role we know that this is a process agnostic standard agility is a key system goal and I want to just speak to the agility kind of aspect that one of the key bills and agility is that you can cycle through your value stream as quickly as possible so that if one day zero sum comes to you with a request that how quickly can you get that request and actually deploy it into a production like environment so I've seen software companies or capabilities where line of business say I'd like to build an application and it can literally be deployed the next day in an environment into fully integrated with sitting in an abstraction layer what we shouldn't be doing is modeling our organizational structure based on the value streams because what it will do is discouraged agility and lean ways of working what we should be more to do is to say how do we organize ourselves in a way that enables us to cycle as quickly as possible and have recursive loops the actual life cycle status sometimes of the of a service could be considered an orthogonal concern in the sense that you could take an idea and prototype it pilot it and get it into a production like environment very quickly and then mature mature amateur and then so the teams that you set up to do that should be shouldn't be model directly on the detector correct so speaking of which where's my MVP so modeling and one of the in the standard we've got the valley stream diagrams which are effectively sort of cross-functional capability views where the different parts of the model come together and show how they interact I've highlighted the bill component which potentially could come in what's nice about this view is that it's showing that when you're designing a service in getting it out there you really need to be considering the commercial aspect at the same time as the design aspect as well as the sort of the technical the technical and feasible considerations and I think that that's a really important concept that all three should be coming together at the same time such that services that get built a desirable and feasible and viable as well and what's important is that the the models are tuned dependent upon the type of service that's coming in so if there's if there's a service that we need to be building and that we want to build that it's got a very you know a kind of heavy UI component tree to it so whether that's a a tool that a developing community is going to use then we might want to start by understanding what do that from a desirable perspective of how do our application engineers want to be consuming what do they want from the services and then maybe start looking at the same time as a as the technical and the feasible feasibility aspects what we do often city is the desirability or usability can be can be foregone sometimes and and a secondary thought and it's really important that the structure of the when you're assessing concepts and coming up with with conceptual models for the service blueprints that we consider those three dimensions so there are probably some new skills that we see needed and this is kind of a quote from from Gordon Ramsay which is kind of a little bit well Gordon Ramsay ish I guess and it's really talking about the experience of the around around the core product the stake when we meet IT professionals that are wanting to work in an IT environment one of their key to frustrations is that they're unable to do their jobs in a way that they might be able to if they kind of as well as they would is on the way on the train home ok so the experience that they they used to of freedom of flexibility of control or using the great tools and playing around with great tools in a controlled enterprise environment is in a lockdown environment well that doesn't mean to say that you know how to sew that one of the questions is how do we how do we control and implement an enterprise level and optionality and governance and at the same time still make people feel comfortable and give them give them flexibility and one of the great things that can be done is by really bringing experience design into the four and we're trying to understand and design for the for the users so that we're enabling them with the best possibility to build the services that that are going to enable with the business value and for that new mindsets and skill sets are needed to actually deliver those those experiences what we've we've covered so just some concluding observations experience in value orientations everything and it drives motivation inside the system and also back into the business and gives confidence to to the business be clear about the entire scope of IT for IT is about providing the tools but it's it's broader than just design and build use it as a catalyst to build an integrated IT operating model that is fit for purpose in in in both modes
