 hey is he gave I'm here with Fox from glow sands and they've created really cool demo here basically well Santa's a IOT service that helps you collect your data and from your devices and they've put together a pretty cool device right here so Fox winning in the what about the company and about this kind of cool detachment plant so those same what we do is we're in iot cloud platform and to demo this we created something what our customers will create this is a smart factory so here we have two stations in vibration station and a UV light station so in this demo what we're doing is we're creating plastic balls but ignore the fact that the balls are extra metal we have to Arduino 101 this Arduino is actually measuring the vibration of this state has an onboard accelerometer and there's another one over here with the photocell resistor that's measuring the life and what's going on here is that these two are connected to the Intel tool via bluetooth and this jewel is served at the gateway to our platform and what's happening is every couple of times a second and sending it to low same as you can see here in this debug output so at this point now we're gathering all this data so we can start to make sense of it so now we can have a cool dashboard to show status and visually see a history of what's going on and then on the other end we can take a look at our workflow engine so now we can react to this data now we can say all right you know what let's make certain things happen once we get certain payload so just as an overall now with a stem factory now we can have it smart connected and actually react to data and make ourselves more productive very cool and I noticed you got rid of some huge school it was no Prentiss and container or surveillance or some sort of container technology going on in there oh yeah so like every workflow itself runs in like in its own independent environment is very secure this work for example we're actually doing here is that rankin something additions to make sure things were right and is actually powering this alexa excellence and how's the factory doing here is your factory status UV output is lower than expected vibration levels are within tolerance haha yes so you're connected to and from exactly the we can provide direct communication data from the device muscles in there select stop cracker if we needed to the bus is late agrees offline very cool well thank you very much for sharing and we'll see you next time on babe you're awesome
