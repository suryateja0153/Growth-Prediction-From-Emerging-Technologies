 today we're talking to one of our Clips IOT day as speakers day & boos knock from from Red Hat just as a reminder where we're having another Eclipse IOT day at on october 25th in ludwigsburg germany just outside of stuttgart as part of the ecliptic on europe and conference so it's going to be a great dad time and dan welcome and when we start out can you just introduce yourself and can you roll a red hat well thank you so I'm a senior software engineer at Redgate I've been in open source for a long time basically in in open source messaging in integration space for a quite quite quite some time and recently you know as we see more and more messaging use cases going toward e io ti I kind of drifted toward the IOT space I'm a relatively new member of the cliffs IOT community but I'm excited for all the projects that they're yeah I import yeah for sure in red hats actually been been a very active member in the clarity community I'm starting with with cure and and and ha no but so it's great to have you on the team from Red Hat and in that and the clips IOT day you're you're going to be talking about some of the projects and initiatives around our i OT cloud platform so can you can you can just give it more insight about what you're going to be talking about and and why why's this is important yes so we will be talking about two projects so eclipse hollow and eclipse Kapoor that we are doing as a part of this iety beckoned initiative so both of these projects are very you in India you could be eight incubation period still but I in my opinion they will provide a basis for up for creating open source I have to plot for a platform which which is something that that that's that's needed yeah for sure in so it may be a bit more detail cam from a messaging perspective why why is kapoor and hanno going to be like with the requirement which they need that they're not revealing for for IOT yeah so so mostly now people are connecting their IOT devices to some kind of the messaging infrastructure and and usually that's you know a one broker or or you know something like that and a broker is a broker is a one machine can scale up up to some point and we can see in the arrow to use cases that did you know scalability will soon be much bigger than than what can be supported with this kind of thing so for debt we need a scalable messaging solution and that's that's the goal that that horn of tries tries to address but it's not just to provide a scalable general messaging solution but we want to provide a basically messaging solution for for IOT specific use cases so tailored so to say message scalable messaging infrastructure for for for variety and then when we have that then we when we have our device is connected to to the messaging thing I mean the job is not really really done yet because we need a lot of services on the back and size that can help us to manage all this new infrastructure that we have so services like device management and registration security all the things that application developers should and shouldn't worry about and that's that's the scope of eclipse Kapoor project so together you know horo and in Kapoor and in combination I think we will provide everything that we will need to do to care as a as a infrastructure for IOT platform so then we can hear developers focusing only using this platform in writing the business logic in an application there right Inge and so how would like so so if we have an IOT cloud platform how does this fit in with something like open shift or crew benetti's or or cloud foundry we're like those are kinda some of the dominant pies open source pass out there so how does it fit in with those yeah so it fits perfectly because what we're trying to do now is we you know just starting so so having it clouds read it basically is one of the primary primary goals for these projects so everything will be darker eyes and containerized so that it can be easily deployed in any of the you know 12 platform so weapon shift well Padre but ever ever you you can run those containers you will be able to to do so so that's the one of the main objectives for these projects from the start very interesting now it's it's it's it's definitely a great great inertia that we've got going I think I'm traditionally the clip zarate communities been on on the edge like I'm at the gateway going out to the devices and I really see that that kinda connecting to and having an open source IOT platform is going to be important part of of a complete open source IT solution and so it's great to see so is this gonna be your first Eclipse con Europe and Eclipse IOT day or if you've been to yes yes well my first one I've been to other conferences but yeah this first eclipse great LeBron looking forward to meeting you and and I hope you're going to be there so so we have on the Monday is what we call the the Eclipse IOT working group which is more focused on current project updates and collaboration topics so it's very technical and then Tuesday it's the sessions of the cuts our t-day would which is more of a traditional kind of 35 minute sessions where the ends and speaking so so it'll be a lots of IOT and I think it's one of the things I like about the clarity dick community is is that some of the kind of leading technologies around IOT or get together and and I think it's a really good learning experience and networking experience definitely I'm also very excited about all these projects and you know my wall in so far and people that they met in this project in these communities it's really really promising great okay well I will look for it to me seeing you again in about three weeks take care thank you again
