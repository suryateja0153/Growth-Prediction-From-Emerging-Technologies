 hi everyone my name is ibrahim al ghamdi today I will talk about the IOT platform here is the agenda I will start up with the overview and background a type of platforms and the hype cycle the risk of IT bulk platform potential obstacles opportunities testing and validation first of all I will set up with our view and background the internet of things iot is an ecosystem or sensor devices and equipment are connected to a network and can transmit and receive data fort for tracking analyzes and action the IOT platform shall provide support throughout all the lifecycle phases of the IOT applications and services cloud-based an IOT application platform is a solution that lives in the cloud meaning it exists virtually somewhere on the internet connected a common theme of the industry IOT application platform center on connectivity as the world continue to see an ever-increasing number of devices connected to the Internet and each other I see application platforms bro fight a common link between those devices and their data driven by data a kinetic device is only as useful as the data it profiles I see application platforms harness the power of cloud connectivity to take device data points and translate it into a mean fold information there are more than 300 IOT platforms in the market today and the number is continuing to grow as you see here I found 12 of dell 380 platforms now I will talk about that types of platforms there are four there are four other types of platforms that are often referred to as I UT platforms the first type is connectivity m2m platforms these platforms for Kazmir Lee on the conductivity of connected IOT devices via telecommunication networks the second type is I a a s back-end infrastructure as a service begins profile hosting space and purchasing power of four applications and services the third type is hardware specific software platforms some company that self connected devices have built their own proprietary software back end they like to refer the buttons as an IOT platform since the platform is not open to anyone else on the market it's debatable with our own Widow one short collate and IT platforms an example is global nest the last types the last type is consumer enterprise software extensions existing enterprise software packages and operating systems such as Microsoft Windows 10 are increasingly allowing the integration of IOT devices here is the Cardinals 2015 cycled hype cycle this tips of these life cycles are technology trigger big of a flighted expect expect expectations from of the basement slope of enlightenment and little of productivity or the risk in IOT platform measure risk fall in this area first security and data governance diversity of niche providers and solutions confusing on where to get value roi data and analyst Anna analyze analytics complexity block of data protocol standards potential obstacles complexity complexity is the greatest challenge challenge we are talking about even bigger beta Delta here click data here which could be overly security and privacy would play on of internet-connected devices it will be challenging to keep all the data flowing between and among device is totally secure her stash the cha charge for the projected growth of IOT sensor deployment by Financial Services category with it with the deployment of 25 billion new endpoints there will be opportunities for all industries including banking the delight analysis suggests that as many one water of sensor the blind in 2013 could be of use to fci raising to one-third in 2015 and then to about fifty percent by 2020 overall the growth in sensor deployments for financial services is expected to be very strong ranging from just over 20 person to one hundred percent annually when a compounded basis depending on the sector link and validation viewpoints you want viewpoints of different players of the IOT platform ecosystem including device vendors application developers provides of platform and related services and the end user to evaluate the limitation of the current I will be platform here are the references thank you so much
