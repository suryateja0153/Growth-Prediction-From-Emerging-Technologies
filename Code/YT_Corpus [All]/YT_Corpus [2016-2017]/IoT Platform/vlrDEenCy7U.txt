 okay so welcome powerweb day we're starting our screencast for tonight's talk on Omega which is I have tea board like I'm still these guys this is something that started on Kickstarter like over a year ago I thought it looked cool when I saw how small was and like somehow there was pure in there pretending raspberry I've been around for a while the deal bit of onion they've really they're kind of like how they're almost like the apple of the IOT world like they've got branding that's consistent they've got like platforms and in some cases it's probably a little less flexible than what you can do the Raspberry Pi you don't really have to worry about your operating system and making sure you're getting right you know dedi an image onto your SD card and holding you know crossing your fingers making sure you know it works right you pretty much get water / firmware they have and firmer just gets updated there's no real life management anything lower than that which is great for me because I as a software developer you know I love this kind of this platform annually designed for software developers you know I'm interested in the stuff up to the point of my soldering like I'm not pay I don't nothing against it I think it is cool I don't know how to do it we want to get their women right right and so this I'm just interested in other parts of the stack yeah nobody i mop it up right yeah you stop at the physical is right okay and that's what's great about this is this platform though may is in design for software developers and so everything about it is with kind of software developers in mind so I'm just going to go through a little bit of it so I've got booted up you guys can see super small so I've got the board itself attached to the mini doc that's quite a bit long yeah I'm like rice picturing like this thing's huge and so with a mini doc I wish my garage hands like you can't see that I broke the switch on it is so small like it is like miniscule and there's like a little mouse which you can toggle on and off it broke and so now it just comes on I was able to use a needle to to toggle it on and now it's just on whenever I plug and so there you go yeah I've rubber-banded it on here because it wasn't like you know always staying together it's a just occasionally fall that awkward stance kind of bad you know so it's like a real computer yeah I don't reckon head and so it's or is that made off of this bug into that provides power and obviously knowing the video can see what I'm talking about but it has one of us beat war so yeah and there's like a little toggle switch and there's a really small LED light on here you can see it's kind of amber right now we can kind of control like if this demo that I was running on goes well we could actually control the color of that light with PHP so that's pretty exciting but that's kind of the goal of that what just came in today on my way over and you can kind of see how this is like I say this is like more the apple style like the whole presentation as soon as you get the box at what is likely this is very different than buying raspberry raspberry pop you know it's there's actually a market for people selling the referee pie with a kit right like this you want the case reality is up you need to actually use it right what's the charge more so this is up just in the mail like I'm this is like an unboxing here this is the this is a full-size dock or the change in dock instead it is um the V Omega would rest in here just like on the mini doc but you get exposure to all the GPIO pins here and it has a good stuff online and on the cal that works and the switches the switch is about the same size of a little break it but you got you know usually power and then one USB port so is it the same bored you brought up to get yeah let me carry really I back out right on never really doing anything look at your show because fish grease and wat gotta show these things were wanting to kind of play this at the maker pair yeah actually can have it maybe get a little bit further along in a project I figure if I'm there all day I should be able to do something cool with it I'm pretty up jumpers and stuff that we correctly and so this is the olee extension and so I don't even really know the visitors yeah he fits into the dock and even if we look at the concert when he pulled the caco we can talk a little bit about it too whenever you get your omega on Wi-Fi or get online with it you could actually you know you cereal into it or you can just connect it to the Wi-Fi let me go back to the main console so it's Tennessee it's kind of like app launcher I just feel like it's a very you know it's a lot more polished environment than what you would get out of the box for the Raspberry Pi the whole platform is sort of here ready to go and they actually have olee control it's not going to find it this is I'm gonna plug up to now which you can like send an image to your olev I mean it's like that easy so Morris in text or whatever just lay on really so I we may be here swish swish oxen write that stuff so I never tried to just got another box look her son what's the resolution on that you know Noah yeah but I don't know you look as well as too good by 2025 it's not just like an LCD yeah so multicolored yeah it's kyle its color with the zoo multicolor so it's red hope you love it Rick uh-oh shows it a little like it's like a starter video on youtube channel and it's kind of going over this section set one heat and see again there's some cool status information right yeah you can see is a journey for debaters appears process here there's make some memories if she makes flash memory you see how much of that is being utilized the store computer here the uptime the Wi-Fi stuff so again that's all just kind of get that out of box if you have a but can you can hook that up if you want to jump on the terminal from right here that's it's just that easy you can also ssh to it so so what is it right like go down with Alex yeah it's money ah I don't know really what it is far it's based on like I say this gets you have oh it's open wrt so good they update the firmware and we'll update you know open the verity year and the other stuff you don't really like that's the one manager with raspberry pocketed to do some like real like low-level Carl's sup or you might need a different distribution for some reason if you need something a little different uses what's abilities but let's holes it's opening up these little tabs down here so I can just kind of look around and skiing for our bus it's a pretty cool robot II it's that posted on your machiners that on the board yes that's coming from the board itself and Ella something I learned this weekend I'm of how the resolutions like there but like I didn't like I was like so bug out like how is it making a name that's resolvable that isn't in Dina's okay so I learned about multicast DNS like I never get news like how Bonjour works or what I've got figure out how that works because you just type in the name once it's on your Wi-Fi you can sort of um let's see 15-0 compra whatever uh was it I'm just staring out this big oh sorry I didn't know if you contribute what's this I haven't played this editor too much yet but it's kind of cool it's like you can edit your entire file system through this one browser so you can start like drag-and-drop problem too I'm gonna that you knew and see what saying about her this is your so much rooms yeah you just look handle it okay you just ride so people are getting these and do custom applications and maybe putting them in their own enclosures deck anything that's what people do call those Paul microcontrollers is just probably another one of those mm-hmm that's cool so there's a whole market for those a treasure trove I'm here you could get waterproof stuff oh yeah that's cool Tim of rodnik suddenly seems okay and his son built a underwater scavenging thing raspberry PI's what so like brushless motors water perfect closure and just like go like an RC controlled thing that goes in scans the bottom of the lake yeah shes lonely kind of a cool idea yeah do you know what the licensing is on this thing if you were to put this into a product we sell it hi that's a really good question it depends on the distribution why does some of them are you know you know they've got different open-source licenses that it known as long as you include different parts different things with your product as far as you know if you use this anybody can hack it and do whatever they want to with it you can't lock it down stuff like that dry I can't remember what I was I was kind of thinking about that and like what it would be like uses to prototype an actual product I think that this would that you get pretty far with that you know in prototyping I think we're going to master do something you probably didn't go and just yeah I didn't know there's there's there's always kind of room for kind of in the middle right where you want to produce these and sell them but not necessarily on a large scale and I was working with a buddy on a project group trying to do this some Wi-Fi enabled music player okay and the you know you can build your own parts for a masters and it's a lot cheaper but the problem is getting through all of the you know the FCC license in all of the regulations around those things if you use devices like this they've already been licensed so you know all of the you know as far as the you know the wireless capabilities anyway that you don't have to have it retested if you're just bundling it yeah another thing right which makes it a lot easier the only issue that we ran into is using certain things was the licensing is that you know you can only use it for certain things or bundle it with a kit you know making it's already in the enclosure then you know you know I don't know there's there was other things like that it'd be interesting because you can you can build things with these things and sell yeah you could certainly build on Eden create expansions in okay throw a throw a mega in here and you've got a thing you know yeah I'm you cold moon like if you could distribute these as part of your product so kind of some things you can look at me haga rare disease twirls our website like that I've just been poking around their website I'm going on see this says the whole project from Harvard's system software to an APA compatible version in the end I will be released as open source materials so I'm sure as long as you include the part of the open source license with the distribution should be fine yeah I guess it depends on the license because some of whom were more yeah it was like you know it's no commercial or you can't have classroom this was something I was wanting to try to set up for today if I had but I couldn't find a USB sound card especially kind of they have here where it's a pretty you know generic cheap one that doesn't require you know real sophisticated drivers because there is no there's no onboard sound control around here even with the dock so but they're showing the dental here's to make a like an airplay receiver and so you can go through the steps okay the time required is 10 minutes I didn't have was USB audio sound card so I bet you know just like you can do thee and this I was looking for a project that would be that would work with amitabh what can I do you have no other exciting heaven art is there anything cool what you just the mini doc and this kind of struck me as kind of interesting is known everything you can do it sitting on a linux box but the fact that it works on the omega and kind of tested my mystical this video today i think it was just this nice little first so I feel pretty good luck we could go through these steps and it would work and then you can see it shows in your iphone you can customize what that says that your omega could become like an airplane destination and you could marry her I thought audio or whatever kid just you know that would kind of gimmicky for here but I mean I can see lots of you know that could be a really cool application for I places like handing like a pineco we always were always like looking for different ways to use devices that people already have in kind of unique ways so you know there might be a use case of that but it's pretty simple you just download this one product and figure in you can show you how to get everything working on intrepid Lois would be like generic engineer Apple murders here push the spin-off DLNA oh right I think your stenographer criteria version deal um why I thought we can go through and we have this is like seven o'clock now so we probably have him to try it sorry she's rolling around as a talkative man routeros just resisting with till a is there no shuttlepod willing to kind of bum me out is there not like mine go get it working but like nodes not available out of box because I decent like this i'm probably do note or just you know i'd only know python all I don't know peach PS i know he's on yeah and so if you guys think this would be cool we could go through and a moment tutorial we can we can set of PHP and we can actually control the little Ellie like on here what so I'm trying to figure out how this would work in the physical world like you said something that do we like to open your garage door remember i'm assuming that you can control those pins three ever yeah so that would be technically showy devices and they were just eating like stage and slot and just like you would sitting you know a signals of town why exactly single to rotate arm so something that has like home automation ordem implications absolutely is that stuff already crowded act so it is awesome but I mean I like we're in the open source world it seems like you could get some pretty innovative stuff it's not as a pretty terribly expensive yeah I think there's a lot of home automation stuff that's already out there they're made for non-technical right all right right so the problem is I mean especially if you like you know for instance let's say something like pongo where if you know let's say you know you got a lot of gigs need opener you want to control access with doorways in something you can buy those things right but if you have the technical know how you can build it and integrate it into whatever technical solution you have like there's an app that all the staff has they want to add you know button to open you know gates well there's not a you there may not be an obvious way to integrate that with some off-the-shelf automation resistant but with something like this it's literally a web application so you can if you've got access to a network and you can send requests and you can make anything happen if you have no I think it just depends on the use case and liability so if any of those specific analyze type applications earth you don't want just anyone having big actually if you don't want to come there and then maybe you should think about this enjoyed watching the solution little bit as far as home automation reals there's definitely the non-technical IOT devices like nest like readiness which is but those four wires keep on says exactly Fort Knox didn't close until you can get watching for that but I mean it's relying upon the service yep and ness is having a lot of financial troubles possible weeks of employer slated to die at some point so because it's not anything I nest that service cuts off you just have a useless Young is that fancy looking unusable device these are more build your own roll your own thing definitely more than maker yeah sure babe however if you mentioned it but these we dealt but i can only none did you owe me yeah that's just that just you know and you have to get a big accessory the mainboard out prices are just drop it yeah yeah the expansion boards are the ethernet expansions 15 the OLED is 1599 there's a GPE gps expansion for 15 bucks all the expansions are this is ramesh you're talking the wireless look into the netbook I think it's got built-in why yeah it's got built in Wi-Fi so you have that so yeah is your relay expansion to know how things you can shop and see that in the back its cuz their seventh straight okay so obviously it really good like package system that's kind of say so you're just installing the PHP package on the distribution of the things well and I Louise students that I don't like worked on this why how much storage is there like says 6616 big squash he makes it much shows my landscape at this point I would believe either one oh yeah 16 matches in LA that's funny there's more it has more ram that it does storage that is interesting that's super interesting so but you can you can hook up like a USB story I may have to yeah you pretty small with that it is a little slice the flesh oh you can would that require soldering I don't see that sets really don't have expansion for that for ya buddy I'm SD card some can see us beta i meant to click on that and she goes ack usb3 go get right ethernet cheeky else yeah great up not question there's a note that they did i know you just further expansion I think you can connect Arduino boards production sure they have a disease or you know I'm sure that it like I made it microsd years younger dr. experiences and accessories this is exactly why I said variable breadboard finish is not don't limit people directory pi because there's other cool little device like this just different solutions from different people is that only as expendable cuz this I'm a bigger my sergeant raspberry PI's men tremble you get their stuff shields for everything you know about that because you get a lot of stuff that the pie it seems like for food ebooks yeah where you could easily racket this is in case yeah some money and be similar but you got the same it's a much lies the 300s this it's a what that's a hard one yep probably tickets oh yeah doesn't matter cuz it's get the RCA bigger pot too about the same thought Percy a so is this like an aftermarket thing or is this come look at you by the horde I like to discover the one I've used was the spark core which i think is I mean it's like practically obsolete now this is way more powerful step 3 bedroom in a smart court you didn't have any like OS access right basically you're you can code it a bunch of different languages but they did we you have to send it to their server this day would compile it to whatever their but I was that you binaries on yeah but but they would you use their service so you could use a bunch of different things that we compile it down into whatever you want is in the original it basically it's like screw this yeah and there's some sort out your that's like too much that is fun because it's how you run them oh yes there are okay and so it's kind of like what some kinds of when we talked enough this work its foot it's a monk OST yeah what's up yeah I guess they're providing cloud for give me a lot here in positive get you reprobate without whereas a selfie be showing up to infinity that's for America cool so mean okay so he's literally it goes small every 0 because it's like I never heard you use a microwave no um it's only five dollars there's nothing you can use it I'd like fun little band I start oceanic alumnus existence amazed all the cool under saloons embedded devices to use that empty honey up there any recommendations for just profited cool chinese to subscribe to ya SDI isn't it oh yeah as Ned bash as a sure where pokemon sorry is there a good people should record now the long term occurrence is there a good blog for some sort of website they just keeps up with every sort of embedded you know I I am roof once I don't know about there's probably a time there's one recipe Richard pine nut allergies got a pretty good blog station buddies renders body and they've got a article today on aquaponics which is exactly those oh yes yeah i'm gonna try to use the clock as you're building pairs as a pleasure enough or diamonds but that's though file better yeah so sing an indemnity I just a male waters and Bucky cheap exactly little one that's exactly what I want to do what did it go Trish this is Zanda I wonder if it the on your while you're installing PHP or one of the server that's running this web app is now okay nope this is PHP your language of choice jobs jobs or should I you some easy work Google comes if you get to them before they say it's off PHP info and then do the just call a PHP invoke those instead of watch Apple watch he loved it I guess the file navigation you might have it earlier them yeah I have one what's the Apple watch team let's see hear any rumors on that that's my point is having a baton to do this that that kills in your name I want to just know it's down at well evening it doesn't no weight or awaken until you actually have to trigger it some elk declines get out of these lawyers man look I'm sorry he goes in hey watch sure it's just a on it's just one of the nice things about a watches you can we just ship it snow right it's a premium so if you look down at black screen it's not very helpful hey everyone I want to draw attention yeah so it's a no yeah if you just like Edwards like first challenge not exactly who tons but if you tap on it or something like you can eat well that's that's not too bad if you is just a nice little tap but nice little bad luck but you were you angry I think we're close guys sweet look at that pretty bad yes so then we're running PHP but then there are some other things that you have to have in order to let me know yeah make things yes the next step was trying to get it to do the only thing I can do on here which is just kind of talk about led I think you change the color or something so you're the libraries that you have to you know okay maybe give my permission dropping this okay this program like you going to it doesn't add doesn't get this oh that's cuz buddy is being can you just put into it yeah right that's like patty I actually power years old and nobody's really damn ignore that it's still there okay so download some peaches so it's just like a little kind of getting to know you app yeah show-offs of the features right like I was trying to find something to they didn't have visitation for the carpets whatever you just need I know you go see some fun yeah that's cool yeah I've been impressed with so sorry this is really feature rich for your hand just because I have done a pitchman for the pod that it was a struggling and getting your SD card you know and you get unique SD cards pre you know set up with the Korean with whatever distribution you want and you want to change something representing I worked on the project for a while with raspberry pi just pull novelty but I had the old BTW 420 don't remove that i wanted to go down and get working but i like Kevin red fruit looks like there's some cool applications and monochrome looks like basically satis type screens or something and the meteors Justin turtles are pretty cool to have a really great scroll characteristics and you're like working on getting this nice looking saudia yeah I'm getting order whatever right and so I had working how to cook up at that raspberry pi or that one and it was pretty good basically just a serial term roll onto the pot and then I was my home I've gotten sorry you didn't like use it to like exude cool stuff i'm here with draw graphs of our registration members and stuff i just used up for ponca different pen think that pressure house for people that you skating zenith said that the only I've really done with it so far what do you envision do me yeah there it is curious what your use cases are here we going to try to the maker faire yeah we didn't make anything I can get I'm just excited I've got a big my collection of sensors and things I'm shivering them and we can play them yeah hold it just like I would make the car yeah I do the farm right there okay i'll just do the font the aquaponics hydroponic yes can you talk about that yeah was really what do you play tales I'm I got nothing so I'm trying to use microcontrollers the ideas he's microcontrollers to automate gardening automate like herb gardening for gardening like watering and fertilizing water and fertilizing changing light levels adjusting temperatures vacuuming and this would be indoors kagney or really highly controlled yeah the oven you're going to go grow pot in your basement no I don't have a basement don't ever joke that if you ever go into a hydroponic store oh no ever because camera here day thing you're under a lot of scream good joke it's becoming less and less solo good Thursday but use the record pi to monitor measure monitor and kind of create some sort of oh cuz you can put on tiffa graphing on the hydro probes to see your moisture yep yep this idiom like oh it's not orchid what not I don't know done more water and then sounds like a datacenter application to you can create something pretty good moisturizer to graph it out in measure just okay obviously she wasn't any good here over the orange door door locks on top that the expand jet they are on your page based on my simple ideas and then maybe we need to switch dogs make a controllable or tower through solar so it's just strictly just a power pretty cool the idea is to get like a compactor nothing unit that you can send to third world countries where they can just develop there's a cure I got another develop a small containers that can be sent to developing nations where they can build a micro farm sorry I'm working on now yeah I've been working again PVC pipes and stop their account not they want their world countries but project don't say joint one I remember now what it was I wanted to I'm very sore I wanted like some reflective material for photography I was gonna build a reef lane and that's all I wanted ha ha then you must pay with us I'm like as is there right oh yeah cannabis is a real thing these days really canon culture just record on your son are we recording now oh hey and it is the FBI's Wi-Fi you know I guess that would be good they don't care if it was the 80s with Wi-Fi right right so you think that they've got together that is just a power indicator I'm here soon as you know it's not actually the ones i see some some little pieces on here that are about the what's the same side he has a code because it might visit it you have the code to change the LED that's why i was gonna go i'm gonna try it on the stock and see because it's parties currently yeah it is icy somewhat look like you see sizes if you let me use our coding program arbitrated was ok but on this is how do we know and yes I see because I still be using our leader the answer is Ivana its youth yeah and like robotics clubs and there is Saturday if every pretty that's yeah I would love to do some robotics like bring the kids out here shops mattered and I know things hose interesting problems and give kids the tools and teach them how to use them and then see what they come up with you know like here's a bunch of parts and microcontrollers that's why I think things like this are awesome if you have to worry about tethering or age you know you can literally build an interface in a web app that's edible and you know drive some servos you know builds macomb closures and think okay you gotta build something that can get from point A to point B or whatever and just see what people come up with right you know or you know I don't have data on they would be zero just seems like every pictures you could have kids coming into this thing with no little no computer programming knowledge and then come out with it with a whole new appreciation you can make things in the physical world happen so it's not true soluble not just I can make web pages right which is nothing that's cool but there's just there's a limited interest level with some people when you take a look you can actually make something that's going to Jess something what you wrote everybody saw is what was that big hero 6 whatever you know robots awesome everybody loves that stuff and the tools are out there now to you know do a little different than like then I don't know what coldwell doesn't need to keep up with a viable way to put my wife to tell me what they do they're supposed to meet him or know you better than I am for now be careful man right VI back the bat better this is a really cool device my brother no get hot too easy I wonder if that's it for me oh you don't walk again up the rhetoric I your ship to jail you know you got a pen I can imagine easily in involution there we go see he doing I bet that's the Le needed you can overclock those who the ugh yeah we should look at you sink a little do its neck shoulder sometimes it was coughing firm it out when that goes salt is good enough sorry I knew how to kita yeah what is the process is that like the arm SOC yeah it's like instead of beers for no games okay in MIPS yeah okay well it's technically it's just let me go on the left side go it's technically system-on-chip you know it's get the whole stack market began we did he run if you're running linux on these things to get more than just go out or do we know right right on who that's just the bare processor and you just right to it oh we got a solid he's gonna happen see me i'll show you that much yeah lots okay so we're back home you don't know hot hot plug be so no touchies be sizable linkage yeah what did you do you swap that out he's got this little dock that it's plugged into that has some additional I'll in there and one of them is a pretty bright LED and we think that what we thought was the belly d that we can blink is actually just a like a hardwired power indicator that we can actually do anything with request very very slowly probably if it works I'll share anything else you know that seems off mr. blinky we could go through phc so it's sending a request it's not yeah bleeding right yeah look at the code for the buttons she was trying to do in the background on here yeah see if you can see the code on the book this is it you make sure these people know same with the little putting the button it is the button acting like a little trip I mean it's have to be sending HTTP repulsive image look here it's just call me ash different pages Tommy Glavine is the inside of a head so she'll do baby RGB LED work spawn use the expanded doc I'm guessing and your page would look like this you ready to keep doing more to get to you may be just as the RGB doesn't equal rights in the little o Go Go threat okay something happened but again it was right again it's just read all didn't make the other color just get RGB on to your head ring one point yet wait does not work alright so it sounds like it's trying to PHP is trying to interact with the system so L yeah it's it's probably calling some weird PHP library that's like writing that pin and deleted you know what I want any promises working so far was that one time to your level I've you know Jesus II really figure out that what that was calling in using the library switching from a photographer's standpoint you could make all sorts of weird rule I'm think still trying to yeah yeah yes it would be nice to be able to you know for many lights from your phone sort of having to have a you know somebody be like hey there are things in already there i know but that's not what this is about this isn't let's talk about all the things we can buy that work out a box this is happy we rigged up crap ourselves and through the innovation and through those innovations you create means things new possibilities I have Philips hue lights and they're not open right the G so with the they are oh okay so you can like program yeah okay with the phila to you can't I think there's an AP act as a huge stuff there is because I know there's that weird Apted I have a tribe of all things that are put enough here's the techno Gianna's lighter after um when I speak boxing movie is I might have done that much work i mighta beat box once about like Chris interesting sorry message there's the set RGB LED Alex let's be in college right gpio that's what is the jeep and point your home to change the color value equals x are you colored public illusion value equals off that's a lie that just seems looking for stirring off okay so you can do the color what are we doing here is I'm sure right library something guys ya dig me the excellent with red color heating on 0 x value for he already knows somebody no no screen just hey that's great how r GG that's what unlock the ibis I mess up more code with di like I think it's absolutely yeah I am I got me a VI book for my birthday it's like this thing like this is the middle but it's crazy start the Emacs vs by Wars again do that thing now if you really I use nano so you can get into the tabs versus spaces debate and then the two spaces versus force base in today that's what always gets my team you owned it I mean there is a right answer so this is what the role of IMT this unexpected to have never ended what I'm doing right here Rosen ya roll your own I think it's smooth well this isn't exactly set up you're not in operational mode right yeah yeah so like inspire you going to get me play program but it would be cool though if they had kind of a virtualized version of that we reckon throw greatly amana idea and illiterate again any more later the headless on pies and then push it it's right okay what was ok but what you were showing a little longer than selling a virtual inspires just it's just the application running from house anyways you guys know but then you know they sufficient money bolt on ivory okay for asking which doesn't work I like my rash ppl easy to do retro pop I got 32 gig SD card just loaded with in wrong play just as you dance do you do that from a pond sweet I had a bunch of dreamcast games it's like horizontal Python you will play for you cast supposedly little hyper podria there we go cuz you gotta get the full cover small I got to do it like water waiting yeah I get the game boy on my last post here is it I got a 60 inch TV with like a Game Boy yes I hey I got a kiss or with that no I got street watching said rge the depot now you but it didn't is just more this isn't the right format so okay so this value equals off ok so that's yeah then shall we got you to this else thing where the est le D no dude there's like a so whatever you put in is running this command punkin on CL i exp led maybe XD le yeah commotion on that Madero yeah just see we can rough day huh if you know how I prefer baby just
