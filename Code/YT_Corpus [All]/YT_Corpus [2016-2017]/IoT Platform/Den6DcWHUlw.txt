 let me briefly take you to our PGCE your journey I'm not sure as to where are you with the PDC and what we do so so selectively we are almost a three-decade-old company we started off with the cat and then we mentioned it to be a lamb and and as as we went into the journey we realize that customers today are looking at things beyond a simple cat or PLM so so that's that's been our foray into into into what we call as Application Lifecycle Management and then into into IOT into service lifecycle management and end into augmented reality which is where we are correct so if you look at the entire journey we started off as a cat company today we've matured into into into an IOT and an augmented reality company and and that's what our customers are demanding from us because I mean we believe that you know PLM is not about products getting managed while it has in the in the factory or just after it comes out of the factory PLM actually has the entire lifecycle we're not the product even after it leaves the factory you should have some significance for for the company on how they're going to manage it and then that's been our foray into IOT so so if you'll get our journey you know and where customers are going you know they're wanting us to solve challenges for them beyond you know the product leaving the effector en and how do you manage the product even after it it leaves its its campus and that's that's how I OT as a concept was born so so if you look at our market space you know we are looking at extending PLM into into IOT and that's where we are filling up and gone are the days when people can conceptualize that it in and come out to the product / 02 years and you still have the market waiting for you and today the market is possibly gone and if you look at this to startup world you know you have an idea we need to be able to conceptualize it to end and come out with and market it at the very early as possible and that's how this this whole market is gene so that's how that's that was the concept with which this was this whole thing was born and into us readily deployability means you know helping customers of our customers so their customers a lot faster by using things like utilities so for example thing boxes are a platform and within the thing works platform we have something called as a thing about utilities you know which is basically some of the common things that that customers would need to to be able to deploy for example a smart connected device management right and when you talk about connected device management it support how you are able to you know get reports out of the the functioning of the urmen it's more of performance monitoring regimen I have a dashboard sorts which can in a throw up data which which you could look at it at any given point in time that could be one example of a utility which is which is quickly deployed I mean and this is something that every every customer who is in the in the verge of deploying IOT would be looking for there could be things like alert management vitamin and if this whole thing is about how am I getting alerted right now so so the thing as we call it the smart connected device is able to throw out an alert which you are able to capture and saying okay man i'm going to fail right over the next you know 12 days or 15 days and i'm going to favor part of my me is going to fail and how am i able to use that a lot to to make my decisions analytics and oak which is another key aspect right now no one way is to collect click the data what do you do with that data how are you going to use the data and that's the analytics capability so so we are able to come up with utilities for for some of these core aspects of what what you would need to be successful I deployed company we are coming out with those aspects and and that took purses readily deplorable IOT right you know make it make it a lot faster make it a lot easier for customers to be able to adopt to to a particular platform well thing works as a platform I know is an open and very flexible plan by that what I mean as a customer developers can use their existing tools so for example if if it ever / is using eclipse as the development platform that that he or she is working on today he or she can continue using eclipse for building IOT very apps on on our platform and that's something that thing works allows these customers to do so it's primarily a very open very flexible platform with these utilities you know you could easily integrate some of the existing applications that you have because today we can't expect customers to have a particular kind of applications within the organization and and if you are if you're connecting to the internet and when you are obviously going to be faced with a lot more concerns in terms of security in terms of being able to connect to different devices in terms of being able to use your existing cloud infrastructure and so on so forth and that's what thing works as a as a platform loves you to do and then that to us is is something which is a great boon for our developers because as I said earlier it's all about shrinking damn lines are to be able to come out with with ready apps so at any time when the market needs they're not at a time when you are ready so so that's that's the whole concept of which thing works and we opened it up to to a developer community for them to be able to easily use a platform to quickly come up with prototypes or or apps that ticket testing and roll out pretty quickly so today's students are tomorrow's industry leaders when and into us that's a that's a very very critical part of our market and what we are doing enough for example we said we're setting up series that at colleges and universities and that's to catch them young and to help them you know embrace so the new technology platforms that are that are there in the market and obviously you know some of the be aware leaders and the address space and so we we do have our own right under under the Sunnis as is one of the key technology player in the IOT space so we are we're enabling our student population to be able to capitalize on some of that for example recently we take a student hackathon at well or engineering college where we we got the students to to come and build apps and we it is it was a fun thing at the same time you know it it enables them to start thinking you know you know I know in a much bigger manner and a lot of these students are betting on us you know so so they go to build their their own apps they're going to come up with various business propositions my daughter for example you know he's in the 10th standard no she's already built a mobile app and and I know it's it's it's a program called we tag that that one of the corporates came up with the women empowerment in technology and they picked up you know students from different schools to be able to build their own app not just stay with building the apps but also being able to you know commercialize the app and come up with business plans and and so on so forth so so they're creating this side of grass root level you know in terms of helping students start thinking you know in a much bigger plane and we were students probably know we had only one and we should not become an engineer and take up a job and a good good form but today any things are things are much different so that's that's what we are looking at and and we will continue to to to embrace the student community to start doing innovative things with the student community on the on the other in the same way no we are also to expand that and do the pic operates you know that's ultimately the serious business users that power that we have and then we get thrown up with a lot of challenges from from these companies that that we are helping them to bridge over so it's a combination of both enterprise and and the student community it's it's dangerous to think about it right when in fact the other day I was it was just sitting at home and I was wondering what what kind of data does the internet possess what about my own self vitamin today things are so very open that you know right from you know the time you wake up to the time you go back to bed you know everything gets monitored know so you have a Fitbit you know which monitors what what your physical activity is and I'm and you have multitude of applications which which pretty much tracks your entire lifestyle so but one side it is it is alarmed at at the pace at which I OT is is growing in when we're talking about what 50 billion connected devices by 2020 and probably 200 billion that intermittent connected devices at any point in time you know so that's that's a awful lot of data that is that is out there what about you as an individual so so so to me this is this is all about how you could make use of the data or you could ensure that this data is not misused and so it's well it's alarming on one side notes it's extremely positive on the other side in terms of what we could do with that data so so so for example the other day a customer of ours no throw up this challenge of saying you know I want my diesel generator to to be out and then connected now that's as easy as a problem right but but if you if you look beneath the problem it is not as simple as what it looks you know you know getting a diesel generator out means you know you need to you need to first of all have sensors which which which can then talk to a back-end application and on which which then can analyze pull out the data is over you're talking about stuff you know hardware device which is a sense or you talk about connectivity you talking about data which is going to be out in the cloud and we talk about security and you need to be able to manage all of that so it's not like you know you're just talking about a generator and and a nap and you know both of these talk to each other so so there are there is a whole ecosystem that works to make sure that the data which is which the generator throws up kids connect gets collected gets analyzed and and gets used for for meaningful business decisions then and that's the that's in fact that we talked about so so so so the data once it is meaningful to do multitude of things right woman for example today another there is a dearth of talent you know this dog of service engineer something it could be as simple as that right i mean generator fails I'm and you you send a service engineer to to repair the generator no for all you know this generator might be a five year old generator and the service and you know who's come on board might be a two year old employee of the organization he may not not not have even seen that model and then he's been passed to the responsibility of servicing that generator so he goes into the customer site and first of all he's shocked you know because he has not seen the generator right no he's used to the new a generator and this is an old a generator which is which is out there running in and he doesn't have a clue and what is inside enough so hard is he saw it you know and that could be a classic example of how you could bring down sociability time and this in turn helps the company plan better because so I mean if you if you know that I can all participate is going to fail in a certain period of time and if that equipment is intelligent enough to communicate that to you that use case in itself could be saving the company millions and billions of dollars right i mean not to mention the customer satisfaction in all the add-on benefits that comes along with with something as simple as that this will go to more complex applications and i could ease your traffic problems it could the whole concept of smarter City is about coyote and in how you you're managing connected devices and so and so forth so so the use of IOT or the use case of FD is pretty much spread across a multitude of industry so so the impact that filter is going to have on on our quality of lives is going to be huge I mean you can't just equate it to money you know it's just just much beyond no return investment terms of money alone and that's my my take on on how this whole industry is not a town this whole thing is getting way beyond you know phantom applications as i may put it right yeah nice to have you know your draw this is the easiest thing right I graphic factorial a smart connected device to your body you know which one it does pretty much what you do we know your exercise lifestyle its complexity but this could be practically used in in every scenario wait a min and and then the most common example would be a monitoring of signals you know how frustrated we get in bangalore item and we are it they take some and we do we don't talk about distance anymore no we talk about time I mean I love in my field and from whitefield to come here no at a particular point in time in the morning in 730 you know it probably takes me 20 25 minutes and if I if I get get to 815 I don't know man it probably takes an hour and a half so so I have no control in terms of what is happening but just imagine a situation where you know when I'm driving you know there is a there is an update would say is that you know it comes on to your yoga or it says that you know there is traffic on this particular Road there's an accident which is happening and you please take a different route to to get yer of que dia work it saves me money or time and money because you're you're you save a few are you saving on the appli- helping in we go green on first of all you need oh stop driving that's that's a different challenge altogether but but there are a lot of associated benefits that comes out with that or not it could help in lion gale accident victims and so on so forth so so so you you have you know a ton of initiators that that that you could you know come up with and this industry is heading the right direction you know but there are of course challenges and as with every modern technology when this has been something which which we've been talking about for the last 18 24 months you know there's been so much of talk around IOT you know there's very little implemented and I end up and the reason for that is you know there are other issues in terms of security in terms of data secrecy and so on so forth to know which which I think we are we are working on and if you look at the the smart government initiatives that that a minister is taking right now you know we we are starting to see these motor city pilots coming out in other I think there are five or six cities which been selected for key for the pilot so so so we are we are heading in the right direction no and so on the saw the corporates I mean I think if they wait in the waiting to watch period is is this kind of getting through an Android iment they are all realizing that in what some point in time they need to jump into the bandwagon the other day i was with the manufacturing company they are wanting to launch gensets to the market or anywhere in that business a for some reason went out of the business and then you know what they want to jump back into into that business and then they talking about you know doing a pilot on iop in fact we are as we're speaking we are doing a pilot with the with them and I can't officially reveal the customers name but but we are we talking to them and we are doing a pilot you know where they've got a divide divide a sense of manufacturing company which can embed their sensors into the way into the genset so so the mindset of our customers to service their customers is exchanging and that's the impact that power that already has so so it's whether it is smart homes or smart connected factory or or smarter smarter cities you know you have you have IOT everywhere and to me this is this is where the future is enter and if you look at ye PDC has gotten to that item and we we see a logical extension of ki tlm into into service lifecycle management and IOT and augmented reality again and that's where we are we are going as well as an organization that's where the marketers is leading us to this far and going back to the example of a service engineer servicing uh uh diesel genset right now he hasn't even seen the jensen vitamin so assume that only has a fancy glass or it may not even be back seat vector the other day our CEO Jim Apple man was your end up here an iphone and get a five dollar amazon glass so he got it from his own not justify dollar it's made out of cardboard and he put his mobile device in there and it was obviously a demo but uh but he had a piece of paper where he had a white drawn that you know it was a Katie Empire and and what the with the augmented reality power know he was able to break that bike into into into paths and he was able to pinpoint of each of the parts and he was able to take other parts mixer maxima charity and so on so forth man and that's where augmented reality is going right so so so just imagine you are the connected device and you have the services in your go sitting standing in front of the the genset he us the school Google glass or or cheap glass whatever it is or he just points his his his hand phone order for his iPad at the device and suddenly the device disintegrates and it shows all the different parts and then you have based on the the IOT you know you have data that is getting fed saying you know the the problem could be in these these these areas can you go open up this particular part and check whether the the part is okay or not and then you know doesn't need to know anything about the device right up and so so with the fundamental basic training that he has and he's able to you know get into the product and I'll be able to decipher what what exactly is the problem that that he needs to be able to analyze right and this is this is the serviceability standpoint just imagine data are getting fed back saying you know this is a particular part which gets filled over a period of time you know so it gives you analytical data to to start working on that particular failure part so that you know it doesn't hamper your ongoing sales and so on so forth so so it helps you in terms of planning ahead as well so so I OT in combination with augmented reality is is where from at least as far as smart manufacturing is concerned as far as customer service is concerned it's going to be the next wave they're already talking about starting work seven so so obviously there will be a lot of things that we will be continuing to to work on as we as we are evolving this product to to the next level vitamin we've done a ton of capability enhancements and as I said we put in utilities made it a lot more simpler for developers we are hosting it on amazon web services so that they can you know get get the advantage of integrating with but the with the with the rest of the core infrastructure that an organization might want to draw draw from and so on so forth so so we will continue to keep building this as we as we go on and I nominate reality as I said you know it's going to be a very very key part I mean we made this acquisition of a company called before you got what six eight months back or maybe a your back and that's going to be the next wave so we're going to integrate the the government is reality capabilities into into IOT make it a lot more stronger and we are already leading the IOT PLM space and if you if you look at what what IDC has estimated us so this is last year's data of course you know we are the leader in the IOT PLM space Oh has given us a thumbs up in terms of our strategy in terms of where this company is going because I'm a big to put in their own words they saying a billion dollar cad PLM filling plus Tolec at klm company taking this gold step into the a to the e into the next wave that's that's that's how home as as sk master comes out you know so so the analysts have have kind of given aza comes up in terms of where we are going we are continuing to lead the already space so i OT PLM space we will continue to focus on that market because that's our power right I'm a cat BLM is still our core and and whatever we do will will be in in those lines to to help customers move from from where they are today to to a smart connected a smart product kind of a kind of the set up and that's going to be our future as well as I said right now man I may not be able to devote the entire plan because it's we're going to have our life works event next couple of weeks time XP soon so 629 thin in Boston and they're going to have what by thousand plus attendees coming over from from from all over the world we're going to have some some great keynote speakers from our customer organizations we're going to have some some great IOT partners coming apart so softly there will be a little more that that we will get as a sense in terms of what next with or without ID but but as of now we know we are we think what we have is is really up there in terms of what capabilities customers who need to start on the air at Ajani actually to really go go really deep on the other teacher me know and we will continue to further that no enhance that you know as I said of minute reality could be could be the next big bet you know in terms of getting authority the working a lot on code life which is our analytical engine for coyote and we we will continue to do all of those skip embed all of those capabilities and make it a choice for our customers to not just develop but to be able to put it i equal to analyze to be able to manage the data to be able to you know you make me some meaning out of the data and to be able to you know go and then service like a s'mores back fifty billion yeah just apartment as i said earlier and also we we currently have market leadership in the space I think IDC esas according the center okay so so we are we are in a position of strength we are in a leadership position there was the market maturity is also going to do with how you want to want this to go to we have we starting to see that getting getting getting through in some of the developing markets as well and and we would want to continue building on one on are we shipping and continue enhancing our market share so no fancy number not yet at some point we were but but not yet and also we want to you know extend on our market leadership that we have right now well exciting exciting times ahead in the end it so it's a great platform I would not sure everyone to do to look at our platform play around with their terminals or a trial version available we can we can help you in whatever way we want to know more as many developers is possible to to look at our platform to play another platform to figure out how easy it is to develop a an IOT app IOT ready app for so to speak and and have fun and and it's it's up to us on how we can we can change the the world and and I think I think we we are enabling you're enablers and in this in this changing environment in the and I want as many be equal to to try it and in the oven feel free to come back to us give us feedback so that we could make it even better and then the good part we have good advantage we have brother of PDC or in India as that you know sixty-five percent of our are the population globally is based in india and we're probably the only company which has that pagan are an R&D presents so in this in desi gasping enter and then we have them here for for a reason because we are like a largely populated country you know we have technologically early rally advanced in terms of the capabilities that we can we can provide to our customers and and then we are here right I'm and so I i need the feedback to to help us get better help us serve you better and and helped come up with some fantabulous worthless products that that really could could could take it a notch higher thank you very much
