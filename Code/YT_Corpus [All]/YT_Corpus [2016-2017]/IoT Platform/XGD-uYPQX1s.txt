 today we are living a prosperous life thanks to the Industrial Development and such development is based on the manufacturing including aircraft car smartphone and many other daily products smart Factory has been a major field of research and development among many countries in the world to increase the factory's capacity to enhance productivity and efficiency of the manufacturing and to reduce the failure rate and malfunctioning however smart Factory is difficult to adopt for the small and medium enterprise due to the high cost so lulala lab has developed the whim Factory wim factory can be applied to existing production line instead of transforming the entire factory process factory managers can remotely monitor the production line status from the office home and in mobile environment there are four IOT technology in the wim factory to enhance the productivity and efficiency of the small and medium enterprises manufacturing processes first we provide an economic smart sensor called week on which can be applied to small-scale factory and automated production line in any environment second we provide that cloud platform which collect operation status and monitoring data from the week on third based on the pattern analysis of what big data collected from the production lines malfunction and failure rate we can help forecast and react to such problem or we provide multi device a monitoring system or PC in the office tablet in the factory site and smartphone in mobile environment wim factories for technology can be applied to any factory site within 15 to 25 days with easy instruction win factory monitors the production line 24 hours and alerts the manager in case of any malfunctioning via PC tablet and smartphone also it can manage the production lines operation status and record to provide quality control Manufacturing is second to agriculture in number of employment and the level of quality as well as productivity is the key to the people's happiness in its country ooh Lala labs win factory provides not only an automated monitoring system but also happiness to the people in the manufacturing industry by enhancing the quality of the production ooh Lala lab researches
