 afternoon my name is Justin Smith I work on security at pivotal thank you guys for giving me the opportunity to speak something's kind of interesting I'm not sure very many people can say this today but I love what I do right and I have for quite a while some days are frustrating right but I actually love what I do I feel like what I do is important I feel like it matters there's a lot of technical challenge and what I hope to do today is actually described to you what I think could challenge convention and enterprise security right typically enterprise security talks are not that interesting I think this is actually really interesting I hope to present and motivate why security is important at least it's my perspective and there's lots of other people that share their perspective and then I really think it's important to talk about how Cloud Foundry fits into that future and I'd like to start with a little factoid how often is the Golden Gate Bridge painted I'm sure several of you know this answer the answer is it's painted every day so there's like 20-ish people that wake up every day and they think about their day and they say I'm gonna paint the bridge orange every day they go to work and paint the bridge Orange I don't know if that strikes a chord with any of you you in the audience there are days when it strikes a chord with me on the surface it looks like a very mundane task it looks like something that would just drone on and on there's actually no end State whatsoever I think if you were to talk to those people some might have that perspective but like life if you change your perspective a little bit it's actually a pretty empowering thing to do you could look at it as they're protecting a national treasure right very much the Golden Gate Bridge is the national treasure and they're actually it's almost an act of love right when we look at enterprise security we tend to think about it as the mundane sort of endless task I actually view it as a labor of love and I think that kind of shift in thinking is really important for us to embrace and there's another aspect of this that's really important the bridge is always changing I would imagine that to some extent there would be flare-ups around corrosion maybe something new has been done to the bridge and it needs to be protected immediately so they go in and paint it but I would also assume that there's an act of maintenance where it's just sort of continual painting I actually don't know anything about bridge maintenance I'm making that up I'm just assuming that's the case but the bridge is changing continual change is a concept I think we have to embrace an enterprise security and it's still not the case I want to make it the case any talk about security is gonna have to include descriptions of features features features features I want to run around on stage and just scream features there's lots of cool stuff that we have done in the community Cloud Foundry in the last year there's lots of stuff that's right on the cusp of shipping to that I think is absolutely important I don't want to talk about it right you can read about this stuff you can look at it online you can engage the community about it I want to talk about something a little bit bigger right I want to talk about what I think is a bigger concept and that is how do we make Cloud Foundry V secure runtime what does that mean anybody know by the way I don't see a single hand alright one thing that we tend to do in computer science particularly in cloud infrastructure and I don't know why this is we think about features show me the feature matrix that is what I want show it to me I can go to 10 different banks and they can all have a completely different view of a feature matrix kind of interesting right mm-hmm so we gotta ask ourselves what does it mean to look at the atomic features and try to assess the security of a platform security is pretty difficult complex topic let's do a little bit of a mental exercise and think about something much more everyday think about a car what are the features that actually do buying a car let's think about number a wheel some wheel some cars have four wheels cars have had three wheels they tend to be a little bit unstable but technically it's happened trucks can have six wheels or more some vehicles actually don't even have wheels like a half-track it has tracks oh my gosh where's the commonality there think about engines the blue flame it's a rocket car there are cars that have jet engines there are cars that run off of solar energy there are cars you can plug in the wall and then there's of course the internal combustion engine cars have a really wide spectrum but if we want to define them as a set of features that actually becomes pretty difficult if we were to see a pallet of all the raw materials that go up to comprise a car we would not look at that and say that's a car it's a pile of stuff so part of a car means it has to be ready to use if we were to look at two parts to a car a brake component in the steering wheel we wouldn't call that a car those are car parts if we were to see a whole car that was missing a brake assembly and a steering wheel we'd probably still call it a car this is really hard to define and it's in our everyday lives if we look at it as a set of atomic features we will never get anywhere instead we know that we take a holistic viewpoint to something as everyday as a car we assess its value based off does it add value in our life does it actually do what we expect it to do can we go from point A to point B right I think we need to adopt that same kind of viewpoint in cloud infrastructure particularly with security I know it's a way that we look at things that pivotal we look at technology with a very holistic lens right we have opinions about how technology should be put together about how you should build software what works best and I think it's time to take that concept and apply it to security so what is it that we're actually trying to attain with security in the data center go talk to a big enterprise their threat surface area is enormous Cloud Foundry is obviously about the data center so let's hone in on the gate data center let's scope it way down what is it that we're trying to do inside the data center my team and people that I work with or like you know please stop scaring us right when I when I go talk about stuff but you can look on the news or look at Norse Corp and see basically active attacks that are happening all over the world right and if you think about it too much you can actually get paralyzed by it so for us to understand what we mean by security in the data center I think it's really important to understand how and how big it is how big is this problem I'm jaded right I work for a software vendor at some point I'm trying to sell you software don't take my word for it look at somebody else look at a very serious professional whose job it is to protect the US every year has anybody heard of the worldwide threat assessment it's a pretty interesting document you can go find it online the intelligence community every year puts together a worldwide threat assessment and they publish it and they actually present it to the Senate and the Director of National Intelligence aggregates all this information and presents it to the Senate it's a very us centric document but I think the concepts in there apply globally right this is really interesting look at the 2007 report what happens there's a bunch of stuff in there that we would expect just from watching the news there's not really a mention of cyber attacks or cyber warfare something has changed 2000 13 14 and 15 there's been a tidal shift like nothing I have seen before in my career this is the table of contents to the 2015 worldwide threat assessment the order is not an accident look at this list mass destruction proliferation are you serious we all we all identify with that but cyberattacks they're number one how does that work and if you read that first section if you look at it really carefully they're not talking about massive attacks on infrastructure right they actually call out we're less worried about an Armageddon style attack we're more about a bunch of low-to-moderate attacks against a bunch of companies and it just devastates the economy it's number one death by a thousand paper cuts I believe the work that we do matters right it matters to our customers it matters to our shareholders and quite frankly it matters globally make no mistake and the other thing that's interesting about this is corporations are listed literally corporations are the assets of corporations are listed on the first page of the net worldwide threat assessment by the way if you work at one of these companies particularly one of the ones that listed you know that you're on the first page this is not a surprise right and by the way if you work at one of those organizations it's a really intimidating thing because there's no one to call if you get attacked I've been through those types of situations they are not fun there's no one to call there's no 1-800 ghostbusters you're pretty much on your own this is serious so in the 2015 report there's basically four companies that are listed there maybe a couple more two of them are on the first page interesting metric for Cloud Foundry both of the companies that are listed on the first page have suffered a terrible breach or breaches post breach both of them use Cloud Foundry I don't think that's an accident there's a reason there it's not about individual features it's about something bigger than that what we want out of Cloud Foundry is for it to be resilient against attacks it's not that attacks won't happen you want to be able to survive attacks give a little bit and then go back to normal state that's the concept that's the that's what you want from a security point of view in your cloud software and so to understand how to be resilient you have to think about what the threat is what's the shape of the threat that we're trying to resist right if you go to an enterprise security team and you say what are you most worried about inside the data center I'll say a lot of stuff but there is one type of threat that will apps lutely terrify them bunch of names for it sometimes called a worm sometimes called a malware of late it's been sort of sensationalized with this label of advanced persistent threat or apt this is a really funky thing it's usually initiated by nation-states but it doesn't have to be it finds its way into its data into a data center it worms around two different servers it observes either stuff that's happening on a server or stuff that's happening locally or locally or on the network it collects information bounces around and then does an X filtration it's a big deal anybody heard of this kind of thing before yeah a little bit now the latest vogue is for these types of attacks to ransom data right so I'll actually take a key and just encrypt a bunch of data if it hasn't been backed up and then you gotta pay him to get the decrypting key that's a lot of fun right so no exfiltration we'll just take all the data and protect it that's basically one of the threats and I think it's a huge threat it's not the only one but it's a big one so what are these things look like what are they require to thrive and survive well you can look at lots of data that's out on the internet about how these things work right there's lots of breach reports 2015 there's a Verizon data breach report that's really fascinating reading if you're a person like me right I've read a bunch of these things and I think there's some common denominators I think there's really three things that are sort of consistent across a bunch of different types of breaches one of them is vulnerable or misconfigured software this is almost a must-have all right patched software is rare in the enterprise it seems like it should be basic it seems like it should be done it's actually not vulnerable or misconfigured software is an absolutely essential component to these types of attacks another one is time these types of attacks require a non-trivial amount of time they require time to gather the information that they need or that they want right to Pogo stick around and do damage it's sort of essential it's sort of obvious but it's a really important dimension and then the third one is leaked credentials now at times in my career I have gone on this warpath to try to get rid of usernames and passwords and I failed miserably I think they're kind of just here to stay right so credentials in this sense are not so much about usernames and passwords for human beings like carbon-based life-forms there are actually credentials for silicon-based life-forms so I'm kind of such a loser about computer science I anthropomorphize processes sorry right but process identity things like how what's my username and password to connect to a database or a Redis service right when those things leak really bad things happen right these are I think are three essential components there's more but this is a pretty important list if malware were a weed and the data center was a plot of land it would look like this it is like this pastoral setting where there's abundant sunshine there's abundant soil and there's very clearly water somewhere right and so if you're a malware author you're like a malware farmer a weed farmer you can just sprinkle your stuff around and it's gonna take root not hard the barrier to entry can be fairly low right it's kind of a problem this is literally what data centers look like to an attacker and this is not symmetric conflict this is very asymmetric it's not fair this is not a fair fight so what's the software industry done to try to deal with this well we're the ones the software people the professionals I am partly to blame for this have built such sucky software that it resists change at all costs right look at router you know firewall configurations go to a big company and say how many firewall rules do you have there well we've got a lot and nobody wants to touch it right how often do you rotate your TLS credentials oh god no no uh-uh not not gonna do it right these are things that we just tend to avoid we've built software like that and we've created this pastoral scene it's a real problem so what's the software vendors answer more software we created the problem and we're going to solve the problem with what I believe is a very flawed set of assumptions and this is what we do this is the state of the art today we're going to put monitors in place to make sure weeds aren't growing no change that we're going to look for weeds that are growing so we pay vendors money little bags of money or sometimes big bags of money to watch for certain things going on inside the data center this is really goofy to me and then there's some vendor that gets the golden ticket because somebody's got to monitor the monitors and you pay them a lot more money because they have to monitor all this other stuff that's going on and they may use machine learning Wow cool right now I'm not saying all monitoring is bad I'm just saying the premise is kind of weird to me I don't accept this I do not accept this concept kind of bothers me actually I get pretty wound up about this kind of stuff but look we just appeared Bing and one of the one of the flags went up by a monitor notice the monitor didn't fix the problem it didn't go pull the weed I just set up a flag so if you're in the enterprise and you have a you've got to deal with a massive number of notifications so you buy more software to figure out how to deal with the notifications this is a never-ending cycle there's a reason security teams inside of enterprises are grumpy right they really are they've not had good tools and they've been in a losing battle if you go back to the bridge painting metaphor it's like waking up every day and what do you know I'm gonna paint the bridge orange that's kind of what it feels like to be in an enterprise security team right software resist change that we sell to enterprises so the culture naturally resists change this is a buyer-seller socio techno sort of system right and so we have grumpy people that don't want to change and I don't blame them if I was in their shoes I'd be exactly the same way so what do we do current approach is not working all right sir we should try something quite different what is that well let's shift our perspective painting the bridge doesn't have to be about I'm painting the bridge every day orange it can be about something different right what does that look like let's challenge conventional thinking there's software today that you can buy that will help you figure out which patches you can apply because it's based on the assumption that you can never patch everything so let's throw that out what if you could patch everything reliably with zero downtime with a push of a button strike a chord with anybody that's a big part of Cloud Foundry we can do this we're opinionated we have the operating system we also have the web server we have the application container we have the whole stack we monitor that thing at pivotal right and other people do as well patch it when you get a patch please deploy it inside your data center one of the first things I did when I when I joined pivotal was absolutely focus on the patch cycle I believe it's just absolutely critical and since May pivotal Cloud Foundry has had 30 ish releases a pivotal Cloud Foundry that are mostly driven by vulnerabilities in dependencies pretty interesting right that's a lot right it's week 20 week 20 ish 30 releases non-trivial right I believe we're quite good at this and I think the community benefits from it quite frankly without without the question the other one is really funny repave all right so repair your software repave when I entered enterprise software it used to be bragging rights how long could my server live without rebooting right never people that would have I guess they had like counters like you know days since an injury in a factory and they were like flipped that they I don't know but it was a badge of honor to have something it's lasting for years I mean some people it's been 18 years since I've had to reboot that know that is broken no no no what if we were to say inside of our data center them we were to play a different game what's the minimum amount a lifetime my VM can live my server can live what if every server inside my in my data center had a maximum lifetime of two hours all right think about it from the malware author that means you have to play a video game and get to level 100 but you can never get past level five because there's not enough time frustrating as all get-out right this command looks similar look familiar cron job right not guys this is part of our architecture this is the way that we're built and the last one is about rotating credentials we have some work to do in this area it's an area that I'm keenly focused on but I think when we get it we're actually gonna have a unique story right the idea is repair repave and rotate the three r's these are features that upset the applecart these are not about features of saying you know do I have this particular key agreement protocol these are features that change the game and I think if we do it right it means to get safer you go faster that's the exact opposite of how organizations think today it will turn this pastoral landscape and is something that looks like this the Mars surface and unless you're Matt Damon you're not going to grow a plant here right and so what I want and my time at pivotal and my time as part of the the Cloud Foundry community is to build the system that gives no quarter for malware in the data center this is not a this is not a place where it will survive repair repave and rotate anyway guys thank you very much for your time have a great conference
