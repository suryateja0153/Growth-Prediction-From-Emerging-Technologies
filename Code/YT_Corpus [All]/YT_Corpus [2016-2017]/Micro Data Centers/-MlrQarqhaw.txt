 AMAC structures are a new approach to data center infrastructure design that affords greater speed agility and scalability while reducing costs self-contained modular components are delivered to your facility as freestanding units that can be assembled rapidly as a result AMX structures enable you to reduce the time and cost associated with datacenter build outs and create an environment that is consistent across your facilities yet response to changing requirements AMAC structures are made up of four components that comprise all the elements of a modern aisle containment design is include a cabinet anchoring basin a hot or cold aisle containment system a cable routing system and an overhead power distribution bus way the base unit of the day mac structure system creates a self-contained cabinet anchoring and aisle containment platform the base unit can be designed in any length width and height to accommodate the physical environment and the racks and cabinets to be installed within it the base unit has built-in anchoring provisions for server cabinets and racks eliminating the need to anchor individual racks to the concrete slab or raised floor when the base unit is bolted to the floor it creates a seismic anchoring surface yet allows for easy moves adds and changes the base unit also supports a tilt up prefabricated aisle containment system in hot or cold configuration the aisle containment system encapsulate s' the iowa and capped the end of the structure with the door style of your choice this increases the flexibility of the structure by eliminating the need to attach an aisle containment system to the ceiling or racks the iowa enables human access to the equipment while maintaining an enclosed environment for cooling efficiency the cable routing system is a pre-installed basket trade that runs along the top of the base unit to manage data communication cabling the structure can also be prefabricated to support an overhead bus way of your choice you can choose just the cabinet anchoring and aisle containment units add the cable routing or get a system that is pre-configured for your desired Power Distribution bus way the system is highly flexible and can be designed to accommodate any size server cabinet or network rack third party components can also be incorporated into day Mac's prefabricated system each component of the day Mac structure is manufactured to our exacting standards with tubular steel construction and fabricated brackets for both flexibility and durability traditional data centers are built from the ground up by anchoring cabinets and racks to the floor then adding aisle containment cable routing and overhead power distribution the process is time and labor intensive with each phase typically handled by a different contractor with day mac structures we handle the entire process from design and manufacturing through on-site assembly as a result MX structures can be up and running in 75 percent less time than a traditional facility let us put the benefits of day mac structures to work in your facility contact us today to get started
