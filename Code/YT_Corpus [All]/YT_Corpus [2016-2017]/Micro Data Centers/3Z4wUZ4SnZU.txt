 2015 with Kevin Brown vice-president of data center technology and strategy at Schneider Electric Kevin with the launch of micro data centers can you talk a little bit about the sorts of applications that customers are going to utilize these these solutions in well we really see this as you know it's impossible to have a conversation now in the industry without talking about the Internet of Things right so uh you know it's it's certainly a part of this overall trend of edge computing the Internet of Things as you know there's certain applications that having always existed and had a lot of data and I think of industrial process control as an example I like to use where they've always existed they've been on proprietary networks but what's really changing is they're coming on to IT networks now and as a result now that information is able to get connected into you know the cloud whether it's a private cloud a public cloud or what-have-you but those types of applications themselves need to run very close to the load there's a you know to be very much very much driven by what's the bandwidth consideration right into a new conversation of you know do I put my application to cloud or do I keep it locally you know it really depends on is there a latency requirement for that application but maybe more importantly is going to be the bandwidth so if we have depended any amount of data that I'm doing it might be cheaper to deploy physical infrastructure than it is to pay for the bandwidth back and forth so we see certain applications like industrial process control where it's gonna have to be very close to the loan we see other ones like content distribution networks where just because of the bandwidth considerations they want to put them out and you know it's really an it's going to be very application specific so there's industrial process controls one to see that it's easy that's definitely gonna be close to the load content distribution is driving itself more out towards the edge but we're very much in this conversation with customers about what is the PAH straight off of having the physical infrastructure close versus the bandwidth fossil putting it into maybe somewhat more essentially and you know it really is very dependent on those those those types of issues latency and bandwidth they're going to be the core drivers in these conversations as we go forward I think the skill shortages in both the data center sector and the IT sector have been well charted how do you think micro data center solutions start to answer some of that requirement I think it's a very interesting question because I think the industry is moving towards where you're going to have going to have generic blocks of compute that are going to deploy a lot of the cloud technologies whether you're running a private cloud or a public cloud it's really trying to get it to where you just have this generic hardware compute that I can deploy any application on so if we do this right it really should simplify what people need to do and micro data centers are part of that story because what you know you now have a block you can design it once you can deploy these anywhere they're very standardized they you hopefully love standardize IT inside of them and therefore that really does simplify because now instead of having to know what might five different IT vendors are doing and then I also need to understand the software and the physical infrastructure you start viewing these just as one one block of compute that can be deployed so micro datacenters I think are a great example of that you know we've you know we've made big investment in prefab data centers I think that's a trend towards that as well we're really trying to get things to be standardized blocks of compute that are getting deployed which hopefully if done correctly will minimize and simplify the training requirements because everything's been pre manufactured done and you know should make everything much more straightforward having consolidation has been a major trend in the data center industry for a number of years now now all of a sudden we see a proliferation or we anticipate a proliferation of band edge computing applications to start to answer this I Oh ting thing that's going on how are you gonna what's the answer to managing the complexity that inevitably arises as assets start to proliferate yeah it's a great question and you know I want to be clear my for Mike the perspective on this you know we always like to talk in the industry that you know things are going in one direction or the other that's consolidating or desert to distributing you know in at the end what we think is happen is you're going to both right so there's gonna be a mix of things that you want locally and things that you want centrally now what's interesting about this wave of edge computing data centers out there is you're right it doesn't reduce complexities and the tools that are available now and you know we've made a big investment other players have as well but the tools that are available now to me energies are much more sophisticated than what existed you know 10 years ago certainly even five years ago so the progress that's been made on the ability to controls and understand what's happening at the local area and the connection between the physical infrastructure and IT is much better than what exists in the past and we think is really a key enabler to allowing people to deploy these secondly though is you know as everything's coming down on me you're going to see and certainly we're looking at this closely other people ours once everything comes onto the internet there's going to be will have the ability to help customers with that as well so it's not necessarily gonna be you have to have a tool that's deployed on site there's gonna be additional support that comes if somebody wants it from vendors like us to help manage those devices as well so with the Internet of Things and everything getting connected you know the investments that the industries made and providing better software tools over the last 5-10 years is much better and it's going to continue to get improve as you know we can also provide that expertise to our customers directly so you know it's quite exciting because I think it enables a lot of opportunities to be more energy effective we more spot where use of energy be more effective with how we're deploying IT because we can get the visibility to it that maybe we didn't have 10-15 years ago so it's quite exciting
