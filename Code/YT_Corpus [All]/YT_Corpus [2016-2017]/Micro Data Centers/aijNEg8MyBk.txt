 finalist getting that a little bit nuts it's got a lot of press recently we take people from state legislature Falcon Energy Commission duncan hunter rank we will get into that cool with that but you know what by the proper pic free is a practical grid and what it is for my crib forget College frac afraid I'll get into that very significant to what we're doing now strategically into the future and Cass beverlyn again it's part of the base of here it's an air base on continental but also they have a lot of solar PV they want to make your car they're filled with leds leds by the way we can talk about that whole bit about way they don't do LEDs I mean that's been there can be some BL deeds by five years now everything will be honest everything in this room could be le economic breast see which is a good idea that LEDs are much better last longer you can dim them term on and off with that affect their life but they're doing that with the air feels I am Caskey its unity based on were you on human by the way is a sunny city in the United States a might say well I've do all sorted they do less full winter but the problem is they're served by Arizona public service which has very low rates it's hard to show the economics of doing what they do they do paraguay and you have another product of the Joint Strike Fighter as low-paid was located there two years ago they had to put in all-new hangers here because basically these hangers our data centers a datacenter my way you so much it is like five houses a tremendous lot of energy yeah they do because all the time sin tener run electronics and all the heat given off and so you might has a real challenge I'll summon two not something who did kind of a discussion Arizona public service approached us two years ago but a microwave on vases was it quite sure and they're putting in the right base it makes less sense we have a link right there at ApS let's see MCRD San Diego and again this is one of the two bases here they don't have microchip were hopeful for the future incidentally these two bases are not parted in CI west as part of the training and education command but we support them that they're one of our own with about infrastructure and again I talked about that a little bit earlier we're trying come I i I'm a suggestion to headquarters one day too let's pour my crid there specifically for the intention of energy efficient you can do that we'll talk about a little bit I haven't heard back where they want to do it on bridgeport bridge important is way up north near Reno and all soldiers and Marines are going to Afghanistan training in fitchburg Bridgeport looks like Afghanistan especially in the mountains and seventy-five percent of their energy use manual are uses propane because not my heat load in the winter so they could actually become a bite but very easily because just trucking enough my creek store and that's all they most of what they need okay so that's a that's an overview of what's foot on each basis and I'm going to get in and out my favorite puppy any questions on renewable energy what we're doing okay ah our strategy we dinner / strategy in august 2013 we finished it and we did with the assistance of booz allen hamilton my set by the four staff members with Booz Allen right now they make up a regional energy water advisory center and they do energy for for me it's worked very well we did the strategy back in august 2013 the main goal was to be energy water security primary energy security but secretary global energy efficiency i remember talking to behind expected Marine Corps headquarters who are doing this they funded it and by the way we were the first region and rain core duo strategy like this they were fighting in force and they will make better security our main aur main goal want to do this with my records now those of you who may be familiar with politics in DC buzzwords run the gamut being accepted or not not like them at a time I Chris nobody they mention favorably stations want to do that so yeah I'm going to do because I think makes sense I'm glad he believed us we wasted has been our goal for the last three years to put my prints on these four bases not went back to a moment we happening in the plant or an operation of all our bases and the migrants were to quite a roadmap energy security for we're basically well on our way to doing that okay that's the definition basically that definition says if you look at some part of energy definition basically without reading it anytime you have a subset of a grid which has its own lows demands for electricity plus so distributed energy sources satisfy those ones with the ability to operate and connected disconnect from the grid that is a microwave think about it for a second awesome rules have been like this for 100 years they cannot break off the grid because they have to automobiles come right under our micro grids but we're looking at micro grids right here to be able to operate our bases being connected or disconnected from the grid Oh does anybody I could get it yes the military bases care food is dependent on utilities so that gives some terrorists or some foreign enemy were to take down the utility big grid as the military bases would be in big trouble and they pee pee in cups well we're just so Billy all get done now that's why they do more doing so we get ready same applies under Ted Koppel just heard about this is our best seller on the LA Times bestseller list and I'm fishing right now but he dresses this issue of somebody hacking the electrical grid the United States and I'm the main sensor is a book that not once does he mentioned Mike the bridge geneticists a solution that would be a solution that if you were concerned about losing the grid in the United States Papa you develop my fridge and students I'll get in that moment I'm really surprised stuff he's not aggressive maybe or deny equal read it when they go off grid do they have a place to start but because you say you can disconnect from the grid these micro grids can disconnect from the grid to so then they have an offer in storage for that oh listen which line not violent money epson connected looks or magical what is that awards out of storage like a test what is it Bob they store the energy oh you are you generally have gas turbines Diesel's whatever you have that or so I it's better to do it is remove water that's what we're doing off the public art our energy efficient our energy storage is renewable energy generally TV and we also have storage I'll get into at a moment generally big batteries down but took long ways you can do it out on the just lot I think as a three-thousand-dollar battery yeah I guess like I am not happy with must not it's not a car it's a battery that's what I love oh you're right and I think he's gonna make an economic her buddy how these things go plus a lot can be talking about migrants they talk about vehicle to visit the board you think you can power building with a car battery that's a lot of energy in these it is tested 85 kill what are the bigger arena na host but use I think firing too large but it's a lot of opportunity right here using the balance that's partner believe it one time that when the power went down San Diego that you see the University of California San Diego their micro grid actually powered the downtown in strategic areas some are on grid I don't know there's some miscommunication I day I know they did to a certain extent you've heard from fire and watch my good friend of mine actually he he talks about that yeah that guy going to youtube and google microgrids UCSD you'll see nice video he put UCSD on the map worldwide because of that my printer they did they put her on can grill these fuel cells batteries anyway so that's the definition right here what looks like is right there just I totally see a well defined area around eight and anything nothing could be in my face in our case on military bases that that could versity maybe a city has have the table before hand maybe a microwave priety got something for calls back parts a husband these are entirely valid things to be looking at me see there there's an x hunter lose the grid and you can solve serve that load by there's a backup diesel right here there's solar somewhere on there and there's batteries storage anything will satisfy the load okay okay now our strategy we complete the initial wouldn't do that or keep our goal was it security why don't we do sell so many reasons for this actually got you don't have car kings here and doing East Coast Weaver face an earthquake and take a look very easily was never means excessive electrical demand come on mr. September in san diego st g d's on the radios and try to cut back unnecessary levels that happens every year because we can just design the system to be so so big you just can't buy for that Pete load easily in September cyber-terrorist member three years ago Metcalf substation up in pga service territory and Cynthia transformed shut up now the FBI said it wasn't terrorism but they're too quick to say that by feared a lot of people think it was it was too well planned somebody could take on the entire electrical grid but I don't think yeah all that effort to do it takes a man with a shotgun aunt imperial valley when the 550 line coming into San Diego she plenty nuns here they got a huge mana load we're just fortunate event yeah there's a lot of easier ways to do that then take on substation like that so cyber terrorism the one way around that is again you guess microgrids got all these individual microts I was ready to put in the failure this was the Black Hawks I California was the cause somebody threw a wrench in a substation near Valley that's good took out the lows of the entire Southern California for all hours so there's a lot of ways to it of the benefits of microwaves I was talking to Jay briefly coming in people especially we're talking about microts starting two or three years ago and talked about the expense of migrants they are expensive PDF put a lot of stuff in there to make them work but people don't talk about the energy efficiency I was in a conference in August in Phoenix and it was an individual he was I ventured none he was a financial investment from Bostonian and he was vice president this like Sonia has ever given talk on on micrograms and I raised my hand after he puts invest in things to make money that's what you do these things for and I says can I ask you what the main source of energy savings is for your investments of my cryx will not complain easy fighting you can decide that he designed anything in dough you can make a Micra do which one to do right there and it's funny I've rented know three months later to conference in dumber and I recounted this story Bob's on Pam recounted the story tell everybody tonight didn't realize he was in the audience I think you must me afterward that chase behind hey thank you he was I've mentioned they're doing this but I think it's the lesson here very important point is if you are stuck in a micro grid you will do it in order to save money that can be done can be not if you don't write the world was i oh no I'm running because batch my page here concise full introduction another way you can save energy with migrants utilities been doing CBR as they worked for years what they do is reduce the voltage at a substation and anybody has any energy idea of their life questionnaire stuff you're reasonably just something in regardless energy and so they've been messaging used to do it they may still be going out now the problem with doing that is if you do it to a customer get of a long feeder you're already offering at low voltage so if you reduce them you begin to burn out motors do a lot of things like that so it's not dead now but up with a micro grid by definition you have the shorter shorter feeds short distribution lines so you can go ahead and do that all day you're not going to lose let's see maybe save money doing good principle bit longer in distance you have to push electricity through the wires you have to increase the voltage by decreasing the amperage and then when you get to house is like that electrical equipment you increase the amperage by decreasing the ball cash very immersive coarseness wife Oh insult my first job is to guinea went by the way was building I bulbs traditionalized designing them and that's why they're all high voltage because you fight I taeyeon is a lot less sandbridge than 230 kv that's a rule like engineering then when you get to the customer site you take that voltage irreducible increase the current for the customer side yeah this that's the done since hustler yes that's what to do finally demand response banks want sex a program where you can sign up for icg your s.e.e in Oxford stemmer take a load off line and make money what better way to do that then take your entire grid off line say the money and get paid for it that's another benefit okay let's see we're getting toward the end those of you can wait I went through most of this I'm say each baconator having a plan or operation that's mere marketing do one end know that depends on me when a landfill gas energy project we're up a bid on that with evaluating bidders and I guess by the summer we wanted a contract chosen twin apologize but that right there also thing i didn't mention they're more solar pv s going in as part of the one wat an issue by President Obama remember say the Union in 2012 we said each of the services 1 gigawatt renewable energy and we're there we've done it we've completed all the requirements for 1 gigawatt for part of the day we were involved in that and Pendleton also the scene hello yeah let me just say a few things about this guy gloss over before penryn got 1.7 million dollars by four or five years ago developed a micro grid and Harper construction was suing a milk MLP structure project and what they did inside five is for or small micro grids up the northern part of the base the key here is that if any one of these sales it gets picked up by the enemy so there's this has very significant import something i'll tell you in just a moment 533 k WP v one of which is concentrating solar it's got an efficiency of about thirty percent which you know it's twice template so we have 500 feel that so because loving plus flywheels bibles is the big deal here because it kind of spinning mass this case it spends about five thousand six thousand rpms you can have it run a generator this thing get for storage this particular file there you have it spinning it'll spin two months if you don't pick in the energy two months that the only spinning ah there's an issue you might be foyer this summer they clean spark and hallway did one of these stuff flywheels that basically filled catastrophic plate it wasn't the one we're using a pedal didn't we're looking beyond it we're still working with them it more was made it although saw the site it would look like a war zone but anyway that was the one we're using so is it done so we're all fascinated by the progress for this little inside front loaders on the flywheel and are they producing of a 14 are you going to buy them or they got affected please smart son contract with them I was the building over there they're working with others in its very positive technology because they're non toxic to regard to its peripheral battery they're not toxic you can start and stop these things without effector lifers we're better you can a battery will provide you about 60 megawatt hours of energy per acre where I was provided by 500 megawatt hours stack them and lotteries all that said my crazy they CEO of place park we forget Frank's talk over there there were the batter's who love that so the perfect technology is not discovered yet flywheels we're evaluating that with flow batteries and other be the source where you can save your kind of oratory don't believe they're planning my own heard up what's his name Frank beautiful Frank dealer give Christmas age that I was letting her that megawatt the pump storage pumps towards by far the best way if you have a high elevation in a reservoir light spot and is that one of my previous students she sees work right now on that project with a copy of a very promising very promising so I resource a key be keep the community choice our bases betting how to do it distribute energy that's what you're going to get it there yes come build on a couple of teams in just a two-part think so let's go back and fall money here a little bit so we're talking with a VOD installation you talk a lot about grants are we finding that this is now being appropriated at bar the the budget or the following out if army is doing a renewable installation with altered party PT a type of thing and then how does the more risky innovation getting the finance as well you know there's a couple ways to go to third-party finance projects mentions in the PPA our first agreement you can do there to save performance contract or 16 contractors in the country yeah it's very cumbersome very involved to do that or you can do a utility energy savings contract wait a minute oh you're a bar so you can do that the other ones happy appropriate a nice hip energy conservation improvement program they retain Congress and it be approved by Congress we will not go in projects anomalous if we're going to third party minutes waiting the pba you ESC or any spc just because of the way money is funny it's not there anymore five three or four years ago for a loss a whole bunch of money that's why i said recourse than 500 million dollar sixty-nine years prior it's not there anymore but rightfully so we're finding ways to do this conferred to party fine in school so the innovation side that i noticed that you didn't mention hydrogen and so hydrogen fuel cells are about as a storage alternative i go on and on one of my favorite subjects we are opposing to the public education on developing hydrogen production station we're outside the gate on marine corps property work with california energy commission the two-year timeframe on it because what we have to do is find a way to do sole source least for the property and combine that with solicitation by the cec and logic it is 18 months into years I i want to feel solve a pro I don't know if you know that Hyundai it's developing sites fraud California to work the CDC develop it right one scheduled to go in at the corner of Carmel Valley Road and five and this candido know in our program and you know on the internet which is it good in I do it every once logged I I'm gonna get you just I didn't feel cell vehicles better way to go because what you said not only get word around the vehicle you've been run building I I personally think we're going to be a book yourself more in future and hydrogen is the most common element in the universe unfortunately very expensive to produce you increase it nice you Brewster I school chemistry lab with heart it's very expensive to do that's made major problem we don't have it there's no hydrogen infrastructure in California but the calibrator insufficient working to get there fit here my money is on fuel cell evenings although when you see the tests of all three next year it's like a smaller version of justice man like to various cops yeah a lot of good things are happening ah ok I'm here in the end you're getting gun okay are our goal now is to sometime in future interconnect be paid basis but their micro grids and there's a three elements up here at diversity reason we can do this and if you think my per second those ain't basis could be eight cities in California we look at pedal pedal Higgins pretty good size see if you can bypass the utility a major transmission right here you can get additional benefits because what you're doing some basis at given times because of the wide diversity of our base some base step excessive bed than others they take generation and they can buy from the other bases in not go through the utility do it but in order to do that you're going to have to work for the I am testing on utilities to reward them I mean it's I mean their transmission lines what are you go to use that it is 10 to 15 years ago you got it from now on you'll stay yeah obvious bub said something like that is happening it's going to happen we're proposing to do this because of these advantages right there mci west coordinates infrastructure throughout the project so many general also he doesn't say we're going to do that we're heading that direction right now because of all these things that are happening to make it work and look the lesson there we can put more renewable waters right now there's one at the amount of Riddler basis because what if month month they can use the amount they put on the grid but if you can do it such Pendleton knows when dinner going to need for it may be said at the parcel center Bridgeport and gets it at the Miramar you can do this by the way not even with transmission contractual make a deal with edison s in Bridgeport and scg you need in an pennilyn deci gdns see you can do that we can do that now but right now it's a very difficult play push you sir i'll just going to say the way you do that if you're in a micro good too is that your PPS are your own optics and you can get around the rules that the utilities have for the length of those PDAs and what you're going to pay for if you're your own mic right so you're basically becoming utility yeah so you can have favorable contracts in terms of buying renewables fine whatever you want to buy didn't then wheel it around to your other bases turn right yeah so that's the finance against right yeah it's not difficult you just have to make work often abilities they've got it I mean they got to get something done well the key question as far as making it worthwhile for the utilities think it's about 75% of our state's power is provided by three investor-owned utility monopolies and it seems to some of us that they are resistant to change and believe me I didn't buy the time make anybody here see a shape of this it's a good company thank you some nothing but the sheriff said potro add another layer the parent corruption with the Public Utilities Commission that is supposed to be looking out for the ratepayers it seems to me it could be a real challenge to get something that really makes economic sense you've ever it out with the utilities and the Public Utilities Commission at this point of time yeah that was a thunder on table plus they've been here at Ron table what they don't fighting Sonny Moore it hasn't spotted record need a TV I think yep I'll say that bad 14 the brain at one time is left poison air great career why whatever possessed him to meet for lunch but this idiot PG&E for in crackle all who have something to do he used to be president for Southern Cal go in unison yeah hiring them parks regard the house or anything never really made a whole body starts to make that is it is qualifying position was the guy very good for your job in here with the price of SC two yeah but it can be done it can be done in one minus KT yeah ah questions one more time one more time okay I'm going to tell you that why we ought to be doing this that's a slime ah I mentioned there because fzi West make this thing work see any gentleman coordinate our eight basis and now here's something I want to leave you with right here to remember this for the future given that existing bar mines only about twenty eighteen forty five percent efficient let's talk new life yes that's how fast our part my salt crust 96 transmission losses are generally six to seven percent losses that's just attacked the result is about thirty and forty percent efficiency of civilization power plants if for no other reason everything I just told you this means that we should not be generating free be used one bt univ custom I'm the mazes taken us this long to realize that maybe do things like lace I goodbye you go more to the street a generation you have more to generation customer site there ain't no bill maher's fill our stuff lying they would get in a twirl in the page I am NOT saying attributed the other day Charlene weight and twice work for actually she had women are for cheating I'm sure bill park or a number it's not an idiom two point oh I have this way here is he sparks flying sweet anyway remember is I get a three BD used under the current system one BTW US ports the dumb thing to do in it for that reason if for no other nothing hope that give you a lot of other reasons turn their security theories is we're going to do this the efficacy of proposed systems definitely like 15 grace all over one last one last time and this is something i incurred me oh one more thing if and i want to do this if an opportunity will be impressive if we take all the bases I don't think pace by 24 million dollars a year on energy bill do you work at all I know if your average Lotus that's 16 megabytes and so errors twinsies may watch Sunday's 761 make what hours be used in there for every base and most of it they're buying from the utilities if you take on average one pounds of co2 per kilowatt hour it's good average for singers might be a little bit less than threes 11 ouch gasps it's better Ohio is about two pounds because all the coal there it was very good that if you figured this out and get the numbers point you're going to come up with a horrendous number of greenhouse gas saved by one microgrids you're not going to pay the utility to get this tribute use get you one me to you and so the numbers there I do it to say months Presley they will be impressive yes sir because of the loss of power older long transfer so he's a percent of it the other part is it the nacelles a hard line up eric 24 facts that vision inefficient tackling the Lord transmission one yet but applause as far as the Terrorism ankle and everything there's not a soldier with an m16 standing on her every transmission of power they march across the country from hundreds of miles and like the people at Stanford a needle that were not genius terrorists they just walked into a government office and just started shooting people it was a symbol and the same thing just goes one of these powers put a load i am i over it knock it down and then an entire grid would go down that's my try to have ya got a purely you see if I their Navy line that's helped us borrowing 589 there the sunrise are on another 500 we've got several to an attorney giggling screaming down the coast any one of us do you take it out of here it's what's going to do it sit in effect bunch of our plants trimming off the spits cruz low and assisting everything I guess that's fine too surprising it's not yet oh good night back to one of your opening comments about 10 years from now someone else will be providing our energy I understand with marine corps that's going to be the Marine Corps providing their energy but back to the cities who you see providing the energy right now it's generated by large corporations like that RG and using SVG amy's transmission layers to get the power to come on suspect it will still be you to those if they're smart but they'll be doing 100 kilowatt fuel cells for communities they'll be doing guest her without doing the pv systems and I know they want to keep their jobs they want to keep their business their industry and like I said the only way they're going to do that is by putting generation didn't rate based on the customer site where guests doing it at petke MCAS yuma in the way askew you're going to do it to a 15 min one pd site we have up a pelican they were they were willing to finance that we we start talking can we changed a little bit way we're going to do it but they they would do as well and i think it's smart I think they can do it they have enough smarts to do that in its regulator supposedly regulate yeah I mean well you vote we vote when we fight about things ask yourself who did I vote for next time I like things in the maze thing okay other questions cons good thought is nobody's closely I must say I've had a conservatives I'm not an expert like a facial but wow there's a little bit in the leaflet was unbelievable I mean I learned more today lot expect to have a long time because it put it in factual ways how these things work together so bottom I thank you so much for coming and I thank everybody the guy Bob come here I think we all learned a lot today and the questions were very good too I mean they weren't very impressed with the questions of interaction nearly yes you want to say no I don't fit again thanks to the invasive crazy me know hey Ronnie need to ask me I think that otherwise would I even be a long time do you wanna ha i come on one side 72 g i'll see you scared me for a couple things you want to come we got it is you best to go and i want to focus on a few local issues first well everybody has an evaluation form would you please fill it up before you go today we get information and we get speakers based on the feedback you give us as well so first of all we have Aaron Aaron would you like to briefly give your veritas Pazzi cappers speak a purse or a group of people they're working on climate action plan for oceanside we have to be talking more about about five matches plans weird about CC eat Bay Community Choice energy and stuff so what you started she has a flyer to turn up his well ok my name is Aaron Morin and I'm a farmer in in oceanside california and I've very active with cappers which is climate action planners for the city oceanside we are a small group and we need every every two weeks friday at south coast tile but the hill street cafe and what we decide we came out with an outline of what we would like to see the city of Oceanside take action for
