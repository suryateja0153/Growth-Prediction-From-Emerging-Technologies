 can you build tomorrow's applications with yesterday's infrastructure I want to share how digital business is driving application changes which will profoundly impact your network new application developers have adopted agile and continuous development models to respond faster to business and customer needs these approaches have introduced containers and micro services is a way to simplify complex application development into smaller less risky software components with the benefits of portability and speed like cloud and big data containers and micro services will transform the traffic in your data center infrastructure as applications are disaggregated into many components services each service now becomes an endpoint to be accessed and shared across the network moving to a container based microservices architecture will increase the number of addressable endpoints in the data center by an order of magnitude or more cloud native application development also brings growth in distributed and IP based storage adding two endpoints scale and bandwidth needs within the data center cisco is responding to these scale and bandwidth requirements by releasing a new generation of nexus switches based on what we call cloud scale ASIC technology that delivers up to 12 times the ipv6 routes increased end hosts scale and increased endpoint density and eight times greater network segmentation we publish the advantage series papers to explain the innovations delivered by cloud scale technology and compared it to merchant silicon solutions take a look to learn more about the benefits of high forwarding scalability and contact your cisco account team to see how that translates into the operational simplicity that cisco ACI brings for network control and visibility thanks for watching you
