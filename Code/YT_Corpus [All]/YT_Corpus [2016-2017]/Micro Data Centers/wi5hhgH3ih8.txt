 hi everyone thanks for coming to this presentation in this presentation my name is Balaji traged I work in business unit cloud and IP in Ericsson today I'm going to talk about a network slicing and how what is the important role of the network slicing in as part of the 5g networks so at the beginning of the presentation I'm going to cover what's happening in the telecom industry and the pace that is taking place followed by that harmonic hour or because of that changes in you know businesses in telecom networks how that will affect the network itself and thirdly I'll talk about the role of network slicing how it will actually create new opportunities for the operators in the area of the 5g networks and they can deliver services to different vertical industries so this is the pace of change I'm talking about so if you see in the screen it took about hundred years to connect billion people right the telephone connectivity and then it only took 23 years to connect the next five billion people and now we also forecast by 2020 there will be about 26 billion connected devices meaning people to people things to things things to people those are the communication that type of communication will take place we also stay by our original vision of 50 billion devices as well so we are on path towards that so now you see what's happening in the in the pace of change in the telecom industry so here as part of that what I'm showing here is what will happen is one network that will deliver services to many many vertical industry for example both the Sdn and the virtualization nfe it's actually creating a programmable network and a service our network that'll actually expose certain network capabilities to the business layer then we can define those services to different vertical industries for example what will happen some of the vertical industries take for example the power plants or you know transport industry or a shipping industry some of this industry will need latency required very very low latency requirements and I security requirements and some of them will require high bandwidth so so that means each slice will have a different characteristics as we establish so the next slice this is very interesting so we talked about you know the vertical industry how the services will be delivered now what are the key function are the components that will enable this so if you take at the very first on the left hand side on the bottom virtualization so that is the first key step network function virtualization as we'll virtualize our current telecom network for example if you take a mobile network the virtual EPG virtual Mme virtual I'm has many functions that will be virtualized right that's the first step the second also important functionality to deliver that network slicing that is required is software-defined network Sdn Sdn will play a major role for example take Sdn will create connectivity for the intra data center connectivity as we create the VMS and the vnf the dynamic connectivity is done by the Sdn controller and so basically for example connecting the VMS using bx lam or MPLS or GRE all these connectivity is done by the Sdn controller and also the inter DC connectivity so once you have done the intraday dissenter you need to connect all the way to the radio base stations to deliver the mobile services right for the network slicing so the Sdn also will connect into and connectivity dynamically the next important thing is distributed cloud this is very important so what's happening in the industry today is you have the radio network where some components of the radio network will be coming towards local data centers so it will move from the radio base station towards the local data center what we call distributed local data centers right at the same time some of the core functions from the central cloud will also move towards the distributed data cloud for example mobile core EPG memy so you will see this movement of these functions to the distributed cloud more closer to the users there's another aspect and the key function to enable this network slicing then the third the fourth part is a network slicing itself that will create a logical network slice from the from the cloud to the transport to the mobile access or any access so many of us are aware people work in the IP industry we know it was Network slicing always there a logical networks that we build on transport network for example if you take l3 VPN l2 VPN eli neil and services they are technically a logical network right on a physical network so we have we have seen the network slicing but in the context of 5g networks we are talking network slice on a whole new level here we are talking about including the OSS BSS system will be network sliced so that means you can expose the entire network as a service to your vertical industries so that will enable the automation and delivery of services that's you know that's what it will happen when you create these networks slices then also the key part to all these things to blue actually what we are doing first of all we are creating a lot of tools we're making the our network very smart that's what all these people you know people come here that's for end of the day OpenStack open they like making the network agile programmable and expose it in abstracted way all the industry people are doing that once you have done that a smart network you also need a smart management system smart analytic system and the orchestration if you don't have that the networks are great but you're not delivering the service in a smart way efficient way to the end users because that's what automation comes the smart networks itself does not deliver that automation because you are looking at services that needs to be delivered in an automatic fashion so the top is a key layer then here in this slide what I'm saying is as part of the management and orchestration there are key things to remember in network slicing so you create a blueprint we start our template you know the open sources OSS so with the task for template you can create actually a blueprint of that Network slice that means characteristics of the radio network characteristics of the trends and also what virtual network function that needs to be defined all of this for a particular specific service for a specific industry you you create that in the template right that's based on your network capability we cannot create a service and expose to the end-user without knowing the capability of the network beyond the capabilities of the network so that's very important to know the capability of the network and that is exposed to the business layer right so you can see the different slices for example mobile broadband is one slice the massive MTC a machine type communication this is for IOT industry that's another slice it could be slices for different sectors right then under the context of network slicing the network resources is actually the vnfs itself a network resource the OSS DSS itself a network resource so it's not your porks or the NIC boards or network resource they're physical resources the entire function is a network resource and the transport is a network resource so all will be part of the blueprint as you create one large service network as a service to a enterprise customer or a vertical industry that's a key point in this slide what are the challenges in the 5g network as we transform slowly so today the services are provisioned pretty much in a static way some of them a little bit semi dynamic way by our operators and then in the Panda stack Phi G is actually it's happening today itself we're delivering multiple services over a single network that'll actually it will be amplified in 5g networks so then network has to be prepared for that and also the management system and our position system and analytic solution needs to be ready for that so those are the challenges the solution is will virtualize and model arise the virtual network function key functions into a smaller micro functions and then the 5g network slicing will let the operator and the users to dynamically provision services what is what is the result the result is a well optimized network that can actually deliver services for each and different users different vertical industries okay in the interest of time I'll just cover quickly about the networks lights architecture so as you see here as I was explaining there is a three layers here one is the business governments then there is a network governance and actual network itself where the slices are physically created logical slices so as you see the network governance layer is a key component of it it creates a blueprint based on the capability of the network and it exposes to the business layer now the business layer as you guys know many of us being in working with operators it has a product catalog and a service catalog with the product catalog actually the operator exposed the services to the end-users or the businesses different businesses so they will define okay this is the product that'll cost you so much money that comes to the order care flows to the system and then with the service catalog it will decompose and send it to the network governance layer but with respect to network slicing so we actually once you create you know network slice we expose that blueprint to the business layer what they will do is depending upon the verticals that they're going to deliver the services for example for an IOT security is a key factor and the latency could be you know much much below you know microseconds right and so those are the key parameters as input parameters they will insert into the network into the blueprint and send back to us and if you have a time I know today is the last day there is a demo we are demo for this exactly to show that and then the network slice governance layer will actually create a network slice logical networks list on the network so it is a product that I'm trying to show where the Ericsson network manager is part of that one component of the network governance right so as we see we compose and expose the network slice to the business layer and we'll do the full lifecycle management of that network slice and then also it does the resources configuration but also it will do the assurance for the lifecycle of the network slice I'll cover in my next presentation about analytics and assurance a little bit okay so actually so once we get as you see there is an orchestration engine so once we get the blueprint that blueprint will go into the orchestration engine orchestration engine will fire up many workflows it could be a couple of workflows and the sister or closed for a PG one could be for IMS one could be for Mme one could be for the transport it's all simultaneously fired up and then it'll pick up the configuration templates based on that it'll go and configure the network so last slide what are the key takeaways so Network slicing we see it's a key major catalyst for ICT transformation the slices will be created automatically dynamically and very securely and obviously the network slicing will create service agility and network agility for the operators and it will be it'll make a network to be used in optimised fashion very high utilization of the assets obviously because it will enable them the network slicing as part of the 5g networks to enter into the new verticals so that means a top-line good top line growth for the industry and also obviously it'll lower down because as automation and service agility and network as a little lower down the costs thank you
