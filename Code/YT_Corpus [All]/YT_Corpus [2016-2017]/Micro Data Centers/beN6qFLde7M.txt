 [MUSIC PLAYING] Data centers and computing centers like the MGHPCC are really a critical part of the infrastructure for information these days. And I think everybody recognizes how important that is. I think the test bed is a great way to find how to become more efficient in tomorrow's data centers. I do want to thank you all for coming. I'm excited to help launch this micro data center that we have outside. There's very few places that we can experiment with different sources of energy that then become more accessible across the country. But this is the first of its kind in New England. And I'm very proud to lead a city with such great partners. Data centers have now become very common. Practically every internet application that you use, whether it's Google or Facebook or Microsoft or Apple, all of these applications are on a data center somewhere. And the largest data centers can have electricity bills of millions of dollars a month. So what we are trying to do is build what we call a net zero data center. That's going to be extremely green. It's going to be lower power, the power of renewables, that helps us do all of the things that we love to do on our phones and our computers, but do it in an environmentally friendly manner.
