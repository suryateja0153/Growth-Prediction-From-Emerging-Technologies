 hi everyone welcome to the dev net zone theatre at Cisco live berlin next up we have Susie we talking to us about how api's are transforming Cisco solutions and catalyzing innovation ecosystem so just a couple quick things before we start in the definite zone we have several activities going on as you know you can find them on the web on the definite zone app or back at the information desk they have a iPad where you can find things like that talking about the definite zone app you can use that to get points to get prizes that we have we have hats scarves and power blocs and also we have some surveys there as you see if you could please fill it out when the certain when the sessions done and hand it to our friends in the orange vest or orange jackets back there that would be great and finally if you have not signed up for Deb net please do it's free it's great there's a Learning Labs ap is just go to developer Cisco calm and you can sign up for free all right thank you Susie great thank you Paul okay thank you everybody so today we'll be talking about again about how api's are transforming Cisco solutions and catalyzing an innovation ecosystem so I you know as you can see we're actually here in the dev net zone and you know what is the definite zone so definite is actually Cisco's new developer program it's actually been in effect for about two years so the thing about definite is that you know before Cisco had different efforts and developers but it wasn't really kind of mainstream didn't have enough critical mass behind it and then what happened was you know we were actually really trying to evangelize to start out and really form definite and so basically we said cisco has a software strategy cisco has a software strategy if you're going to be serious about having a software strategy you need to have a developer strategy because really developing software is about creating a larger ecosystem and really getting a set of developers around it and that's how we started definite so here what we've done is thought about it in this way so as we know there's actually you know a really large portfolio of products that Cisco has they actually spanned the Internet of Things cloud networking data center collaboration security and services and what happens is these are actually very interesting building blocks for you know that are used to build out any infrastructure and really in delivering new applications and experiences as well but what we wanted to do was actually take those building blocks make sure that we start to create an API layer on top of it and make that into a platform for innovation where other developers can come in and basically grow and other developers can actually innovate on top of this so in doing this definite is about looking at the developer first so devnet is for treating the developer is the customer where we're looking at the guy or gal who codes and really making sure there's the right resources for them it's about creating the right and really vibrant developer ecosystem where again we can actually have larger solutions where you know not only does Cisco innovate but really the larger ecosystem innovates and we're about providing market opportunities for developers as well now an interesting principle that we have indefinite is that first of all innovation is catalyzed by a developer ecosystem through programmable platforms and api's so it might sound like a lot of words but once again when you know not only do you allow to developers to code but what you're really doing is pushing a broader innovation effort and that's what you're really catalyzing by open up these different api's now overall let's take a look at some of the innovation drivers that are happening in networking so so some of the innovation drivers are actually shown here so first of all there's the space of just networking itself so right now networking is undergoing I would say one of the biggest transformations in decades where networking is actually now moving towards software so we have software-defined networking there's actually also things like network function virtualization this really greatly changes how networking is done we know that this transition already happened in compute or compute moved to virtualization and software control and that transformation is now happening in the network as well now in addition to network programmability and api's there have been other types of innovation drivers which is the cloud ification okay the clarification of applications and services and how those are run so clearly the cloud is a very important element the clarification also involves the network itself in terms of really requiring the connectivity between different applications that span multiple data centers across service provider networks and these things that are all owned by different domains as well so that's a really interesting innovation driver that's happened as well the last area is that there's also now the network is evolving in the network is actually impacting applications and experiences so you know not only is the network like providing the connectivity and the plumbing you know for the network packets to move but there's actually capabilities being built into the network that's actually allowing new applications and experiences to be built and we'll be talking about some of that today now in addition to the technology drivers there's actually a whole set of of changes that are going on in the developer experience as well so there's a developer experience where there's developer tools and platforms that are available so in this new world of programmability of cloud fication new apps and experiences there's a number of platforms developer platforms and developer tools that are being provided if you want to work in this new area I wouldn't start from scratch I would actually use these set of tools that are becoming available another shift that's happening in the developer experience is that not only is developing about developing it's also about developing and deploying your software it's about developing deploying and operating it and so this is a big shift so it's you know takes us all the way through devops and then you know the last shift in the actual developer experience is that there's actually an innovation ecosystem and you know once again there's a broader ecosystem the way that innovation gets done has actually been transformed where there's of course a lot of innovation happening within companies and you know in different proprietary areas and different technologies but in addition a lot of innovation is happening in a broader open source world as well in this larger community coming together is again another way to advanced technology so let's take a look here at one of these areas so let's look at some of the new apps and experiences that can be created in the Internet of Things so as we know there is a there's there's a big shift that's going on you know right in front of us as we have the move towards the Internet of Things and you know again this is a new area that's coming to and if we look at the Internet of Things we can look at it as an evolution going from crawling to walking and then to running when we look at crawling you know some of the first IOT apps were about one thing connecting to one app and then giving experiences based on that if we go over to the walk portion of this then what we know for walk is that there's actually now many things connected to many apps so they're starting to be some more growth in there but as we move on there's going to be a scaling that really takes part and in the scaling then what there is is there's actually many things in many apps but in addition there's so much data that's generated and this ends up being many times per second there's a lot of real-time streaming data that's coming through and once again this is what's really needed in this whole new world of experiences so this is an evolution that's happening and then we're all together really working on on making this real now within devnet we actually have a number of innovation projects that we actually have in order to help developers do more things you know or actually to showcase innovations that other you know developers have have put in then they want to showcase them so we have something that we created called devnet labs which is a place to show some of the innovations that are built on top of these platforms or built for developers and we have one project that we have called dev IOT and in this project what we did was we asked ourselves what is an IOT app so if I asked you all what's an IOT app you know it's kind of interesting to think about you know what a mobile app is but what's an IOT out and then if I said go and build one you know go and build an IOT out then you'd have to think about well what would you do so think about how you would build it well if someone said to me build an IOT app what I would do is I would you know kind of look on the internet i would say okay let's get a raspberry pi or an arduino grab that let's grab a few sensors you know let's try to make something happen let's get it I wave my hand over this thing and I make an LED light up and I'll say hey that's an IOT app well of course that's the first thing that someone would do and that's actually a good example and really anybody can do this very easily these days but that's only the beginning right so when we really talk about the Internet of Things we can actually look at let's just take this conference facility imagine that the infrastructure of this whole conference facility is internet and IOT enabled if it's IOT enabled then there's actually sensors in different areas it's detecting where people are going it's detecting the environmental conditions and then go ahead and analyzing that data taking actions to really make interesting outcomes happen so that's much more complicated than just going through and you know writing your little IOT out another question that we ask ourselves is who's going to use that I OTL and who's going to program it well if we take this example again of the conference facility then it actually might not be the software developer who's you know kind of in his corner writing these apps but it actually might be used during operation right and actually the facilities folks or the conference workers or even yourselves as users might be the ones that are programming that infrastructure so what we've done is we actually have have a project called dev I OT and what we've done is created a developer environment that makes it simple to create this type of IOT app and let me show you a video of this at Cisco were passionate about creating innovations that solve hard problems especially when it comes to developers the Internet of Things is an evolving technology with a complicated landscape it's difficult to connect all your things get your data analyzed in real-time and deploy your solutions into real operational environments Deb IOT is a cisco definite innovation project that lets you build the next generation of IOT experiences this developer tool lets you design your solution generate code and deploy into your devices quickly we want to make I OT real for you wanna see how this all works let's walk through a quick manufacturing scenario let's start with the fame maker from my library of connected things I'm going to drag and drop my machines onto the campus and connect to a cisco networking device this lets me collect and consolidate data I'll also connect to a visualization widget so I can see it now I can instantly view my machine data like up time down time and where my machine arm is located if you make the things used in IOT systems this will help fix issues fast and improve your supply chain because you'll know what's working and what's not what if you're in sales and you need to customize a demo first I'm going to drag and drop my device components onto my canvas I'll also connect to a cisco networking device and my iot cloud so i can see the data and generate a dashboard view now I'll set up rules and policies letting my app send notifications to the maintenance team and generate performance dashboards automatically in addition I want operators to get messages firsthand so I'll connect to Cisco collaboration technologies like spark control go imagine doing a sales pitch and selling to your prospective customers with a physical solution demo it's easy to use intuitive to create a more powerful to show let's imagine your facilities operator and you want to see the operations dashboard in real time now that I have my solution and logic view let's click on map view here I see the actual floor plan of my facility as an operator I'm interested in viewing one floor and seeing my machine sensor data laid out on the floor plan ultimately this helps streamline my building operations optimizing my dollars in energy in the long run in all these scenarios were dealing with a real life customer situation where easy quick and intuitive IOT solutions are necessary with Cisco dev IOT we help simplify the complexity by streamlining development and managing deployment making things easier as we transform into a more connected world Cisco helps you accelerate your transition into a viable digital business okay so what you see there is that you know again an IOT app is actually much richer than you know the little raspberry pi Arduino example and there's a few things if we go back to the question what is an IOT app well we can say a few things about it it spans things right the physical things that that people are using it includes data and analytics and it allows you to take actions as well it actually involves an ecosystem so again in this example or the manufacturing example somebody makes the machines somebody make some of the solutions and it might be a different company that's actually operating this so there's a whole ecosystem that comes together the solution can you know not only you know solve operational issues and provide but it can actually grow up and actually provide business value as well so really solving business goals as well and then it also requires the full IT stack there's a lot of networking compute storage and cloud that's all involved in this and another thing is that when we looked at who's programming and who's using it it can actually be programmed during use so programmed in use by for example the operational technology folks so this is really fundamentally different about IOT apps and we're hoping that this innovation tool will actually make this come too now let's take a look at other ways that the network is actually helping to provide new apps and experiences so an interesting part is now in mobility and location so we have a product called cmx the connected mobile experience and what this is is cisco's Wi-Fi access points and and what happens is these Wi-Fi access points now give you location information now if you think about how Wi-Fi is done you know you're here at the convention and while you're at the convention you know you actually are joined in on the conference wireless network and as you move around between different buildings or even move across the floor then you actually get handed off between different access point Cisco actually has something called the mobility services engine which actually helps you to connect all of those access points and it's also telling you you know when you hand off how can you stay connected it's also collecting the location information that you have that the mobile folks have so for instance when I come in with my device my device is always looking for a wireless network so even if I haven't logged into it then basically it still knows I'm here because it's saying would you like to connect would you like to connect so what happens is you know the there's a knowledge about the locations the mobility information about that device so with that cmx has Maps API is to actually get maps of the place to get real-time location information of the things that are moving around you can actually get location history and then also there's actually a notification API that actually shows movements you know when is something moved or the presence did something become present so this is actually just really interesting building blocks in which bigger things can be done so we have another definite labs innovation project that we call glance and what we asked ourselves is how can we gain more insights take more actions and gain business value by using location and what you see here is a picture you know it's one thing for a wireless access point to again provide connectivity but what if it actually and it's another thing for it to provide location but what if you could actually figure out when somebody's moving around and they spent you know a few hours in this area moved around spent an hour here and what path they took all of a sudden you start to get very rich information that could be very valuable for example to a retailer who's trying to understand what's going on so here what we have is some is an innovation in which we're actually looking at and using that information and now doing things like navigating indoors so if I take a look here now what we can actually do is again load maps into it you know dive in to take a look at what's going on you know take a look and find some information about for example the definite zone I get some more information and then zoom in and here we are in the theater right here so now imagine that we can actually put heat maps over this that show where things are busy you know where the hot spots are and then we can actually understand the paths that people are taking and then you can actually provide services like indoor navigation to help people get from one place to another and find and decide where they're going in addition we've actually furthered this in added kind of context so an interesting problem that happens is that you know when you're at a conference you want to find somebody you want to find the definite expert you want to find the expert on location you want to find the expert on the Internet of Things can actually have people register in and create a service like this where you can then go and see where the experts are do a query and actually find the right expert so again it provides a very interesting way to now just build up from location itself and provide some compelling services that are really important for people so now let's take a look at some new apps and experiences in collaboration so I think that there was a there's talk by yen's meggers earlier to talk about some of the new collaboration technologies that we have and there's actually some cisco cloud collaboration platforms and there's two of them one is called cisco spark and then the other is called cisco troppo and what happens is this collaboration is really you know can be viewed as an app itself but it can also be viewed as a capability that's being built in on which other apps and services can be made so just to dive in the spark a little bit it includes you know a very rich way of creating groups for groups creating rooms and then in real time sending messages back and forth between these different between the people in these different rooms in addition it integrates with voice and video and there but if we take a look at some of the api's to do this they're just some simple api's which you can specify people and add people to groups and take them away you can specify rooms and put people into different rooms and then you can send messages into different rooms so these are the basic building blocks and let me just give you an example of a way that we've actually used it for our own internal operations so you know we have an always-on service called the sandbox so when developers want to write apps they can actually use our sandbox to have a running version of a contact center a running version of a live network with us an SDN solution in there and they can write apps to it by actually logging into the sandbox environment while our team has to constantly monitor that to see if there's ever any issues or downtime and if there's a downtime then we have to actually get in there and solve that as quickly as we can so what we've actually done is created a system by using these ap is where we're constantly monitoring our sister services and we're using different services for that and then when an issue happens we just send a spark message to the folks in the room to the folks who can be responsible to fix it and that allows them to get in on the call in the past that might have been automated and done through email but when people are working you know or you know supposed to be monitoring over the weekends or at night this is actually a messaging service is really a more is a better way to actually get that kind of real-time notification done we also have a service called troppo an troppo is a is a voice and messaging service cloud service that's being offered and with troppo you can actually do things like make calls and send messages you know do conferencing you can send text messages you can do things like record a message and say you know you know hello pressors say one in order to go to the next operation so there's actually a lot of very interesting capabilities that you can do for voice and messaging using the tropo cloud service it's actually much richer than what I said it has things like services like number provisioning voice calling text messaging advanced call control and it has rich media controls using the tropo cloud now something that we actually want to announce here is that for this service it was originally operated in the US but can be used and what is just recently being done is that we actually are having a trope ODU instance that we're developing to offer the same service with with some of our servers actually located in the EU to actually really service and grow this capability to to the European Union so now I'm going to move on to talk a little bit about Network programmability so we're talking about the network earlier and the move in networks to programmability and AP is so let's take a look at this a little bit closer so as we know in the infrastructure it's actually you know fairly complex there's a lot of storage networking and compute resources that are being used to run different jobs and these can be done within different data centers they can actually be run across enterprise networks they can be also of course traveling across service providers as well as we enter this world of network programmability there's actually a few levels of programmability that are provided so one is programmability in the devices themselves so as you have again the complexity of a lot of devices that are operated you know across the network compute resources storage devices as well then it's actually important as they become programmable what's happening and what you can actually see here is that cisco is actually pushing forward and providing api's into these different devices into our storage networking products into our storage products are compute resources in our switching networking products as well so there's a lot of a device level programmability that's being provided now in addition as we move to software-defined networking then what's happening is not only do we have the devices that are becoming programmable but there's now a controller layer where controllers are actually bringing together that type of information across the network and what happens is the old way that you would actually run and manage this network is very manual be talking to each of the devices trying to do configurations and when you want to actually operate some type of service or change some service setting across it it's a very manual and tedious operation but what the controllers do is help bring that information together allow you to do some of the automation across those devices and actually specify kind of policies that can be deployed across the service on top of the controllers themselves we have some rest api is that let you do things like automation and orchestration that let you run applications like collaboration and security across this as well so let's take a look at a little example so here we have an example of network automation with security and let's see how we can actually put these together when we have some programmability involved a really important problem that people have to solve is detecting threats in the network so when you determine ad we actually have a product called Sourcefire which is actually very good at threat detection and remediation so if there's some bad traffic going on your network then sourcefire will help detect that threat as the threat is detected it sends it up to a source fire defense center now once that threat is detected then some remediation needs to happen so what it does then is through its api's sends some action over to a piccy m and tells it there's some bad traffic it then needs to update the devices for example the ackles and the access control to try to block that bad traffic across the entire network so this is actually an interesting way of bringing together security and network automation together to have a better solution so the security is actually done by itself using source fire which is specialized in that but then you wouldn't ask it to then go and deploy it across the network that's where a pic en comes in and actually does the automation to actually to do this so I'm again it shows an example I believe that Jeff Reed had talked a lot about the newest advancements in I am in his keynote and this just gives a flavor of some of the power that's behind that ok so now also in this area of network programmability there's a lot of efforts that we're doing in the area of open source and that really the broader open source community is really doing to develop this so you know in open source we know that for example in the compute world there's efforts like OpenStack which is really helping us as we go to a virtualized world of compute resources to bring software control and virtualization in the area of compute now in addition there's there's an effort called open daylight which is actually bringing together virtualization and software control of networking and then there's actually a project called OPN fe which brings these things together now what Cisco is done is cisco's contributing very heavily to OpenStack specifically within a part called neutron which is the networking area of OpenStack and for the networking portion of OpenStack in Neutron Cisco's actually the number one contributor to this effort also one of the top five OpenStack members that's top six code reviewers as well so very active in this area now in the area of open daylight cisco is actually also very active in its contributions at both in terms of the number of commits really contributing quite heavily as well as in the number of lines of code and in addition it's actually not you know only Cisco in these areas at Cisco Red Hat brocade you know the Linux Foundation many groups are actually working together to move these areas forward now what's also interesting is something called OPN fe so you know we talked about the the area of development but then the move to dev ops and development and deployment so what happens is OPN fe is an open-source effort in which case it brings together OpenStack and open daylight and as it's bringing that together to both manage your compute networking and storage resources then they're still comes the question of how do we make these things run and so what OPN fe is actually also adds components for integration continuous integration and deployment for doing testing on these systems as they're running as well and really putting in requirements to make it real so it's actually really interesting how open source has moved from not only doing source code but also pushing forward into the DevOps and space as well now I you know we had a panel earlier on open source and there was a really good discussion about taking Sdn and making it real within you know within an enterprise and there was some talk about you know both the benefits and the challenges around doing that and what happens is there may be companies that want to adopt using something like an open daylight solution but sometimes you actually also very much need some of the kind of enterprise care and support and things that are associated with that so another product that cisco has is something called the open SDN controller and this is really based on open daylight so it's continuously building in the newest versions of the source code and in addition what it's doing is actually providing some special some some additional features that actually really help different customers make this real and be able to deploy it within their own infrastructure now one thing is we talked about this world of SDN and network function virtualization NFV we're now talking about doing a lot of networking operations in software and that's really an interesting thing if you think about it because we know that the network has to work really hard its mission critical there's a lot of really heavy duty operations that the network performs now there's been a lot of innovation in in basically s CNN Fe and the cloud as we've been discussing and a lot of this is in the control plane services that are associated with networking but we know that to really make this real and to make it scale we not only need some control plane services but what we have to look at is the actual data plane itself as well and the question is when it really comes down to move the data are we going to be able to move it fast enough in the software world you know and really be able to do this in a way that scales so there's actually a new effort that was actually just announced last week and David Ward talked about it in his innovation talk this week which is around creating an open-source effort called FDI oh that's working on really creating a platform for data plane services so this is a Linux Foundation effort again brand-new created effort which is really trying to create a platform for data plane services that are one really based on high performance also is very modular and extensible so it can actually do different types of networking operations I in software and then is also open source and interoperable and so in this brand new effort that's actually been created just recently what we've actually done is is is actually open source this work within the Linux Foundation to take a deeper look what we see here is actually the stack of you know of a system and the place that FDI o works is actually down in the data plane services and what it does is accelerate the packet processing of the network packets in the network I oh and this is actually still done in user space so it can actually still be done you know in software but what it's doing is again accelerated the data plane itself now there's a the heart of the technology that's actually in the heart of FDI o is something that's developed in Cisco that's called vector packet processing and what happens is as you actually think about you know operating network functions in software then you actually take a network that comes in a packet and process it take a packet process it take a packet and process it but what FDI o is doing is looking at vector packet processing where it's actually bringing as many packets together as possible and then carrying it through its operations and by doing this we can actually get you know huge improvements in the actual scalability that happens when you're using these software software functions you know and and when you're actually doing this they actually continue to scale in a very big way now FDI o works within the larger solution open source solutions in this way so there's OpenStack with Neutron which has a plug-in and odl which is in the control plane and then FDI o is down in the data plane to really provide those operations and again they can be used on bare metal they can be used in a virtualized environment they can be used in a container based environment as well so it's a very exciting new activity to show you another place that we're actually working in open source and this is where we're actually moving a forward an innovation project that we call next and what what we've hit here is the problem of how do you visualize what's happening in a network and how do you visualize and view network topologies so this is an HTML javascript framework for actually developing and showing topologies and this is actually used in a number of ways and it can be do things to show nodes and to show you know paths and show traffic that's actually moving across these different areas it actually lets you zoom in and zoom out and really open and close different network notes that you can actually view your network at different scales now we actually have provided this as a tool and we've actually released it in this certain way so basically first we actually developed it internally and we made it a tool for internal use in some of our different products and research efforts really focused on using the next UI toolkit then what happened is we made it available as an SDK for definite members at one of our first definite developer conferences in jun 2015 so then we actually progressed it further and we actually released next as open source within the opendaylight efforts and that was in august 2015 and right now next is actually becoming part of an official odl release this month so this actually shows how we actually started with something as an internal innovation and then really worked it across and now pull through open source so very exciting effort now what I want to show you is actually the evolution of this and what question that we've been asking ourselves is how do you visualize data effectively and in a user-friendly way and what we've extended this tool and right now it's still internal is to look at next 20 so again with one dotto address networking and what it does next is now grow to actually show IOT and indoor navigation and then also growing to address the problem of big data visualization as well and again there's a number of additional modules that were built into what next one dot o did and let me actually show you just a short video that shows some of what it's used for so earlier I showed you the glance innovation that we were working on and actually all of this view is actually based using next 20 so it's actually built using that library can actually do different things like you know create different modules and be able to drag and drop and actually compose these things in different ways so we talked about dev IOT and you saw that interface that was also built using next in addition as we move between these areas you see the indoor navigation that's done and this was also built using next 20 so there's actually a lot of capabilities that are being built in and currently we're working on it internally but we'll work along a similar timeline to make that available as well okay so now I want to move to the area of cloud and so looking at the areas we said there's cloud ification is a big innovation driver that's going on and then also the move to not only for developers have developed but to develop deploy and operate so as Barry had mentioned in his talk and and also as Nick girl had mentioned in his innovation talk there's a real shift that's going on in the industry as we go from client-server computing to going to cloud into thin mobile clients and virtualization and now the move is shifting towards containers and micro services to allow a more flexible of these kind of apses microservices and this actually requires or creates a change in how applications are developed as well as in the infrastructure below it but it provides much more kind of flexibility and agility and performance in this infrastructure now as you're developing in this new world then there's many tools that are available for processing big data for working in this cloud environment and for developing in it and there's actually you know really a whole set of tools that range from stream processing to analyzing data to you know really collecting it and these are all different areas that are being developed you know in open source in ways that different people can use now if you're a developer and you haven't been working actively in this space all these tools are ready for you and so what you need to do is really you know and you wanted to build now in IOT or a big data application would you start from scratch it's actually really good to utilize these different tools and so the tools are good but it still takes a lot of work to bring them together now what we have is we actually have an open source innovation that's called mantle mantle do and mantle and the nickel had just talked about this in some of our cloud efforts and what this is is actually helping you to build a container based infrastructure that can run microservices and it's using many of the tools that are shown up here on the right side you know but again if you wanted to take all those together and turn them into you know a good container based infrastructure there's a lot of work to make them work together so it's actually an open source effort that actually brings together these things to do provisioning of VMs cluster management and scheduling adds infrastructure services and support apps of things that you would need to run this infrastructure so within mantle containers are first-class citizens it actually allows us to now seamlessly integrate resources not only within a data center but across data centers you know enterprise data centers and SPS the other thing is when you're actually kind of unifying these things sometimes the application developer doesn't want to deal with how you put those resources together but it actually allows the network to unify those platforms using a lot of using different networking technologies that have been you know very well established and developed and then what the developer has to do is define the policy in their application but then let the network itself enforce it across the stack and so this some mantle is a new open-source effort that we've put together you can go to mantle do and actually really get a stack that will get you going in a container friendly way now what's interesting is that there's actually different open-source efforts that have really been made to be able to flexibly do virtualization and network control and resource management across a single data center but some of the capabilities of mantle are basically allowing us to do the same type of resource optimization and management across multiple data centers using some of the underlying networking technology so this is actually a very interesting effort that we have and I encourage you to take a look at mantle daioh and ken Owens is the CTO who's actually been developing this and it's a very interesting very interesting effort now let's go talk about you know it's great that this exists but what does it mean for the developer experience so it's kind of interesting to back think back to how development was done and there was a time when writing code was about a developer tool and an IDE and then source code so you could use something like eclipse have a source code repository and kind of that was development you guys remember those good old days but then it's actually changed and evolved so now it's actually then changed to involve not only developer tools and source code but also continuous integration and continuous deployment in addition it's actually gone beyond that so it's beyond beyond the build and develop part to the deploy part but now also to involve application orchestration service assurance and issue management so now what you're doing is going from build to deploy to operate and so this is actually now you know a not much bigger development chain that you need to work on in this new cloud world and what happens is there's a number of tools that are being available to really help in all of these different areas and once again the tools are very helpful but now when it comes to a developer to use them there might be still a lot of work to put these together now in addition when developers are working across these different domains communication becomes very important as well and there's this it's important to have collaboration tools that again let you know the coders talk to the operators and things there now once again there's a lot of power in these tools but we want to make it easy for developers and what what cisco has done is created a project called Cisco project shipped and what it does is create a developer environment for developers who want to write apps on this type of container based infrastructure so you can say that shipped is actually the developer experience it's the developer ide for writing these cloud-based apps and so what happens is it actually allows you to do things and you know both writing the code doing the continuous integration and deployment as well as the operations and it looks complicated but the key is that there's a developer experience that allows you to do this very easily you actually walk through a wizard specify you know the types of environments that you want to run the place that you want to deploy it and you can actually go from your code to get your code into production within five minutes and so this is actually on on Cisco ship I oh and you can actually look at get it from the definite page as well and really learn about how to really take out the complexity and all of these underlying tools are being used in here and mantle is actually underlying it as well so you can actually get quickly get going and work in this way so so that actually shows you like quite a few different areas that we've actually worked through and what we can see is that the landscape has changed quite a bit and we know that with devna what we're really trying to do is really enable the developers and so let's take a look at the mission of definite so when we are real our vision is to really be able to help developers build solutions and grow their careers because as we said it's really all about the developer ecosystem and it's about the developers themselves now when we first started definite we thought that we're building a developer program it's all about coding and of course that's important we want to provide tools and let people code and let the ecosystem develop and then when we had our first developer conference we actually created a lot of learning materials so people could learn the newest technologies learn the you know latest coding coding technologies as well as a you know networking technologies and collaboration technologies as well but it turns out that a huge value proposition of devnet that our developers were interested in was actually in the learning so you know really definite is working across all of these different areas and then developers also need ideas on the different areas that you can work and I hope that today I showed you some of the inspire some of the different innovations that kind of give you a feeling for what can be done when you have different platforms that have api's exposed as building blocks that are now available to you so we have definite labs for that in addition in definite there's the learning portion and it turns out that a big part of what was interesting to developers is teaching them to code so we have a set of coding classes called coding 101 and 102 up to coding 201 and 301 and these are helping people to get familiar with rest to get familiar with JSON to use Python and put all of these things together so this is a full set of coding classes and what's interesting if you look at a network operator a network operator who wants to learn about Sdn so that they can make it real within their environment well the network operator has been awesome at networking and it's an awesome technologist running mission-critical networks you know just really an amazing skill set there but they probably have encoded as their day job for about 10 or 20 years so how do you take that technical person and let them learn about it well they can actually do it through these coding classes and learning labs and they not only learn about how to code by going off and say learn to code and write a web page but they learn about how to code by making calls to a running version of an SDN network with routers and a pic um and then making rest calls to get the information about the devices in the network or set a policy within the network so it's a very interesting way for people to learn in addition there's a set of online learning labs which are helping people again take these coding classes and to learn about different types of api's and what this is doing is helping people springboard from where they are so once again getting to a new domain so it could be a network operator getting to the area of being able to work and software-defined networking and automation and orchestration it might be taking a developer and then springboarding them in collaboration in springboarding them to be able to use cloud collaboration as well so that's another feature in terms of coding there's more and more technologies that we're bringing in and trying to make those available to developers and just recently we've actually brought on 15 new cisco technologies into definite to make it accessible for the broader our broader developer ecosystem you know in addition I told you about the sandbox which is real life systems that are running and allow developers to go and develop on them and these are the new ones that we've deployed so overall the evolution of definite has been you know quite interesting we didn't know what the interest would be but we're fighting out is developers are hungry developers want to innovate developers want to really create in this ecosystem our definite membership started with about fifty thousand people a couple of years ago and it's actually already grown in these two years to 370,000 developers we have definite zones within Cisco lives which are developer conferences within the larger Cisco live conference and we've had that in every theater you know we've created a developer portal at developer Docs is cocom which brings in 230,000 average page views per month so people are hungry of on-boarded new product sets we have new learning labs and we're having hackathons all the time for folks and then a new thing that we're going to be doing is really looking at communities of interest to help people develop and we're actually launching a definite woman in tech community as well as a definite kids community to help there as well so you can actually find more and join devnet at developer.android.com a B this can mean more so first of all in the area again of network innovation drivers we talked about the shift in software and networking to go from networking to have software control in network function virtualization so we talked about the move to network programmability we showed that example there and we showed this also in terms of a p.m. and the device level program ability and the controller level programmability that we're providing as well as the open-source efforts in this area we talked about cloud ification and the move to new developer to new environments that involve the cloud and as we're looking at this area we actually have tools that are really focused on containers and micro services to provide more agility in this cloud ified world but then providing tools that actually help people develop in these areas we have new apps and experiences that are that are now enabled by the network whether they're in location collaboration and the Internet of Things so it's very exciting about the capabilities that are being provided by the network in terms of these new apps and experiences when we talked about the developer experience and how that has really progressed starting from the developer tools and platforms and there's many new ones that have come up in just the last couple years but then really making those than a way that's easier to use for you we talked about how development has changed from just developing to develop deploy and operate and once again all the tools available there and I hope that we showed overall that developers and developer platforms are not just about development but it's about creating a larger innovation ecosystem so that different solutions can come together and provide more value to customers so this has been really the key and you know Cisco is very committed to working towards this innovation ecosystem by again exposed ap is in providing an innovation platform that the broader ecosystem then can then come together in innovate in thank you very much alright thank you Susie very much and thank you for attending and if you could please fill out the survey and hand him looks like our orange shirt hurts not there anymore so please hand them to me thank you very much
