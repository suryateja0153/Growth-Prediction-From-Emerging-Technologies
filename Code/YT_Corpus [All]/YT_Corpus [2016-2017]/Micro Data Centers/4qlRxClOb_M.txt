red button a member of our webcast support team will work with you to correct your problem so without any further housekeeping it gives me great pleasure to introduce today's speaker Thomas Baum Thomas whenever you're ready Thank You Patrick and hello everyone today we're going to cover 28 gauge twisted pair cabling systems in their application for today's telecom rooms and data centers and this is an exciting topic because these new 28 gauge cabling systems can be used immediately to help with current TR and data center challenges now what exactly is 28 gauge cabling quite simply it's smaller sized cabling due to the smaller stage of wire used in the cable for example most current patch cords use 24 gauge wire and for a category 6 patch cord that looks like the red cord below what customers now have the choice to use 28 gauge cabling in many cases and for a patch cord that looks like the blue cord below which as you can see is much smaller in size our goal today is to outline what those sides advantages mean to telecom room and data center applications and also provide tools to help you understand if 28 gauge cabling is a good fit for your situation so why is there so much excitement about 28 gauge cabling systems for today's PR and data center challenges well whether we're talking about TRS or data centers we're all being we we're all being asked to do more with less there and as we see in the picture which I'm sure many of you can relate to common count common challenges are things like downsized and small or crowded TRS congested pathways space for new equipment that's coming or using high-density panels as a way to try to increase the density but having difficulties there you also need it for category 6 and 6a systems which are currently being installed and you're probably looking for both greenfield or new installation or brownfield retrofit or revision applications to a key point here and the reason that we're talking about telecom rooms and data centers for this cabling is it the space within those two areas is prime real estate suited to its function and the cabling equipment combined there yet as we can see in the picture the copper patch cabling often drives how well we can meet the space challenges there for example we can see in the TR rack shown that while there is available rack space in the upper left for new equipment there's little or no room to effectively add the patch cabling that would be needed and this is a very common challenge therefore it's try to solve these issues in the TR and data center we'll be looking specifically at the role 28 gauge patch cords can have in addressing the space challenges and just so you know 28 gauge cabling can also be used in other portions of the channel with many of the same benefits but since their focus is within the TR and data center will focus on patch cabling today so common patch cabling challenges being in the telecom room and data center are these shown whether it's crowding or congestion that makes moves adds and changes more time-consuming and looking at the pictures going from the switch to the panel that could be patching bulk at the switch entering or within the pathways or at the patch panels trying especially when when using high-density panels having challenges with normal cabling or in the bottom right picture the use of space consuming layouts that do make it easier to work with the patch cable in bold but at the expense of added equipment cost being horizontal managers and low rack utilization all of these drive up network costs whether higher operating expense do two at a time four moves adds and changes or higher capital expense from equipment costs or the cost of low rack utilization the goal then is how to address these cabling challenges in the telecom room and data center to help lower costs which brings us back to 28 gauge cabling and why it's just recently begun to be used within telecom rooms and data centers historically a big influence has been the TI a 568 standard first released 24 years ago 91 which established the hundred meter maximum length for a copper cable channel and incorporated common cable sizes at the time with 24 gauge cabling being very typical as a carryover from the telecommunications twisted pair cabling but as we've seen there are new challenges in the data centers TRS overtime your than buying new network capabilities and those have caused the industry to consider new ways to best solve the critical space issues within that prime real estate and that is behind the excitement about 28 gauge cabling in the telecom room and data center not only is it significantly smaller than the typical 24 gauge cabling like we see in the picture with 24 gauge cabling in red on the left and 28 gauge in blue on the right but it can actually be used today in most common telecom room and datacenter scenarios to help solve the space challenges with increased pathway capacities higher density layouts easier cable management and ultimately lower costs being the result stay with me over the coming slides and we'll dig deeper into how 28 gauge cable and does this but a simple way to think about why 28 gauge cabling makes sense is the statement giving up 7% to get over a hundred percent back now most people would do that and they are doing it and by the end of this presentation you will know exactly what we mean by this statement let's take a closer look now at the exact size advantage of 28 gauge cabling by comparing it to typical 24 gauge cabling here are the diameters and true to scale images of available twenty-four gauge patch cords in category 5e six and six eight performance levels and just a quick note that all of the dimensions that I'll be referencing in the presentation from available Panduit product not just because we have all these products but because I can't speak to specific dimensions of other suppliers products so just to keep everything fair will be discussing dimensions with Panduit product now here skill sizes of available 28-gauge patch cords in comparison where you can immediately see the advantage in reduced size and reduce patching bulk with the 28 gauge cords actually taking less than 50% of the space of traditional cords you can imagine what that can do for your pathway capacities next we'll take a look at what the size advantage means within telecom room and data center racks and pathways for example here is a typical vertical manager finger opening of one inch with a true to scale bundle of 24 gauge patch cords based on the dimensions that we just saw as you can see with 24 gauge cords a 24 cable bundle of those cords is already interfering with the finger opening meaning it will be hard to work with in comparison here is the true to scale bundle of 24 of the 28 gauge cords again based on the dimensions that we just looked at which have a diameter less than the opening size as a bundle and therefore fit easily and can easily be worked with another common pathway area to see the 28 gauge advantage is the vertical manager in its cabling capacity in this example we'll look at a very common 4 inch manager size and we'll look at it fill to a 50% fill ratio so we'll be looking at the gray area shaded on the screen we use 50% fill because that level is essentially considered full by 4 working capacity and note that we're looking through a section of the manager with the door closed so as we look at this comparison for the 24 gauge cabling on the Left which is in red we can see the capacity would be 213 category 6 patch cords we're on the right for 28 gauge cabling which is in blue using the same fill ratio the capacity would be 523 cables an increase of a hundred and forty six percent or in this case over three hundred more cords now imagine what more than doubling the capacity of your existing manager could mean in the case of many of the 4-inch managers that I'm sure many of us have seen that would mean actually being able to fit the cabling in the manager and close the doors so now we're beginning to see how 28-gauge cabling increases capacity limitations in existing applications and also want to point out that this 146 percent increase in capacity in that prime real estate where you need it most this is the over 100 percent reference from our earlier statement now let's take a look at the space between cables when cat6 patch cords are plugged into a typical switch or patch panel for the 28 I'm sorry for the 24 gauge cords on the left in red the open space between the cables as you can see is just over three hundred thousandths of an inch where for the 28 gauge cables on the right in blue there is four hundred thousands of open space between the cords now this may not sound like much but it's actually 27% more open space which actually means a number of benefits first of all that means better port number visibility especially when using high-density panels as you can see in the picture it also means easier cord management sensor is spaced four fingers and plug access and for routing cords it means better air flow and equipment cooling which is especially important with large chassis switches whether in telecom rooms or data centers and finally it means new configurations are now feasible whether using fewer or no horizontal managers due to the ease of cable management the effective use of high-density panels since the cabling bulk is reduced or even new layouts like direct switch patching as we show in the picture on the right all of which are not as practical when using typical 2014 cabling now let's take a step back and put it all together looking at a typical to your rack example to see what benefits 28-gauge patch cords could provide for an overall layout when you're faced with a need to change or expand for example maybe you've acquired some space and you're moving into that space maybe you're moving a group of people within the existing own space in the in the number of people is changing significantly or you're asked to install some new equipment in a data center here on this slide we have a very common to Rack telecom room configuration which you could also see in a data center cabinet with one rack being used for the horizontal cross connect field which would be on the left here and the other primarily used as a network rack housing the switch and power supplies this looks familiar to many of you I'm sure and it's really a staple within large office telecom rooms around the country so let's take a few minutes to understand the current layout with 24 gauge cabling in the cross connect rack on the Left we have nine - ru 48 port flat patch panels for total of 18 are you and we have 10 - are you horizontal managers totaling 20 are you for a total of 38 are you in the cross connect track now looking at the network rack on the right we have from from the top - - are you horizontal managers one - are you 48 port patch panel 1 1 are you fiber tray a 20 are you 65 13 switch and 2 3 are you power supplies at the bottom total length 33 are you in that rack so that altogether 71 are you is being used to provide connectivity for 480 ports leaving us 19 are you of available rack space between the two racks however if we look closely we see that over 1/3 of the argue consumed is just in horizontal managers which we've seen are commonly used with 24 gauge patching to manage the cable in bulk also we see that our 480 ports are requiring 20 ru of rack space - overall we would consider this a relatively low rack utilization layout with the patch cable on being one of the main drivers for that now let's see how 28 gauge patch cabling can help increase the rack utilization and open up more available space in the same rack layout as we step through this I just want to point out that the total port count an active equipment are identical to the 24 gauge layout that we just looked at so now on the cross connect rack on the left the 28 gauge patch cabling allows us to effectively use high-density panels and by high density panels I mean those with 48 ports in one are you and that cuts in half the are you needed for patch panels for the same number of ports the total now is 9 are you compared to 18 are you previously saving 9 are you also note that we are using 28 gauge pants with the increased port visibility and easier wire management so we're able to easily use angled patch panels which eliminate the need for horizontal managers the feed cords to each panel from above and below now we're also able to use a single 3 ru horizontal manager just for getting cords to the other side of the rack compared to 20 ru of horizontal managers used in a cross connector active for saving a 17 are you just in managers put together that's a savings of 26 are you of rack space and the nine horizontal managers that won't be purchased of course our cost savings there on the network rack we see that in addition we save an additional 4 ru by using the high density angle patch panel and a single horizontal manager meaning a total gain between both racks of 30 are you that are you savings can be used now for immediate expansion within the existing space or as a more compact footprint for future deployments with that much added are you available we now have 48 49 are you available it actually gives us another exciting option and in an option B scenario that could be to consolidate the existing equipment network and cross connect and connect into one rack where you would still have 5 hour you of open rack space because we gain one are you from consolidating the horizontal managers and essentially gaining a free rack for expansion space for new equipment or handling cut over transition to a new switch both of which are very common this also provides a compact solution for future cases where there may be space for only one rack so in either of these options we have created available rack space for expansion within the existing real estate footprint thereby avoiding the significant cost with expanding the TR rack footprint a room size which in many cases as we know is just not an option sometimes the net result is that this allows you to either put more in the same footprint which you might have often in an existing telecom room or data center or to shrink the size of the footprint with the same amount of equipment such as you might have for a future design your choice of what to do with the space savings is really up to you looking at another common example example here we see a different challenge where 28 gauge patch cabling can help and that is in the congestion of the cable managers both vertical and horizontal in the overall amount of patch cable unused this again is a fairly typical two rack telecom room layout in this case using two 8ru chassis switches for redundancy for a total of 768 ports and cords which are all taken to the cross connect rack on the left via the horizontal and vertical managers this layout does already use angled patch panels at a density of 36 ports per ru effectively which is not as densest 48 ports that we just spoke spoke about and you can see how dense the patching becomes even at this density with normal 24 gauge cabling now due to the cabling layout driven by the bulk of the cable several different lengths of cords are needed in this case which increases the time to install the patch cable and to manage it over time as you can see the physical layout of the cabling also drives a very large amount of total patch cabling in this case over one mile of cords now here is a layout an alternative layout for the same number of ports using 28 gauge patch cords which takes significantly less space the bumble sizes and allows the effective use of high density 48 port and 1ru panels and eliminates the need for any horizontal managers I'll just point out that in this case there are still two racks they are closer together using a six-inch manager as opposed to a 12 inch vertical manager as is in the foreground and the switches in the alternative case are in the far right rack and they are the same chassis switches as in the near right rack so very significantly this layout allows a much more compact side-to-side configuration which obviously reduces the total cord is needed actually reducing by more than 60% the total amount of cable needed so obviously reducing that amount of cabling by that much is going to have material cost savings and the simplified layout and the cord lengths all being the same are going to reduce operating costs due to less time to install and maintain the system now I just want to point out that this new layout circled in the blue box simply would not have been feasible using 24 gauge patch cabling we can see in the foreground case with 24 gauge cabling the bulk of the path the bulk of the cabling going through the pathway from the switch and just imagine trying to work with that in a direct side-by-side scenario you can see it's crowding the finger managers as we looked at earlier and the manager pathways so with that in consideration you can see the total impact of 28 gauge cabling to reduce the cabling bulk in those areas so with having looked at those two examples in a little more detail with all these advantages for today's needs you might be wondering just why not use 28 gauge patch cabling everywhere well there are some guidelines for use that we'll cover next tell you identifying suitable applications one of the most common questions that we get on the use of 28 gauge cable n is whether it complies 2t i-a standards and the short answer to that is no the reason for that is that the size of 28 gauge cabling is beyond the range specified in TI a 568 C 2 which as we can see is from 22 to 26 gauge for patch cords now keep in mind that the last major revision to 568 C 2 was in 2009 in the interest in 28 gauge cabling that's been much more recent than that there's also the 100 meter channel length that we talked about earlier which 28 gauge patch cabling does not support so for those reasons it does not comply to the standard however 28 gauge patch cabling at least in panda which case that is does comply to the performance of the standard and that the cords do pass all of the TI a 568 performance criteria such as near-end crosstalk and return loss or patch cords or within a channel when used within the length guidelines that we'll discuss now when you think about it this is really not unlike several things that are done today in field networks just such as home run cabling using patch cords or using stranded cabling for horizontal cable neither of which are included in the standard but which are often done also I just want to mention in the case of 28 panda a 28 gauge patch cords I can say that these cords do pass the patch cord component tests as part of our 100% factory testing that we do to all of our cords for 28 gauge cords from other suppliers you would need to check with them on their testing practices and performance now I just mentioned length limit and this is another usage guideline to be aware of when using 28 gauge patch cave line dia 568 situ specifies a maximum 100 meter length channels for copper cabling comprised of 90 meters a permanent link cabling which is in the center this is typically solid cable and a total of 10 meters of patch cabling here shown as five meters on each end for simplicity sake I'm showing the two connector model with the same gauge of patch cords used on both ends obviously the standard also includes specifications for a four connector model but the length limits are not impacted by that so we're going to stick with the two connector model 24 gauge patch cabling supports this configuration from a maximum channel length of 100 meters now looking at what happens when we use 28 gauge patch cabling a derating factor must be used which reduces the maximum channel length achievable let's look at two common examples to see the effect in the middle example the first blue one the goal here is to maintain our 90 meter permanent link or horizontal cabling because most typically that's going to be in place and not easily changed for an existing application in that case we can have a total of 6 meters of 28 gauge patch cords in the channel that can be used for a total of 96 meters of channel length in an alternate case where maybe it's more important to have that same 10 meters of total patch B all of the 28 gauge patch cable then the maximum permanent link length would need to be adjusted to 83 meters for maximum channel length of 93 meters now this 96 and 93 meter lengths which are 96 percent and 93 percent respectively of the hundred meter Channel that ties back who are giving up 7% to get more than 100 back statement so those are the two pieces of that value proposition when using 28 gauge cabling regarding the D rating that I mentioned a moment ago the shorter length Channel is due to the higher attenuation of the smaller wire gauge that's used in 28 gauge cabling as compared to for example 24 gauge wiring to calculate the maximum channel name a derating formula is used which is pretty straightforward and that's in the blue box has shown there are two parts to the formula one for patch in the other for horizontal cabling both of them you what you do is you take the total length of that portion of the channel times the D rating factor for that portion of the channel and the product of those two terms rather the sum of those two terms must not exceed 102 meters so looking at an example and in D rating factors that are common are shown here below 28 gauge being 20 gauge stranded that is which is commonly used for patching a de-rating factor of 1.9 24 stranded being 1.2 and 23 or 24 solid gauge being a d rating factor of 1 now the two bottom d rating factors are specified in TI of 568 c2 and 428 gauge the value shown is for panda with cords with 28 yards 28 gauge cords from other suppliers you would need to confirm that information with them so looking at an example in the bottom of the page when using 6 meters of 28 gauge patch we would have a patch portion that is 6 meters times 1.9 d rating with up totaling 11 point 4 meters plus the horizontal or permanent link portion 90 times a d rating factor 1 so that's 90 meters so 90 plus eleven point four is 101 point for which as we can see meets our criteria for being under 102 meters so this would be an allowable channel the same math would apply for the 83 meter permanent link and 93 meter channel that we looked at a moment ago as well as many other variations as a manufacturer of many 28 gauge cabling solutions Pandith has a detailed 28 guide 28 gauge installation guideline which goes into the D rating formula in more detail and give some additional tables about blanked calculations if you're interested this length calculation that we just reviewed covers the most common panshin configurations for example patch lengths up to 20 meters for cases outside of that there may be some other factors that need to be considered to determine maximum channel length but those are not very common and those details are covered in the installation guideline document I mentioned now PE or power over ethernet is getting more interest lately due to the new standards and development and the new applications supported by them and 28 gauge patch cords can be expected to be used with p OE systems as you can see in the table the power levels for P we are increasing from 15 watts with the original p OE up to 60 watts and even 100 watts for the P we plus plus specification expectedness next year but the good news is that 28 gauge patch cables and support even the highest PE power levels being considered the only guideline to keep in mind is the number of cables that can be bundled together in order to stay within the recommended maximum 15 degree C temperature rise now TS be 184 a is a technical service bulletin from t IA that deals with a topic of Pewee cabling and bundle sizes and it references a maximum bundle size of 100 cables which practically speaking a 96 cable bundle would most likely be the size that you'd be working with as since that's a multiple of 24 cables and that's shown at the bottom left-hand side of the page however when using 28 gauge cabling due to the smaller size of the cabling more heat buildup can occur as the cables are closer together so in order to stay within the recommended temperature rise the cables must be grouped in smaller sized bundles such as 24 or 48 cables like in the bottom-right picture by bundling them in smaller sized bundles it allows more airflow around the smaller groups of cables so that the temperature rise can be kept in check now just to point out in the chart above for current p OE and p we plus up to 48 28 gauge cables can be bundled together and for the expected higher P we plus + power levels up to 24 cables of 28 gauge cords can be bundled together across all three categories of performance also just to point something out about what we mean when we talk about bundles as you can see in the pictures at the bottom of the page we're referring to groups of cables that are bound with a tie or a wrap of some kind so that there's no air space between the cables we are expressly not talking about cables that are just near each other in the pathway where there's air space allowed to be in between them so here again these specific normal science recommendations of 48 and 24 cables for p OE RS tested with panda with 28 gauge patch cords and for other suppliers you would need to check with them so with these usage guidelines in mind and the advantages that we looked at here is where we recommend that 28 gauge cabling solutions be used as compared to 24 gauge cable I'm looking on the left whenever you're looking for relief from over credit pathways such as in an existing application or need a higher density layout for example working in new configurations or a desired new layout and where a channel length slightly less than 100 meters is okay 28-gauge cabling solutions are ideal looking on the right side however if for you have examples rather you have cases where the 400-meter channel length is needed or there is POA use with bumbles of more than 48 cables at a time or where full compliance to the TI a standard is required then those are cases where 28 Gators I'm sorry 24 gauge patch cabling should be considered let's take a moment and look at available 28 gauge products now most of our focus in this discussion has been on patch cords but when considering the supplier to work with you also need to look at supporting 28 gauge components like jacks and plugs if you plan to do any field modification of cords this would be things like cutting off a plug of a cord and terminating a jack onto it to make an equipment cord in the field or maybe cutting down a patch cord to make it shorter and needing to put a new plug on it the reason that you need to look at specific 28 gauge solutions for Jack's and plugs also in that case is that the much smaller wire size of 28 gauge means that Jaxon plugs designed to work for 24 gauge almost certainly are not going to work for 28 gauge cabling and cannot be used when terminating to the 28 gauge cable now of course a 28 gauge patch cord shipped as a patch cord as an end product can be plugged into any standard rj45 jack regardless of the cable terminated to that jack in fact as we've already seen in the examples and in the diagrams in this presentation nearly all 28 h patch cords in use today are used in a mixed gauge Channel environment with a permanent link and maybe even the patch cabling on the other end is a typical 23 or 24 gauge cable and respective now it's a shameless pitch for app and with products for the commercial that you probably knew was coming at some point we offer a full range of 28-gauge chords jackson plugs needed for any typical field configuration and we offer those across all three performance categories at 586 and 6a which to my knowledge makes Panduit unique as having the broadest line of these 28 gauge products by one supplier in the industry in addition to those core products at the top we offer some unique time and space saving solutions in 28 gauge assemblies for category 6 applications like our switch harnesses which are pre bundled in pre labeled groups of patch cords and common configurations that could very often be used some configurations that we looked at a few moments ago in the switch patching kit that we looked at earlier thanks for allowing that quick commercial and again if you're going to be doing field modification of patch cords please keep those other components like specifically design 28 gauge jacks and plugs in mind so in conclusion on 28 gauge cabling we feel and much of the market seems to feel that it is an exciting new area in copper patch cabling that can provide immediate help with current needs like increasing pathway capacities achieving higher density layouts getting easier cable management and ultimately reducing both initial and operating costs in the TR or data center just remember to keep those guidelines and channel links and ple bundle sizes in mind and happy cabling now as a reward for your attendance today in addition to the Bixi continuing education credit that you will receive in the follow up email you'll receive you can request a free sample app into its new category 6 a 28 gauge patch cord as well as getting a copy of the 28 gauge detailed installation guideline that I mentioned thanks so much for attending and everyone have a great day Thomas thank you very much for that information this is Patrick McLoughlin once again and I am going to allow Thomas to take a a sip of water while we prepare for Q&A well while he's taken that sip of water and we're gearing up these questions I will provide a little more detail on the attendance certificate that that Thomas just mentioned in in his closing so before we begin QA just want to let you know that your attendance certificate will be available through one of the icons that you see at the bottom of your screen it's the one the icon the color of which I've never accurately described I call it purple some people call it Rose if you see anything that's that a button that's anywhere in that color family please know that that is the that is the button or the icon behind which you'll be able to access your certificate you're achieving that attendance certificate today is based on the amount of time that you spend with us in this seminar so when you have spent that sufficient amount of time the certificate will be available for you to click and and download from that particular icon so I'll move now to this final wide which contains an email address where you can reach out to us if if you do not get access to that certificate today we do have the ability to monitor and track your attendance today so provided that you did spend that sufficient amount of time if you did not receive your certificate we will we will send one your way if you email us at the at the address that you see here which is webcast material at Penn well calm so more housekeeping out of the way Thomas have you taken that drink of water because we've got we've got more than a couple of here and I think we'll be able to to go pretty close to the or right up to the top of the hour with this QA perhaps if you're ready for it I know several questions are ready to go excellent yeah we're ready bring them on thank you Thanks UH one question are 28-gauge patch cords more vulnerable to micro bends than the 24 gauge cords that that are so common in the market okay first of all thank you for the questions really appreciate the interest and sending on the questions during the presentation to the question they're not they're not really more susceptible to micro bending they do when when when you look at the bend the minimum Bend radius for cabling it's based on typically a 4x of the cable diameter so naturally with the cords being much smaller in diameter they allow a much smaller Bend radius than the corresponding 24 24 gauge patch cords but that does not mean that they're susceptible to micro bending thank you very much for that next question you you addressed this question came in fairly early on in the in the presentation you addressed some of what's asked here but I think there's some some information that could kind of serve as a follow-up it begins what are they heat concerns which again which I know you address where the heat concerns also insertion loss channel D rating for smaller diameter conductor stranded or not again I think you got into some of that current carrying capacity of stranded 28 gauge compared to 24 gauge solid conductor okay several topics that we did cover in the presentation and make use here or tend to make use of the of our ability to go back and look into presentation I think maybe showing on the screen now is the is the slide about the P we bundle size so with respect to the portion of a question about the heat rise so the the heat rise specifically has to do with the p OE considerations and typically that 15 degree D rise that we refer to that is a part of a concern for the cabling moving from a high ambient temperature of say 45 degrees C and not getting above 60 C which is a common jacket temperature rating of many cables so that's where the 15 degrees C T rise reference comes from and what we're doing here with the cabling by breaking it into smaller sized bundles is with the PE being applied to the cabling we are staying within that 15 degree C T rise so Patrick there was a second portion of that question I believe just having to do with current carrying capacity which really is is covered with P we in the comment that that all of the cords least in panda wits which I can speak specifically to they are all capable of carrying the even the elevated 60 and 100 watt p OE power levels so so no issues there it's not an issue of the cabling being able to carryin it's simply an issue of when you bundle cables and again when we say bundle we're talking about tight bundles of cable that can't breathe next to each other the cables individually can certainly carry the current and then I think a last portion of that question if I recall had to do with the length and the D rating factors so let me see if I can make use again of this capability and Patrick we should be seeing the slide with the lengths on it is that that's right yes that true okay good so this is a section where we dealt with that topic and essentially we can see the comparison between systems using 24 gauge patch cabling achieving the 100 meter Channel and systems using 28-gauge patch cabling which depending on what you're trying to do for example in the middle case trying to maintain your 90 meter permanent link length that you could achieve a 96 meter channel or you can achieve a 93 meter channel is it was important to you to have that 10 meters of speck allowed patch cabling done on both ends as 28 gauge cabling and as we reviewed and it's covered in much more detail in the installation guideline that I mentioned and I would highly encourage the person submitting this question as well as everyone to in the follow-up email take advantage of that getting that 28 gauge installation document because it covers this topic of the d rating and tables and various configurations because let's be honest there's almost an infinite number of combinations that could be desired by someone out in the field so it's really hard to make a blanket statement but but it basically comes back to this D rating factor that we looked at here and similar C rating factors are specified in the TI a 568 C 2 standard others such as 28 gauge really needs to be provided by the manufacturer and I hope I hope that addressed the different parts of that question and do we do we have others yes uh yeah there are others thank you again Thomas one question what you're describing sounds great but do we lose any measurable conductivity speed etc by using 28 gauge Thank You Patrick like the short answer that is absolutely not and I just want to go back for a moment here to one of the slides where we spoke about this topic the reason I can say that is back to this statement here the lower half of the slide where we talked about these products at least in panda which case they are completely performance compliant to the standard you can take your flu can help meter and you can test in the various portions of the channel either as if you have the patch cord adapters you're going to test the patch cord as a component or if you want to test the entire channel with the patch cords the 28 gauge patch cords as part of that channel subject to the length limitations we looked at and you test that channel or that patch cord as a component test it will completely pass the the necessary criteria in all aspects wiremac mapping of course near inner crosstalk and return loss you will see no difference in the Fluke test report and this really and this is a great question I appreciate whoever in the audience asset this is a great question because it is it is one of the key things that most people want to know when they look to use 28 gauge cabling systems and when they find that it's completely performance compliant subject to the length limits that we talked about this is where people get really excited because basically it is that equation or that statement that we talked about they're willing to give up 4% or maybe 7% in the overall channel length to get this massive you know over 100 percent increase in pathway capacities other things that we didn't even spend so much time on increase flexibility of the cabling you know just the overall ease of management of the cabling so I hope that addresses that question Patrick yes absolutely thank you another question asks if there is an ETL verification channel report available with the with a 28 gauge cords yes there is yes in Pandits case we absolutely have that terrific neck question for you Tama you need to take another drink of water to feel free I'll take my time on this question go ahead question ask Thank You question s what happens if the standard cat6a patch cords are utilized at the workstation cat6a cabling is used in the horizontal for 90 meters maximum and then the the smaller diameter of the 28 gauge cat6a patch cords are used only in the telecommunications room another great question in and for that I want to go to this slide here for a moment and Patrick please let me know when that slides all the way off so obviously Thomas I believe the audience magnet right so the question if I understand it correctly has to do with basically as I show in these examples both the patch cords on both ends are the same gage the question as I understand it is what if one is a 24 gauge such as at the work station and the other is at the 28 gauge well then you actually have a situation the same D rating formula applies but now because you have patch cords of different D ratings you've got to have two different patch terms the good news is that if we look for example at the top channel of 100 meters and the middle channel of 96 meters we could take the five meters let's say that the left end of the page is the work area and we're going to have five meters of 24 gauge patch cabling in the work area our 90 meter permanent link is the same and then on the far end but rather in the telecom room we're going to apply three meters of the 28 gauge patch well you could do that combination and as you as you add up the simple numbers of 590 and 3 you now can achieve a 98 meter channel so the same math applies you just have to remember that when you start mixing the gauges that you do have to consider basically if you know that the other gauge is 24 gauge that you're working with you're only looking at the incremental difference on one end so the good news there is that now the channel length that you can achieve is even higher than what I stated here these are these are conservative estimates on the basis that you might use it in both places but if you use it just in one you actually can achieve a higher channel length thank you the next question may I don't want to jump to a conclusion but but may may benefit from a reference to this very slide that you have up but certainly you you be the judge of that one as I extend the question to you because that understood that in your in your presentation you showed a two connector model for probably for the sake of simplicity but question asks will the insertion loss associated with the with added connectors reduce the maximum channel length further no no that is actually again another great question thank you all very much the simple answer to that is no in that the weather using the the standard rj45 jacks that you would find terminated to 23 and 24 gauge cabling or even if you happen to make an equipment cord out of a 28 gauge patch cord and use a 28 gauge jack that allowance in the channel for up to four connectors in the channel of the insertion loss that allowance is already dealt with in the hundred meter standard allowable configurations covered by the standard at 100 meters or two three or four connector configurations so essentially the simple answer is no because that allowance for insertion loss by the added connectors has already built into the standard and I hope I hope that that this is clear there right thank you I think it is next question asks if there is is there a recommended shortest 28 gauge patch cord in other words don't don't use a 28 gauge patch cord any shorter than blank is there such a recommendation or requirement well for practical purposes in the case for example with cat6 patch cords and and a good a good visual on this is the go to the front of our deck here but visual on this is the patch cords that we would be used in the bottom right picture in this direct switch patching case the practical answer is about six inches and that's the length at which you could actually go between two adjacent ports in a switch to an adjacent panel and have enough working room and you know there there's essentially no concern about the length of the cord that's short when it's used as part of a normal length channel beyond and that's why panda wood is is confident in offering those products basically without qualification because of the intended use of using it as part of a short interconnect up to a normal length Channel Thank You Thomas I mean I suppose it in theory they could be shorter than that even but then it begins to be what do you do with it if you if you don't have enough room to work with and space to unplug and access things than just practically speaking but that's pandu its position sounds like it's a matter of practicality as opposed to electrical performance right that kind of dictates the shortest length right yeah yes and I can tell you that that these very short cords are quite quite popular next question asks if do you have available field terminable 28 gauge patch cord or patch cable I guess meant might be the the best term to use there that can be terminated in the field I see and if I understand that incorrectly it would be like bulk patch cabling and if that that's indeed the question from Pandu what the answer would be no that we offer for stranded cabling options while we do offer a large range of solid cable offerings you know cross all categories for horizontal cabling which is typically per sister very often purchased in bulk for patch cabling we do not but I do know that there are 28 gauge bulk patch there is 20 gauge patch cabling in bulk available on the market we don't supply it but there are other suppliers that do and for that I would just reference the specially designed 28 gauge connectivity options that that we offer as a way to actually terminate that in the field great question though and thank you for that answer next question ask EMI electromagnetic interferences is it an issue or a concern with 28 gauge cords no no Patrick and that one no more no more so than it would be with any other gauge of cord and actually that's a that's a good opportunity to point out that while we have focused in this presentation almost exclusively on unshielded twisted-pair examples all of the dimensions that I mentioned in examples were showing unshielded twisted-pair and that's because you know of course the prevalence of that in the in the US market in the case of the cat6a 28 gauge cords we actually do offer both a shielded and a unshielded UTP solution so many times for e/m EMI concerns low frequency noise and such customers will look to shielded solutions in those cases and for those situations we do have the six a 28 gauge cable but as a simple response there's no more concerns that you would have otherwise for other types of common cabling Thomas thank you very much for that answer I don't look it but thanks again look at my clock I realize we've we've reached the top of the hour but I'm sorry I cut you off twice now you're saying great set of questions I imagine was your comment yes yes that's that's it Patrick thank you and and there there are questions that came in that that we are not going to have the the time to answer right now so Thomas you can take that that other drink of water now because I won't be asking you any more right now but but please know those who submitted questions that that we have captured those questions and it's possible but that you may be hearing you may be hearing some responses to your questions as we move ahead offline would be outside the outside the course of this seminar because we are just about to wrap up again the the slide that you see on your screen has an email address where you can reach us if you do not receive an attendance certificate today cannot download a certificate today and and and do need one from us so on behalf of cabling installation maintenance its parent Pendrell corporation i offer a great thanks to Panduit and to thomas bomb for today's presentation of course we thank all of you for joining us and very much appreciate your attendance today we certainly hope and trust that you've gained some valuable information today and once again thank you for joining us thank you all and please have a good day
