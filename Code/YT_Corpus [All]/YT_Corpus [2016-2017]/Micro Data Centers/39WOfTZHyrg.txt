 all right so I figured this was a good follow-up to the error 53 video that I did a lot of people who've been commenting is particularly on this MacRumors thread have been going on and on about independent repair shops and now independent repair shops are not going to provide the best experience why would you even take your what you know the well somebody said you know why would you even take your Ferrari to Jose around the block rather than going to the Ferrari dealer and there was this one really great comment that I thumbed up which was because Jose knows more about your Ferrari than the dealer does which again and in my experience when it comes to Apple products I mean find somebody at the Genius Bar that knows their motherboards better than I know their motherboards and I will sign my store lease over to them like I will just I would transfer it happily because I know that that doesn't exist but that's another argument the real crux of the argument was that you should go to the Apple store because the Apple store will provide you with a better customer experience I feel like that's worth discussing and I also feel like it's worth mentioning the experience that I had with somebody about a week go who had a liquid damage machine so one of the things that I'll do that I described in the past video is if I don't feel like I'm a good value for the money I will actually tell you to go elsewhere even if you came in the door and you're willing to spend money here and when it comes to iPhone 6 and 6s screen repair call me crazy if Apple will do it for 109 I'm not going to do glass only replacements in a store where I take the glass off of your broken dropped [ __ ] up screen and put a new glass on there for the same price that Apple will give you for a new screen I'm not gonna buy a refurbished screen for 50 to 70 bucks that sucks and put it in your phone when again Apple put in a new one for one I'm not going to do that I will happily tell customers when I think there's a better option elsewhere even if it means that I'm not making money I need to feel good about what I'm doing I need to feel like I'm providing a good service a good value and with board repair I do feel that way because very often Apple will give people a flat rate of 750 to 1250 to do something when my parts cost is five ten thirty bucks and I know that what I do is going to last and we can charge two to four hundred dollars in all is nice again you'll see the videos that I've done on this channel do this in a regular basis and it ends well for everybody involved now this person came in and they had a Mac macbook air they had received a quote of 750 from Apple I open it up the board is dead and this is not a boy that I'm going to be repairing that battery is bad the keyboard is bad the trackpad is bad the trackpad cable is bad the DCN board is bad the DCN board flex cable is bad the only thing that's actually good on this machine is potentially the screen and the SSD boots up in another computer without error it had no corrosion on it and the SSD on this machine is encased in under fills so even if it did get a little bit of liquid on it it's not really going to affect that much at all so I tell the customer here's the list of things we would have to replace here's the cost here's what Apple is going to charge you to replace everything see how that costs less money and you're also going to be getting new stuff but in there go to Apple and cheese and not exactly the happiest about the fact that the 750 in her specific case is actually a good deal not not exactly a happy camper there but whatever she goes ahead with it and she goes to the Apple Store now the problem here is that they said that we cannot recover your data we don't offer data recovery and I felt that that was kind of strange because what do you mean recovery this SSD has no errors on it you can boot it in seven seconds inside of another machine and has no corrosion on it I understand if under your flat rate repair policy I totally get it if you don't want to you potentially put that drive in and have to deal with the failure that results from it but why call it recovery why call it data recovery when you're not recovering anything because that drive works why not simply use tools at the store to copy the druid data from one drive to the other drive then she says okay can you give me the drive and they go no and I thought that was really really weird and it's at this point that she calls me and she explains everything and she comes by and they say here's what we're going to do I'm going to take out your drive here it is you have them fix the computer then once they're done with whatever they do you bring it back here and I'll plug the driving and you may think okay well it's that person's fault that they didn't backup their data it's their fault that they didn't back up their data and I'll go back to the question that I asked in the previous video which is again raise your hand if you've never ever done something irresponsible or stupid over the course of your life in I mean how many of you are raising your hand right now and here's the thing when it comes to good service here's the thing when it comes to loyalty when you get kicked in the balls are you going to support somebody that just like stabs you in the balls right after you got kicked for no reason or are you going to support somebody who helps you picks you up dust you off and asks if there's anything they can do to help you out that's really what it comes down to is it again the customer did something stupid they spilled [ __ ] on their computer that's that that's stupid we established that then they did something further stupid by not backing it up again that is also stupid so they are careless in how they treat their $1200 product and they also don't back up the important data on their $1200 product all this is dumb but that's in the past like you can't change what happened you can only change how you deal with the catastrophe one does happen and when it doesn't require effort when it live when it requires like no effort at all when it's literally taking data from a perfectly functioning Drive and transferring it to the new one or simply reusing this perfectly functioning Drive in the fix computer like in you can argue all you want the idea that they need to back up their data that we don't want to be responsible for it but when there's no option for this customer other than to take a 40-minute back-and-forth train ride for me to simply unscrew their drive and put it in a little plastic baggie for them because they won't do that at the [ __ ] Apple store that's [ __ ] that really is [ __ ] and you can say that they don't want to be responsible for it you can say they don't want to be liable for data you can say they don't want to deal with transferring stuff they don't want to deal with unplugging stuff then that's great but then you can provide the argument that they also offer good service because this is something that a monkey can do and this is basic [ __ ] common courtesy we are going to fix your stuff hey how about this just to be nice since a lot of bad stuff happen to you and we're taking $750 your money just to be nice we're not going to delete your data today how [ __ ] difficult would it be to do that not that difficult at all but again better service what is better service that's in the eye of the beholder and in the person that waited six days to get an appointment at Apple to have to then waste 40 minutes of time in the store and then another 40 minutes going back and forth via train just that I could remove a [ __ ] SSD so that they did not have their data or raised by the dumbass that was dead that was doing this stuff and like why explain to me how this is a better customer experience explain to me how this makes any sense it doesn't and again you can use the argument until you're blue in the face that people should go to the Apple store first but I want to give you another person's perspective this is why people don't go to the Apple store first and if you would just say I'm not doing this to [ __ ] on Apple oh my kidding I'm kind of doing this to [ __ ] on Apple but the point is I'm doing this to try to improve it you know people will say that I'm a fan boy for Lenovo I like Lenovo products much more than Apple products and you'll see on this channel that I have these videos with hundreds of thousands of views where I'm just digging into Lenovo and exactly what I think of some of their dumbass design decisions where they've just butchered good machines and here's the thing with people who are fans or quote-unquote fans like real fans real fans are people who are going to criticize the company that's doing something stupid so they can stop doing something stupid fanboys like with all the 14 year olds that you see on the internet that will just scream and cry one way or the other whenever you criticize a product or a company fanboys are always going to defend a company even when they're doing something stupid but real fans or real users are not going to sit back and just take it in the ass when a company does something really dumb so when a company like Apple says hey I know you're spending almost a thousand dollars to get your $1200 product fixed here that probably would have never needed repairs at all if we had simply employed the same design tactics that Lenovo and IBM did over 12 [ __ ] years ago how about this we're going to give you the courtesy of not erasing your data that's all I'm suggesting and I think that's pretty damn reasonable now one thing to take consideration in the service business is that we can never really focus on the past of what it could have should have been done we can only focus on how we can make the experience better for our customers so a bad analogy here because I'm half asleep let's say you have a kid and every now and then he decides to run across the street he breaks away from your hand runs across the street when there's a red light there should be a punishment for that because in the real world if that kid does that over and over again eventually there's a chance that he gets hit by a car and that's very bad so if he runs across the street and doesn't get hit by a car we should celebrate the fact that he did something stupid and did not get hit by the car we should punish him he should have to go to his room he should have no video games he should not be allowed to ride his bike for whatever amount of time do whatever you want to do to punish the kid but also celebrate the fact that he wasn't hit by the car we don't take the kid and then toss him back in the street and say no here's what happens when you run across the street and then actually let a car run over him that makes no sense we're going to celebrate the fact that he wasn't hit by the car here customer did something they weren't supposed to they spilled water on it I've done that before it's a pretty stupid thing to do and that should have its consequences of having to pay for the repair now if they didn't back up their data there should be an additional consequence or an additional additional punishment or an additional fee simply to cover the fact that somebody at the Genius Bar now has to transfer data whether that's $50 $150 $500 you come up with it but it should be an option but at the same time we should still celebrate the fact that that person's SSD is in perfect condition now again if the SSD is destroyed if their hard drive is clicking if the data is completely corrupted I get it don't recover it send them to drive savers send them to somebody who's going to actually get their stuff back I understand that but if they're coming to you with a liquid damaged computer and an SSD that surrounded an underfill that has no signs of liquid damage whatsoever that has no issues at all it is in perfect health that shows one gigabyte per second read and write speeds that boots up perfectly in another computer let's celebrate that let's celebrate the fact that the drive is in perfect condition so that we can transfer that customers data will charge them will punish them the same way that you punish the kid that runs across the stream but why are we going to go out of our way to data that is present why are we going to go out of our way to not give the customer back that drive when that drive is a is is literally sitting there with one little screw sitting in it it doesn't make any sense that's the difference between people who are successful in the service business and those people who those carry and all those people who work in IT you have the same job when they're 60 that they did when they were 30 where the person was the same job at 60 that they had when they're 30 they're always against the user they're always insulting the user belittling the user saying well you could have this if only you had done this this way but no you know you can't and I understand that I understand that users do a lot of really stupid things and I understand why you may be sick and tired of it but at the same time what makes people successful what allows people to move up in their career is what puts a better taste in the users mouth as when you tell them what you've done is bad here's why that's bad here's how much misery and nightmare there is going to be ahead to make things work properly again however it's totally possible but because you've done it everything this way this is all the crap that we're going to have to go through and this is what you're going to have to deal with as a result of it so always make sure it's on them you didn't back up your data you spilled [ __ ] on here but at the same time if it's possible to fix their problem fix their problem because people will always like the person who fixed their problem even if the problem that you fixed is this little if they don't know how to fix that problem themself and you fix the problem with this little there's this crazy thing in IT where they will treat you as if as if you saved the world they will treat you as if as if you've parted the oceans for them and they will talk about you as if you part of the oceans for them so what benefits you more having somebody who's really really happy at the fact that you were able to save their ass or having people who hate your guts because of their own mistakes it's their mistake keep the responsibility with them but what is the point in the world of IT and in the service business of constantly focusing on what somebody else did wrong when they're not even blaming you why even get into the blame game back and forth and say well they you know that's their fault that they don't have their data when their data is literally sitting on a drive right in front of you and this really goes back to the entire error 53 fiasco because people say you need to disable the phone this cannot be allowed to work if they change the home button and again it just shows that same kind of pattern that complete lack of concern for things like data do you really have to make it so that nobody on God's green earth can access data on the phone because somebody changed button oh no yeah well when I say these things and when I say that I think Apple is doing it just just to be pricks sometimes it's because of this base of experience that I have against seven years of people coming here and saying Apple wanted to erase my data just because I was getting a screen replace Apple erased my data without telling me that they were going to do it when I went in for a Wi-Fi card repair just like stupid crap like this has been going on for a really long time so when things like error 53 happened it's not just like oh look out of the blue they just made this one decision that didn't take into account user information it's it's like it's a history of this [ __ ] that's been going on for a really long time and if people don't say anything about it even worse if people are actually okay with this then there's no reason for it to get better over time and I would like it to get better over time because this again it's just a waste I literally sent somebody to the Apple Store to spend almost a thousand dollars there and as a result of sending them there they're now less happy with me because I I was part of creating a bad experience for them and that's just it's just dumb I mean I should be able to send somebody somewhere this way they're sent spending 750 bucks and somebody there will actually treat them like a human being and not like a robot but what do I know I'm just one of those dumbass third party service centers
