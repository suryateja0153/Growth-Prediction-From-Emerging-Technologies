 Hello, I'm Jessica Pryor from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Special Bacteriology Reference Lab. Mysteries can sometimes be fun. But when you're trying to find out what's making a patient sick and your lab results don't match anything you've seen before, you know someone's well-being is on the line. CDC's MicrobeNet can help you find the answers you need. Let's take a look at how MicrobeNet can help. MicrobeNet provides laboratory scientists, clinicians and researchers with unprecedented real-time access to the CDC's virtual pathogen library where they can identify pathogens faster, reducing the time to get the test results from over a week to potentially just hours. It is designed for public health and hospital labs, as well as research laboratories in the United States and worldwide. This information can be used to select the best treatment for patients faster, which can lead to better patient outcomes. The time difference can save a life. MicrobeNet contains detailed information about more than 2,400 rare and emerging bacteria and fungi, including their 16S DNA sequences, MALDI proteomic fingerprints, phenotypes, colony morphology, growth conditions, references, standard operating procedures, Gram stain images, and more. All data in MicrobeNet database are curated by CDC subject matter experts, so you can trust the information you receive. MicrobeNet can be searched in different ways. If you're looking for information about a specific microbe, you can type its taxon name into the search bar and get the information you need quickly. For example: if you type "Nocardia abscessus", you are immediately brought to the bacterium's "details page." From here, you have access to information about the genus and species, colony and microscopic pictures, growth conditions, phenotypic traits, references, DNA sequence, and the contact information for the subject matter expert for that microbe. If you're trying to identify an unknown microbe, you can also search the Microbenet database in 4 different ways. You can: Use your own DNA sequence from 16S genetic analysis. Use your own phenotypic results by entering them into MicrobeNet's virtual biochem panel. Use your MALDI-TOF results directly from your MALDI Bio-typer. Or transfering your MALDI-TOF data from your instrument to your online computer to access MicrobeNet. Short training videos are available at the MicrobeNet secure portal. You can view them after you've received access to MicrobeNet. New pathogens are being added to the database every month. In addition to the new MALDI-TOF module developed in collaboration with Bruker Deltonics, ThermoFisher Corporation has developed a sequence editing tool called MicroBridge that allows for searching the database directly from any ABI DNA sequencer worldwide. Join MicrobeNet today to see how this system can work for you and your lab. You can request an account through the MicrobeNet secure portal or by emailing at microbenet@cdc.gov
