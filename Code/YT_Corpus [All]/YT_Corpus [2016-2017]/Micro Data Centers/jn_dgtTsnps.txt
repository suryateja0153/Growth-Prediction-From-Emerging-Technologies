 hello and welcome to telecom TV we are at the Intel offices in the Georgian city of bath in Somerset in England it's coming up to Christmas it's very jolly out there as a big Christmas market going on and we are in here at least it's warm and we're talking about em ec mobile edge computing and I have three guests with me who are very knowledgeable on this pretty new subject and I'm going to begin by introducing them to my left we have Doug Linda Meyer welcome Doug in the middle is Mansura Hanif who's director of radio access networks and programs at EE also welcome answer i'm good to see you again and finally in last but by no means least john jettison who is a technical director of infrastructure sales for a mere at intel so gentlemen welcome we've got quite a lot to get through over the next few minutes so let's get straight to it i begin with you John if I might um why a me see what is Emmie see it's a newish subject a lot of people still even lien in within our industry still don't know exactly what it is can you begin by explaining that an Intel's part in it thank you let's start looking at this to mobile edge computing is really a transformational technology initiative that's coming together across the industry what we see at Intel is that the requirements on the telecom network to handle data center like were closed data center type application types data center type analytics is now needed more so than ever what we see is that we are providing a fundamental you know technology from the data center edge out towards the telecom edge that's really what this is mobile edge computing move the edge of the data center to the edge of the telecom network and then drive a ecosystem of OEM partnerships service provider our partnerships as well as ecosystem application development on top of this nothing that we drive alone it's something that we inject our technology into to make innovation happen on top we've seen this in many markets before and we think the time is right now to take this to the telecom market together with fellow travelers such as Dirk and masseur here ok let's talk to you now and why Nokia why is not get involved in this anokhi as a mobile broadband specialist company so we build mobile networks for our customers like like EE and we of course having a high interest in creating additional value with LTE networks in particular which is right now forming the lion's share of what's being rolled out into into live networks and we we saw an opportunity back in 2013 to actually plug some additional intelligence into into these base stations which form the edge of a network for mobile networks standpoint and we did that and we announced it together with Intel but but back then and 2013 it was really a bit of a Nokia specific thing so we called the liquid applications and got a lot of interest for it but then very soon people started to started to realize that hmm really is a network build exclusively for nokia kid so we said okay we have to make it we have to make it an industry standard and this is really what m ec mobile edge computing is all about its kind of generalizing and standardizing this initial concept which we made a product now into an industry standard okay thank you mentor you are the sole representative here of the service providers why is it mecu particular interest to you those are huge interest to us because we we all know that the edge is going further and further into people's lives you know the edge of the network a few years ago everybody had big rooftop radio sites micro sites and now we're going into small cells we're going into femtocells we're going into business areas corporate areas so our network is drawing you know into the areas where people need it most so the age is growing actually and actually what that means is that there's a huge opportunity there by actually doing the computing at the edge of the network you can really improve the customer experience by doing it there there's no need to it all the way back to the center of the network and computer bring it back so you can improve the experience for the customers but also by adapting the content that you are providing at the edge of the network to the local specifics for example a shopping center or a corporate location or a railway station you can actually provide a lot of benefit to the users themselves so I think it's very it's a very exciting prospect okay thank you another question is why are we doing it here I mean it's a nice place to be that's a nice City lovely city but why here rather than anywhere else is there a particular reason to Intel the whole area around Bath Bristol Swindon along the m4 is a hotbed of innovation technology companies and in particular as you look at the round side of the other telecom network there is software development hardware development ranging from a long history of high-tech companies in this area and you know that that's from our vantage point a natural place why we wanted to put the collaboration lab here ok yeah I mean for the whole of the m4 corridor is becoming a real hotbed of innovation so we have a very big office in bristol a lot of my engineering team is based there which is ready nearby we know of a lot of our partners based in Swindon and all across the m4 corridor into london is a it's something that a lot of developers are are growing into that area so i think it's the right place to be for this type of innovation if you look at if you look at bath itself I once where I went down to the root the Roman ruins in bath city centre and it's very interesting to to walk around there and you see a lot of inscriptions from people in Roman times and what's really interesting is bath was always a hotbed of bringing people together and you know the grapes of the gravestones I saw there well the inscriptions were from dalmatia from Italy from all over you know all over Europe so it's always being a center of drawing the best people from Iran the world in my view very nicely put don't you have anything to add to that well we generally like to drive innovation close to where our customers are sitting and with this new mobile edge computing approach we really picked a very few leading leading operators that want to innovate and want to be part of the disruption that Emmy see is actually is actually causing and as such it was a perfect choice for us and ya doing in a bath of course and in your home country is just very natural to do let's move on a few years ago and she will all remember every comes industry business in the world or many of them had one story which is come to us we are a one stop shop for everything you're ever going to need come to us wig and sell it to you will arrange door will do it those days have gone this is no longer the case has come a realization that in this quickly changing world they're not no one company can do it all and the emphasis these days is very much on a sort of cooperative ecosystem how do you begin by building the ecosystem for m ec weds it start and how do you hope it will develop I don't know who liked ones first whether maybe I can take this so basically it all starts with the the way MSC is set up in terms of what are we actually standardizing so if you little bit zoom into the the objective of em you see it's not about standardizing the form factor the amount of CPU our memory we're putting into these distributed servers but it's all about standardizing an environment that applications can land on to these space stations regardless of who the base station vendors so is it a Nokia base station or is it from somebody else doesn't really matter after em you see so the way it's set up it's really meant it's really meant for openness and it's um it's meant to hide the multi-vendor reality that is that is simply their networks today so really what this means is that we are opening up the base station for the for the very purpose of inviting partners to develop on it and that's something extremely radical so had you asked that question maybe two or three years ago would we ever open up the base station and have it provide IP is absolutely not so it has been a very if not the closest environment of the entire mobile network and and that's the main thing we opening it up and we are inviting partners to the activity here to actually comment and what caused net sea change what caused you to change your policy we know you said no no we're not doing this it says our secret and what what why did you change your mind because we told them this is it exactly my point I was going to make man sir and you can confirm this for me is as we've seen with sdn and NFV of course it's been the service providers themselves will put pressure on the manufacturers and vendors to change things well I was only joking really but yeah I think I think you don't put it very well I mean we've had a lot of conversation about liquid I've loved the concept of the collapse since the moment I heard about it but the thing that held me back was always the same well you know I told your teams you know I need something I can roll out over the whole network and therefore we need to find a solution so that you know it can be multi-vendor and I think you were thinking the same way anyway because you know as what you said is very clear so the whole of the mobile edge computing initiative is about getting that multi-vendor and we're actually quite lucky because most of the key vendors to work with us are part of it not everybody's part of it so it's a very good opportunity for us in particular to to build something that we could possibly roll out over the whole network and that increases the opportunity for the application developers and for you know all our partners I think if you got the opportunity of rolling out applications across the whole of the country a big country like the UK and you have the service provider like ourselves who are passionate about it and are ready to push that through I think for some of the big partners around the world who are looking to try and try their first experience of this it's quite an enticing prospect yeah absolutely and even more so it's there's this base station yes it has been a closed environment for for a long time but there is additional things we can do for it because if we are completely honest with ourselves as industry this thing as sophisticated as it is it has really been serving one single purpose all those years and that is forwarding data from left to right and we thought there's definitely much more we can do with these with these locations with the extreme proximity to the eyeball that the space station is by definition having and that's something we wanted to we wanted to really unleash and it is a mobile network and it is very revolutionary because I know a lot of my colleagues Amell been in the business 20 years I know a lot of my colleagues to would you know treat me as a heretic by saying that we're going to open up the net where we're going to open up the api's you know we're going to allow this kind of open source development platform now we need to be very careful about the quality and you know that's why we need really good partners like internal nokia to make sure it's there in the right way but if it's done in the right way the potential is huge so you know I think we go to open source you know open source our minds and change the way we think about this because I think we've been looking at it the wrong way if we want to entice the over the top players to come through the network this is the best paper okay John you wanted to get in yeah lovely lovely discussion indeed from from from an architecture perspective we have we've also seen this in other industries once you decide to open it open it up you have to identify standards agree on what those rules of engagement are but then innovations speed picks up really really fast so openness is the key and I do think that we can learn a little bit from the past as well where we have done this in other industries such as the data center the enterprise and cloud build up that that's going on there we're not moving that capability to the edge of the network so similar rules will apply so we have a lot to learn learn from the past here that we can benefit from that's right so we have an ecosystem that's building you know you are in partnership what about standing you mentioned open you mentioned standards one of the things that we've seen also referring back to SD n n fe is this concept of openness is great but how far does it go when you're talking about open for emmy see how open actually is it John it needs to be so open that multiple OEMs can participate just like Dirk said this is not limited to a nokia brand that does not mean open it needs to be able to be deployed from from various operators regardless of what their base invested architecture is so adopted i think most importantly on the software side it needs to be very well-defined with the software api sorry for the for the software vendors to deploy on top and again these companies are participating in this in the past we are participated in it so we can do this again but but openness means truly open on all aspects o a.m. service provider and ecosystem side and that's what we have to sit around the table and define exactly what that looks like well that's not going to ask you my next question following on from that is how do you define that openness now what does that mean to you it's an easy phrase yeah absolutely i mean from the the way I me see the standards are going to be set up it is it is of course open where we have to be a little bit careful is that we don't make this yeah have people get the impression that this is this is just another data center another cloud that applications can be deployed into it not because it wouldn't be possible from a technology perspective because it is it is very alike to to what we see in data centers today but of course the resources at the edge of a network are somewhat pressures so many functions that are residing in cloud today would reside there also in future so we have to be a little bit i would say clever to select the right applications to put to put onto the base stations for several reasons and what we have done is we have developed a small methodology for identifying which really are the ones that benefit most from from from sitting at the edge and then also which other ones that deliver the greatest value because there is an incremental investment let's make that clear as well and operators have to recoup that eventually so we have to really hand pick the right applications to go there and that requires a bit of thinking so it's not just another cloud it's a highly distributed cloud with with some particularities in it and that's of course the process we have to educate developers into that they don't start putting everything on to these service because some things are very well suited for the cloud also the future okay mentor as an operator you've been listening to this and what do you make of that sort of approach to openness is it chime with what you want to do with in EE yes it does i mean it's this is very much in line with our thinking from our point of view the most critical points are that a common definition of the api is that i use into and out of the base stations so that we can make sure that we have a common capability across all our vendors so i think there's a lot of work on that in terms of defining exactly which parameters are coming in which members coming out and how they're defined and also a common platform where you know the intelligence of this solution can be made available to any developers you know from the ecosystem especially here in the UK in a common way through the way they interface with those api's you know so it's exactly what we looking for let's move on to standards if you might be told wide open open implies standardization somewhere another what about the standards themselves I know that that m ec is involved in the etsy processes and is Jean exactly on what does it mean how does how does that involvement with a body such as etsy help or hinder or further enable yeah so it was a very conscious decision to put this under at sea we a little bit trying to replicate the success of Etsy nfe it wasn't completely fitting into at Siena fees that we decided to make it a separate isg namely the HCM easy but sort of the working principles the support we are getting from etsy all these kind of logistics around that actually they they are very much the same as SDR with HC n fe so it was a easy decision to go that way we started with six founding members now we are already at twenty I believe with ten more in the process of joining and that only like a month after we have announced the entire thing so I think by having it hosted in etsy we first of all make it easy for companies to join as they know accidental Nov so it's it's kind of an easy thing and and secondly we kind of ensure that we got a good mix of participants so if you look at the the mix of founding members that were like two system vendors like us and two operators like EE and then to kind of IT giants in there and and now we see several independent software vendors queuing up to actually join as well so we want to have this mix of network infrastructure and technology vendors operators the ones who would actually put this into the network and then thirdly the ones that we want to populate a plan forum with so is vs 0 TTA SPS I mean everyone sorry many acronyms that anyone who has an application that should land on the platform that that's the kind of mixed we want and for that actually etsy is a good term is a good ground much more than 3gpp maybe well the net GN fe has been remarkable runway successes we've all seen donning I've never seen anything like it no my time in the industry so if you can get anywhere near that with m ec you'll be doing tremendously well John you want you to come in on that just then my reflection is just that the numbers are now faster fast it moves five members will not do it the 20 will give you the critical mass to start moving this mountain much much faster than we have seen in the past so I think it's certainly on par with a at CNN IV push that we saw earlier indeed and what's the ultimate aim under etching how big do you want to get are you going to close your membership in due course or know how you know much do you want it to be how enormous that was there was an enormous question ought to be honest I don't have a strong point of view I mean my vision would be you know a year else from now I'd like to see a hundred if not more active you know Ivy's developing on top of this vibrant ecosystem I'd like to see you no more hardware innovation going into it I would like to see you know refreshed into technology going into this as well because that's another value of deploying on standard architectures that you can benefit from you know the moore's law and the evolution of all this so i see that being picked up by by our OEM customers in this case i want to see service providers explaining how this drives you know revenue benefits to them new revenue streams new business opportunities so they can invest in this technology I can't define an endpoint now we're at the starting line and then we're moving fast on it absolutely yeah I think I mean generally from my point of view because a little bit special first is because no we normally go to our shareholders france telecom deutsche telekom orange and deutsche telekom but in this case we join directly ze because it's so close to to our hearts really and i think it generally speaking the more the merrier but with the caveat which is that you know let's not get bogged down by crissy and and you know ratification of this or that and if it gets too big and too bureaucratic that's the day we leave always a problem isn't it so as long as as long as we're moving at a good speed and there's good alignment how may be being led by a few of the more you know pioneering operators or vendors then I think the more the merrier let's move on again look at something real than real nitty-gritty but from the technology money finance none of this is free nothing comes free there are all sorts of requirements that you man saw and the operators have you want to make a return on investments as quickly as you can by introducing new services and applications of course what sort of costs are we talking about for a service provider like you to take on em ec2 to deploy it and to use it how long will it take and what do you expect to get out of it in this short and medium term it's a very significant investment because we would need to upgrade all of our base stations so it's something that we've made it very clear to our partners that you know the business case is just based around optimizing our network will not fly on their own to get this across the board with our investors and our shareholders we need to be showing the uplift in revenue as well so if you got the uplift in revenue plus the optimization of the actual quality the network together then I think that's a compelling business case because I've been on today especially in Europe revenues are flat at best and it's a very competitive environment so I think you know we're all looking for that golden formula to increase our revenues and I think you know this MSC provides that potentially I think there's a lot of third parties who are willing to invest if they can see that this will be rolled out in a big scale and it can provide opportunity for them to improve the quality of service for their customers or they can resell it to other customers this is where I'm really excited because I think that you know from my point of view I'd like to show those use cases to generate new revenues as well as optimized costs bring it management and then you know even if it's a big investment that's something that we can definitely look at somebody needs to give both revenues and cost reduction yeah gentlemen as members the other side of the fence on this there's a vendors and manufacturers what do you say in response to that how do you see the cost of upgrading these networks in this way is it going to be difficult is it going to put people off or do you think it's an absolute necessity for the network's going forward I don't know who wants to answer first whoever you like but yeah maybe i can start so first of all it's some the important thing to understand is that this does not require to virtualize the entire radio access network which was the very initial perception that people thought okay now applications are coming into the rand so first I have to redesign the entire network not the case I mean the whole idea is that we add this to existing LTE networks so that's the first thing it's an incremental upgrade it's kind of an application's overlay if you will then secondly of course we are we are trying to optimize the cost of the product itself and of course Intel is is very instrumental in that in terms of helping us to reach a volume and drive component prices to to where they should be driven towards two very important that's the product cost so that like any other base station component we have to make sure that the cost is continuously eroding eroding downwards and then then thirdly there is this aspect of making the deployment easy and what we realized is that a lot of network build which is which is still happening can be utilized as a as a vehicle for actually getting these service out as well so from that point of view it is just another base station component so it doesn't require an additional cabinet or any particular skills from a technician was installing it it's kind of pre-configured in the base station if the base station happens to be a new one and just being deployed together with the base station so that's that's the way how we can manage the cost portion of it but I completely agree with month as well that's not enough i mean the the revenue piece is as important but it's good point to Dirk in terms of the speed of Roland I mean once we have a management decision and the business case is there it can be very fast I mean we're all struggling to roll out the new frequency bands on LTE that takes a lot of antenna work rigging work a lot of permits and that's that's very very slow upgrade compared to this type of upgrade which would basically be a board within the base station and could be done in theory you know we have eight and a half eight and a half thousand base stations so it could be done within a ureter you know you know New York although John died and i think it's the realization that this is really a new network capability that's being put in place and innovation will start happening on top of that I I know Dirk you've shared with me as well as you know some use cases and data points that are coming back which are look very very compelling to operate operators but there's more to come on that and with innovation new applications being being put on here we will find new business cases as well not everything is developed out to shoot we are starting here and we have some good fundamental use cases that have been tested and proven and that we are communicating around but there's there's more to come on that line totally John I think we're at today with just just really scratching the surface we're just beginning you know so the use cases are going to explode as more and more of these companies come a book come on board so I think we're just at the beginning of of this at the moment so I think it's going to is going to grow huge record another question to you something we haven't mentioned up until now cautiously ultimate end user the your customer man sir I can see gentlemen that you are happy to be doing this because it's taken new technology it's a revenue earning opportunity same for you man so what about the ultimate guide down the road there what is he going to get out of it she or them I think yeah if you look at our customers in two broad categories the corporate customers and the and the consumers I think initially the corporate customers the ones who are going to get the first benefits there's a whole new app ecosystem which is built around having a really low latency and depending on the location of where we'll be rolling this out we can we can give benefits to their business models by improve the latency but also by that in the content to the location so for example shopping gaming live gaming in shopping centers for example you could be adapting the content regularly you could for example install it's what the use case we're looking at in a shopping center you can stall this in indoor installations and have adapted content being updated into the base stations every day by actually adapting the content to the football and also providing people information that they need whether while they're there combining the the added precision on mobility to the actual specific location itself the same thing for railway stations the same thing for roads and motorways and in particular for video content for corporate customers for example a lot of the broadcaster's they're very keen to be able to measure the quality of the video and people like Netflix or you know any other broadcasters they're all very keen to make sure they are putting out the best quality the video and through one of the use cases of liquid apps we can provide them quality assurance and optimization of that of that video experience John do you have any concrete examples you can challenge about well I have some concrete problems right where though we all can relate to your children in the back seat wanting to watch their high definition video downloads and screaming for more more bandwidth I think with the help of location-based services predictable placement of content down the road because we know how fast that car is going where it's headed we can you know preload content down the road and give them a fantastic high-definition experience and less shouting in the car I mean to me that's a promise that I hope to see content with a sort of technology and that and even beyond the shouting kits on the back seat there's this whole new space of Internet of Things which is which is out there and where I think many people have been scratching their head so how can we really make that happen if we look a little bit closer we will find out that many of these objects and there are many billions of these objects out there will generate a sizable amount of data and much of that data would first hit the network at the base station so it makes complete sense to actually catch it there and pre processes there to first of all limiting res benefit to the cloud which can be very substantial as we have seen and secondly enables some real low latency decision-making based on the analyzer so what we had shown in Barcelona this year was was video surveillance as an example so what we've seen is that by analyzing the camera feeds at the base station we can take out some ninety-five percent of the road traffic and there with really thin out the amount that goes further into the cloud further analysis and we can come to quicker decisions we can come too quick or insights based on that data and take action on it so very easy example and I think only with edge computing really many of these IOT use cases will will make sense and will be implementable I just said last week that even a cow today is generating to a megabyte of data every year just by some health monitoring I don't know how many cows we have in the world but sorry how's the right internet next thing you know what what's what's next and we need this distributed computing approach for handling all these objects or animals in that and after I mean as well as we go into the future that will have more exotic use cases we're actually in a controlled environment in an indoor environment you could even have the users controlling the physical characteristics of the base station changing the antennas tilting orienting the antennas changing the coverage so you could use that to adapt to allow the user to that the coverage in an indoors relation themselves and they might want to on a certain day have it covering a certain end part of the building and the next day another part of the building why not if it even if the corporate building or if it's a shopping center you know we should be allowing that flexibility in the future or even for gaming for example you could use the network characteristics could be controlled by the gamers to be able to control for example I don't know gaming robots are to bring games alive you know so that's more exotic that's coming in the future but what we need is the the creative types to come along think about that and what would they do with the network if they had it in their hands to be another use case that I'm dreaming about solving here is also the one of battery life which is the other thing my the backseat passengers are complaining about I think with rightly deployed this will allow you to be very efficient in your upload be very very you know faster upload stuff let your client device go back to power saving mode enhance give you longer battery life experience as well it's easy to forget about these things we're all about great consumption but it's it's actually how the whole device can be improved thanks to how the network technology is implemented people tend to forget about that but the network helps your device experience you know improve dramatically as well okay final question we're down to our last minute believe it or not already what about the developers you mentioned these a couple of times if you give it short sharp answer to this if you would each of you what about the developers they're all important as you said how are they going to go about getting their hands on the platform begin designing and writing apps I mean the software market here is going to be particularly important as we know so how are you good to do it well the spa facilities is a very important stepping stone for developers to come in so we are bringing the platform to where the developers are basically what they'll recognize is a platform that looks very similar to a data center with some specialities which are simply due to the fact that the surface it's inside the base station but with regards to API descriptions their ability to bring the house to as together with the application deployed inside a virtual machine all these kind of things are not telecom specific that's very much data center or private cloud like technology so they all find something very similar to what they have been using in the past and yeah we invite them to come here not only to bath but also to two other such places that that we hope we can actually open up to be to be where they are and benefit from their their innovation and inspiration thank you John so no no that's that's fantastic and that's what we wanted this bath center to be able to do from an Intel vantage point we are also developing or or we've started a developer community called into networks builders which is another way a for software companies to come together compare notes learn from one another listen to each other on optimizations and making sure that they are on the latest you know software revisions and so forth and draw benefits from one another and that those those have really been hotbed for innovation conversations on top of this type of platform so I foresee that happening continuously throughout 2015 and onwards as well these can software ecosystem gatherings to draw from each other thank you meant to the last words with you ya know I think the two ways really first of all we'll be listening to our partners and when you say you've got you know interesting partners that you like us to meet will be more than happy to do that but at the same time I think would be what we'll be doing is will be organizing some open days specifically for ye hear you know together with the Nokia inter where we bring some of our corporate customers who are interested in some of the developments here and some of our corporate developers who work on our app ecosystem to bring them together here to have a look at the possibilities here and and basically to see what they'd like to contribute well thank you gentlemen very much indeed we're out of time and half hours gone pretty quickly Satya and all it remains for me to do is to thank Intel for hosting us here in their offices in bath in Somerset in cold England and to thank my panel and to thank you for watching goodbye for now
