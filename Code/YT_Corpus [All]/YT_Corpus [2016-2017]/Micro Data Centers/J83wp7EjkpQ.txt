 next professor david menon from the center TBI project thank you so thank you very much I'd like to thank the organizers for asking me to come and share our experience with this project as you see it has my name as a contributor and very small letters and what I'm doing is representing a large number of collaborators and thus entity behind the wider interval project which you just heard about so what's what's it all about why should we be looking at TBI because we currently got a pandemic of traumatic brain injury across the world in Europe it hits 2.5 million people each year and million are admitted to hospital nearly 100 thousand died in the u.s. it's 1.7 million the TBI every 20 seconds and a TBI death every 10 minutes but the big problem and the increasing problem is in the developing countries with increasing industrialized nations for example in India these are probably underestimates there are over 50 million traumatic brain injuries 15 million hospitalizations and the rate is increasing at four times the population growth with between half a million and a million deaths a year this is a big problem but the deaths are the least of the problem it's a it has a global and enduring impact there's an enormous burden of late morbidity in survivors which changes their lives and those of their families forever and even mild traumatic brain injury can have really quite disabling effects which may last for months to years but what we're realizing over the last decade or so is that this this disability can be progressive in a proportion of patients perhaps a third to a fifth of patients and it's an important epigenetic risk factor for late dementia and that risk may be 1.5 fold or as high as 10 fold depending on the severity of the brain injury and also your underlying so all this comes together to say that though people are making a big noise about dementia it's really important to make the point that neuro trauma is and will remain on projections up to 2030 the most important cause of neuro disability worldwide we really need to do something about this so what can we do well we can start off by trying to see whether we know the disease well unfortunately we haven't been doing a great job at classifying the disease and understanding it most of our classifications and our pathways for treatment are based on the Glasgow Coma Scale which had its 40th anniversary and 2014 devised by Graham Teasdale and Glasgow it's it's a fantastic clinical tool but the way it's been applied to traumatic brain injury gives you some gradation of the severity of injury so for example mild traumatic brain injury when you present with concussion to the emergency department can still have a disability of 10 to 30 percent at 3 to 6 months moderate traumatic brain injury where you are still able to respond and obey commands results in the disability of probably 50% at six months and severe traumatic brain injury has probably only one in four people recovering to pretty much their original state three in four will either die or be significantly disabled so you would top your thought that if we've got all the sorted out and this is such an important disease we would know precisely what to do for each patient unfortunately we don't so these are all scans of patients who've been classified as having severe traumatic brain injury and they have widely differing prognosis pathophysiology and perhaps most importantly treatment needs so if you look up here these two patients have what I call surgical traumatic brain injuries and this patient could return to a completely normal outcome with quick surgery this patient requires surgery but may not have a really good outcome and this patient probably doesn't need surgery at all so we have patients require surgery some people who can improve with aggressive management medical management because a lot of TBI is disease and we need to be able to have treatments to offer in a more precise way it's not that we don't have treatment this thing on the right side is our protocol algorithm for traumatic brain injury in Cambridge which includes something like forty to sixty interventions depending on how you slice and dice it but these interventions are aimed primarily at raised pressure in the brain rather than the underlying mechanisms they're based on population targets and they are stratified by side effects we use the most dangerous therapies late even though they may be the most right ones to use in a small proportion of patients early so this is not precision medicine as enunciated by the National Research Council and Institute of Medicine in the u.s. in fact it's not precision medicine at all what it's more like is this it's from our one size fits none line because we're not using the right treatments and the right patients at the right time so the answer to this one part of the jigsaw that's the answer to this is the center TBI project the collaborative European York Rome effectiveness research and TBI project which is a precision medicine and comparative effectiveness research project and traumatic brain injury coordinated by Andrew Mars from Antwerp and myself and it consists of 43 institutions with over 80 scientists who will look at data that is collected from 70 investigating centers across Europe in 23 countries and as Katherine Behrens pointed out supported not just by the EU but also by one mind who have helped us with Diane CF to create portals for sharing of data and analysis of data what is the study about well we have not just characterization of the patients but the centers who are taking care of the patients so we have Center profiling providing a context of care so we understand what treatments are offered then we have a course study with just under 2,000 patients in each stratum patients who pitch up to the emergency department and are discharged so the mildest form of traumatic brain injury to understand why some of these people have laid disability that goes on for weeks months and occasionally years and the admissions staff and people who come into the hospital but not SiC that they go to the ICU and the ICU stratum this is underpinned by an anonymized administrative registry data set which allows us to look for generalizability of our course study and look at the impact of process variables which we get in the first of this of the categories you have there then we focused out the smaller populations we have detailed serial mr in just under two thousand patients high-resolution ICU data in several hundred patients including intracranial pressure recording intracranial chemistry with micro Dallas's brain tissue po2 monitoring and high-resolution electro and careful ography a small sub study looks at the electric auto cog Rafi looking at spreading depression and there is an EEG sub study also going on the inclusion criteria are very straightforward you have to have a suspicion of TBI and an indication for a computer for computerized tomography scan which makes you get to a certain threshold of severity and you have to present within 24 hours of your injury there are some very straightforward exclusion criteria basically making sure that the underlying disease doesn't prevent us from looking at the impact of the TBI on outcome and we're looking for consecutive consenting patients with a pragmatic definition sometimes in Windows but making the point that we want a representative data collection so we don't just get the patients who happen to come at convenient times all these data will be combined and are being combined in repositories of clinical data the physiological data neuroimaging DNA circulating biomarkers and outcome data and many countries where ethics permissions allow have patient identifiers stored for long-term follow-up and we have used these data sets to build research networks so we have a set of prioritize research targets and it's useful to just look at how the data fall together we have here the core data set of just over 5,000 patients within that you have the more detailed studies in thousand five hundred patients four times that number in the study registry so allowing us to make sure that this is generalizable to the patients who come into the centers combining that with national registries making sure that our centers particularly in the UK and Germany represent the national populations of patients and then international collaborations across the EU USA Canada Australia China and India which I might have time to talk to you about later on and then we have a whole category of evidence synthesis and communicating that evidence with a lot of translation knowledge translation and implementation science built into it very importantly all of these repositories are going to be stored for eventual open access so they provide a research legacy for future studies so this is our recruitment this is what I downloaded yesterday we're up to about halfway to our target with 2,600 patients and the core study getting on for 10,000 patients in the registry and 57 current actively recruiting sites some sites have finished their recruitment and dropped out because they've reached their target but importantly as Kathryn Barron's pointed out what makes this special is that it's part of a bigger hole and that is the international initiative a traumatic brain injury research which is not a collaboration of just of academics but a collaboration of funding agencies the European Union National Institutes of Health the CIHR and one mindful research and these are the studies that initiated the interior collaboration but currently using both direct and leverage funding that's getting on for a hundred million dollars worth of research funding for this we will eventually recruit data on 25,000 patients with traumatic brain injury 10,000 of whom will have quite detailed information we have information involvement of Chinese and Indian centers the Chinese project is led by Professor Jiang from Shanghai the Indian project is still being built up it's being led from the all the Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi we see this as a generational opportunity for traumatic brain research this is a Framingham study for neuro trauma so intima is more than the sum of its parts it is the logic of common data platforms the common data elements which Kathryn referred to which means that each of us are culling collecting data which has the same vocabulary syntax and grammar allowing us to combine datasets the opportunities provided by spontaneous treatment variations because there are some centers for example that always take out Bru's bits of brain and some centers that don't to run a randomized control trial of that would be very difficult but looking at natural variation will provide really important insights that could change management over the coming years in decades the public benefit of open access to curate the data essentially we make the whole neuro trauma research community our research team the strength of numbers would mean that impossible questions suddenly become answerable and we can have new research paradigms the incremental phenotype and I'll talk to you about that a bit later and use data driven approaches such as those being pioneered by ncf and this power of networks can accelerate knowledge transfer to patient care and that implementation science part insensitive RIA is really in a very important thing for us because as Gary pointed out it's not just enough to know we have to do and this could result in a paradigm shift in research collaborations and yield an investment that will yield scientific dividends in the future so two examples of how this is developed first of all the gain consortium genetic Association the neuro trauma consortium we're now in the second stage of an application the Wellcome Trust it's a pragmatic consortium of interior partners from Santa TBI track TBI which is our American sister study recruiting 3,000 Costa patients the CIHR cohorts which are focusing primarily on mild and sports-related TBI and then because inspire is not a project it's a concept all of these researchers who include most of the major trauma centers in the world bringing their old datasets which have been properly curated and ongoing studies outside entry are collecting data with CDs so we can bring everything together we look for both minimum phenotypes that we can do really large-scale studies and then very refined studies using a very detailed phenotype with neuroimaging or treatment variables and your cognitive testing there's a common genotyping platform which has been developed at the Broad Jonathan rose and and his colleagues along with Arno Pilate are the people from there and we will genotype at three centres in order to avoid all of the regulatory barriers and then we can bring the data together to undertake meta-analysis later at the Broad Institute the Finnish Institute for molecular medicine and probably the Center for Applied genomics in Toronto we are now at 12,000 patients and growing and it's salutary to recognize that this is now 10 times the largest genetic Association study that there was in the past so I talk to you about the more detailed phenotype let me give you an example in my last slide so this is a frontal projection of all of the white matter tracks in a normal person one of my newer surgical consultant colleagues and this is color-coded to show the direction of white matter fibers and now I'm going to show you data from one patient acquired at several time points in two days one week six weeks six months and one year and what you can see is between two days and six weeks there's loss of white matter it's not surprising this guy's had a severe traumatic brain injury but then after six weeks going on to six months and one year there is an ongoing loss of white matter in the brain this brain does not just have the residual effects of a bad traumatic brain injury it is an acute process but it is a chronic process it's initiated acutely but goes on for a long time this is just a picture but the important point is that this pattern is seen in ten to twenty percent of our TBI patients and the loss of white matter correlates with recovery and cognitive deterioration what's being called negative negative neuroplasticity it now provides both a new treatment target and a new biomarker for that treatment now in centers like ours in Cambridge which is very near trauma center we might actually pick up over a five-year period 20 patients who have the willingness to come back for such follow-up and have clear phenotypic characterization in int where we will have several hundred patients we can ask the question what makes these people different and one of the things that might make it different is one of the neuro degenerative processes such as amyloid deposition in the brain and I'll finish with this not because this is the cause but many of the tools that we have now developed for chronic brain disease for neurodegenerative disease can be applied and this is showing PET imaging of amyloid in the human brain from our Center but there are many other processes that we would want to interrogate thank you very much
