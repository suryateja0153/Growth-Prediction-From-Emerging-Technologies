 today there's an amazing degree of security innovation that's gone on and we're seeing the investment the amount of work that's going on and the major security brands is simply incredible and we combine that with an incredible number of startups that are going on in valuations well until a month ago they were going crazy and you see that there's this never before has we had more security innovation so the question is what's missing you know why is it that we simply can't deliver a more secure infrastructure more secure architecture in this environment and we would simply say we lack a security architecture now some of you of course would take great offense at such a statement but we would argue that we've never really had a true architecture for security every organization has policies they want to see enforced across all of their security tools and we consider this the great divide we have policies on one side and a whole set of tools on the other side and an inability to align those policies against the objectives and the services that are available and fundamentally we need an architecture that allows us to bridge this divide and fundamentally we believe that virtualization and the ubiquitous layer of virtualization allows us to cross this divide it enables us to raise all boats and fundamentally the virtualization layer allows us to accomplish two things it's an alignment between the physical infrastructure and the applications above it allows us to connect the dots through the lens of the application and it's ubiquitous it's the first ubiquitous layer that we've ever had that cuts across compute network storage within the data center across multiple data centers and now even across clouds and rather than the question of how do I secure virtualization the question is how virtual is a enables me to secure everything
