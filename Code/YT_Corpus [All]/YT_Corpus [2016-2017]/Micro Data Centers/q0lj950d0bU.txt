 I'm a datacenter dynamics 2015 which hydroelectric is just announced its new micro data center products and solutions and Kevin can you tell us what sort of edge computing applications are driving the state for micro data centers yeah and i think it's a it's a very interesting time because we really believe microdata senators very much emerging it's at the beginning of a trend and it's part of the larger context of edge computing you know we see that there could be three forms of edge computing in the world one could be something as small as an embedded device that's handling relatively light loads and data at the edge there's going to be other solutions where what we call a regional data center that's going to look and feel a lot like a regular data center we have today but it's going to be closer to a fiber loop that's close to the edge of where the computes happening but we see some customers coming to us with this emerging need in the micro data center is the solution that we think is meets many of those needs where they have a specific application that they're trying to run the compute that they need is going to fit within one rack or maybe a few racks they want a very specific solution it's going to be optimized for the application and the IT that they're deploying and they're going to want to be able to deploy that very easily and have all the security and everything built in so that's really what we've been announced a day is trying to get some different solutions to help meet that need some of these can be looked like a piece of office furniture that you could be standing to and you wouldn't even know what data center was running in some of them are very industrialized type solutions that are designed to go outside or in any rugged environment so we have different forms of these micro data centers they all ship in one box and really are designed to allow someone if the application demands it to deploy data center compute really anywhere and so we're pretty excited about it we're trying to help lead this trend and be at the beginning and it's really quite fun as we're talking to different customers about how are they trying to meet these challenges that edge computing is giving them so do you believe with the launch of micro datacenters we're taking a step towards say a datacenter appliance which includes the IT as well as the physical infrastructure yeah I think it is you know in many ways you know Micro data center and some of the things that we're talking about an extension of the trend that's been happening in the IT industry of Halla converged IT hyper converged whatever term you want to use where's the compilers combination of the storage and networking to compute all coming into one box but if they're also generally designed to run one application the customer deploys at an application that they want they deploy a convergence solution for that what we're really trying to is extend that into the physical infrastructure so that I can deploy really IT anyway we think it's a quite effective solution when you can design that all to fit together we're working very hard with the IT vendors to make sure that we've got solutions that are optimized to fit what they're doing and what the customers are deploying and at the end of day it's going to be quite interesting because I believe you're going to see customers where they're in certain applications where they need compute close they're certainly going to have things into the cloud and it's going to be a lot of conversation about depending on my application what I'm running does it make sense for me to put it in the public cloud a private cloud into a micro data center perhaps very close to the edge because the any day what's starting to emerge is really you know the people are going to eat compute anywhere and everywhere and so you know we're trying to make sure that we have solutions that can help you fulfill that be Kevin thank you very much thanks
