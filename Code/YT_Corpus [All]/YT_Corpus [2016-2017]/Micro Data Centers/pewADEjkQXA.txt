 this is now describing the 3d of the energy worm first one is the carbonization the carbonization means that we are going more and more in the renewable field fifty percent of the expected new energy is going to be in a renewable world in the renewable technology this is the first day of the of the change that we are facing the second d is the digitization we are connecting all the devices our devices should be talking to other devices in order to make it more compliant and making more efficient this is the second description the third description is about decentralization a lot of things has changed in the world of the energy in the world of the utilities the decentralization is what that today we are having generation everywhere in the infrastructure in the network in the grid what is our advanced great vision what is the solution of our digital world of what is solution of the energy world that we see for the for the future three anger that we see number one is the grid efficiency all the tools that we want to put in place in order to make the grid more efficient automation smart devices software scatter system this is one point which is how do I manage automatically how to manage I do I manage in the real time my grid number one is efficiency number two is about grid edge the great edge is the way of introducing renewable energy it's a way of putting the energy inside the grid and this is how do I manage this distributed generation which is now becoming what we call also Michael great the third the third answer to this equation of the 3ds demand side we have to work on the generations I we have to work also on the demand side whether it is on the demand side at the level of the industry but also at a level of commercial industry building and then also at the level of the residential which is how do we manage the demand side how do we integrate this wat which is the negative what that we are injecting of Lee I would say Sabine taking of the the grid in order to make it happen where are the most exciting innovations in the energy sector occurring so the carbonization renewable penetration and generally the necessity of more efficiency in the distribution network generated a technology acceleration for a simple network automation smart voltage regulation smart metering advanced distribution management system 10 15 years ago vez peony paeonia 6 known as NL we started our program for scada for remote control 23 ago we started the smart metering 15 year ago we started living a lemon ago our edms project with Schneider people in Serbia consumers becoming pro Zuma's and that is driven as much faster in trying to adopt all the 3d technologies in making it more meaningful and to meet customers expectations I consider demand-side management as important as distributed energy resources I have a pen in my hand kind of demonstrate I see this kind of a balance point you can work either the man side management portion or the generation portion but for that thing to be balanced you've got to work in both spaces and it's got to be connected what will be the magnitude of this power system transfer transformation because we are transforming this power system pretty rapidly with the power system adapting we had as well all the utilities having to adapt their businesses because when we look at technology we tend to look at technology from an integrated way we think okay what makes sense to be put in place when we look at the power system and we take a business driven approach is a slightly different with unbundling rules in Europe with the utilities having thermal acids on one hand and being to ask as well to add renewables having to integrate intermittent renewables into the system I think that there is a decoupling between the economic fundamentals and the technical illogic of operating a power system and this is something that is a structural in Europe it has changed completely the rules of the game utilities are trying to adapt to this new reality new entrants are getting there and clearly technology is the only in a blur that is going to make this possible I think the revenue element will come if in fact we're listening to what our customers needs are if the solution that the utility is presenting solves what that customer need is I think the revenue will follow I think a micro grid is a legitimate solution for select customers now your data centers your hospital districts I think those are legitimate needs and I think the utilities in the right spot to provide those needs you
