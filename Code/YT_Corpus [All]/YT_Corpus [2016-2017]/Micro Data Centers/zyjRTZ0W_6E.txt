 welcome to the ihp I seminar series today we have two speakers our first speaker are you gonna speak for sale soon Sarah Miller is going to speak first professor Miller has a PhD in economics from the University of Illinois she was a Robert Wood Johnson not clinical scholar health policy scholar at the University of Michigan and she is now a professor of the business school and she's going to be talking about her focus is on health policy and the short and long run effects of Medicaid policy in particular sara is using a database that Clint Carter is the administrator up so one of the reasons we wanted them to come and speak was to give all of you an idea of what you could do with this fabulous data that they have so after Sarah's presented her research mr. Carter's going to come up and present some of the details of what's available for other research as well thank you great well thanks so much for having me I'm excited to be able to talk to you you know not only about my research about the Affordable Care Act but also kind of sell the research data center that we have here at the University of Michigan it's such a fantastic resource for researchers I remember when I was in graduate school I I wanted to some restricted use census data for my PhD and I had to drive three hours to go to the RDC up in Chicago and then work all day and then drive three hours back so it's just it's such a tremendous resource to have rdc here on campus so I think it's something no everyone should take advantage of so the research i'm going to present that uses data that is restricted use data from the RDC is about the consequences of the ACA medicaid expansions this is a project that's joint with laura weary who's at UCLA so just to give you a little bit of background on medicaid a rich I prior to the Affordable Care Act Medicaid was a program that provided health insurance to certain groups within the low-income population so for example low-income pregnant women low-income children and low-income families the disabled for example now as the Affordable Care Act was originally written and originally intended to be implemented it was going to expand Medicaid eligibility to not just people falling within these categories but all low-income uninsured adults of course that didn't actually end up happening in 2012 there was a Supreme Court decision in which it was decided that these Medicaid expansions would be optional states could choose whether or not to expand Medicaid eligibility to individuals and households making up to one hundred and thirty-eight percent of the federal poverty level so in 2014 there were 24 states that chose to forgo these expansions and not expand coverage to their low income populations affected 6.7 million as estimated by the Urban Institute low-income uninsured adults who would have otherwise to gain coverage through the ACA expansions now in the last year there have been a couple states that have sort of fallen to political pressure and have opted to expand Medicaid but as of the last time I checked which was a couple weeks ago there are still 20 states that are not intending to implement these expansions so our paper is asking what are the consequences of this decision not to expand Medicaid eligibility as intended in the ACA on the low income folks that are in these states there's already some data that's there some evidence that's kind of begun to trickle out here and I consider this paper part of this trickle first there was a very recent paper in Java um that used Gallup data they found that states that did not expand Medicaid eligibility to their low income populations had less of a gain in health insurance coverage they individuals in these states were more likely to report having no personal physician or difficulty accessing Medicaid care art sorry medical care as compared to that did adopt the expansion's there were also some early estimates of increased coverage from the NHIS which is the data set I'm going to be using that found that those states that adapted Medicaid unsurprisingly saw greater gains and health insurance coverage in their low-income populations and of course there's lots of existing evidence on what's going on with Medicaid what does Medicaid do so I mean I think the Oregon Health Insurance experiment is one example but perhaps the most prominent example of looking at an expansion besides the Affordable Care Act and trying to figure out you know what is Medicaid going to do and of course they found greater utilization greater financial protection of course you have to wonder the population in Oregon looks a lot different than the population in the rest of the United States and so you might be curious if the results in Orion are going to have immediately apply to all states and under the ACA otherwise there hasn't been that much evidence but kind of on a week to week month to month basis i think more evidence is coming in as more data starts coming in so in our paper we're using a restricted used version of the national health interview survey from 2010 to 2014 and we're going to look at how these medicaid expansions affected coverage access utilization and self-reported health among the low-income population in the states that did and did not choose to expand medicaid so a few advantages of using this data first of all national health interview survey is a very high quality federal survey has a very high response rate asks a very broad set of questions so greater than seventy-five percent response rate compared to for example the gallup data something in the five to seven percent response rate and they also asked about a large set of questions on topics that we might be interested in that we might think that health insurance is going to be affecting so just to give you a quick summary of our results just in case I I run out of time here so consistent with some of the previous research but kind of a bit larger effects that have been found previously we find that states that adapted the Medicaid expansion experienced much greater gains and health insurance coverage about eight percentage point it's about a 35-percent greater increase in coverage as a result as you would expect this is largely in increase in Medicaid coverage right about an almost 10 percentage point increase in Medicaid coverage in the states that adopted the expansions we also find that survey respondents report much higher rates of having higher quality health insurance they feel that their health insurances higher quality than it was in the previous year which is interesting as Medicaid is usually perceived as sort of a low quality not very good type of health insurance we find increase visits with doctors decreased respond reports that respondent has no usual place of care because of costs and we also find increased rates of diagnosis for chronic illnesses yeah so I'm going to get into the data a little bit more but um it's through the end of 2014 so we're going to be looking at the second half of 2014 as compared to 2010 through the end of 2013 so that is from the national health interview survey from 2010 through 2014 this is a nationally representative household survey all household members are asked kind of a small set of questions these are in what's called the person file and then within each household there's an adult that's selected to receive a little bit more of an in-depth interview so they're asked a larger number of questions about their use of health care and their their health so we're going to use outcomes from both of these data sets although you'll see when we use the sample adult file this sample sizes are obviously going to be smaller we're going to look at all non elderly US citizens adult citizens between the ages of 19 and 64 in families with incomes under one hundred and thirty-eight percent of the federal poverty level in our main analysis but we have a pretty pretty thick appendix where we check that our results are not particularly sensitive to you know slightly differing the sample that we're using or changing our model specification a little bit so the restricted use variable that we get from the RDC is the state of residence so you can go online right now you can download the National Health Interview Survey and you'll get all of this data but you won't know where any of these people live so of course to do this analysis where we're comparing States it's really important we have this restricted use variable so that was really nice to be able to get that in the RTC here we drop states that previously had Medicaid expansions to adults in this in this income frame again you know in the appendix we kind of verify how sensitive our results are to this and it turns out not very so if I have time I'll show you some of those kind of alternative models the way we're going to approach this because obviously there are fixed differences across states that shows and chose not to expand the ACA Medicaid coverage so what we're going to do is we're not going to just compare a cross-sectional across states we're going to look at changes that happen within states so we're going to look at the trends that happened within the states that opted to expand Medicaid eligibility and the states that did not this is a difference in differences framework so we're going to exclude the first half of 2014 we're going to sort of dummy that out because that was the kind of the beginning of the expansions and we're just going to compare the second half of 2014 to the years that were previous 2010 to the end of 2013 so if you're an equations person then this is my regression model that I'm not going then I'm going to be estimating if you're not an equations person you feel free to just look at your phone for the next 30 seconds but I just want to be very clear okay what our model is doing so we have we have our outcome variable so we're going to look at things like doctors visit self-reported health coverage we have a state fixed effect so a binary variable for each state this is going to account for any differences across states that are constant over time so the fact that the states that expanded look differently than the states that didn't expand we're going to account for this with our state fixed effect we're also going to include a year fixed effect that will account for any trends that are common to all states and we have a quarter dummy variables just in case there's some seasonality that we would be picking up by splitting the year up like this so the first beta one is going to be the interaction between an indicator that the state opted to expand Medicaid in an indicator that the survey respondent is in the first half of 2014 so you can think of beta 1 as capturing sort of the very early effect of ACA and then beta 2 is our primary variable of interest it's the interaction between the indicator that the state expanded Medicaid in the indicator that this was in the second half of 2014 we're also going to include some characteristics of the respondents such as their race marital status number of children in the family educational attainment and dummy variables for each age of the person responding and as I mentioned beta 2 is going to be the main effective interest and that's going to capture how different the change was for the expansion versus the non-expansion States over this period from pre ACA to after ACA so our underlying assumption in this model is that in the absence of the Affordable Care Act these states would have been on a similar trend and so we can use the trend that we observe in the non-expansion States to give us an idea of what the trend would have been in the expansion States of course that's a much more believable assumption if prior to the ACA it looks like they're following about the same trend right so here I'm going to show you the results but at the top is going to be a figure that shows just the unadjusted you know whatever the dependent variable is so here's a percent without a percent without insurance coverage in the ACA states that we're expanding which is the the line that has the black filled in that versus the non-expansion States which is that can open triangle all right and so the top line there is the non-expansion States in the bottom is the expansion States and so as you can see in 2010 2011 2012 the Trent 2013 the trend looks pretty similar across the two groups of states it's only in 2014 you can see some divergence where there's a greater reduction in the fraction without insurance then in the expansion States than in the non-expansion States right so if you want to see this more in terms of a table that's what I have here at the bottom it shows that sent uninsured among the expanding state's first pre ACIM post ACA then the same numbers and the non-expansion States pre and post and one thing I do want to point out here is as you can see on the graph is both in the expanding anthon on expanding States there was an increase in insurance coverage because probably through the state exchanges or increased take up among people that were already eligible so there is in effect in both states but the difference is much larger if you just look at the expansion States ok so there's about a seven percentage point larger gaining coverage among the states that expanded our or between seven and eight percentage points gained and coverage in the states that expanded relative to the states that didn't expand so the next outcome we look at is the fraction that have Medicaid coverage again we see have a slight increase even in the non-expansion States that could be increased awareness or increase take up as a result of the mandate you see a much larger increase in Medicaid enrollment if you look at the states that actually expanded Medicaid coverage so there's between an eight and a ten percentage point increase in Medicaid enrollment in the expansion States relative to the non-expansion States um the next question that we look at is we the survey respondents are asked you know has your health insurance the quality of your health insurance to improve relatives of the last year here you see very similar trends prior to the Affordable Care Act and then a much larger increase in those reporting that they have better health insurance this year relative to a year ago in the states adopted to expand Medicaid coverage all right so you can see between six and eight point six percentage point in relative improvement in the state such chose to expand Medicaid the next so the next set of outcomes are going to look at utilization so in this figure I'm plotting the the fraction of people that saw or talked to a general doctor in the last year and what you can see is there's a relative increase in states that expanded men Medicaid between five and four and a half and five and a half percentage points right so it looks like stateside expanded Medicaid people in low income households are going to the doctor more they're visiting the doctor more often when we look at specialist visits this was something we were particularly interested in as its kind of thought to be one big barrier that low-income populations face is getting in to see a specialist we see some mixed evidence about the effect of Medicaid in both the unadjusted for covariates and adjusted for covariance we see a relative increase of between three and 3.5 percentage points although our confidence intervals are a bit larger in the adjusted model and so we can't reject that on that effect is different from zero so I would say at least suggestive evidence that there's also an increase in visits with a specialist for hospitalizations we don't find any relative increase that's statistically significant in the expansion versus the non-expansion States this is a little bit in contrast to what they saw in the Oregon Health Insurance experiment where they saw cut a very large increases in hospitalizations however we do know that we do see positive point estimates and we have pretty wide confidence intervals that would include treatment effects that would be similar to those found in oregon health insurance experiments so this could be one area we're having a relatively limited post implementation period might be hurting us in terms of power similarly emergency department visits this was also an area where they found have large increases in the Oregon Medicaid experiment we're not finding large increases here but again we have pretty large confidence intervals so that would include you know effect sizes in the neighborhood of what they saw in Oregon so the next set of outcomes we look at relate to access so here are reports that individual said that they had to delay care due to costs sometime in the last 12 months and we don't find it suggests alee significant effect here we were a little bit surprised since this was could have one thing where we would expect to see a large effect but again you know as I said we're looking at a relatively short period after the she has been implemented so perhaps some of these effects will materialize in another one or two years so you you want to get access to all ready see now so you can be ready to write that follow-up paper that was a joke um also a similar results for usual source of care we don't find any effects unusual source of care if you look the two groups seem to be trending pretty closely together although one thing I would notice it does look like they're going up after the Affordable Care Act is implemented in both the expanding and the non expanding states so it seems like more people have a usual place with care there's just not a differentially large increase among states that expanded Medicaid and then the last access question i believe is reporting that you had no you know usual source of care because of costs here again we find a bit mixed results so in the adjusted model we find a significant reduction in people saying oh I wanted to have a usual source of care but I couldn't because because I didn't have insurance or it was too expensive but it's not statistically significant in the unadjusted model so our last set of outcomes that we look at have to do with being diagnosed for chronic illnesses this is one thing people speculate it could be a source of improved health for individuals that they had undiagnosed chronic illnesses perhaps expanding Medicaid coverage could help their long-term health by increasing the rates of diagnosis here we look at reports that they were diagnosed with diabetes we find significant relative increases in the expansion States relative to the non-expansion States about 3 percentage points to four and a half percentage points we look at diagnosis with hypertension again we find positive point estimates but our confidence intervals are pretty large so we can't really say anything about hypertension and then we have diagnosed with cholesterol unfortunately I don't have a picture here because it was only asked in two years it was asked in 2014 and it was asked in 2012 so we really only have those two pieces of data that I have in the table but if we done you know sort of have you no faith that the assumptions that'll are satisfied we can say that there was a relative increase in in these diagnoses so that our final set of outcomes are about self-reported health the first is they ask survey respondents if their health was better than 1 year ago we don't find any statistically significant effect there but again positive point estimates and pretty wide confidence intervals this could be an area for future research oh I I think that might be the only self-reported health question i have here so i think i have a few minutes left yet so I'm just going to flash a couple illegible big tables in front of your eyes to try to convince you that we did think about robustness and we did think about the sensitivity of our results to sample selection so the first set of column shows the adjusted difference-in-differences effects when we include the state unemployment rate to account for perhaps some contemporaneous but unrelated change in the economic climate doesn't seem to affect things very much we include the early expanders in our model it attenuates the results a little bit which is what we expected since this is a group that is not really experiencing as big of a gain and coverage but overall we see kind of us very similar pattern increased utilization decrease reports of not having health insurance coverage we include non-citizen so some non-citizens would have been medicaid eligible if they were in the country legally again this is a pretty small fraction of our data so it doesn't change the results very much we limit our sample to only those making under one hundred percent of the federal poverty level so those between 100 and 138 would have had access to health insurance through the health insurance exchanges so we might think that this is really the sample that's really strongly affected by by the decision not to take up the Medicaid expansions and here we see pretty similar results as in the main model suggesting that there was some kind of effect for people in this gray zone between 100 and 138 and then finally we exclude young adults who in general might have gained coverage through the dependent cut the dependent coverage mandate here we actually see a little bit sharper increase when we look at utilization we see a marginally significant increase in going to the specialist in a significant increase in going to the hospital so in this sample we find a little bit stronger effects and then again just to sort of flash this quickly in front of you so you can see that with the other outcomes we kind of have similar results when I cut the sample in different ways this is for the access to health and diagnosis outcomes and self-reported health outcomes and we find again pretty much the same effect if we include non-citizens include early adjusters includes state unemployment rate things like that okay and here's the other two cuts that we do in the appendix all right so I'm just a quick discussion of what the results mean and then I'll turn it over to Clint who will tell you about you know other great data you can use at the RDC so we find large increases in coverage um I guess I didn't show you the results for private insurance because of my limited time but we didn't find any change in people reporting that they had private insurance so that's what we would think of as economist at least we would call this crowd out it doesn't seem like people are dropping their private insurance and switching on to Medicaid we find my magnitude of effect that's consistent with earlier estimates from NHS but it's quite a bit larger than what they saw in the gallop data in their recent chama we do see some increase in utilization which is what we would probably expect from previous studies of Medicaid that tends to find that it increases the use of care we see more doctor's visits suggestive evidence of increased visits with specialists higher rates of diagnosis of chronic conditions we don't find any increase in emergency department visits or hospitalizations which is a little bit in contrast to some previous studies but you know one thing that we thought was very striking is that even though we only really have two quarters of truly post-implementation data we're already seeing some of these increases in the use of care okay so we might think that if people are getting in to see primary care physicians if they're getting diagnosed we might see better health on the road in a year or two we don't find changes in self-reported health this doesn't really surprise us since people are having more contact with medical professionals and they're learning about maybe chronic illnesses that they already had it could give them the perception that their health is is worse we really we don't see any change we see in a very small point estimates the point estimates suggest there were improvements in self-reported health but again it seems perhaps maybe a little bit too early to uncover these sort of effects alright that's all i have i guess Clint it's up next ok so I'm Clint Carter I am the administrator in the Michigan research data center we are part of the federal statistic research data centers were sponsored by the US Census Bureau and the University of Michigan and we has a lot of data so I'm going to briefly introduce you to the details of an RDC go over the data that we house and provide some information on how you can access that data so what is an RDC it's a secure computing environment where qualified researchers can work on approved projects accessing non-public census and other federal data we are currently located in the Institute for Social Research in the basement actually in a brand new lab where we move last year so it's a beautiful place we even Maggie the director painted sky on a ceiling so it looks like you not in a basement you can actually look up and see clouds and birds that don't move but they're beautiful anyways so let's see so why would you want to use our data much like Sarah suggested we offer greater detail and find our geography so with our demographic data typically you can get down to the census block as opposed to what you would get in the public use micro sample which is Puma so that's one reason another reason would be that you can access data sets that we for which there is no public version that's typical of the business data sets that we house and then you can link to our data so you can bring in external data that might have PII information on it and create one to one link individual level links with some of our restricted data so for example with the palms data versus rd CRTC has lower levels of geography no top coating larger samples and greater detail and variables for example we would have more race categories than you would find in the public use version you can also get place of birth we offer some writing responses and with the health data there are diseased codes so top coating would be for some of it with it with the decennial or ACS data they don't show i don't know the percent above the top percentage of income so those are gone because you wouldn't you would be able to identify this not me but someone that makes a lot more than me it would be able to identify that person app question it depends on the the dataset we have new madden data which actually offers the i think it's a city maybe even slower than that as sarah's on the project that's using that i believe in county and city place of birth yeah so it's a that's a fairly new data set that we have in the lab and we have a project linking it to acs and looking at the war on poverty and where people were born and looking at outcomes we do have country of birth also so some of the household data sets that we have would be a decennial from 1960 through 2010 we have the acs which is the basically it's the new long-form version of the decennial and as from 1996 through 2011 we have the current population survey martin december supplements however we are working on getting new supplements i think we now have the tobacco you supplement available our website offers more detail on the new cps data sets that we have some additional data sets would be the survey of income and program participation american housing survey which is a unique survey that actually surveys houses so you not does not look at well the the people residing in the house answer the survey but if five years from now a new families in that house they answer the survey so it's basically the houses been sir we have National Crime Victimization survey national survey of college graduates the NL ms the nls and we have social security administrative administrative data as well as housing and urban development data one of the unique data sets that we have in in our lab was the longitudinal employer household data set so that is a combination of household data and business data where you can get information on the employer all of characteristics of the employer and all the employers employees and their characteristics such as race sex age I think we have some imputed education variables and salary trying to get through this fast so this is exciting thing I think with our data is that internal data most of our demographic data has been picked where they've replaced PII information with a personal identification key so if you have external data at the individual level you can bring that into our lab and merge it with our data at the individual level which is pretty unique another thing that you can do with most of our data sets is linked at the geographic level and this is true for firm level data as well where if you're looking at business firms you can bring that in link it to our firm identifiers and also perform analysis on the businesses business data we could spend all day about talking about business data is we have a lot of data sets economic censuses the longitudinal business database quarterly financial report ASBO MEPs IC annual capital expenditure sir myrtus really if you want to know about businesses we have some kind of data that will help you understand it and if you are interested in that sort of research i invite you to meet with me and we can go over it in detail we even have more through these so how do you access these data first you have to yes sir a couple slides ago you said that's insurance component yes but I a decade ago it was a merger on the way with Mets household household not that I'm aware of actually I think we do I'm sorry I think we do have an NHS data set that includes MEPs also yeah I have a slide later on that discusses in safe just data sets that are available I don't think that ones listed but I do believe I've seen that so you identify the data you need talk to me talk to the executive director Maggie levinstein will set up a meeting with you ask you to write a brief two-page summary of or not to page two paragraph summary of what you would like to research and we will go over the data that's available suggests data that you might not be aware of and sin joy away with a template to write a proposal for the census bureau the proposal process is non-trivial it's a 15 page proposal single-spaced one unique thing about our proposals is that your research has to benefit the Census Bureau so that's something that's most researchers don't think of but due to title 13 in title 26 Census Bureau requires predominant purpose to be the benefit of the Census Bureau some other unique things about our data we have exemption from the IRB there's no informed consents and the coolest thing for response rates is we have mandatory participation so at very large samples I could go into detail about the predominant purpose statements but in the just a time I won't do that but there are 13 criterions from which you may choose to and your research must accomplish those two things during the life of your project notes about sense of proposals please plan ahead you typically take six to six months to a year to get access you must work with us because if you don't you won't write in the language that census likes to hear so where we are well versed in that and we can help you write very boring proposals that don't excite anyone and those will pass review at the Census Bureau you also will be required to obtain special sworn status which is a security clearance for the past seven years since the security department will want to know what you've done where you work where you've lived how many times you've entered and exited the country they will ask for references for each place that you've lived and work and they will send out a letter to each I think it references that you've listed you will also have a one-on-one interview with the FBI agent and you'll be fingerprinted so it's a very secure environment yes sir because they're all housed in the lab and you may see something that you shouldn't see or you have to have security clearance to use the lab so Sarah uses nhis data but she has sense of security clearance at the I are at the highest level to moderate risk secure environment work environment everything is running on UNIX in the RDC preliminary output can only be viewed in the RTC while you're in the RDC we don't provide internet access for secure reasons software that we offer would include SAS data our matlab gals we have quite a few packages that you can use most people use data at least from the econ Department and one thing about NC HS projects is that you must work while I'm in the office that's an NT HS policy census data and on HR q data their policy is allow you to work 24-7 in the lab at nch s restricts your access to when I'm present disclosure process no output can leave the RTC with our review if you plan ahead it takes three weeks or so to get your output out basically I look at it to make sure you pass certain thresholds such as sample sizes and concentration ratios and other things once I approve it it goes to the disclosure officer at census he or she looks at it and finally approves it or comes back with questions finally information about health data so the available data that we have for help would include the maps household component from the AHRQ agency very easy to get access to their super cool agency they also get their output your results back to you within the typically the same day so super good and then national center for health statistics and this is not an all-encompassing list but it's the NHIS in haines I don't know if you're familiar with in Haines but they do some pretty neat physical exams of everybody blood tests and everything small sample because of the detail that goes into that survey but it's has a lot of information survey a family growth National Vital Statistics system national health care surveys you can see all of those and then how to contact me so I've left some brochures at the back table I handed out some brochures to people who were here earlier if you have interest in using our data welcome you to contact me and we can start talking about it and any questions I guess for Sarah or me talk about the process from researchers standpoint of getting so yeah I found the getting special sworn status is a bit time-consuming you definitely want to budget for that but it's not it's not that difficult like you you know we're all used to writing kind of proposals and things and so they just want to know that you're using the data appropriately it takes a long time to get approval like so for my projects I've usually had to do and maybe this is just me not writing the proposals well enough but I've usually had to do at least one round of revisions based on their comments before it was approved but I mean I don't I didn't I didn't find it particularly arduous and you can't remote into the RDC which you know if you like to work in your office is a little inconvenient but it's open 24 7 here so you know as long as you're not using at CHS data you can come in 24 7 yeah so i have i mean i have several projects that are DC right now and it's it's been really great especially with the new Newman link you can link to people's county of birth which is really cool if you like so I have a lot of projects on like the long-term effects of Medicaid coverage and childhood and so being able to see where someone was born you can learn a lot about the probability that they would have had Medicaid as a kid and then you can track their fertility there um you know employment outcomes human capital outcomes like educational attainment so it's been really cool that's my perspective thank you you have to go through that fingerprinting in background check is that do it again yes unfortunately you do I don't know why they did the agencies don't talk to each other yeah the obvious the direct lag is that these approvals and trigger bring put the research lag if you will is that you had to decide hmm I got to get in there because I need to know this and that will get the access to them so I guess what I'm kind of asking but I'm kind of commending you that you already had in your head ideas to do important research so that then you could go through this person okay yeah i should i should say or we should make clear you only have to go through it once so once you have the fingerprinting and everything you're you're in the system you have to apply to use the data again so like I had an ta chita for a different project than i wanted to use it for this so i had to go back and get a proof for that but you don't have to go through the whole rigmarole yo go through the first time so once you're in as long as you keep up your training you have to do like some very straightforward and not difficult trainings once you're online you like click through and then they're like two or false you can still people's identity or something like you do do a quiz at the end right but you don't have to go there's a whole thanks thankful we never hear from you again one day we'll just know that your squirrel yeah exactly they had to disappear me you're saying hey I nude I knew too much I knew the state identifier xin the NHS but um yeah once you do it once then you can just your kind of your good what about showing you your study has valued Census Bureau study that you presented today yeah so this was n CHS so I didn't I didn't really have to show that it's only for a season to go that's great but like mine understanding from friends I know that use the census is it's it's reasonably bra I mean you can make a case for a lot of different things so you have to choose to benefits one of the benefits are the estimates of your project so that one's done for you the other one we try to make it to where it's something that you will need to do to complete your analyses like if there's data cleaning that needs to be done or quality assessments of variables when you're comparing external data with internal data that can be a benefit to the bureau also so really it's not too difficult you do have to provide a technical memorandum at the end of your project detailing how you've done these what you promised to do but that's about it anything else you try to understand some of the things that came out pejoratively disappointment I'm thinking about these lads getting coverage I need a doctor getting appointment finding something wrong ticket kid when you're out of time therefore you had hospitalization or yeah i'm i totally agree with you so this is I mean this is the result I was showing you are just based on the second half of 2014 so this time next year we'll have kind of another year worth of data in fact I think some of the variables for the 2015 and h is the for the first quarter of 2015 have been released already so but i don't think the data identifiers have been made available yet but um yeah i mean we you know we went into this project knowing this these are the early effects there can be effects that get bigger over time and i think it was interesting that we already saw some really strong effects on you know things like diagnosis and going to the doctor and you know at least feeling that you have better health insurance than before definitely worth and after the liver yeah no I agree with you my job I you know can insurance for Massachusetts reform so I mean I think there's a potential that there could be a reduction in emergency department visits for certain types of visits and Ezra's all of the Medicaid expansions but you know at this point we were just kind of seeing a big you say which I think already is kind of encouraging given and if you're familiar with this on the orientation some very dramatic increases in emergency department usage so the fact that we're not and observing though Jenna heart that there could be some NBC some of these kind of diagnosis so there would be some of these help to prevent sections for future use of care I have a question about the best day that's available so on the next I see in something I'm wondering if there's an option where instead of diving all the way in there's a way to request to get the date of a little bit differently it summary date about having ruled by faculty right so there there is a way to do that the Census Bureau has a special tabs unit I think you can find that information on census gov and there is a fee I don't know what the fee is but there is a fee to do that but it might be worth your while instead of going to the entire process yeah so I think I just want to emphasize that this is a resource we have at the University of Michigan that most other universities don't have and I've worked in this secure environment before and people travel from you know other states to come and work in the secure environment here because we have it and here it is at our university so it's something we really should be taking advantage of they have an enormous amount of data and very sophisticated ways of working with it an incredible amount of local knowledge about how to use these data sets and how to some of them our investigators have developed and so working in this environment is a real privilege and something that most other places don't have and you guys can take advantage of it relatively easily compared to most other researchers who have to either travel here or get someone here to do it for them and I'd encourage you to go ahead and get your clearance and go over and see what they have because it's really a pretty remarkable resource and more questions we can send by email or connect you later thank you so much
