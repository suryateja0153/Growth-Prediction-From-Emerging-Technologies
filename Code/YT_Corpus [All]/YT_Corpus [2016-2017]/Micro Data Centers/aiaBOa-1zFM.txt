 people won't use technology they don't trust and with more than 2 billion devices connected to the cloud every day trust in the cloud is critical but concerns about government surveillance in the rise of cybercrime have eroded people's trust in the technologies they depend on to store and share information at Microsoft we work to protect customer data in our cloud from the physical security at our data centers to best-in-class encryption across the Internet to help ensure our customers stay in control of their own data our policies and programs respect your privacy we never use customer email content for targeted advertising and there is no cloud provider more committed to helping enterprise customers meet or exceed regulatory compliance and certification obligations when storing data in the cloud Microsoft even invests in non-traditional means of helping protect our customers our Microsoft cybercrime center is home to the Digital Crimes Unit a specialized group that uses big data analysis and cutting-edge forensics to protect customers from online threats and improve the security of the Microsoft cloud but trust is bigger than how Microsoft handles data protection in our own products and services trust in the cloud cannot be achieved unless we make broader progress as an industry and a global society on the problems that undermine cloud trust worldwide Microsoft has been at the forefront of the global policy debate on privacy pressing for greater legal protections for cloud customers on more than one occasion we've taken the US government to court from fighting for the right to publicly disclose legal demands for customer information to seeking to block a US government warrant for customer information stored in our data center in dublin ireland we've opened transparency centers around the world to demonstrate the integrity and security of our software to governments and we regularly publish information about requests we receive for customer data from law enforcement and governments worldwide to help ensure greater transparency and inform the public debate privacy has become a defining issue of the modern era it's important to get this right trust cannot be taken for granted you have to earn it at Microsoft we're working to do just that
