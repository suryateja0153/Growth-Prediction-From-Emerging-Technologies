 this program is presented by university of california television like what you learn visit our website or follow us on Facebook and Twitter to keep up with the latest UC TV programs it's my honor to introduce today to you our first keynote speaker dr. Robert Knight dr. Knight is a world leader in the new field of microbiome research he's a professor of pediatrics and computer science and engineering at UC San Diego and the author of follow your gut he received his bachelor's in chemistry biochemistry from the University of Otago in New Zealand his homeland and his PhD from Princeton in ecology and evolutionary biology and as did his postdoc work at Boulder and we're just so happy that he's now a UC colleague he's the co-founder of the earth microbiome project in the American gut project and he has many foundational discoveries you'll hear about some of them today he is as you will quickly know if you look at the literature a computational genius he's developed the soft software tools such as you nephrotic fraction which is now a standard tool in microbiota research it's developed other software he's taught himself programming and he has been a big proponent for disseminating these big data tools to the small guys to small research labs to really push forward the progress of research he's shown for example there differences in gut microbes where people based on where people live in the world differences between obese and lean people and both the phylum level and changes in the level of diversity and he has shown those first differences in microbiota based on were you born from a vaginal birth or from a c-section so we're gonna now get to hear what he's up to you at the highest level and we're just so happy to have you here thank you so much for coming great thanks thanks Alysa for that very kind introduction and thanks to you and the rest of the so crew for inviting me to kick this thing off this is a very exciting very exciting initiative that you know that you have here and I'm also also really excited to tell you about some of the work that we've been doing in in collaboration with an amazing range of different collaborators including many of your other speakers today so I'll try not to stay too much time are they going to tell you about as well so you might be wondering why why is there so much excitement about the microbiome right now and in some ways it's almost like we discovered a forgotten organ right so we have this thing that weighs about as much as our brain but it contains more cells more more genes and arguably even more complexity and of course what I'm talking about is our gut or rather the trillions of microbes that it contains so you might be wondering what do our microbes do and in addition some things like digestion which we've known they were involved in for a long time in part because of the advances in DNA sequencing and advances in the democratization of computational tools as well as I mentioned we're finding out all kinds of things that our microbes do but no one had any idea they were involved with until very recently so for example your microbes explain why you're not insane when you go camping so I seldom get veteran by mosquitoes but my partner Amanda gets attacked by them in droves and part of the reason why is we have different bacteria on our skin that produce different volatile organic compounds that that that that they respond to you differently and it really may be true that you attract mosquitoes ten times as much as the person you're going camping with so it turns out of neither of you is crazy one microbes are also critical in drug response and Peeta's going to talk more about this in his keynote later but the first really great example of this was was acetaminophen the active ingredient in Tylenol we're where Jimmy Oh Jeremy Nicholson slab UK said that whether or not as toxic toxic to your liver depends some large measure on whether or not you have a particular group of sulfate-reducing bacteria but some people have and others like and Peter's really pioneered driving this forward to a whole range of other pharmaceuticals the microbes are critical in the action of and then finally microbes have been linked to behavior and so if you're a food fly at least that this is working gene-gene recent big slab if you're a freak like the microbes that you have determine who you want to have sex with this has not yet been the society have been demonstrated in humans yet but actually question to you but it's probably just a matter of time before someone gets the right protocol through their institutional review board but it's kind of hard to do this sort of thing double-blind they hated a placebo so you might be wondering well how do our microbes do all that stuff and in part they can do it because they outnumber us and I should point out with this huge error bars on these estimates they come from back of the envelope calculations and you should take them with a big grain of salt but a number your cor from the literature is that we carry about to intrigue insist of about Tim trillion human cells but their most back of the envelope calculations say that we could have as many as 100 trillion microbial cells Arnold inside our bodies so by that measure we could be as little as ten percent human now you're probably thinking well here wait it's not really a cell count but it's our genes that make us human so let's think about let's think about what the DNA level for a moment where we can be a lot more precise so each of us has twenty thousand human genes plus or minus a couple of thousand depending on what exactly you define as a gene but the size of our microbial gene catalog when you consider all the microbes all over our bodies ranges somewhere from two to 20 million microbial genes so if you're talking about the unique genes and the unique biochemical functions they know they encode by that measure we're much less than one percent human and just like we leave traces about human DNA on all kinds of things that we touch in ways that are useful for forensics the same is true of our microbial DNA so with no Faris lab at Boulder about years ago we showed that we can link your fingertips up to the keys of the keyboard you type on and even your hand up to the computer mouse you years by the microbial DNA that you leave behind when you touch them so let's came out from the scientific journal PNAS a few years ago but more importantly was on CSI Miami so you roll it straight and and if you like it today's issue of science we have a follow up with a follow-up to that work in microbial forensics where we can shave up not just microbes important during your life but even after you die the microbes on your decaying corpse can tell crime-scene investigators exactly how long and so we did this in a mouse model a couple of years ago the first intentional dead animal study that we know are from the animal facility of Boulder about but now we're being able to extend it to humans but before you get too excited no you can't pick people to enroll in the study if then I did yes and if they don't agree to have their clocks used for that purpose so anyway in the human microbiome project which probably many of you have heard of together with the consortium of about 400 researchers across the country including including a number of people in this room actually we spent a hundred seventy three million dollars of NIH s money characterizing 250 healthy people at up to 18 sites in the body and up to three time points collecting a total of four and a half trillion nucleotide bases of DNA so aced he's Jesus and C's and and so it was amazing how rapidly this lift from the science journals and so as a science in nature in June of 2012 just just a few weeks later it was on the cover of Scientific American just a couple of weeks after that it was on the cover of The Economist so this idea that microbes really matter is really penetrating public consciousness and the results the results of a study had kind of had to understand so what I'm showing you here is parts of taxonomy so what we're doing is taking DNA sequences and just turning them into counts of the different major kinds of bacteria like the thermic Utes and bacteria DTS and Proteobacteria and things you might have heard of so just zoom in on the gut and basically what you can see is that different people differ tremendously in what kinds of Erbs there although the encoding of microbial functions seems to be more static so this is what we call the microbiota the kinds of organisms in a particular sample this is a microbiome the readout of their genes and what was amazing about this is that a confirmed work that we had done earlier in 2009 with p10 bow when he was in Jeff Gordon's lab sharing this amazing functional consistency across different people even we when you have amazingly amazingly different underlying microbiota our assemblages of organisms in them so this was a huge surprise to us at the time although we realized that we'd spent a little less time staring at the computer or more time looking at the world around us we should have expected exactly this because that's what we see on larger scales so if I show you this grassland in South Africa versus grassland in New Zealand now where I grew up then I show you all this rain forests in Africa whistles rain for us to New Zealand there's all sorts of intuitive similarities between the two grasslands between the two rainforests and all kinds of physical and chemical measurements that you could take would back you up on that somehow most similarities but there's no species shared between these two grasslands very few of the general and it's only offered about the family level that you start to see some overlap and so that's what we see around us we see this incredible diversity in species assemblages they lead to just a few consistent patterns in terms of how the ecosystems are arranged and those that's what we're trying to discover now in the gut so service leads to first major challenge of how can we map our microbes and and so what we've been trying to do is essentially use all that DNA sequence data to figure out who lives where in the environment and for example many of you probably think of e.coli pictured here is a classic gut bacterium but the reason why you think that isn't because it's a dominant player in the gut ecosystem it's just really good at growing in captivity right so you can go it on a petri dish easily but in general it makes up less than one in a million of the cells in your gut so what we have to do is instead of studying each microbe in its own cage in the zoo it's like you know having to get out there in the rainforest and figure out what everything is doing and how there acting so to do this we turned to their DNA sequence nature and as I mentioned in the human microbiome project we collected about four and a half trillion aged he's T's and C's and the problem with doing that is that the data will look like this so what I'm showing you is the fist file of data from the human microbiome project happens to be an oral sample from one of the individuals at the fist time point and it's pretty hard to tell he lives where in the environment from this right and what I'm showing you is actually the first 0.1% of that fist file there are another 17,000 files just like it so a large part of the challenge was was to develop software that could let us make sense of this and so my lab developed this pipeline called chyme which sends the quantitative insights into microbial ecology it's free it's open source you can run up anywhere from your laptop to the Amazon ec2 cloud so the 120 420,000 core supercomputer at nist which was the largest system we've run it on and you can now even run it on a luminous based space and have it interpret directly the data off your instrument and so when we point out that the HMP data what you get is this so you get this kind of map of how all those microbial samples are arranged so let me explain what's going on here so each point on this map represents all the complexity of a single microbial community as read out by its DNA so if I show you a representative oral biofilm all of that complexity boils down to just one point on the snap and so we use something called unified distance based on evolutionary history to put the samples on the map and if the samples are close together that means they have similar kinds of bacteria as read out by their DNA if they further apart that means they have more different kinds of bacteria so you can see patterns emerging so you see a big cluster for the mouth for the skin up here for the vagina down here and pink and then for the fecal samples down there at the bottom and brown and so what's amazing about this as the algorithm knows nothing about the samples and there's nothing about the people all it knows about is the similarities and differences among communities in terms of the bacterial DNA and one thing that's remarkable is the different sides of the same person's body including different sites in your body are completely different to their microbiomes so if I highlight one our sample and fecal sample you can see they're in really different places on this map but it wasn't until we cross-reference the data to the earth microbiome project which was crowd-sourced initiative to characterize habitats all over the planet from the water from the air from the soil from different animals and plants that we really understood how profound these differences within the human body really are so so what we could do is we could go out there to the physical environment and ask what two samples are exactly the same distance apart in terms of their microbial DNA as the mouth and the gut of this one participant in the project and so if you think of your mouth as being sort of like a coral reef you have all these complex bio mineralized structures covered in biofilms that may be your dentist's pastéis you about well the gut is as far away from the mouth and that one person as the coral reef is this coral reef in fact is from the soil and the spare in Nebraska so there are actually non-overlapping communities and just think about that for a moment what it means is that a few feet along the length of your body can make as much difference to your microbial communities as hundreds or thousands of miles across the Earth's surface so these highly differentiated communities and adults may lead you to wonder well how stable is the microbiome and you know can we really use it for forensics purposes or does it just change everyday as we touch different things we different things we meet different people and so forth and so to address this question my partner Amanda I have to admit let's put up with a lot in the name of microbiome research and I sampled our microbiomes every single day for six months looking at our mouths our skin and our gosh I'm just going to simplify this data frame a little and what we're going to do is we get a we're going to animate those time series in the context of data from a whole bunch of other people and so each frame limbless animation shows our microbiomes changing from day to day to day where we just connect up with successive points and what you can see immediately and basically the dark points to me the light points to Rome and you can see that the skin even within a person is much more variable than the other body sites and the math is a lot more static and the gut is in between and you can see that the the daily variation does not outweigh the difference especially two of us as individuals and versus especially interesting when you consider that we live together right so we have all kinds of opportunities to exchange my credits with one another and yet our microbial communities remain different and remain stable and and I'm just going to rotate this around so you can see that stability and you can imagine how tracking this not just not just out of curiosity where nothing in particular is going on but in development or disease could be really compelling and there's the decline in cost in DNA sequencing technology that finally makes it possible to do this kind of detailed tracking every day because it was literally a million times cheaper to do the DNA sequencing but it was just 15 years ago so this may lead you to wonder well where do our microbes come from in the first place and if you have kids or dogs as I do you probably have dark suspicions about that and all of your suspicions are true by the way so so it turns out that just like I can match you to your computer equipment by the microbes you share I can also match you to your dog and but but don't worry that microbial exposure is not necessarily harmful and in fact soot has been a pioneer in showing that animal associated microbes are in fact beneficial in terms of reducing asthma and I'm favoring some of the molecular mechanisms of that but in all seriousness where our microbes begin depends a lot on how we're born so if you come out in the regular way basically what happens is that all the commute all the markets all over your body look more or less the same and so what we're looking at here is as we're looking at babies within 20 minutes after they were delivered then their mothers are now before they gave birth and the supposed together with Maria Maria Dominguez Valley now at NYU and so if you look at the vaginal samples from the mothers and read all the body habitats from all over the vaginally delivered babies shown here in pink clusters together with them or as in contrast if you delivered by c-section and light blue all of all of the habitats from all over your body look just like skin and not like the naturally the natural microbes that you would have been catered him as he went through the birth can and so one thing we're wondering at the moment is whether whether or whether it's possible that these differences in baby's first microbiome explains some of the differences between c-section and vaginal delivery in terms of increased rates of allergies of asthma of atopic dermatitis and even of obesity and whether you could restore that first microbiome by inoculating with those beneficial vaginal microbes so that's what happens initially and now you're probably wondering what happens after that so this is work we did with Ruth play tracking the development of one have one kit your own over the first two and a half years of life and so you might be wondering why two and a half years that's been it was toilet-trained and it's a lot easier to you know get the fecal samples out of the diapers than it is to fight your kid for the matter they're absolutely amazing and they're really excited about flushing but anyway what we're going to do is we're just gonna track the fecal community from birth and you can see that he's basically in the vaginal region up here as we would expect from a celebrity mode all the way and then the question is how much do they approach the adult fecal State over two and a half years and they're sort of smooth progression or is there a lot of change as a more or less the same every day or is it different from day to day and each frame of us is one week in the developing microbiome and this was put together by Antonio Gonzalez and the oshika Vasquez two very talented grad students in my lab at the time and so what you can say is that sometimes there's tremendous change one week to the next and other times that's very little change and you can see that it's moving away from this initial vaginal State and starting to get down towards the fecal State and one thing that's fascinating that's going to come up in just a moment well so one thing you should note is what matters on these pots is how far apart two points are and so what we'll so because some of these differences week to week are bigger than the differences between any two people in the HMP while this means sister your kid really does look like a different person one week to the next at least in terms of their microbiome so coming up here it's fascinating so he gets antibiotics for an ear infection and you see those tremendous regression of the microbiome followed by this recovery so that went by pretty fast I'll just rewind up for you so you can see it again what we're going to see is on administration of our mock Sicilian four in fiction we see those tremendous regression of the microbiome in just a few weeks and doing months of normal development followed by a relatively rapid recovery and then by the time we get up to two and a half years what you can see is that he's more or less in the adult fecal station lessly and he's been resilient to this but that doesn't always happen say for example Dave Roman at Stanford I gave three people the same antibiotics just to see what would happen when they were healthy one of them came back to baseline in a few weeks the second within a few months and then the third was still totally different at the end of the year of the experiment and and Peter although identify he's going to talk about this today has shown that even if two people have the same bacteria in their fecal sample you give them the same antibiotic it's not necessarily going to target those bacteria even if they're the same initially it's not necessarily again just hugging them the same way so there's a huge amount that we don't understand about antibiotics yet and you might think that early life antibiotics then there's all that chaos up there might not really matter but mighty Blaze's labid in my you turn both epidemiologically in humans and in animal models experimentally but early life antibiotics have a profound effect on the microbiome later in life including leading to increased rates increased risk of obesity we can also do the sort of cross sectionally across people because the effective development is so large as they were sown Australia led by Tanja yes in inko in Jeff Gordon's crew back in 2012 we share that in an African population South American popular so an African population in red South American population in green the US population in blue going from very different from the adults to very similar to the adults happens within the first three years of life and all three of those populations but what was fascinating is the final state that you reach is very different in those populations so here's the kya the same kind of principle coordinates now have been showing you the same data as this part and what you can see is that age is the main factor structuring it from the youngest kids in red to the oldest adults in blue but you can see the Western population that ends up in most totally different place from these two non-western populations even though the rate of approach to it is very similar and so we think what we're seeing here is the overarching effect of diet in structuring the micro and one thing that's really important to remember and the stuff is that it means that it's really credible to include a diverse group of individuals in your microbiome studies because even large scale projects like the human microbiome project only focus on Western adults and so when you just look at Western adults you're just seeing with very small space and possible microbial communities as soon as you look at children and as soon as you look at non-western populations you see all these totally different configurations of the microbiome and given that given what we now know about the links between the microbiome state and drug metabolism as well as the links between the microbiome and food metabolism this may be critical if you want to test a drug in one population and then deploy it in a different population whether you're talking about the context to foreign aid or you're talking about the context to doing the drug trials in Asia or in Africa where it's cheaper to do the study so you might be wondering well you know does novice microbiome diversity really matter and as I mentioned over the last ten years when when I went together with Jeff Gordon's lab and and and recompete who I mentioned earlier we were able to show for the first time the microbes were linked to obesity in mice since their microbes have been linked to all kinds of different conditions and so it might not surprise you to believe the microbes in your gut have been linked to conditions like irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease maybe you expect to that maybe you're a little more surprised to hear that gut microbes are also linked to colon cancer and to atherosclerosis and it might be really surprising to you they got microbes linked to rheumatoid arthritis which no one in the field had really suspected but the evidence for that is shaping up it's pretty solid and coming back to obesity the evidence again microbes linked to obesity is now it's now very solid and then in fact today I can tell you with 90% accuracy whether you're lean or obese based solely on the DNA of your gut microbes so on the one hand this is kind of a cool trick technically on the other hand I bet you're thinking I can guess which of these people is fast knowing absolutely nothing about their microbes about their DNA so we don't think it necessarily has a lot of commercial potentials that history obesity right but but on the other hand we can classify people as lean or obese with 90% accuracy based on microbes we can only do that with 58% accuracy based on every gene ever linked to the human genome to obesity by genome-wide Association studies and so what that means is that those three pounds of microbes in your gut may be more important for determining traits like obesity but every single gene in your genome we can also do the sort of thing in mice where we can do a lot more experimental II and in particular what we can do is we can raise them germ-free with no microwaves of their own and then transplanted microbes that we think again have a physiological effect and and so so obviously you can do this ethically in humans and it will also take a long time to raise some germ free to adulthood without any microbes of their own so well so she has no antibiotic facility at Wash U where the next verse had to work I'm going to tell you about it's done and so-and-so said that so the first links to obesity with microwaves were with us OB OB model in mice and so this was in 2005 and so basically basically so basically a team of researchers from Jeff's lab was able to show that if you take if you take obese mice and then you transfer their microbes to germ-free mice with no microwaves of their own those mice can substantially more weight on the modulation with those microbes than if they instead to get the transplant from her from a lean littermate of that Mouse and so what's what's fascinating about this is why it happens depends on the particular system that you're looking at so what the ob/ob system it seems to be primarily based on energy harvest where they're better at extracting energy from the sim from the scene if you didn't push but with another study with another system we studied with Henry quits his group at Georgia State what we saw there ELISA these the tlr5 knockout what we saw there is that they actually changed the mouse's behavior so basically there's no difference in the energy content left behind on the feces what happens was the microbes from the fat Mouse make make the other mice you gain weight when those microbes are transferred because they make the mice eat too much and that's why they become obese so you can cure them with antibiotics and you can cure them just by cutting off the amount of food that's put in their cage to limit it to the amount that a normal Mouse would eat so they're hungry all the time but at least they're not obese more recently in work with Jeff's lab we showed that we could do the same thing across the species barrier so now we're taking microbes from obese are firmly in humans and transporting them in mice and again a fatty human leads to a fatter Mouse when you transplant the fecal sample but amazingly we can design a microbial community from the microbes of lean people that we could immaculately the mice with to prevent them from gaining this weight so at least in the mouse we can manipulate weight by manipulation in the microbial community with a design to synthetic community of known strains and we can also be the sort of thing and same sort of thing for malnutrition so with kwashiorkor a profound form of malnutrition of so say linked to cognitive deficits the transplant the quashed microbiome into germ-free mice the mice to extremely badly so they least 30 percent of their body mass within three weeks if they're left untreated and then they die but you can rescue them with the same peanut butter based ready-to-use therapeutic food that's used in the clinic to treat the children and what we see of these profound differences in the mass response and in their microbiome only with the quash microbiome but not what the healthy microbiome and so what's really exciting about this is the pilots the idea that you can take you can take humans who are different in some phenotype transplant their phenotype and timaeus they manipulate their phenotype with the nutritional intervention in mice in a way that mimics what would happen in the humans and so they're really exciting how follow up from that is could you use that as an assay to figure out which therapy whether it's nutrition or drugs or something else would work for those human individuals of course the gym pre- are hideously expensive when we can't exactly deploy them in Malawi but the hope is that we can move from this to an in vitro system and ultimately to a primarily computational system where from a sample to of your stool we could predict what would happen to you with different diets with different drugs and with different inventions if you did different things going forward so part of the reason I'm talking about these fecal transplants is that you can also transplant behavior by transplanting the feces and this is what's especially exciting the solicitor's from a group at McMaster published a few years ago where basically what they found is that you take two strains of mice to differ and behavior and in this case we're looking at a test that measures the anxiety you can swap the behavior between those two kinds of mice by swapping their microbiomes if you raise some Jim free and so I said so following up on this cyclists mazmanian at caltech has been doing some fascinating work looking at a mouse model of autism and again you have this very clear link between the microbiome and behavior well what they're able to do is they're able to submit such as stimulate features that resemble autism and mice by simulating a viral attack by injecting double-stranded RNA into the mothers what happens then is that the pups develop cognitive deficits they develop social deficits they have repetitive behavior there's communications deficits they also have GI barrier dysfunction but about sackless was able to show that you could restore many of these you could restore many of these mice basically to health except for some of the social deficits by using a probiotic naturally found on the human gut and so this this suggests the following pipeline for these studies where in the lab you can basically simulate a model look for a dysbiosis and then for a particular metabolites that are associated with that dysbiosis then figure out how to create the animal back to health by a range of interventions that target the microbiome and then ultimately apply the same pipeline and humans I'm gonna skip this bet on genetics and just just get along - Wow the crowdsourcing part of this and so especially what the success of these of these projects funded by the government and funded by a large scale and large scale private foundations a lot of people have got interested in how they can participate in this kind of research so every Thanksgiving in 2012 Jeff leach and I launched this project called American gut which is a collaboration between the earth microbiome project and the human food project so it's a true open-access citizen science initiative and essentially the idea is that watch there is that in this IRB approved project what people do is they send us away they send us their samples in the mail the sequencing of those samples is ported primarily by their own donations so essentially this is 99 dollar increments for members of the general public and then we can tell them where they are on this map related to other people and an increasingly relation to different disease populations and so we launched this over Thanksgiving because for some reason that's the time and a lot of Americans are thinking about they get I don't know why turns out not everyone wants to know what's in there so these are middle school so these are middle school students tearing our lab and Daniel McDonald one of the very talented grad students he's been working on the project is explaining to them that literally we're going to use lasers and robots to look at the bacteria in their people but a lot of people have been fascinated to find out the last point we've raised well over a million dollars shipped out over 9,000 kits and over 5,000 actually it's over 6,000 now samples have been sequenced and you can download all the sequencing data from EBI which is the European equivalent of GenBank including 400 samples from PGP to participants where they complete human genome is also sequenced and available but we still need more to get at all kinds of different combinations with the conditions get a rare populations and get a highly individualized responses that depend on the microbiome but why do you get out of this what you can see is the data from our project is highly component with the human microbiome project data and so what we're doing is we're using consistent published protocols exactly the same as what we've done with the almost a hundred thousand samples were processed in the earth microbiome project and related projects to ensure that the data quality and the processing pipeline and the lab techniques are all exactly consistent across projects so you can compare results and so what you get out of this is basically a readout of your microbes compared to people of the same age gender weight and so forth Michael Pollan the food writer was one of the ilium and pleased est participants in the project and as a famous omnivore and like The Omnivore's Dilemma and he also agreed that everyone can be compared to heaven as a kind of reference standard so you'll see that comparison as well and basically we tell you what's coming in your sample what's common the new relevant to other people and place your sample relative to different body sites relative to different human populations around the world and relative to the American gut population as a whole so where say so what's something on the scale we're finding all sorts of links to the microbiome that nobody expected so you probably expected that how old you are affects your microbiome but you might not have expected but how much you sleep at night also affects your microbiome but it's equally statistically significant as an effect and fascinatingly we can find we can find out all sorts of things about what matters and what doesn't matter in microbiome studies so these are power calculations done by Justine dibelius who just completed her PhD in my lab and was graduating next week and so what we're looking at is the number of people per group you need to see an effect this is this is a statistical power of the test so this is 80 percent power to detect this was 100 percent power if you want to tell your mouths from your gut you only need about 5 samples per group that's a very unsocial thing that you can do easily if you want to look at say IBD or antibiotics you need about 25 to 50 people per group but you'll notice one other thing right up in that part of the kit is the number of different kinds of plants you ate and what this means as a diet can have as strong an effect on your microbiome as weather or whether you're using antibiotics recently or whether you have a disease like IBD then we can tell all kinds of other things like how old you are a fat you are what time you did was sampling how much you say you exercise because remember this is all self-reported data how much you sleep at night and even how much you drink you'll be relieved to know that at least up to one during today which is the Tarpeian to the survey questionnaire we see this nice dose dependent response where the increased amount of alcohol leads to increased microbial diversity which is generally good although we think at the top end you know we bad things happen so don't try to push it beyond what the bubble survey measures and what's really exciting is that we're using American gut was a discovery platform where all kinds of other investigators can can do their studies so one thing we've done since we moved to UCSD is expand internationally so we now have British yet with Tim Specter and Australian Josh with the Hume Holtz and then we're we're expanding thus massively internationally over the next year ot we've been looking at a lot of clinically significant significant cohorts for example in autism where we're looking at 500 patients there's an initial starting set when scaling that up with the Autism Center of Excellence at UCSD we've done some work with Paul wish Myer at CU Denver I'm looking at intensive care unit patients who you can see a totally different from the rest of the population we've been looking at depression with Phil strand watts and and then Ken Lewis at Northeastern we've been doing this intervention to see whether the reason why dogs make elderly people happier if you give them to them randomly is because of the microbes they share rather than because of other factors that you might consider and we just got the sequencing data back from that recently as well as a whole range of other projects of different kinds so the idea to set this up as a research platform where many investigators can use the free software tools and the free open access data to investigate all kinds of different phenomena that would otherwise be hard to access we think is a really remarkable opportunity for the community and we invite all of you to participate all of the data and all of the tools are free and available now even though we have published nothing from the project so it's a bringing us back to the mind one one thing that's been fascinating is using the American gap population to look at things that we hadn't anticipated in advance and for example when we look at things like GABA producing bacteria and the gut we see statistically significant so they're relatively small but relatively about highly statistically significant changes between the people and American gut who report not being depressed versus the people in American gut who reports that they had been diagnosed with major depression and and so what's fascinating is that we can then start to tie this back to the relative abundance of particular kinds of bacteria so we think that we think that as we have this larger and larger cohort with better and better molecular characterization as we introduce new techniques that we're developing and the new center for microbiome innovation at UC San Diego we're going to be able to investigate more of these questions retrospectively and this huge population and also integrate the data with the many other universities many other medical centers and increasingly many other companies around the country that are used the most standardized protocols that we introduced in the earth microbiome project and continue to refine through projects they like in bqc the microbiome quality control project with NCI and the habits school for public health as well as dozens of other participants around the country so I'm just going to conclude with them with our most compelling example of why you care about where you are on this map and we're going to get back to we're going to get back to a GI example although as Erin will tell you in his talk there are tremendous additional links between Legere between the GI tract and the brain and a whole range in a whole range of different neurological conditions but here I'm going to focus and this is just to reorient you here I'm going to focus on c-diff associated disease and so Clostridium difficile infection is one of the most important hospital-acquired infections in the United States kills 14,000 people in a year in the United States alone and and and it's a huge clinically significant problem and so what we're looking at here is we're looking at c-diff patients and you can see these are all gut samples but they look nothing like a healthy healthy gut community and it's profound dysbiosis throws him into the middle of the pot more or more along the lines of the skin and the vaginal community some like a healthy gut and this was what we did with how excretes might Sadowski at the you know university of minnesota i was published earlier this year and again Antonio and Jesse he did the data visualization so what's gonna happen is that four of these patients again again a fecal transplantation from this one donor and so what we're going to do is we're going to track four of these patients over time and see what happens when you do that fecal transplant well their microbiomes basically say that the stay the same or will it be like the infant times I showed you where you have this progression from one set of the microbiome towards the normal healthy adult state in case you're wondering what fecal transplant is I'm not going to go into too much detail except to mention that services bill Sanborn is that term di at lease in San Diego and five years ago he told Larry Smarr is the directory with ki - - and the current patient but we would never do fecal transplant at UC San Diego whereas now he's doing were relatively routinely so these so-called poop circles really for transplant using hospital grade store from open biome which is a non-profit in Boston and so anyway so the so what we get to do is we're going to give four of these patients fecal transplant and we're going to track them every day and we're going to see what happens in terms of their approach to the healthy microbiome state so I'm just going to start with going and what you can see is immediately within a couple of days all of their microbiome is given to this completely different healthy state from where they were before that only happens to the four people who got the transplant and they stay in this healthy state for the several months of Iowa and in fact the last large-scale comparison that was done directly between antibiotics and fecal transplantation as the treatment for c-diff had to be stopped early because the antibiotics are 20 to 30 percent effective which is typical the fecal transplant was ninety three point eight percent effective which is also typical so the trial had to be stopped early because it was unethical to continue withholding the thecal transplantation from the people who were getting antibiotics and were not benefiting from it so the question facing us as a field now is for what other diseases now linked to the microbiome including conditions that you suspected like IBD and IBS conditions that you probably didn't suspect like rheumatoid arthritis and conditions that have been demonstrated conclusively in mice but not I would say yet in humans like autism multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's for which of those different diseases can we do microbiome based therapies that take you from a bad state into a good state and for which of those diseases for which those diseases are we going to be able to do that based on thecal transplant or prebiotics or probiotics or more carefully targeted antibiotic or changes in diet which have a huge impact on the microbiome or phage therapy or all the other all the other new generations of therapies that are starting to get into the pharmaceutical pipeline or that you could do just just at home by changing your diet or by picking different ingredients but while we need not just to do this is not just the support of a huge a huge community of researchers and a huge community of participants but on top of that we need to go beyond this map and develop more of a kind of microbial GPS that tells you not just where are you right now but where do you want to go on the snap and what do you need to do turn-by-turn in order to get there and so ideally we need to develop this kind of microbial GPS and make it so easy to use and so ubiquitous that even our children can use it so you could imagine the kind of smart toilet that does an instant-read out of your microbial DNA and perhaps your metabolites and delivers that to your smartphone which let's face it I bet you're using in there anyway and and and gives you an instant readout of where you are on the map today what your trajectory has been from the last few times you used it and are you going in a good direction or a bad direction and what specifically should you do 10 by 10 as aware to be able to optimize your microbiome for lifelong health both physically and mentally so with that I'd like to thank a large number of collaborations his work I talked about here many of whom I mentioned during the talk so I'm not going to read out this list to you again our various sources of funding especially NIH Gates HHMI the currents and Colitis foundation and thousands of members of the public have contributed to American gut financially and or by sending in their poop and the many members of my lab it's been a true privilege to work with so many incredible trainees over the years and and the move to UC San Diego certainly opened up and even more exciting pool ever interdisciplinary researchers including clinical trainees who are able to work on this stuff and finally I'd like to I'd like to thank you for your attention and again for the invitation to be here there's going to be a panel discussion later but I'd be delighted to answer a couple of questions now at this time thank you thank you so much that was incredible we have two microphones so just raise your hand and a microphone will come to you so when you're doing a fecal transplant how do you screen the donor so that you don't get a flow sclerosis 20 years later or so many other things great question no data so one thing that the American Gastroenterological Association is trying to do at the moment and I'm on the science advisory board for the microbiome Center we're trying to set up a nationwide clinical trials registry to address exactly that kind of questions so we can have ongoing tracking of everyone who's is receiving fecal transplantation in the United States and so they say that we can do so we could do sequencing of the donor and recipient and wiped him tracking of both the donor and recipient so that we can address their safety issues in general so all of the stalls as it's been for acute pathogens so you're not going to get hepatitis or HIV but the risk that you might transmit something that we don't know yet but we need to screen for is certainly present and that's why the Aga recommends that you do not do it at home despite the fact that you can just Google DIY fecal transplant and get a half hour YouTube video that shows you exactly how you would do it with with a blender that let's hope you're not using for anything else and turkey baster that let's hope you're not also using your Thanksgiving but that's exactly that's exactly the reason why we need to know for a huge number of diseases what are the dysbiosis involved and what are the risks and transmission and animal studies like the like the transplants I showed you in mice are a key component of that overall research agenda but but we really need to we really need to look at faster living animals over their whole life span to see if there's a potential for diseases that are only going to show up later by the way the NIH rejected the grant proposal that the Aga put in to do that registry it's it's a couple of million dollars and if anyone has ideas about donors who might be interested in supporting it rather than returning to try to get public funding for it that's certainly something that the Aga would be very interested in talking with you about so let me know if you're excited about that possibility a follow-up on that question do you scream that the donors for their medical history their emotional health and all you know any heart disease rheumatoid arthritis etcetera family history in the in the donor yes so so that that's that's another really good question what open biome does is they screen the donor for a whole suite of infectious diseases and they recruit the donor they recruit the donors primarily from the gem round above us around the corner from their building so they're getting people who are young and healthy one thing we don't have yet as we don't have predictive models for a when you're in your twenties we don't have good predictive models for what are you going to get when you're 60 or 70 developing those is really important for the field but it's difficult to do longitudinal studies and humans are they trying to get out of cross sectionally and trying to do it longitudinally in animal models as of a lot of interest but for example in the case of dental caries we've shown with their Chinese collaborator Jan 2 that you can tell whether a kid is going to develop tooth decay months in advance even when the teeth look perfectly healthy from a clinical perspective by looking at the microbiome and as it's entirely possible that one day we will be able to predict disease far in advance based on the gut microbiome but we can't do it yet and the longitudinal cohorts have not yet been assembled and studied so anyway it's a good question from a personal perspective if I began to get a fecal transplant I would definitely screen out any family history of mental illness because the possibility though that can be transmitted is certainly there and absolutely and completely outside current screening but there's really no data that would support that at this point it's really a personal preference and intuition I was curious about the role of breastfeeding and c-section births versus vaginal births in the microbiomes of infants yes great questions so breastfeeding seems to seems to partially although although not 100% ameliorate the affected c-section birth and another thing that was this a lot of interested a lot of interested in at present is administering probiotics perinatal II which which again in the few trials that have been done they have tended to be safe and and then the efficacy has depended a lot on what particular strain of probiotic get us so one huge why don't you just use with probiotics as a lot of people assume that you know basically any probiotic should do but that's that that's equivalent to say thinking that any pharmaceutical would do right because they all have different effects and so I think we're going to see a lot of personalized personalized medicine basically matching up the right probiotic to the right patient and the right clinical condition and again that's a huge area that's a lot of people are getting into now you
