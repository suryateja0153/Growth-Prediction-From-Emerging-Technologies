 thanks Jonathan yeah Johnson said I'm a professor at University of Liverpool and Jonathan may have already mentioned briefly this thing here called the associés consumer data research center which Liverpool's got a node in it I'll tell you a little bit more about that and then some of the retail data that we're sort of consolidating together to create these indicators which we've applied to retail centers to explore this issue what we're calling he resilience now I'll discuss a little bit more about that more generally as I'm talking if there's something you think you'd like to ask a question about don't feel like you gotta wait to the ends just interrupt me and I'll try and answer it as I'm going along ok so the CDR see the SRC had a program of investments in big data the second round of those investments was in a collection of business and local government data centers of which we bid in and we were fortunate up to win one of these so the the grant that Jonathan myself and University College London were involved in was one of them which was funded the University of Leeds put in a very similar ground were also funded as part of this network we basically came together under this single brand of consumer data research center as a sort of unified grant if you like now the overarching objective the CD RC is to open up retailer data to academic researchers and stakeholders within the UK there are lots of data sets that you can't just download off the web for example census microdata so we've got things like a one-percent sample at the individual level of all census data in order to get access to that you have to go into secure facilities there are similar data sets in health and in education and there are particularly constrained access protocols which enable academic research to go and get these data and historically within the UK there's been no such relationship with commercial companies so typically an academic would have ad hoc relationships with different retailers or different consumer data providers and for that reason it quite disorganized and it didn't give opportunities to everyone who might benefit from these data so CDR sees mission if you like is to act as an intermediary where we can provide services to the academic and stakeholder audiences to enable access the data we've pre-negotiated but also act as a facilitator to get different data sets which we don't necessarily have access to it this particular point in time but because we know the people in the retailers who could potentially supply those data and we've got a series of infrastructure which enable us to disseminate that safely and protocols which enable people to apply and for the retailer's to feel comfortable with accessing those data we act as a kind of broker for that so we're funded until 2019 and as part of that we've got a series of different objectives related Azure research projects which are ongoing which taken a variety of different aspects of return analytics we do short courses and training in addition we will be providing these various types of infrastructure and doing outreach events and things like this so how do we make the data secure this is Liverpool so this is the thing that when retailers want to come and see our facilities I take them into this this cage drew here and this is actually now this is this is pre as actually installing machines now this is actually packed full of large servers now in the 1990s this is slightly off topic in the 1990s there was some issues in UK academia with Ukrainian gangs stealing Sun Microsystems servers no very very expensive now what happened was insurance company said that they had to install these prison cells and they are essentially a prison cell so we've got one of these prison cells which we now cut in half so is actually to access doors and then a stack of servers which we don't put all our retail data in there's a private network into this room here the cct CCTV cameras on everything here you needed tool to access this you've got like a double swipe card air lock type system so this is pretty mi5 kind of level security here so the great thing is we take retailers in here up them in the cage they feel very claustrophobic and they say this is actually much more secure than our own data housing we feel comfortable with that that we can honestly say this is the most secure place to hold their data and we have access protocols where if we've got a store card data for a national a national extent academics can apply to use it we have a research approvals process where they going to be proved to have access to the data the retailer who's provide the data CD RC sits on that panel and they can delight they think it's not appropriate or hopefully not and the project can continue in the retail gets benefits and we provided our service so we have this and then we do other things as well this is the most secure level of our service and we have various other yeah they can the way in which it works is they when you have your project agreed you agree the outputs the retail agrees that they're happy with those particular outputs the person who's in the lab produces those outputs there's an a process of checking and they signed off if they're the same as what was originally agreed they can leave the lab and that's via a secure download link there's no internet connection on anything here it's fully closed Network in fact it's not even on the University Network it's so it's just a private network and then if it was different from what was specified its referred back to the retailer who can say whether they think that's okay or not the agreements adjusted and then it can be released so every stage there's no way anything can leak out at the moment the people who could access this would be academics and retail stakeholders so if you put data in you can put a project in which could be approved could be approved to go and look at it but let's hypothetically say there was two retailers in the same submarket if retailer a said I want to go into a project to work out my market share every involving retailer be retail Abby's going to see that project and not approve it so the the project have to be for some sort of common good that both retailers could see there would be a benefit in that if you were a retailer academic projects are a bit simpler because there's there's less of commercial sensitivities they're more typically I want to build an indicator of something to tell me about some social process or whatever it might be so that's sort of us most secure level the next tier we've got we've got some datasets you can just download that's just a registration process and they can be like very aggregate retailer data or things like this internet user classification which I presenter on packaged up in a way which is easy for people to use we've got a website called data CD are cedar AC UK for that and then lots of the other data we have on a mapping portal which is maps CDR see to AC UK and then the the classification I presented little while it's available to download for free on here and there's no costs or anything like that and you can also view a map of it as well for the UK to advance its not UK classification it's just England in the context of this particular project okay so I'll start up with a little bit of preliminary about the techniques that I use to build this classification and what we do with it in the context of retail essentially we we are interested in geo demographic methods so the reason you have these methods and what they are is that we have things like censuses it could be you know it's a collection of data about places or bad people in places this in a similar sense to how you might have a consumer record about data set of different attributes of your consumers now if you looked at each one of those attributes in turn you could map all of them so you could look at every single attribute separately but that would be a huge huge array of information so but I did this with the sensor so in 2001 the census data came out here using we use a program programmable siskel programming language called our and you can produce maps like this in our and actually mapped every single variable for every local authority in the UK so took each one mapped every variable but what you end up with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of maps I think actually this is just one one variable for Liverpool but if you imagine you might have 100 200 300 different maps for every local authority in the UK that's a huge volume of information and it's a challenge which has been it's a challenge to synthesize that information into the information which you can use for making commercial decisions so a very common method by which that's achieved and this is actually Richard Webber which should have you come across mosaic classification and an acorn when the 1970s Richard made a corn and then later on made mosaic as well so it's his I you know this idea was his I think and this is actually a quote from one of his earliest bits of work 1978 which i think is quite pertinent about picking out patterns from the detail without losing too much information so we're looking for general trends that you can pick out from these with large volumes of information how well the one of the nice things in fact so Richards now very very old and he's actually having a bit of sort of self reflection on his career he rang me up this past week and in fact he's starting to work on a book with Roger Burroughs abouts of the history of geo demographics and I think it could be a really interesting read so anyway that will come out in the next couple of years I want to keep an eye on so gia demographics Richards kind of the founder of that and principally what they are is if we you know we take a city so does anyone know where this city's anyone know that there's no reason why you would this no even nicer than Oxford it's Liverpool so this is this is where I live it's you sell green it's lovely isn't it that's right good for the Liverpool tourism anyway so if we take a series of sort of places within Liverpool these places have some significance which are reveal in a second so no not they are well you think about that for a second and what we can do what a Geo demographic does is it takes those places which are all quite different and it classifies them by the address so we find that these three air this in fact is a corn and these three areas here are in a group called urban adversity and this one here is affluent achievers anyone now have a clue about what these areas are very good you Liverpudlian that's the yet no one is very rare that anyone will pick this up but the obvious thing is there's no reason at all why a load of people be clustered around the derelict house home with a guide but anyway yes that's quite right so we've got one person here is not a working class hero if you have a look is actually an affluent achiever so I'm spent on fair but if we go back to 1970s the this is the original classification incidentally that Richard de Valence on Liverpool which is also another nice link to Liverpool and this original classification was built to portion deprivation alleviation funding so I don't if you've heard of the index and multiple deprivation we have one in England Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland separate sort of scaled measures of levels of deprivation and this was a sort of precursor to that but it uses this geo demographic method so rather than scaling areas from high to low it was looking at these type ologies which are multi-dimensional captured the essence of these particular areas so you actually get I mean you can actually go and get these these original classifications outta library they've got some nice cartography man Richard later went on I should say as computer power sort of increased and expanded from just liver port salute sort of the whole the UK I think originally it was at like a census ward level and then as computer power increased and we were looking at much more granular and you can get your classifications down to individual level now or more commonly things like postcodes or out census output areas and this technique works across terms of multiple jurisdictions so you get classifications in different countries okay so the so the meat of this talk is about this thing called ira's it's and our interest in this started incidentally with Richard in fact sort of in the mid 2000s and we built a classification specifically to look at use and engagement with the internet called the e society classification and one of the things that we did was we produce this portal where we've got classification behind it you could type a postcode in you could click go and it would it would give you a profile and this is just a map of the cinema graphics I apology this is somewhere in London I think where are we yeah ealing healing healing so the the these are the groups is quite typical NGO demographic to organize areas into groups and types you have these aggregate groupings which then sort of go down into a series of tights and more disaggregate and it gives you an idea of the geography of Internet use and engagement now this is quite a dated classification I think still online actually but it dates data from the went into classification is from around 2000 it was built around the mid two thousand so by now it's quite quite a to date that said it has been used in sort of policy so it was used as a measure to assess relative need for government's investment in rural broadband infrastructure so he has had it has had sort of ongoing sort of utility but I think by now it's probably not not that useful and one of the things that we did when we got this website is we did a small press release actually ended up being quite a big press release ago on to the BBC technology section of our website and I think we had we had something like quarter of a million searches just one afternoon when itself appeared on their on their website one of the nice things that we did is we actually captured the things that were being searched and also we asked for responses about whether we thought they've whether the people using the website thought we got it right or wrong which i think is useful validation and not many geo demographics companies do that but it's something that we're quite keen on we found out some interesting things so this is the if you look at these as the average so if the search propensity for our website was exactly the same as a distribution of postcode sort naturally you'd have a sort of a line across 100 if it's to hundreds of twice and fifty a half so what we find is more engaged people tend to be over in these groups and less engaged over here and as you might expect it was on technology section of the BBC news websites more people are searching for their post code from the engaged groups which exactly as you'd you'd expect if you look at the feedback origin so if we they think we've got it wrong and they're leaving us feedback to say what they think it should be most of these people have been assigned which they claim erroneously and is probably true because if you remember there on the internet and are searching another postcode and it's something they found through the BBC technology section of our website is they tend to be in the areas which are not that engaged so that's what they've been missus eynde and then obviously the feedback is in the more engaged groups which is probably more fitting for what they believe that classification should be this was very interesting but we also had the inverse as well so there was some sort of mischievousness I think where people were searching for post codes which came up as being very engaged but then they were being reassigned back to the least engaged and I could only imagine that that would be someone perhaps they didn't like or their parents or something like this so there was some of that which went on as well but it's a very small fraction so general terms of when we build a geo demographic classifications we like to do it in open and transparent ways you know what the inputs are the methods are we publish all those we typically make all the code open source and where possible the data is open source as well and we also like to have these feedback mechanism built in as well so you can actually just say whether you think it's right or wrong and we think this is the way that geo demographics should always be orientated because a lot of qualitative ditions go into making these you know how many clusters do you have what specific inputs do you put into these classifications algae standardize the data and all out in my view needs to be known and particularly when some of these classifications are used for sort of public sector applications where your pension potentially apportioning life chances so in the context of broadband example if we've got it wrong if we've got it wrong potentially communities might lose out on access to broadband which could be quite significant for sort of their economic developments or so on if it was a healthcare healthcare application it might be where do we cite a breast cancer screening clinic perhaps we cite it in the wrong locations because you've got the classification wrong and if you've got to make defense the defend your position of why you've made certain targeting choices in public sector applications it's far easier if the methods are open you can say well why did you do that because this classification said so and this is how the classification has made and there's no reason at all why you couldn't remake the classification for a particular purpose okay this was kind of those of leaden if you like to something I've always wanted to do which is to update this because we had access to a lot more data the original classification really only looked at behaviors and the other side of behavior of course is the environment in which the behaviors occur so you could be for example a very engaged person you really want to get online but you live out in the in the sticks and they're in a really rural area broadband's terrible you might be able to go and browse websites but you're definitely not be able to use netflix or anything like that anything with high high bandwidth requirements so in a new classification what I wanted to do is to capture both the infrastructure which impacts use and behavior which obviously is of the measurement of of use and the types of activities that you do online so a series of different data went into it so one of them was a proxy measure for how fast your broadband would be and in the UK most broadband is delivered over the telephone network and the closer you are to telephone exchange all other things being even you will have a faster signal so we actually extracted a telephone exchange database from the Sam knows websites and we've created these accessibility measures and you can see the dark darker colors are further away lighter colors a closer to telephone exchanges so as a distant measure we built this for a lower super aqua terra geography so we've done that the similar distance calculations were used for some data extracted from off con which related to mobile phone masts so you can't always assume that people are connecting to the internet over fixed line connections it could be wireless mobile broadband as well so a similar exercise this is a phone mass from the Ofcom data and we won one thing I like to do is to email people and just ask them if they were willing to give them give us their data for different research purposes and it's actually quite interesting that a lot of people just say yes and you surprised by that and then you've got something you can do which is quite interesting so one of these of random emails are sent out was to a company called broadband speed checker and at the time they were I fitness some competitors now but they were one of the biggest broadband speed checking websites certainly the UK and what that is it's a small application that runs on a web browser and they've got a file size of known and known kilobytes you then download that and then it uploads it and with the size of the file and the time it takes to download and upload the file it can work out your speed and then what it does is ask you if your postcode once you've run your speed test the advantage of putting your postcode in is once you do that you then see everybody else's speed results because typically you don't you interested in your speed but only really in relation to what your neighbors are going to get so if you're getting very low broadband speeds and everyone get slow broadband speeds it might very well just be that you know you live out in the rural area if you're getting low broadband speeds and everyone's on sort of much better broadband speeds it could be that everyone else has got fiber optic connections and you don't or it might just be that you know you're you know Reuters a misconfigured or whatever it might be so a very large number of people actually do put that postcode into this which they also collect and then it gives you things like the packages that they're using and that kind of thing so you could work out people were Virgin Media broadband suppliers versus say BTW suppliers for example so there was around seven point six million postcodes results in this particular data file we've actually done quite it we've done a paper which actually looks at patterns over time which is very interesting so you can disaggregate these data both by where they happened and when they happen so we partitioned the whole data set into this measure of reality that we have in the UK urban rural classification and you get some really interesting results over time so you can have areas for example in cities cities always tend to have better infrastructure and a better connect faster faster connections but there are some middle tier towns where in the in the daytime they will be reasonable and then at peak use in the evenings when people come home and start using media streaming or whatever it might be you'll suddenly find that the connections will really dip in terms of their speed and actually very rural areas are actually I've got quicker speeds than that because there's much lower use so there's a real entry alee interesting interaction between the volume of people who want to get online and what they're doing and the infrastructure that's available you can start picking out these trends but we've got a paper on that which I can provide some links to so that was another input it's slightly different from the Ofcom measures of broadband speed which are more typically based on a physical unit which plugs into the wall so in some respects there a pure measure of signal broadband speed because there's no there's no connection whereas these obviously people's Wi-Fi networks can be better or worse and so on they can be more interference with different devices so these are actually what people experience rather than what the hypothetical speed would be if you were directly plugged into your sort of telephone socket so that's quite interesting data set which when tuned so that was kind of all the infrastructure data which went into this geo demographic and then we had a series of behavioral data so we know about the infrastructure that constraints and what do people do with it note contacts and one of the best sources of this information comes from University of Oxford the Oxford Internet's Institute's have got em I think I know how long as I survey ran for it must be 55 or 65 five or six years I would have thought it's a longer toodle survey which asks a pretty diverse set of questions it's nationally representative about internet usage behaviors online participation civic activities social networks all those kind of things it's really interesting and they started at a time just before the internet really took off in terms of some of these avenues and it's a I think it runs every every other year so we could access this data and we used a small area estimation technique to create estimates for the local level so we actually created estimates reach area from this survey and so this is for example this is just a percentage of households with an internet connection this is leads I think actually sensitive people in mostly use the mobile phone for internet access and if you actually look in terms of ground truth in these results if you think about what's logical you know who might in the center of leeds who might live in a central of leeds than if you know leads it's quite a lot of universities there so students live there and they're probably using mobile phones for most their internet access and when you actually look at the percentage of students you find that there's a there's quite a high degree of Correspondence so in addition to this of behavioural estimates we also put into the classification some sensors attributes as well so the way in which Geographics work if you imagine you've got all rows in this very large spreadsheet every single row would be an area and so that we use lower super equity areas and then every single column in the data set is a different attribute about that area so it could be the percentage of students it could be the percentage of broadband connections it could be these measures of distance to telephone exchanges so you have all these different data and then what we use the process called clustering and what you end up with when you cluster data is a geographic classification so what you do is you compare every single area in this big spreadsheet and you find the groupings of areas it's really put them together almost similar so you're looking for areas which have similar characteristics and with GL Emma graphics you can build general-purpose ones like acorn and mosaic they're designed to capture a range of different things you can build a jeer demographic for a specific locality so one of the national geo demographics we've got in the UK from the office for national statistics is called the answer and the greater love Authority approached me to say we it doesn't really work very well for London basically we'd like to do one specifically for London so a colleague of mine at UCL and I and took the data cut out London rebuilt a classification specifically for London so you can actually do classifications for particular localities and then the sort of other category of genome a graphics which is like this is for an application-specific g.r demographic so you put into the geo demographic at the start some of the things that you're interesting measuring at the end and what that means is you order the area's into groups in a slightly different way than you would get in a general purpose classification which is theoretically more robust because your inputs are more closely aligned to what your outputs are supposed to be measuring so this is what the geo demographic look like and again it's lead so we can see we partition the areas into these different groups it's not very easy to display on a slide so I haven't put the keys and things like that on there but if you go to that map's CDR see website there's a GI demographics tab and the Internet user classifications actually on that and you can browse it and you can see all the different areas in England where it classified so in terms of retail examples this is kind of like a background measure you could use that measure for lots of different things but with the CD RCA so we've got this sort of interest in retail and Internet consumption is I think you got the end of your talk at the end it's it's a big it's a big deal particularly looking for things like catchment areas and particularly particularly traditional models like gravity models so we were interested in how exposed a retail center was to people who might be shopping online and it's driven and I think this is quite an interest in example so these are you know example of a couple of stores have disappeared up the high street principally because people have swatched swapped their shopping behaviors to online channels borders is one example zavvi borders incident if you go to their website which used to be their website there's now just this amazon advert if someone's done that purposefully but I found that quite amusing anyway so that's where all used to go to borders now Sean so in terms of measuring this this concept of ira's is where do people go and shop or an estimate of where people go and shop the second thing you need to know is the characteristics for those people are the type of people who would go and shop online which is Yuri resilience measure so your your internet user classification I just presented and then the other thing is you need to know a little bit about the composition of the retail center itself so if you had a high street which is made up entirely of bookshops and and music shops those are the types of return offerings which have got a greater propensity to be digitized I swap two online channels and so you need to know all of that information and to capture this thing that we referred to as e resilience and this is the framework that we came up with which is essentially all of those different these different things here and what we were principally doing is creating an index for each retail center which we could then use to compile all of retail centers by their exposure to these different populations and their risk in terms of their built infrastructures and the basic way in which we work out where people go is of a very straightforward gravity model most gravity models are fitted for retailers and cells we actually looked into literature there's very few actually fitted for retail centers because in principle the data for them are more difficult to get if you're talking about spend you need to spend for all the shops and that kind of thing so you don't have access to that data but what you do have access to through one of our partners the local data company is a store by store a store by store measure of the type of retailer and levels of occupancy so principally rather than having spend we create an attractive this measure which is a mixture of the number of the number of stores the type of stores the mix whether there's a leisure offering whether there's anchor stores in that particular locality and we create a model which is actually split hierarchically so we can differentiate between very large centers like the center of Liverpool through regional centers and then more smaller sort of local high streets and parades so the model fits for all of those the output of this again because we're you know we're interested in we're interested in putting things and making things open source we developed the model entirely within our and you can go and download it in you can apply it to other contexts so I think I had an email from a retailer in New Zealand the other day it was interested in applying it for their stores in New Zealand which I thought was quite me so you can go and get that the other thing we do in this model in addition to these calibrations are we have Robin tour Euclidean distance we swap it all out for Road distances so run straight line distance we actually take the the road network distances and plug those in we build it at lower super out bateria and what you end up with is for every retail center there's a collection of lower super Altair's associated as the core catchment of that retail center and the catchments for those if you want to get them you can actually download and you can view them online through that map's CDR see website the models essentially the model itself is calibrated on you have imagined you've got basically two destinations they've all got attractiveness measures so every single area in the country is assigned a probability of visiting a center so every area so from the top of Scotland there is a probability that you would visit somewhere in Brighton it's a very low probability and in terms of delineating the areas we expand them into different thresholds and it's around seventy percent is what we produce the way we built the model because we allow for these different the different hierarchy means the catchments can be overlying there's other ways you can build the models where the catchments aren't and they just have dovetail to one another we weren't as comfortable with that because it's not I don't think that's useful yes so that into we've got a paper on this which you'll see in a little while but the validation were used in the case of Birmingham we managed to acquire a dataset a traditional survey data set of which we then use to create models and compared them to ours we essentially calibrated our model against that survey but you could do that in multiple contexts and I think a little bit like the geo demographics example the fact that it's all open and you can go and download it and redo it if you've got better data I think that's helpful because there are like gia demographics or qualitative decisions that you make did you do this energy is did you use are easily and the nice thing about this well it's nice for me is it's all in our and not in the GIS at all so even the even the routing is actually within our so what we do is we convert all of the roads in the UK into a graph it's a big graph and then we actually do the routing on a graph but you can go and download it all and it's actually very simple to run so we build these models with us or second year undergrads okay the moment using our PRS dude any attachment here in Ireland swine pro-nuclear in distance listen as soon as they put their own Santa some reasons crashing now write it all I was it's not doing it it's only on for three months and a bigger budget so that we used to apply the rules in some reasons update within a few guys but in theory this but this would probably resolve your problem it's not Anna cost you any money probably would yeah yeah so you can do that and there's other there's other tools as well there's another one I use quite commonly have done some work on commuting to school is called routine oh it's a free library and you can hook it up to our I mean if you look at my blogs I've got various posts about it but you can send queries and gives you distances and that kind of thing so there are lots of free and open source tools available as well yeah but I suspect if you've paid for an ArcGIS license ESRI we'll probably willing to give you some technical support as well hey sorry there was some more money is for all the routines you know Peter two men out here for Network Analyst was it it was actually really specific genes to margarets automatically house oh I know you had here is rich by a hundred yeah but if you are fine 20 euros for some reason yes so our models basically a half model that we use but we've just improved it by adding things like the network distances and that kind of thing is typically they're just calibrated with straight line distance and that kind of thing so yeah it would probably solve your solid problem so i think i think it's called we call it hoof tools it's all we've got see DRC github and it should be on there somewhere but failing that drop is an email or give you some pointers so we yes so we go from this oh just a quick mention about what a retail center is at the moment i'm using DCLG definitions from 2004 so they're actually quite out date it's not as diverse a set of retail centers as I like but that is the best nationally official set of retail centers however we have got another project which is almost finished now and we've created about 2,000 retail centers for the whole of the UK we're actually quite happy with and then we're going to refit these models and again put them through CDR see site the next or six months so your retail centers are quite important because to say the attractiveness measure is based on a composition of retailers within that zone so in this this is actually some again one of the yorkshire retail centers and these green units here are our shops and an in reality i'm got to slide there's actually some which sort of fall outside that so it does sort of broadly represent the core but in some some areas since 2004 there's been a greater degree of change than in others so you really need a more up-to-date model of retail center definition but we've done that as well and again that's that's just in the process of being written up you end up with outputs like this it's actually a 75-percent catchment for that particular retail center and then you can look at the exposure of the different population based on this internet use a classification within that zone so you know about the retailers who are within that area you know about the people who actually typically like to go to that retail center we create these various index measures ones like an exposure index the ones are behavioral index are you more likely the type of person who's likely to go online shopping and what's the sort of mix of the composition of the retail center and we end up scoring retail centers by the balance of these two measures and what we end up with is something which i think is very interesting and this is the paper we've written up on it and you can download that freely available and these are these are our retail centers these are urban areas that you can see in the background now these retail centers are highlighted in blue are the ones that are most in trouble if you like in terms of their composition and people likely to be shopping in line and they're all broadly speaking what you would cause of clone retail centers or peripheral retail centers which aren't as attractive some of the main centers with their sort of exciting leisure propositions and they're not a specialist retail centers like you sort of nice sort of specialist local high streets be those either sort of more down market high streets or or art market high street since or more affluent areas and we thought that was a very interesting pattern and it's very evident around London but you see all over the UK and again it's written up here we also had this featured in this magazine Britain in 2016 which is the srcs magazine and is actually nice article on that again this is available as a PDF through my websites you can go and download that if you're interested a sore the nice summary of the classification and the process we went through and as I said there are there's these websites this is the CD RC mapping website you've got a Geo demographics tap here you can choose Internet user classification and you can browse the map you've got retail centres you can turn them on and off here which of these dots and when you click on a retail center it will give you a the catchment areas that we use for those particular retail senses as I said we're going to update these sort of fairly soon but you can see what we use for the paper anyway so that's the end but briefly this is all sort of working progress so this was an update on what we did in sort of the early 2000s the mid-2000s I think it's an improvement on that what we're going to do next is we now through the CRC accessing various retailer data including online online companies and other companies who are not purely online but have online retail offering or Romney channel retail we want to create a series of measures from those which will then input into a new classification particularly we only look to England in this particular case so we want to expand that to the falls of national extent at least Great Britain and particularly look at things like use and spend we have not to spend at all so you might spend more prevalent online than you would offline and we can actually start getting those ratios through some of these large data sets that were actually capturing so those are the sort of measures we're going to create and input into these new classifications the catchments themselves and the measure of e resilience we hope to improve when we've got the new centre definitions as well so hopefully by the end of the year we'll have a full suite over sort of fully up to de producto then roll forward I said all these things are available through the CDR see services without cost just part of what we're doing ok that's me done but I'm happy to take any questions you
