 ladies and gentlemen please welcome from The Wall Street Journal Rachel King good morning today we're going to talk about telecommunications and open networking and open switches and routers and those kinds of things we will look at data centers and how telecommunications companies are really starting to ramp up deployment of these boxes in their data centers & networks I'd like to introduce the panel great so I'm going to let these gentlemen introduce themselves Mahmud why don't you begin I good morning everybody this is mohamed el asesor senior vice president and cio with the verizon high Kenda well good morning I'm an AVP with AT&T hi this is kang wanli from sk telecom senior vice president of R&D Daniel Brower from the Deutsche Telekom vice president sorry from the treadmill ago so Daniel we're going to start with you that's good i'm the one with jet lag here i just arrived just amazing go ahead why is your company interested in moving to white box switches and routers what benefits do you see I'd say the overall driver is for sure efficiency and cost savings but also driving innovation at a much greater speed I don't know ken what would AT&T say um those three factors are the same with us I think in in our case it's a matter of survival our customers are expecting services on demand anywhere they may be and we're finding that the open source platform open source software provides us a platform to build new services and deliver it which much much faster velocity great and I'm looking forward what kinds of challenges are you facing now and do you expect to face in the future I would say when we think of white boxes the hardware ecosystem with system-on-a-chip is maturing very quickly and we're very pleased to see that progress the challenge is the software especially Network OS software to run on these systems with when networking features and so one of the things we hope in participating in this forum is to create enough of an ecosystem to help develop visa Network OS software platforms hey Mahmoud what do you think of white box computing and using open networks and networking gear in your networks sure I would say we've been just to pedal lil zoom out a little bit when you think about the entire networking space historically the focus has been more on speed and focus has been more on running different outside protocols like the data and video and voice on the same networks and now now it's exciting in the telecom industry is and then networking industry is everything becoming more software and software basically the same everything in that room becomes more like a nap and that's very exciting which allows us to kind of unlock and the aggregate or network components and allow us to accelerate the speed of innovation allow us to use white boxes and and then innovate and the software and and create different use cases for our customers one of the biggest case we have right now we're leading the 5g transformation and that's going to create lots of unique use cases and the ecosystem will change creating in you and we're growing the ecosystem especially with edge compute and mobile edge so getting compute everywhere in network all the way to the edge is a key key element for us and I would say speed in terms of giving our customers what they need and what they're looking for ski great so can you walk us through some of the challenges with the traditional kind of networking gear that you've had in your data centers one of the out say opportunities just today you get like one box and this box is has the software and hardware and everything so everything you want to change it's like on inbox by box basis so when you go and disaggregate this and and virtualize your network and use more white boxes then you can automate and you can scrub your entire network so network automation becomes much much easier and much more doable and nothing is easy the devil is always in details but but it's a completely different ballgame one another thing today the network is for everybody how do you go create personalized networks so these are healthier you visualize the different services like virtual cpe personalized networks are key elements so there's an opportunity for automation but just didn't exist before because the focus was more on speed and running different protocols and similar that's what same networks and but now there is a there's a good momentum in terms of accelerating and treating networks like IT apps and so much the same way as Facebook was able to automate the servers and its data centers and really scale down the kind of administrative attention each one needed and for me that's a good kind of murder I would say like the paths are kind of merging between what kind of Facebook and Google and everything has been doing and now the different service providers are they used to they had different kind of partners relying on right i would say on virtualized network like and now everything is becoming more like a data center and and scale data centers and rich and software-defined networks and i think that's where there is a joint interest here come one are you seeing the same kind of benefits yeah i think something that probably I mean maybe we need to I mean frame this challenges and what are the things that we want to do in this space is a it's it's really I mean different from how telcos and the mobile network service provider has been working previously right I mean it was more about the coverage and the bandwidth and how you support I mean people people moving around and make sure that they're connect connections don't drop I mean that was the foremost goal of mobile service providers and in some sense I mean in Korea we have already achieved that that I mean no matter where you go you have really good connectivity with video streaming no problem now mom of just mentioned about 5g network I mean in this case 5g doesn't stand for give a VPS this is the fifth generation mobile network that is going to be the next of the 4g LTE network that we have right now and that has a lot of emphasis on the bandwidth speed and the latency impact and so on but what we see also as an important scenario for 5g network is that it will be a lot of different types of traffic's that need to be able to connect through these network like healthcare people are talking about industrial IOT especially its talked about a lot in Europe also like a connected cars type of services and virtual reality augmented reality's now people want to be able to have I mean richer experience that is not available from the network today and in order to support those different types of traffic's I mean they have very different characteristics in terms of qos they require so the traditional way of setting up these monolithic Network years and having well provisioned network will probably require a lot more efforts in terms of labor and configuration and it will require a lot of work if we don't take this software-defined approach so that's why we are looking at data centers I mean white boxes obviously I mean creating data centers with brand name servers it's not going to be cost-efficient and also there is a lot more innovation going on in the open space in terms of open source software OpenStack odl on us so I think it makes sense to look at this even we come from the telco industry which was traditionally considered as walled garden space so i think that's that's what we are now the in terms of challenges it is actually if you talk to a telco engineer there are very different species if you talk to save talking to a software engineer or anyone from IT background so the I think the biggest challenge is how to transition from the traditional way of operating telecom network to this new type of network which is more open based on software based on white box gears so it's going to be interesting but it's definitely not something that can be taken lightly so let me ask a follow-up yes Jen what is the traditional way of operating a telecom network our audience may not be familiar with how that's different from say you would run a data center at Facebook or an IT data center or networking for a corporation ok so I think one thing that is different is that we have a very close relationship with network equipment vendors and we sort of go through a lot of I mean three trials and testing of the equipment's of course it is not just the routers and switches and servers that matter we have to make sure that they work with all these base stations access network gears and they have to work n2n right so we have very good engineers who are good with say how do you make sure that your the wireless signal is getting through how do you plan that how do you I mean set that up and then how do you migrate for that from the current generation to the next generation type of stuff but once you start talking about okay software define or open stair or tosca model yang they will say what are those I mean I don't understand any of that so it reminds me of the old days where you could get any telephone you wanted as long as it was black right yeah yeah you just still like a little bit more so when you get into like 5g you get like speeds that are 50 times the speeds we know it today in your mobile device and you get latency like single-digit millisecond and today when you look at the current compute so most of the computes happen in the data center some of it also outside data center and wood-fired jihad you bring compute to the edge of the network all did sell to the cell tower and that will enable all the frame type of use cases Cohen latency become super important being it into a VR augmented reality into like you mentioned connected cars and there are so many scenarios that will be enabled and that's different so any pushing like would industrial like video video is going to be huge use case of IOT and we're out say we're under estimating today there is no not today that can sustain the explosion that's going to happen in video would I OT and the current networks are completely out say unsustainable to scale so this is where the move to the software-defined networks and software-defined data center is a data center could be a huge data center but the edge the Sun is going to be unmanned super small data center and this is what I think those who kind of command OCP kind of project can help as well so can I what would you like where is the Open Compute Project now in terms of developing specifications for open switching for example and where would you like it to be I would characterize it that for the data center it's mature the open there's many open-source submissions on through ocp and we're very encouraged by that success and where we'd like to go is to incorporate the new system on chip silicon options that are coming out into the marketplace that include more when we could now when networking features and I think we have a pretty good line of sight that this year will be the year of development of new open white boxes that will meet a broader set of needs that a carrier like ourselves require yeah Daniel what about you you look you're nodding I sister no I agree we can and we didn't align before um no I really I really see that also we have in our network with what we're calling with with the open source or development with a real-time NSM and we have a long ways to go the one is the hardware of course at Open Compute but we still have the software on the systems that take us a few years and the development and I think we're going the right way so you're trying to develop the operating system now for this and how long do you anticipate that might take too long right now we're looking at what we're developing in our network we already have like say version 03 or whatever but we're looking to have it where we could do a massive rollout in 2018 that's pretty soon we're trying to go fast with open dude I thought that's why we're joining forces here do you envision that do you envision that this vacations that ocp provides will be timely enough or will you also have to turn to other resources no that's what we're hoping that's why joining forces here give us the ability to put pressure on the market and the vendors to make sure that we can push it on the market much faster it's one of the things we're at least hoping and looking forward to okay so let's talk about the fact that you all are collaborating especially with AT&T and Verizon that's sure interesting so what is it like to collaborate with your competitors on a project like this sure absolutely so I would say today I mean our number one focus fire these on the customer so today we do collaborate and we lead the innovation and drive the innovation with our traditional suppliers and these suppliers are the same so I think now would what OCP is bringing to the table is really unique is like we've been using we've moved from using it's a proprietary software into a open source software and now we are at the good place or we can transition also from using proprietary hardware into open open source hardware and I think in our in our view we want the ecosystem to grow and we want the ecosystem to be successful and when all shapes arise that's good for everybody and so we want everybody to be successful and and went on the use cases on the focus on the customer can yeah in to add to that i would i would characterize that there's a lot of efficiencies on having many companies collaborate on open source hardware and i think it'll help drive the cost down in the efficiency up across the entire industry and what will really happen you know so 18t will still compete with Verizon there's no doubt about it but the differentiation will come with software the hardware will be common and will get huge efficiency of scale but will compete on software features and Verizon I'm sure will develop there's will develop bars and will continue to compete together and the use cases from the customers are the key okay great and Daniel do you have any thoughts on that no I I think I said it also earlier i think when we joined powers it gives us really the ability to change the industry and we can only do that together so either we went together we lose together the customer is the main focus great i know that there are a lot of new services that virtualization of networking and switching will allow you to do can let's just go down the line and talk about which ones you're most looking forward to now and what you think you might be able to do in the future so it's it easiest one to mention or like virtual CP they select literal return and switching in and all this stuff the other one you also be able that exciting to get about with five GS you're going to create personalized networks on the edge so he can have your own network on the edge so we can slice the network today that's not possible it's very it's like I can you explain that to me I'm not quite understanding what a personal never with me today everybody is using the same is connected to the same cell as the same network performance is available to everybody we can change that network we can provide more secure Network we can provide and for every at a personal level if you are connecting it especially for IOT devices and that's where again I'll keep saying the edge compute will create this differentiation because you can throw orchestration and of the software on the edge and having compute and storage on the edge a level to the lots of scenarios so if you're we're not possible before so if you're for example running a network of automobiles that are communicating safety information to one another you can prioritize now the real time create network for this car and then hand off to another network in a different cell and then you don't need this this part of the slice of the network on on this cell as the car is traversing the network sir it's exciting times in hey Ken yes we saw at ATT we've developed two new services one is network on demand and the other one is net bond and what's at the core of those two services is we opened up our network to allow the customer to control several parameters of their service and we found that virtualized switching and routing and and moving towards merchant silicon technologies has been the fundamental underpinning that allows us to create this new environment and we continue to really be delighted in the innovation we see from our customer so we'll open up an API and then a customer will come back to us and explain how they're using combinations of virtual network functions that we provide and open up to them and they're using networks in ways we never imagined and it just feeds on itself it becomes a virtuous cycle where a customer will say hey you open this API we developed this and but if you add if you can open up this other part we can create this new additional service and manage our business needs and it's really driving a lot of interesting and innovative conversations with our customers and quite frankly the people that work for me are quite excited by this their day job is much more interesting to work in an agile environment where things can really move fast with the customers so Ken can you give me an example of a way that you never envisioned something so some of the parameters like with network on demand and which includes a virtual cpe is we have a virtual network function library so we may look at certain functions like a firewall that we can the customer can control adjusting cos and adjusting bandwidth between locations on demand and then a customer will finally you know start to use our network at night they may be using it to sync data centers during the day then we rearrange the network to carry stuff from satellite locations to a hub and so there's a lot of time of day and tweaking of the network to meet certain business needs and quite frankly our customers know their business better than we do and it's you know we opening up their network provides on the whole set of tools that allow them to optimize their networking needs to their business rather than us being in the way with lack of features hey come on yeah I think the basic idea of virtualizing the network infrastructure gives you the flexibility and agility to to those services that you want to create and provide to the users and also it the the main benefit that it gives you is that you can have finer grained control of your network and how you want to be able to create something and the provide to your customer in a very personal way so if your customer has a lot of I mean bandwidth needs I mean he's a gamer he has a new oculus VR with the mobile network connectivity then I mean we can easily create that type of network type virtual pipe to that customer if someone I mean like mentioned in the connected car type of scenario you want low latency then we don't have to go through all the way to the back end of the network you can just route all the traffic at the mobile edge so there is a lot of possibilities and flexibilities that we can build now to the network because of the new a key is that are available to us and Daniel how about you what can I add all the great virtualized stuff there no basically about a year ago we we launched what we call Clell VPN a service in three countries in Europe and where we're expanding into five different countries at this time throughout Europe once unique on it is utilizing one data center in one country to provide a service for other countries within Europe with all the regulatory problems lawful interception and all the other problems that we have in Europe that in America you don't have with the 50 states but we definitely have it in Europe makes it a little bit unique but we managed to launch the service last year and we're expanding it using and utilizing the virtual routers and switches at this time so that's just one thing that we're doing right now and we're also preparing to launch in April or pan european network we're installing a data center in different countries and so we're already moving this direction and so what good suppliers do this year or next year in order to help you achieve your goals go faster with their development go faster yeah okay have a come on is there anything that you're really looking to buy and you cant buy it yet I think we're working really close with some of the vendors on doing partnership and joint development in this area all of us that i know and i think we have some excellent working relations and we're trying to push i think like i said we're always pushing to go faster because they're quicker we are the more efficient and cost savings we can bring come on how about you yeah i think go faster is definitely important so one of the things that has i mean change it in this new brave I mean open word is that now we as a telco service provider has to play more role in putting all these things together I mean select the right components and put them together and make sure that they work seamlessly now many of the things that supposed to work together when you try to actually I mean put together they they don't work together so it we need more composable more compliant open pieces so that I think only in that way we can get and we can build a system that I mean fits the purpose and optimized for providing the service you know I'll just add that speed is also the essence and then there's there's an interesting challenge it's you know today as we discussed about the type of engineer so we in eighteen t or having to retrain our workforce to work in this new environment it's it's a very different job to engineer a network with OEM equipment versus open-source equipment and so we've created a program to we call skills pivot to retrain people in place to this new better way of doing engineering and collaborating and working and so this includes co-development with many partners and and then learning how to you know just the basics of how to manage open source projects and we're really looking forward to applying it with ocp okay how is that working the retraining of employed it's it's it's going well there's we have multiple collaborations with universities with master's degree programs we have micro degrees there's lots of online training we're training people to become pro you know modern programmers from a lot of people were dated myself so we're lots of online training and the feedback from my team has been very positive on the results and the quality of it so if I were say a certified networking engineer from a large conventional proprietary provider you would retrain me to actually be able to manage in this new environment yeah where r we are retraining our people in place because there they know what we're trying to achieve work for our customers they have that as part of their DNA but what they need to do is be retrained on a new technology so we're bridging the gap between their knowledge of our customers to the new technology and bringing them along with us in place so what is the most important skill but that they are learning or that they need to know I'm sure that there are other folks out here who may want to adopt it it's really software skills at the end of the day it's a it's software you know when I learn programming once in the day I won't say how many years ago it was a completely different environment of how you code how you work together with teams to code and it's basically learning those software skills is where the focus is sajjad on this one so to piggyback on the culture side and the training and workforce side again when you get to the networking they're all days it's mostly like CL eyes and stuff and now everything is becoming software oriented said the biggest concept we have in the software world is DevOps kind of culture and DevOps tools and operations and this has this includes the software kind of development lifecycle automation so how do you bring that to the network world even though it's not everybody in IT most of the time the same IT teams are developing and operating so I'd be bring the DevOps culture into the network world as every but everything goes into a software and that's like that's how you automate the network and get operations and developers to work much closer so that's one and then the other one which we're going to like push on the ACP project is there is the design for an efficient open open source mobile edge and and all the 5g forum we mentioned we have a kind of a 5g forum we found would like ask et in some of our key vendors and in Dolce and Nokia and an ericsson and in Thailand kokum and I think LCP candy can add a lot to that forum the helm of the mobile edge how do you bring the DevOps culture to verizon what what are you doing specifically are you retraining folks are you bringing in consultants we are so I'd say we're doing all of the above right so in the IT side we spent past couple of years on terms of moving thousand plus application to do full automation and with that the focus is on time to value instead of waiting until like three months to get the value how do you get incremental value every two weeks three weeks whatever this print is so so so the same culture so inserting some people were rotating between IT and network so that helps in terms of sealing players at different levels we have formal training for like the IT team who are applying similar training to the network teams and we're also connecting showing what's possible and we have a monthly kind of forum at the executive level what a bit of you and share best practices and and we're in the process of sealing more and more people in the network space would kind of IT background and doing same thing moving like people from networks IT so that's like what I tina's becomes like 10 please join me in giving this gentlemen a round of applause thank you very much
