 hello everyone my name is Paula and thank you very much for the introduction Adrienne and today I'll be presenting the all of the data integration aspects of this new product is AP Business Objects cloud so a little bit of a disclaimer before hands as I'll be talking about some of some planned innovations the legal disclaimer is always so good to have so what is the agenda are going to be first of all we'll do an overview of what ADA integration is within that psap Business Objects cloud offering identifying all the different step that it encompasses then we'll drill a little bit more into the details of what is data integration and talk about the two types of data connectivity both the remote connection and the acquisition mode of the data once you've acquired the data the next step is to get the data ready for analysis or do it do some green things modeling and this is what we'll be talking in that in that fifth step next step is about data security and so what about the data security aspect of of cloud Vienna and the Business Objects cloud and so what it will cover some of the security aspects of this is subjects cloud and also review some of the innovations coming by the end of the year with this new product so let's go into the into the overview of the of the product and at first it may be a 10,000 sheet view of the abbe SAT portfolio but I think it's worthwhile understanding where to position the safety Business Objects clouds within the overview over all SAT portfolio of products in the cloud as you notice the Hana platform is the foundation of the various products on topics which we have the Hana cloud platform and SCP business cloud is going to be this area of self-service where we envision our end users to go to where any type of work an optical workflow mashing mix and matching data together and presenting information to end users is going to happen some of you may have seen also the digital board room which is based on top of the SAT business cap and cloud product but this is where we would position the how we would position the SAT Business Objects top platform within the overall offering of the SAT product so drilling now a little bit more into what is the the the product itself and I think it's good to understand that we the products are a 50 Business Objects cloud has a core number of common services with which on top of which we have business applications that are being deployed on top of this platform the advantage of this approach is that any of the application is going to be using these common services and the interoperability between these application is it's almost built into the into the way that they are being implemented so the particular area we're going to be focusing on today is this data connectivity and modeling component how we connect to the data how shape the data how we how we model the data so that it can be used afterwards in the subsequent step of Business Objects cloud for those of you who have who are seeing the business objects come for the first time there is a a visualization component along with some collaboration once you've present once you've shaped the information correctly you can assemble those this these visualization into a story you can also add some predictive so use some of the predictive services that are part of the platform and the monitor or audit the the usage of the the your your content so the three the three applications that are today sitting on top of the platform are the business intelligence application the planning and the predictive so we just released along with the new name we released a new application the predictive applications last week at vampire the platform is sitting on top of the Hana cloud platform that's leveraging some of the services of that particular platform but in it is really leveraging the services of this platform so you do not need to buy any Hana cloud platform this is encompassed into the licenses of the Business Objects cloud all right so now once you have I think it's here at this point if this diagram helps you understand for the various steps that you would be doing as part of your analytical workflows are being able to connect to base data to prepare the data and to model the data they are intertwined within the application with all the other steps of an analysis and so once we acquire the data you may want to prepare the data and then visualize it and and assemble the various visualizations together but it's not this always a straightforward sequence and this is what we recognize is that oftentimes you may want to do some visualization then you can go back to the data modelling and then you do a little you sense a little further in your analysis and and continue and continue prepare your story until the next point in time where you actually want to bring in more data this is not the straightforward step and the workflows within the products are made in a to to satisfy these kinds of a different of different workflow so this product has been released recently last year and one thing that is that it's certain is that this is a product that changes very rapidly so every two weeks we have an internal release and this means that the number of changes that are other enhancements that are coming in they coming in at the very fast pace so you have a here a link for all of es AP release notes within the presentation if you click if you click on the link once you have the presentation you'll be able to be brought you'll be brought to the page where all of the what you are being a listed and you'll notice that we're already on our ninth release of the year that gives you an idea of how fast we're improving the the the product so one question that's always popped up when talking about data in the cloud is where is my data is actually going to be located and so at AP Business Objects cloud is part FP and Hana cloud platform data centers which are located in various areas or over the across the world so today we have five deployments of Business Objects cloud and some subsequent and data centers that are our deployments that are planned in in various areas of the of the world if you want to have any information regarding the data centers PSAP data centers understand what are the certifications that we run with Deb can go and click on be a safety data center come and page and this will give you all the details you want to regarding how our death data centers are running so now in overview of the data integration step themselves first of all what are the data what are the data source that a capability objects cloud can connect today and this picture gives you already an idea of all the different sources that we can connect to and again this list is going to significantly in be increased over the course of the next month based on the list of new Afghans innovation that we have so today within the if we look start with all of the clouds sources that we have so we're able to connect to httpd math solutions and so those are areas within HTTP HTTP API a cloud platform so you could store whatever data you already have there and then you could use our API or HDI offerings or smart data integration offering to push data into your HCP D bath and then connect from it with clouds for analytics as you notice there is this little and keep arrows which have mentions the remote so in for other on premise source we can connect with this time reader remotely to Hana instances they need to be a piece of Hana SP 10 and if you could always use the smart data access of Hana to have gained access to their data Oracle sequel server db2 and and the list goes on and connect to these sources via the Hana platform with cloud for analytics so this is a remote type of connection again meaning that the data remains there so I'll do this distinction between these remote connection and the data acquisition and I think it's good to again go over the the pose of each of the dissolution so if we talk about the online solution zone with a remote connection we do this the analysis without any data replication and that concerns the Hana HCP suing be W and s for HANA data sources which means that we can leverage the work that was done in these on your unfriended system so the investment that you have put into your on-premise system are protected meaning that we can leverage all the views we can we connect directly to the views that you created in your own assistance from AP Business Objects cloud also if you have very large amount of data and you don't want to move them that would be also another a good option to consider the last the last last but not least all of the data given the real time power of the Hana it means that you are always guaranteed to get the latest data the latest data in your business objects cloud application on the data acquisition side so data is being imported into cloud for analytics this is where we can actually leverage all of the analytical capabilities of Business Objects cloud so meaning that all of the planning the blending and the data preparation can be leveraged within this acquisition monthly if you want to take bring data together and don't have to do it and don't want to do it on your own front assistance then that would be a way to to to leverage be the Business Objects cloud this what does that mean in terms of who are the end users that we can we wanted to target do we actually want to support the the data analysts that want to wander around and run their analytics on the on the fly being able to bring data at any point in time create their visualizations they love their economies or do we want to have on the other side IT who wants to pretty much structured structure that the data sets that are available to their population of end-users make sure that they provide this one version of the tools on top of which the and the reports can be run the analysis can be run and they can guarantee the the results what we want to do is do both do at the same time provide the end-user with this autonomy and also provide IT with the mean - with the means to satisfy this one version of the truth how can we do this by making sure that as a as is the transition from what the work of the data analyst has done to do to a more a more structured way of presenting the information can be done smoothly and this is where all the all the modeling aspects are are very important when once the end-user once the data analyst has created has shaped the data in such a way that he wants it to be he wants to share the information share the results that he has he has found what I can take over and add in on top of this modeling is experience all the necessary security for that of everyone or all the only the person who are allowed to see the information can have access to to it so it's it's about both the autonomy of the end user and the this one version version of the truth that you want to be able to accomplish with Business Objects cloud and how do we do this so this is a simple way of looking at the various that in order to get to this paper integration so first of all and this is typically a job that is going to be done once is to set up the connectivity to the to the source that you want to have in your business public's pennant this is an IQ driven workflow and I'll show you in the demo where it where it actually happens then this is more from an end user perspective and can they will connect to the to the data source to the data source they want to be able to have access to in the case of data in the case of an acquisition mode then they can start preparing and cleaning the data they have the proper experience to actually do that within a Business Objects cloud and finally the modeling experience depending on how deep the end-user wants to go this modeling experience can be very light but can also introduce a lot of power that can be leveraged by by the end users can you go into the and the next slide alright so I will take over at this point again if I could very good stuff so now I would like to show you what it actually means within within business objects cloud what is the experience of connecting to one data source so I stuck with a story that we have created where you can see also what what we can do with the Business Objects calcloud what are the visualizations we can bringing and this is a an overview of the company of my company where I have brought in data coming from the Mayer HR system I have also a data coming from my my travel system and from my procurement systems all of those into just one one into one story but there was what the information that I am missing right now is a I want to be able to know what is the average salary of my various departments in my in my company so I can always go I don't have the model prepared and I will show you also how we can connect to that data so so the source in this particular case is success factors and that is a source like we've just brought into this is objects count I have already done the setup I want to show you what it looks like and it is a very easy step you just as a as a more of an IT type of person I would have to fill in this type of information to get my connectivity going once I have the connectivity I can always set up also this is where I would set up to the scheduling of that connectivity so I acquire the information but the from this connectivity I can also decide when to refresh as an end user I can decide when to to refresh the this this particular connectivity I can decide to refresh it once or to repeat the refresh got all of this flexibility so I'm going to create a model on top of this connectivity and in order to do that I will be I will need to connect to the to that to the particular source Here I am presenting presented with various options I can start with a black model this is typically what you would do into your planning scenarios I can use a particular data source or a get data from an application that is in this case success factors here I will I've already predefined the connectivity and then I will go on and look at the aquarium at this point I will create a new query call this query demo all and I'm looking for my user table way I have all the information necessary to create my my salary so you see I've got access to a large number of information within my Pizza factor environment and what I'm going to bring in is the department I want to filter on a particular division I want to bring in my employee ID here and the salary here there I keep it simple on purpose um and then I want to be able to sit to do it on my and a particular division I want to do it just on the on my industry division so let's wait for the pop-up to come back but the idea indeed a search you've notice it's a very interactive query panel so we can drag and drop all of the necessary and objects within did this this query panel and I don't need to know any what is the underlying technology as an end user it's very seamless what kind of what kind of technology is being used behind in this particular case for instance it's an old data technology so there I've set my filter and I've created my query afterwards I'll be running the query and at this point I'm retrieving the this particular information so this is where I will be again this is a simple query that also it gives you an idea of the type of actions I can actually do on the data I've acquired I can sort filter I've got lots of transforms possible where I can combine the columns I can split the columns can print the case I could also change and replace the the values here I notice that I'm I'm saying that my ideas are measured though it's not the measure to dimension and once I'm happy with this I will just create my my model and so this model is this semantic layer that afterwards I'll be using in my subsequent step of the analysis and so every time that we'll be creating visualization I create these visualization on top of the model this helps guarantee a particular a common language a common business terminology across across my my end-users and this is a modeling experience that I am that you can see I've cut so I in this particular query I brought two additional dimensions first name and last name of the employee but you see I've got my salary measure for which I said change the aggregation type to average and I'll be using this into the main stories so if I go to my story I can open it up again and this is where I'll be adding my a chart with the particular the bucket particular track width which will show the average salary per per department in order to do that I'll show you one of the actually pretty cool interface that we have especially when it comes down to to business users this is more of an exploration exploratory a data exploratory experience where here we go and there can be data connectivity so this is the model that I've just created and it will show into this this panel this is a facet panel and anytime I will start selecting a either a value or a dimension that automatically a chart will appear beneath it so here I want just to have the salary per department and you'll notice that I get my response right away I have flexibility to change the chart type if I wanted to but I'm happy with this one I could also sort it to make it from highest to lowest and this shows me that is probably preferable to work in a line to serve as running in the stores um once I'm happy with it I will directly put it push it into my into one of my pages and you'll notice that it shows up into my into my page I can also change just the layouts beneath it so I and I can actually see something see the background there we go and then I can always bring it into elsewhere this is this is not the fixed template it's really flexible and if you start even selecting two values that will even be notified about how what does what is the difference between these these two bells there's lots of features lots of pretty cool features that are part of Business Objects cloud all right so that was the the demo confuse I'll try to continue here and I'll talk about more in details about all of the features that you've seen so far this is where we drill a little bit more into the details of the different type of connectivity so having to talking about what the remote connection is and here at this point it's just a reminder that it is for Hana HTTP and on the roadmap we have bigger BLS for Hana the idea is that you would be connecting to the to the models to the on premise does that happy already created there for you so the dictator stays where it is and you connect to these on premise models so what you can do on top of it is as more measures calculated or restricted measures you can edit those those measures those are this is the flexibility that you have on top of these particular models you do need to have a certain level of Hana and enable the ena Delivery Unit and for any type of level of support for the SAP HANA features I would recommend to CDC the documentation of Business Objects now in this slide and there is a link of you you can notice this experience to you how to connect to these on premise sources you need to set up a reverse proxy in order to connect securely to your on-premise sources there is a link here that details how you can set build this particular reverse proxy today and build the the SSO between the your Hana on-premise with your Business Objects Scout this allows you to leverage all of the security you've built into Hana into those Hana views and not have to worry about it in your business objects called implementation so again in order to do to build this reverse proxy I would recommend to click on the the link of the presentation as it provides a very good step-by-step explanation of how to do it now if we go into the so we covered the data the remote connectivity for for data and I will kill a little bit more into the acquisition step of a Business Objects tiles on the next slide so for all of the these sources and this is just a reminder you've seen it in the demo all of the source that we can connect to one one interesting thing that you can do in the dish if you've got the CSV or txt file simply drag this file into your into the business object onto the screen and automatically it will generate a particular model in order to connect to some of the on-premise source that is where you would need to do some data acquisition there is some IP steps that are being are required in order to make sure that you have a secured connection there you need to install two agents locally in your system in order to create first of all create the tunnel that secured tunnel between a Business Objects cloud and your your system and for this you'll need to install the SSAT HANA cloud connector and the second agent the ASAP cloud for analytics agent is all about making sure that the queries that are being sent from the business from business objects out and are understood by the unprinted system locally so you'll need to install these two agents and once again there is a very good job done by my colleague hi chief that detail step by step how to do this you can look at also into the documentation but I found that this blog was very useful as it is a really and you follow the recipe and you'll get here you'll get to the to the points are very very easily and very quickly so again this is a link to the to go to to to the page just follow it and you'll be fine a little bit of a spotlight on to two particular sources the first one is the HP Business Objects universe again for as much as possible for all the this source we want to have this kind of drag and drop type of experience and universes is a good example of what it what it is so you'll be able to do this have this drag-and-drop type of experience but a little bit more flexibility with constantly filtering operators so the we are able to understand and and or operators and also you can we can under also understand pumps coming from universes you do need to have a business object and system that is up for that one x.25 at least and we do have the the scheduling of the universe data refresh so for the authentication types that we're supporting I think you can see it it's enterprise alga and Windows ad all those types of supported with and and once you have the data acquired into your business objects value can add the security on top of it for an SSO type of experience where we would be able to replicate the and the the the authentication from the universes into business objects now that would be further down the road one thing one last thing to to clarify is we're only supporting there's the latest version of universe's those that came with the Business Objects for that oh so the doc UI next type of universes here we're talking more about the BW type of acquisition and this is a very good solution if you want to start mixing and matching your your BW data with other types of data for other types of scenarios and the BW online connection is actually plan and will probably be the one that you'd want to consider if you have a more of an OLAP analysis type of you're looking for a more of an OLAP analysis type of experience where a lot of these and delegated KPI calculations or if you want to leverage some of their higher keys they fit them BW those bases the years you want you're looking for the online type of experience which is again coming down the road for the data that has been acquired what we have is a scheduler that allows end users depending on the model that you've created the mistress that you've created to actually replay it free play the query at a either once or in a repeat schedule that has been defined by the creator of the particular query and that ensures that you have somewhat of the latest data you can define how how how quickly you want to make it to repeat every day or every hour this is up to you to define and um so once you acquire the data there is the data is always very or not very but that there may be some tweaks that you want to do and and this is where the this data preparation experience or section it will come in handy so for any users who do want to have a certain number a level of flexibility it's an important step where they can change replace they have a whole list of transform I showed you in the in the demo so there's a this is a non exhaustive list of the transform that are state supported them we're going to improve the the data this list as we go along but it's not just about the transforms that you can do in the data it's also about the semantics and richness that you can do and you've seen what we can do with geo maps thanks to our partner s3 but all of these geo locations these maps I can be done because semantically enrich a particular column of a by datasets with the Vice plain which is going to be a this is a an actual geo-location all of the Transformers are lifted into a history panel so we can see what are the transformations that the end user has done and of course you can undo it and redo these kinds of operations if there is an error that we can automatically detect within the within the the data we have a tendency of exposing be the heir the idea is to make the user as efficient as possible so this step is you can is only done when the data is acquired once you've created the once you've acquired the data and you can do all of this data preparations I mentioned that we want to make the user as efficient and as possible which means that we want to also indicate to him where he needs to look when there are some issues within the with the model that he's creating so for instance says those are some of the quality issues where the system will automatically automatically provide a visual feedback so the end user can actually go and and and act upon it so a lot of these issues can be fairly easily identified and reported to to the end user again keeping in mind that we want to help the end user provide a good model so that afterwards at the data that is the visualization that are being created on top of it are are correct these models as we've seen are we can see how they help be and use it a healthy end user both in multiple ways first of all they don't need to have to write their own people or right there Oh data connectivity or whatever technology is underneath all of this is being taken care of by by Business Objects cloud it also helps the end-user access the the data and and make sure that they have the group Ranger audience has a common business terminology so in terms of the features for each of the mount models and this is more of a summary of what we've seen during the demo it's all about being able to create these dimensions and measures there is also a formula language that you can use in order to add more measures or add more dimensions to tear and to your tier model there is some security we'll cover that a little later each of the dimension is shared and especially when you have to the training enable so if you bought the planning relation these models that you've created have additional capabilities such as being able to version these these models so you have your actual data but you could also start defining additional versions for the and forecast and create multiple forecasts so this is a very interesting aspect of Business Objects clouds which really does leverage some of the concepts that we traditionally have in in our business objects tools so security security we've got multiple multiple levels of security oh yeah but I thought that would be interesting just to have this then this slide about the maximum security and Jenson's as you can notice the path is very you can go around it but the idea being that if you want to implement security you need to have the proper tools to do so if you go to the next slide and this is what business object bound is going to give you so security that you can apply as the dimension level and you can give right to your users you can give the right to goals and apply these rules to your end users and each of these right I can be also specific to a particular model to a particular dimension and within a particular model you can also define who has access to the to be to the to a particular value so um this is starting to be a enterprise-ready type of approach where we want to make sure that the everyone has access to the data that he can and I connect to the key he can access again for remote connections from yo cloud and so connecting today to Hana on premise we can leverage the security as soon as you have the SSO enabled as the ditches where as one of the advantage of the this remote connection so just to give you a direction of where we're going with the Business Objects Council we we're really focusing on two aspect when is making sure that we have we can provide the autonomy to end users so basically allow them to connect quickly to any data source so they listed data sources that we're going to open it up both creating our own adding on to the list of data sources that we are supporting but also enabling partners and customers to add their own data source as as they go along the other aspect is that we want to have data analyst more efficient increase their efficiency when preparing the data I don't know if you heard or it's probably well known to to use the fact that in a typical visual in a typical analysis eighty percent of the time is being dedicated to data preparation and this is a number that I think we can release lower and lower down and this is what we want to do going forward make sure that instead of 80 percent thing it's we're reducing drastically this kind of number the other aspect is keeping in mind that whatever work is being done by these data analysts can be shared across here we enterprising going along this idea of having a semantic share lay the semantic layer increasing the power of the semantic layer making sure that we can head IT and empower user can control the data coming into the Business Objects clouds and supporting some of those more modern complex data flows that are being that companies now have to support so you see the various approach here in this in this in this diagram the various investment areas of investment that we want to have when talking about data connectivity so making sure that we can explain support to other cloud services to on premise sources to it ap cloud sources the s AP on premise sources of course and also this partner this idea that whenever I pass system is out there those are these integrated integrated platform as a service solutions those are fantastic to bring data into and connect any type of data to any type of data and bring data into asipi Business Objects now and so this is how the the roadmap would look like when looking at the various types of data sources that we plan on supporting so this is a planned roadmap where if you look at q2 indeed we've already delivered quite a bunch of these data sources already so the University UCC connection but also the success factors that I just demoed and and some of the generic connectors is still yet to come so if you have your sequel server then you will have a generic JDBC connector very soon that without allow you to connect you to that particular source in q3 and the focus area is going to be probably twofold first of all looking at under SAT cloud solutions and seeing how we can connect to them so continuing along this idea of connecting to success factors can cure we want to make sure that the other skp cloud solutions can be accessed VI with it Business Objects cloud but also non entropy cloud solutions and for this group will be looking also at some of those particular vertical so in the in the planning area or accounting area but also trying to look into the marketing area that some of the these sources and as we go along will probably add more features and more sources but as I mentioned one of the one of the effort will be to make sure that we have the proper API to import data into Cochrane analytics and partner with both internal solutions such as smart data integration that will be able to directly feed data in 2006 and not have to go through Hana cloud platform and then Business Objects cloud but also external third party such as GUI or smack logics those are the types of partners that we can we want to make sure that they can feed data into em into business objects cloud in q4 big investments into the SDK extension framework so now any any partner any customers should be at this point in time would be able to to create their own plugin that would be put into and into business objects table to connect to a source that so we don't support natively in in the solution that should open up a lot of use cases or more dedicated or specialized use cases depending on the type of the source that you'd want to be able to access there is going to be also some efforts around the in the the Big Data area so if you're using some of those sources will be able to connect you two to it in G and the idea also the remote connection so today only HANA but at this point in time we'll have pwms for hana as well and hopefully this this will come this will come very very quickly and this is a robot subjected to change as always but it gives you already an idea of where our investments are going to be and really our goal is to make sure that we can connect to as many data source as possible and thanks to those those connectivity that are built in or and also through our partners I'm just a bit over time so if you go into the last slide and I'll do a 30-second on it just to make sure that everyone is aware of the big effort that we're putting into data preparation and making sure that we have a next generation data preparation experience coming in very soon in h2 of this year and which will have not only a not only a revamp grid grid and resent experience where instead of having the end-users tell us what he wants to do up front we would actually be able to suggest to him based on what based on the different objects that he'd be selecting whether a column or self the type of transform that should be most probable most probably doing so it is really a change of shift into the user experience of the part of this aspect of the product where we really want to focus on the efficiency of the end-user also make sure that we can we will help you end user with a different type of experience when organizing and shaping the the model of the of the data set so having this through this card like experience where you can the end user will be able to structure the relationship but also structure that the the model that will often the PP be created it's just the beginning this is a seriously exciting product we've just started last year to with our first release and already we're we're very very far down the road even after a year onto the market so from a bi perspective it's pretty exciting to be working on top of s product and the data areas is very um is very important at a key aspect of it so we want to bring in a lot of innovation as evidenced by this the state of new data preparation experience but it's it's really just the beginning we have lots of ideas about what we can do and how we can help end-users achieve their their core any remaining questions that you may have yeah thank you thank you Paul have a great presentation despite the technical difficulties and great thanks to Eric who's being busier than what we were done without you I couldn't actually see my note earthy chat while I was presenting unfortunately so there are a few question yeah so question from dawn I guess here can you elaborate on how Business Objects cloud supports and enhances single version of truth I'm seeing how could I'm also seeing how it might work against this with the valuable move towards a data analyst autonomy curious and your take ranking it might take but I think more value would have your take if you if you're able to provide the feedback oh yes yeah so the way I see it I see it where indeed as an end user I can start acquiring the data I'd consider myself as a data analyst to start with so I can connect to any data source I would wish to with Business Objects now acquire the data there and start creating the proper models and editing the models but once IT steps in they can take these model sets were originally created for one person these models are start to be private so I don't have to share the these models with anyone as a as an end user as a data analyst once I start making them public then I can also start introducing it more of the enterprise readiness that is being expected in those types of scenarios so having their security having their scheduling implemented on top of it so this is where I would say that the we have a very progressive experience from the self-service autonomy of end-users to the structure raishin that is being needed in the enterprise types of scenarios
