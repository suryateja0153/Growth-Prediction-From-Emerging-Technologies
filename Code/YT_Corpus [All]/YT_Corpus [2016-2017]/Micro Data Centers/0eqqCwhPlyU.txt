 60 minutes the week before comes out I'm sitting on a couch sitting on my couch with my wife and I pull up the preview Michael Lewis is there on the screen and steve Kroft says to him what's the headline and he said the United States stock market is rigged and I just went oh my god no okay Michael Lewis says that on national TV it's it's in the you know it's in the preview so I call Michael and I say to him I said Michael why in the world did you say the stock market's rigged and he said well let me ask you a question I said okay he goes is the way the stock market has been designed does it systematically disadvantage certain people and I said yes of course you know that he goes well what would you call it them so the funny part about it is that rigged is a word I have my money in mutual funds I don't think the investment process is broken by any stretch of the imagination but when you ask the question is the stock market the way it's designed does it systematically disadvantage certain people the answer to that is yes and I'll explain you exactly why that is and I think over the course of time what's happening is the playing field is getting more level and as Martin indicated the people who it's who are being systematically disadvantaged are the people who know the least about the stock market so back to the beginning here my career started as a trader I traded energy stocks they traded technology stocks I cared about fundamentals of companies this is a typical screen this is from Google Finance I would use Bloomberg Reuters my job was I traded on behalf of mutual funds and hedge funds I was an institutional trader and actually ended up running all of risk trading for Royal Bank of Canada in US equities which meant that if a mutual fund wanted to buy a million shares of Advanced Micro Devices AMD I'd pull up a quote I'd look on the offer and I see that there's a hundred and fifteen thousand shares offered at two dollars and 91 cents so in 2006 if I wanted to buy a hundred thousand shares of AMD - no two dollars 91 cents I typed that into my computer by 100,000 to 91 enter it would go out and I would buy a hundred thousand shares of AMD $2 91 cents but in 2007 when I would try to do exactly that same thing I'd only get eighty thousand of the hundred that I saw and in 2008 I would try to buy a hundred and I get seventy thousand of what I saw in 2009 I tried to buy a hundred thousand I get forty five thousand of the hundred thousand shares that I saw and it drove me insane I do what every trader does when they think their computer is not working I call tech support and the guy would run out of the back and say what's going on and say watch this I see fifty thousand shares at two dollars and ninety three cents I'm going to try to buy that I will only get a fraction of what you see you and I see on the screen and I try to do and I get fifteen thousand shares and I said what do you think is happening and he says well I think that there's more people that want to buy AMD and it's not just you meaning that you're part of a market that's moving very quickly and many people want to trade and I said okay well I'll prove you wrong I say I now I'm going to try to buy forty five thousand shares at two dollars and ninety five cents but I'm not going to press this button for five seconds and if while I'm counting the stocks trading you're right other people want to buy AMD I said but nothing's going to happen until I press this button so I count to five or seven or whatever and I could change it doesn't matter and then I hit the button and that's when the stock would move that's when the the offers would disappear and I'd say to them I said I'm the event this is not a random occurrence the only reason people want to buy AM B is because I want to buy it I had no idea why this was happening and went on for two years all right Michael Lewis you know I think some people if they haven't read the book you know kind of would view me as a disrupter and that's like the opposite of what I am I spent my entire life getting along with people this is not in a million years I never thought I'd be in the position I'm in right now this went on for two years myself my traders we just dealt with it it became common knowledge that if I saw 500,000 shares of a stock on the offer that I would only get a fraction of what I actually saw I got really lucky in 2009 RBC offered me an opportunity to run what's called electronic sales and trading and what that meant in a nutshell is I went from managing a group of people human traders - computer programmers and network engineers that were building algorithms that our traders would use so I went from managing traders to managing people who built programs and algorithms for those traders I actually didn't want the job so my first answer to them offering me this job was actually no and it's funny because life is a lot about decisions and a lot about luck and for some reason my boss kept persisting I think you should really take a look at this job I didn't want to do it actually funny story is that we had bought a company terrible terrible company we bought in 2007 they were they were supplying the technology that we were using and I actually thought they were partially responsible for the fact that I couldn't trade we buy this company it's a pile of garbage and I can't trade they fired the CEO and they wanted me to take that company over and I just didn't want to do it I went out and I said okay I'll do a little bit of due diligence to see if I want to take this job and I set went out and I sat with a friend of mine who actually worked at sa C capital in Stanford Connecticut Steve Cohen's fund and I said if anyone has the best tools algorithms in the market its sa C capital so I sat with the trader from sac he was using algorithms from Goldman Sachs and Credit swift's and Morgan Stanley cetera et cetera he could not buy or sell what he saw on his screens either and that was the first time where the light bulb went off in my head to say this isn't an RBC problem it's not a crappy technology problem one of the biggest hedge funds in the world is using tools built by all the largest banks and he can't buy or sell what he sees on his screen either at that point in time I actually knew the problem was systemic so I took the job because I really wanted to figure out what was happening and it turns out that some of the people that I you know again life has a lot to do with luck I was hiring people in the spring of 2009 that's when I took the job if you look at a chart of the SP the absolute bottom of that chart is spring of 2009 and all of a sudden I could convince a bunch of people who never in their wildest dreams ever wanted to work for the Royal Bank of Canada that the Royal Bank in Canada was actually a pretty good place for people to work so I built a team at RBC for the first time also I started to read about high-frequency trading I had no idea what that was but I knew that it sounded pretty important and he's a hire people from that industry and I did and with some of the people from the high-frequency trading industry explain to me was that the hundred thousand shares of AMD that I saw on my screen wasn't just at one stock market the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq they were actually at the time thirteen different stock exchanges in the United States that were geographically located in different buildings now the geography actually is important here because what that means is that when I see a hundred thousand shares of my screen and I try to enter an order me pressing the button once isn't just one action me pressing the button once sends one message to something called a smart order router it splits my order up into as many as 13 different messages and blasts them out to the stock exchanges this is going to sound crazy but RBC at the time we were located in downtown Manhattan all the exchanges were in New Jersey which is west of Manhattan so what that means is that my one order to buy a hundred thousand shares of AMD let's say there's 25,000 shares offered at four exchanges Batz direct edge Nasdaq in New York Stock Exchange the four the biggest exchanges at the time I would blast four orders out to the market from RBC and they would arrive in sequence first at bats because bats is located in Weehawken New Jersey right on the other side of the Lincoln Tunnel it's closest to Manhattan then direct edge in Secaucus then Nasdaq in Carteret and the New York Stock Exchange built a new I I heard I heard they spent close to a billion dollars building a data center in Mahwah New Jersey and one in Basel Dhin it would arrive there last it was 60 miles away from Nasdaq the difference in time is because some completely bananas but was 2 milliseconds between arriving at the first and the last exchange at the time I thought that was actually pretty fast it's 300 milliseconds to blink your eye 2 milliseconds to me seemed pretty fast except for the fact that one of the people I hire this guy by the name of Ronan Ryan had just come from building out high fruity trading infrastructure for some of the biggest high-frequency trading firms there were and he said I got bad news for you Brad I can get from one building bass to the next in 476 microseconds a microseconds is one millionth of a second he could actually get there four times faster than I could which meant that as my orders were going out to the market we would arrive at bats first Ronan's clients would pick up a signal and race us to direct edge Nasdaq in New York and they were doing two things one is they were canceling their sell orders now that they know a buyer has come in and bought everything all of the AMD shares at 291 on bats they're racing out to cancel any sell orders they have in the market but second they're also trying to buy shares ahead of me to sell back to me at a higher price and this is what was happening after rolling to explain this to me I said to him I said well can we get faster and he said well he's like we're the Royal Bank of Canada we will never be faster than anybody right so he so getting faster was not a solution there were things that his clients were doing that we would never do funny story is that also proximity where you're located in the data center so now that I've paid to be in the day center where you are in the data center matters and he said that next to one of the big stock exchanges toys-r-us actually owned a cabinet next to one of the big stock exchanges by accident they were there I think they're probably running their website or something like that from there and he said he was entered he was working on behalf of clients trying to pay toys-r-us and insane amounts of money and they finally gave in they finally sold their space and they wanted to leave toys-r-us as the identifier on the cage because they didn't want anyone to know who was in the cage proximity matters and they spent a ton of money on that he said we cannot be faster than them but the one thing we could do was get slower and at the time in 2009 this sounds crazy every big bank out there selling to their clients were the fastest were this were that we're microsecond we're nano second and we said you know we're going to get slower and what that means is slow down our fastest connections to try to get all orders to arrive at all exchanges as close to simultaneous as possible and in theory the way to think about this is send the order to New York Stock Exchange first send the order to batts last to arrive simultaneous and we actually were able to do that we got our arrival variance down to 290 microseconds it is not as easy as this diagram makes it look it was actually very very hard to do because latency changes at the beginning and end of the day there are more messages on the network because the open and the close latency fluctuates so this was actually something where we had to use messages in a real-time basis to calculate variances between exchanges but we got our variance down to 290 microseconds which meant I could now buy or sell everything I saw on my screen this was the easiest product in the world to sell I'd walk into any asset manager out there and I'd say you want to buy Bank of America you see two million shares in the offer how much of that do you get people would say anything from 500,000 to a million shares I said I'll get you all two million and they would say give me the product the product actually was it took RBC from 19 to number one in the Greenwich associates survey in one year it was a hundred million dollar product in less than 18 months the problem was is that clients couldn't just trade with RBC one one person one of my closest clients put it to me brilliantly he said Brad you solved 2% of my trading problem like what do you mean he goes 2% is the amount of trades that I can actually send to RBC like what about the other 98% of my trading issues so this actually got us thinking quite a bit you know we wanted to understand you know a lot of people villainize high-frequency trading I think again not every person that uses a computer to trade is harming the market if you're if you're arbitrage in an ETF against the 30 underlying stocks there's a computer does that there's nothing wrong with that if there's an ADR that's listed in London and trades New York there's nothing wrong with arbitrage Jean correlated products but there are some high frequency traders that are actually picking up signals and racing we call this latency arbitrage but high-frequency traders have no customers they're capitalists in many ways and you know again some slant on capitalism but they're looking at an inefficient system and they're saying how can I capitalize on that on the other hand how can someone pick up a signal at bats and race me to another exchange and get there in 476 microseconds and the answer to that is because stock exchanges themselves aren't exactly what you think stock exchanges are anymore a lot of people think about New York Stock Exchange and think about Wall Street and the big bell ringing on CNBC they think about Nasdaq and Times Square but in reality no trading happens in these buildings the irony of it is that the floor of the New York Stock Exchange the people on the floor have never been farther away from the actual point of sale because all those orders are beamed out to data warehouses in Mahwah New Jersey and Carteret New Jersey that's where all the trading happens so this idea about proximity on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on CNBC it's not relevant because all the trading happens in these data warehouses we started to ask ourselves questions you know back to Martin's introduction why does a stock exchange exist if you sit back and you ask yourself why is the greatest question in the world I've gotten I started IX because all I would just incessantly ask these questions to myself a stock exchange exists to help companies raise capital to ensure that those companies meet certain standards and to help that capital and that equity change hands between investors in a just and equitable way that's why a stock exchange exists except if you start to read articles to say well hold on a second wire exchanges creating complex order types 2009 the way I learned about high-frequency trading is a stock exchange called direct edge build something called a flash order which would give people a preview of an order before sending it onto another sock exchange essentially a free-look exchanges collectively in the United States pay three billion dollars Plus in what are called rebates this is like figuring out that the electricity company pays you to turn your lights on it was something that just completely baffled me when I learned it but they're paying people billions of dollars to trade which means they don't actually make money from trading anymore which is why they open data centers to sell people access to sell people technology to sell people cabling they've even gone as far to put microwave towers on the roof of the exchanges to beam orders back and forth faster because all of this really adds up to the 476 microseconds that Ronan needed to beat me it's being sold to him and his clients by the stock exchanges the stock exchanges were enabling the issue that I just explained to you among many other issues we only have a few minutes here so I can get too deep into them a stock exchange exists to help companies raise capital to help investors allocate that capital they do not exist to sell this stuff but why do they do it so first of all they sell fast data right if you want to learn about the changing of a price faster than someone else you have to pay for it if you think about it theoretically though there isn't anything technically wrong with someone getting data before someone else because there's no way to ensure that everyone gets it at the same time if I broadcast a signal from this stage everyone in this room will get at first maybe someone in the front row will actually get it technically before someone in the back definitely before someone in New York will get it or someone in San Francisco will get it there's no way to ensure everyone gets data at exactly the same time the problem is the person with advanced information how do they monetize the information they monetize it by trading against someone who doesn't yet have it that's why let's insider trading I'm a lawyer I work on a deal I find out that company XYZ is going to get bought out there's nothing illegal about me possessing that information there is something wrong with me running out into the market before it's announced and buying up stock of XYZ that's a problem and here what you have is you have people because you can ensure everyone gets information at the same time some people know something before someone else why do people pay hundreds of millions of dollars for the technology to be right next to stock exchanges because it gives them the ability to trade hundreds of times thousands of times before that same piece of information makes it to the last person let alone the fact that you're processing that many times with your eye and you're thinking about it I mean we're talking about microseconds here right so they sell technology to allow people to capitalize on the advanced information that they're selling them and what it's really what's really happened is it's led to the rise of what's called high-frequency trading August 24th when the market went haywire - see traders were greater than 50% of the volume they are every single day I mean back in 2012 in the fall of 2012 we had seriously volatile times and one of the big clearing firms the head of a clearing firm said 75% of all of our volume today was high-frequency trading so when the majority of volume in the markets is traded by people who do not care about fundamentals what does that fundamentally mean for the stock market it's a pretty scary thought right
