 ladies and gentlemen please welcome from Microsoft Azure mark rescinded itch morning everybody it's great to be here at ocp speaking about Microsoft and our open source journey now let me get a feel for Microsoft's perception not here in this audience how many people think of Microsoft as an open source company let's see a few hands well what I'm going to do this morning is try to convince the rest of you that Microsoft really is an open source company we embrace open source and participating in OCP is a key part of our open source journey in working with the open source community and driving innovation into the ecosystems in which we play with open source so I'm going to talk first a little bit about the ways that we view our interactions with open source and we when we sit back and take a look at all the ways we participate it really boils down to four different distinct categories the first one is enabling usage of open source with Microsoft technologies and speaking as the CTO of azure this is one of the places where we've really led the way largely at Microsoft with some of the ways that we help customers use their open source technologies of choice in our cloud for example when we launched infrastructure-as-a-service a few years ago in Azure the day we went out we released both linux and windows distributions or operating systems for customers to run so day one of either being able to host virtual machines Linux was there and more recently we've announced a partnership with red hat that brings Red Hat on to the Microsoft cloud with support from red hat and a great collaboration that spans not just a sure but a bunch of different areas including dotnet when it comes to enablement we go even further in Azure we allow people to bring puppet and chef for example agents on to the cloud and we work closely with those companies that are contributing code to that to make sure that their solutions work great a measure when we create our MapReduce as a service we know that Hadoop has largely become the de facto standard for MapReduce platforms and so we partnered with Hortonworks to build Hadoop as a service mapreduce as a service on top of azure so those are just some of the examples of enabling customers to use open source in Microsoft when it comes to integration what we mean there is us using open source ourselves to build solutions for our customers one great example there is our as your data lake analytics platform this is part of our big data platform that we announced and released last year as your data like analytics allows you to perform deep computation across very large dexa bite-size data sets and instead of building a brand new platform data platform computational data platform to support that what we did was use yarn underneath the hood and this is an example of us taking advantage of the innovation that's going on in the Big Data space on top of yarn to build a service that we believe is differentiated in unique for big data releasing open source there's been some very high-profile cases of us releasing open source and last few years one that I think stun the world was our release of dotnet core as open source and more recently we released Visual Studio code that's completely open source those are just a couple examples typescript is another example of us contributing code out into the world that is we developed internally at Microsoft including code like net core which a lot of people consider to be state of the art for garbage collected runtime systems and finally for contribution this is our participation in the open source community at large really this is what open source is about is contributing code to open source releasing code open source and when we release we expect the ecosystem to work with us to drive innovation into open source and the contributions we make here also are pretty broad for example docker we worked very closely with docker and just in the last few days John Howard a developer on the windows team became a top 10 contributor to the docker project with our work on that in the open source community I referred to HD insight and Hortonworks we're also a top contributor to the Hadoop project through our partnership with them so it's not just us taking open source and using and enabling it but actually contributing back which is really the spirit a true spirit of open source this work in open source so I've highlighted a lot of examples from Asher but Microsoft's work with open source goes back 10 years when we originally started contributing to open source and just this past week we've got some examples of us in our continuing acceleration of collaboration with the open source community with for example our announcement that we're taking sequel server to Linux and just a couple days ago we announced we joined the open eclipse foundation so these are steps that just a few years ago people would have probably considered unimaginable and I guessing by the lack of show of hands at the beginning of when I asked my question a lot of you might have also been highly skeptical we'd ever make moves like that but we're here at open compute platform summit and a couple of the steps that we've taken in the last few years involve open compute platform in 2014 we joined the open compute platform and shortly after we made our first big contribution there which was to take our server design open cloud server and contribute that to ocp and it was accepted OCP so open cloud server comes from us developing technologies internally learning and then sharing that out to the community again to help the whole ecosystem to help the ecosystem and also somewhat selfishly to help us because if the ecosystem is driving innovation into the platform we can come back and take advantage of it as well the learnings that we've got here I think are pretty unique we operate over a million servers data centers all over the world as yours footprint itself we operate in 22 regions we've got six coming online this year and of course we've got many more that we will be coming and OCS now when it comes to us deploying new servers in that data centers ninety percent of them are OCS servers and we continue to deliver back innovations that we come up with and take innovations from the ocp community as we evolve our server designs now I'm going to talk a switch gears a little bit and talk a little about this networking stack in particular if you take a look at the way network working looked five to ten years ago we have proprietary appliances that combined the management plan the control plane the data plane all in a tight bundle of software that you really couldn't split open and that made it a one solution kind of swallow for anybody that wanted to take advantage of networking technologies well as we started to build hyperscale clouds this kind of approach simply doesn't work for scale and reliability we had to do with split these things apart we had to take the management plane and create a REST API that could be accessed in a public way in a multi-tenant way for customers to on-demand request changes to the network topologies for their services and virtual machines that they were deploying we had to take the controller and also break that out and made it make it a distributed controller to get the kind of scale and throughput that powers a hyper skill public cloud and then finally the switches themselves and the host they had to become intelligent participants in the software-defined networking stack they had to take commands from the controller that were the result of the REST API is driving this topologies and driving those routes and firewall rules down into the switches and the hosts that were then effectively agents responsible for executing the will of the higher levels of the stack so once we split this out let's take a look at the host itself because this is a place where there's also opportunities to split into layers that give up the ability for scale and innovation across different vendors in different solutions and if we split that out now and magnify what the switch looks like this is what it looked like at the beginning of last year we're at the bottom of the network switch the a6 we had ocp hardware variety of different vendors each delivering their own value in the hardware OCP adopted open network linux as the bare metal linux distribution for powering switches and 0 ni for deploying firmware updates to the switches but what was missing at that point was a way to program those switches and a way to access the switch in a uniform way from above the controller for example so last year Microsoft contributed the switch abstraction interface sa I let me talk a little bit about what s AI is if you take a look at the switch the lower layers of the switch of course at the bottom you have a variety of different vendors and I've got some of them listed up here that participated with us on bringing si I to open compute platform barefoot broadcom Sentech a vm and mellanox and each one of those in the past spoke their own language until today they still largely do it they've got their own api's their own API it's for common things like quality of service and routing they also have their own custom api's their own proprietary api's that are value add for them but what that meant was that anybody wanting to deliver some value out on top of a switch or create a switch on top of these types of asics had to come up with unique ways to talk to each of them and the software stacks would be customized for these different asics and became that makes it very hard to reuse technologies and proven production software across these different vendors kind of limiting choice and the flexibility and the innovation at large that can happen when you've got a common plane and so that's where software abstraction interface comes in which is to create an abstraction abstracted API for all of the common functionality that you'll find in these switches so layers on top can talk one language to all these switches and then si I with plugins from each vendor then translate that language into the ones that are specific to their own a six and this has been really well received by the networking ecosystem and ocp participants to take advantage of this it's giving customers choice driving speed and agility we found it very useful in Microsoft in our hyperscale cloud to be able to take advantage of the innovations coming from these different partners in a very uniform and easy way now that we've got a common software plane to talk to them but what we're missing at this point still is then that software components that run on top of the software abstraction interface of the switch abstraction interface so when you have the switch the controllers are talking to them again using custom protocols and interfaces to do things that actually end up programming the asics and that still means that at some level if everybody is writing their own network software components that the api's they're exposing are all different and the software on top the SDN software on top has to be customized for each one again limiting people's speed of innovation and choice because they've become very glued to a particular interface it becomes hard to switch out and adopt something else that might have some innovation that you want to take advantage of so I'm really excited to announce today Microsoft's next contribution to ocp and that's something we called sonic software for open networking in the cloud moment this is clearly an acronym in search of some words that fit it unlike SI i which is clearly an acronym where nobody had any imagination on towards that would to fit it but sonic software for open networking in the cloud fills in that top-level box of the switch it's in production already today at Microsoft and we've worked closely with the partners that you see they're listed on the Left Arista broadcom dell and mellanox to bring this to ocp all of them are working closely with us on supporting the sonic network interfaces that create again just like si I an abstraction at the top level for the controller's to talk to so what is this sonic specifically it's a set of software components runs on top of a Linux distribution so that you add them on top of a base Linux distribution and those software components do all of the common things that switch software would typically do like store the routing tables in fact there's another example of us taking advantage of open source technologies for use inside of something that we're contributing we use reddish cash in sonic to store those routing tables it also implements l2 and l3 protocols it supports bgp programming so all of the things that are software-defined networking in our hyperscale cloud need to do are supported through interfaces provided by these software components link aggregation groups is another example so the bottom line what you we hope to get out of this contribution is just like for sa I of enabling flexibility and choice which in turn speeds innovation because you innovate in one place and it applies to all of the solutions while yet still giving vendors the ability to deliver their own value the same thing applies here the vendors can still deliver their own value on top of Sonic the common interfaces are all supported in uniform way so anybody wanting to talk to those for the bulk of the network processing takes advantage of the power of the open source ecosystem which is part of Microsoft's overall journey and why we're so excited to be part now of the open source world so this is yet another major step in Microsoft's open-source journey I can see it's been a busy week sequel on Linux the open eclipse foundation and now us contributing Sonic the next step to ocp with expectation that it'll be accepted by ocp if you want to see sonic in action or sa I in action I recommend that you come and visit the microsoft booth you'll also see our OCS v2 hardware which is also part of ocp obviously in action so you can take a look at that the sonic code is being released to github right now there's the github repo that you can go and download compilat contribute our contributing to it we hope again that we take advantage of the innovations that all of you can bring to the software technology that the rest of us can all take advantage of and then we also have a microsoft cloud exact track session at two-thirty on microsoft cloud innovations so you'll hear a little bit more about the way we're powering our hyperscale cloud and some of the innovations that we've got that are unique to microsoft and then finally if you'd like to know more about microsoft's open-source journey i recommend you visit microsoft com / openness where you can see a list of all the github repos that we've got our source code posted in all the ones where our developers are contributing source code to all the contributions we've made and the sources that we released the open source community so a deeper look at that time line that I showed you at the beginning so with that let me ask you again that question that I asked you at the very beginning how many of you view Microsoft is an open-source company now all right I've convinced at least a three or four of you which is so maybe we still have our work to do but we're in this for real so I'm convinced that all of you will become convinced that Microsoft truly is an open source can company that is active participant in the world of open-source innovation so with that I want to thank you very much and hope you have a great day here at ocp summit thank you
