 round towers a systems integrator we are really focused on cloud and automation software-defined networking network virtualization that's enabled by partners such as Cisco ACI and VMware NSX one thing that customers are very interested in is how can you help me protect my data how do I ensure that my security platform adapts to that so on that front checkpoint is a partner that we work closely with to help drive those types of solutions that integrate you know with the customers entire data center infrastructure there is one customer you know that comes to mind that chose to go with VMware NSX and checkpoint V set for their solution so the key security require requirements that the customer wonder to resolve in this project security at the edge was not good enough they wanted to leverage micro segmentation that NSX enabled they wanted to leverage the layer 4 through layer 7 advanced services that a solution should such as checkpoint be set could add on top of kind of the solid foundation that they had built with NSS right at the be neck level before data trends was transferred across the virtual wire they wanted to be able to inspect that data so they could apply things such as data loss prevention malware detection antivirus at that level the key benefits of checkpoint V SEC with nsx for this customer where basically it allowed them to go through and you know check each and every one of their requirements it was detecting or it was inspecting detecting and then proactively responding to any security threats that were identified and as part of that responding it was blocking the traffic that looked malicious so that was violating rules and then notifying the customers engineers so that they could then respond by investigating mitigating and then updating the rules
