 local company north power who along with multinational Schneider Electric have unveiled an australasian first this morning north power officially unveiled their 20-foot prefabricated portable data center the first of its kind in the asia-pacific region using the templates created with North power Schneider Electric have already been commissioned to construct a similar design in Australia both businesses are becoming increasingly renowned for their innovation with North power leading the way in New Zealand with the growth of the electric vehicle sector and ultra-fast broadband fiber network design and builds while also expanding its electricity network acoustic testing expertise in Australia meanwhile Schneider Electric continues to invest and develop connected technologies that manage energy and processes and a safer more reliable efficient and sustainable manner for their customers as a great day for both companies this is a pre-engineered true designed and pre-tested modular data center so North power North cloud our reseller and Schneider Electric built embraces and number 8 wire approach to designing this data center around the fact that it was constraint for room and also the need to bring it into I guess the 21st century really with data storage data security and cyber security been a big part of what we need today well actually it's huge it's part of what we do in terms of finding good partners and two in the technology space it's a plug-and-play kind of solution so although it was hugely technically challenging because it's the first in the asia-pacific region it's actually enabled us to set up something that's far superior than we could have replaced our data center internally in the building so it's fantastic it's been a long road we've been looking at upgrading our data center here for for a long time and just trying to find the room within the building was difficult so we hear this prefabricated container was ideal fit it met our requirements from an equipment perspective as in what is covered the the size of all the equipment was was really difficult to fit but this seemed to fit a clearly work so and we came in on budget and on time so that's just amazing for me
