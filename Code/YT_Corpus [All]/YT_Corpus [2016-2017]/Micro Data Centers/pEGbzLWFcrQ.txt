 what if you were told that we live in a world where we are not sole intelligence in existence a world where new life is developing in societies every corner a new life-form that could soon surpass that of our own they live amongst us hidden in the shadows the corners in the offices of society they go unnoticed by the common man people do not recognize them unless we choose to view the world from their perspective unless we choose to acknowledge them then is when we truly realize the importance the dependence that the human race has on the species allow me to tell you of the day my view of the world changed forever allow me to tell you of the day that I decided to look through the lens of a computer it all started when I was four years old the day that i received my very first computer at the time I had no idea what made a computer work the internals the hardware there are just abstract concepts to me only knew one thing it was a tool a device made by man that allowed me to educate myself that allow me to get work done it allowed me to get through my daily tasks but then curiosity struck into my life what exactly made a computer how was it able to communicate with the human race and so I decided to open I decided to truly uncover the reality that thrives within our very shadows and what I found was astonishing the human race did not just stumble across a computer by accident we did not just develop a microprocessor just by playing around with silicon we developed a computer because we modeled it after ourselves the biology of the human body is what drives a computer to process after all a computer has a central processing unit which processes the surroundings the input that the user provides in the interface very similar to what the human brain does in functionality a computer has random access memory we're sure serves as a short-term memory span just like a human being and then when those memories are faded into a distant but we can still recall them if necessary they're put on too long term storage or a hard drive a computer even has visual receptors just like our optic nerves through peripheral attachments and their graphics cards but this is the very basic components of a computer the hardware just one world of their new species but it was not until a few years later where I actually found the true world that drives a computer the world in which they have their own language a language that communicates with us and that allows us to communicate with them a computer used as in usual language called binary it's a universal language actually if we consider it to be one after all we human beings user nervous system and a nervous system scans the surrounding peripherals of our three-dimensional environment but let me talk to you about how a computer scans its peripherals a computer processes using just simple electrons electrons that are converted in micro processors to data but they only hold two pieces of information just true and false and if we compare that to the anatomy of the human body the nervous system that allows us to see feel understand we notice that in fact our brains use electrons we process our surroundings using electrons they carry only two pieces of information true and false so in reality the horizons of computer technology are unreachable as a matter of fact to tech companies Microsoft and IBM are pioneering the journey into artificial intelligence IBM producing Watson the computer the b2 world champion jeopardy contestants and Microsoft has project Oxford a computer that is able to analyze the three-dimensional world to be able to see what the humans see to be able to understand if something's on a table or someone is hurt or happy but where does this lead us we have computers virtually everywhere in our society everyone in this room has some form of communication whether it be a landline in their home a regular cell phone or smartphone they all use micro processors the diplomat that has to contact other countries uses a computer in order to send messages across the world the people of the world rely on the Internet the global servers to store all our knowledge but what if I was all removed what if one day we just woke up and nothing turned on the internet vanished our computers did not run our cell phones could not send a text where were the human race be now we have developed such an interdependence on computers these humble workers that aid us in every aspect of i D that we take it for granted because if we remove their aid in society that diplomat would not be able to send his letter to another world leader that worker would not be able to submit their work to the CEO of a company for their promotion that student would not be able to draft their next essay so we have developed such a reliance on these workers and in fact our world would not be able to run without them we look at our infrastructure that is completely run now on robotics car factories they run on robotic arms to construct the next cars which you will be driving we have the economy that runs on a server wall street that has all of the expenses and the transactions of businesses all computerized and digitize and then we have the entire world the economy the infrastructure and the social life of the human race they are all reliant on a computer so the next time that you go to access your files on a computer the next time that you go to work to turn on that computer and submit your file to the CEO or another manager of your company the next time that a student goes to a teacher and as if they can type up their work and submit it to the world so the entire world can view their information share it across all countries across all languages ask you to think of this understand the importance that these devices have that they're not just another tool that was made by man that they're not just another device something a case that holds just materials because there's so much more than that they're actually a person they have a personality the individual that program them put their entire knowledge their entire personality their entire expression into creating that operating system that runs your programs so I ask you this when you go home today or when you communicate with your children or with your parents when you send that text message please understand that these computers as a matter of fact or your humble workers they ask of nothing of you but we ask of everything for them so please recognize that the next time you push that power button you're not just pushing a device to turn on you're asking another worker to join you and wake up for another days of work thank you
