 hi my name is Martin wash mitt I've worked for GE Digital and I want to talk a few minutes about the platform for the industrial Internet of products that were building at the key digital facility in San Ramon across the bay and what I want to start with is actually showing you a chart can I get the chart so I've been I'm gonna start off by basically talking talking a little bit about how to position the platform that we're building I could tell you that prediction is an IOT platform but that wouldn't tell you much because there's so many of them there is variations on the theme of IOT platforms wherever you go you see them often being created as extensions to existing systems out there for example enterprise systems are often extended with with IOT extensions are Salesforce or commerce has an IOT play I'll tell you also see a lot of IOT platforms emerging in consumer space the things that basically were the things that you want to want to integrate in your house the thermos starts the the toothbrushes that you have and again those are often kind of implemented extensions to existing systems of engagement I think the really interesting action I'm a little biased here but really interesting actually an IOT space at the moment is at the industrial end of the spectrum where the things that you're basically dealing with in that IO IO T their industrial assets they're relatively complex machines the kind of machines that GE actually builds for example wind turbines or gas turbines or locomotives or MRI machines that basically look inside a patient and give you a 3d picture of what they have and I think the reason why much of the really interesting advanced action happens in this space the reason why you see the pure play IOT applications not extensions to existing systems but systems I really focus on assets and nothing but ask why they happen in that space is two reasons reason number one is the things out there that you find in the industrial space they have been instrumented for a while they're really well instrumented they're well connected they give you a ton of information even before I achieve other thing so you have a spectrum of really interesting machines out there they can tap into and extract your information and then the second thing is the applications that you can build in this space I'll give you immediate value if you can optimize the behavior of a wind farm or a fleet of wind farms out there there's immediate business value if you can optimize our the rail system in the northwest of there of the United States there's immediate business value so when we set out to basically build our two each platform for the industrial Internet one of the things that we made one of the decisions we made from her from an architectural perspective earlier on was we said going to build is entirely on open source we do not want to reemployment a bunch of things that we find out there so basically three three quick things on this chart that place it gives you the GE platform we're not sure thing number one is for standing on the shoulders of open-source Giants we're using a lot of technology that was innovated in the context of systems of engagement when it comes to big data analytics we're using Kafka and Cassandra and the like but also very importantly we pick cloud foundry as our cloud platform it's the environment that basically enables us to build and deploy at scale the kind of applications the service system micro services that make out the platform but more importantly it enables us to actually work with many many partners that we have so that they can add services to our our ecosystem the cloud service you see on top of on top of this chart so what we innovated in the platform is creating and building out those micro services on cloud foundry and the last comment I want to make on this chart is an interesting challenge that we're facing that either T platforms especially the ones in the industrial internet that they do not only live in a cloud what I'm showing in this picture here is that basically we have a variation on the hybrid theme that that built hearthstone but in this case hybrid is not kind of a private cloud in a data center on the enterprise connecting to a public cloud the hybrid here is actually a presence of the platform close to the devices we need basically put other applications beyond the boundaries of the cloud we refer to this edge of the clouds we pushed and basically out there into the environment we have analytics that operate on those industrial machines close to those machines we push them into the winter lights we push them out to the the wind farms we put them onto the local motors that drive around there so so one of the challenges we're facing is how come I'm basically push the concept of cloud computing outside of the data center into the real world and now we have a few interesting applications that are just going to catch on here with basic event life with this platform a few months ago here's here's a few really interesting applications that we built on top of that as part of the work that our team is doing when are only using Cloud Foundry were actually helping to extend it there's a few things that we found that a cloud platform that was meant to basically cater to transactional systems as it's lacking so our teams have been working on adding IOT extensions to cloud foundry to enable more event based communication and then as I said the big challenge that we're currently facing is how can we make use of the multi cloud capabilities that cloud foundry has we run our own data centers we also deploy our platform into public clouds but how can we take the next step how can we basically make it so that the cloud platform in a native way can actually get into the edge of the cloud into the gateways into the controller's closer to the sensors out there gives us basically that environment in which we can then deploy end-to-end applications from the point where where the wind turbine is out there in the field to the cloud tech and that once the analytics across it that's in a nutshell if you want to see a lot more about this we have a booth over there and the exhibition so please go and take a look at critics thank you [Applause]
