 good morning how's everybody doing my name is Kevin Myers I'm a network architect for IP architects this is probably about I think about our fourth month we've done so far and we were fortunate enough to have an opportunity to exhibit over in Europe so this is actually my second presentation of the year which is kind of nice because you know it's hard to wait a whole year to roll round for Mom so for this one I decided to do something a little bit different then I'd done earlier in the year I did actually a lot with BGP in Europe so I actually ended up changing to MPLS for whisps something because we got a lot of requests for with someone to do MPLS some wisps that don't do NPLs kind of wanted to know about it they want to know how do I get it in how do I deal with it or maybe you have it in and it's not working quite right so that's why we decided to do a presentation like this that kind of covers MPLS with a little bit of a wisp focus so but a lot of the concepts in here if you've got a hybrid lack if you're a telco if you're another service provider most of the things in here are also applicable to wireline networks as well so so let me tell you just a little bit about myself before we get started I live in the Jackson Mississippi which is where we have the Jackson office of IP Architects we've also got an office in Denver Colorado we have an office in Montreal and we're actually looking at opening an office here in Europe within the next six months because we have a lot of work there so really trying to be kind of a global provider for mikrotik for services and consulting my background is almost all IT and network architecture and engineering and spent about 18 years now doing Network engineering of various types most of the areas that I focus on our service provider whether it's wireline whisp datacenter do a lot of enterprise data center and e-commerce cloud data center build outs and things and then and then just network networking in general people that needs very specific network projects date data centers are really big wood now we get a lot more cloud data center than we ever have because that's something that's really an white box networking is something we've been doing a lot with and certifications gone through a whole number of mikrotik certifications and I'm really excited because they're actually adding some more now and got the IP certification that should be coming out and we've asked them about some others that they're considering so hopefully we'll see more mikrotik certifications in the future that we can look forward to working on and before we get the presentation I want to tell you just a little bit about my company IP architects we were the number one ranked micro tech consulting firm in North America and one of the top consulting firms in the world we do a lot I think the only content we haven't hit is Antarctica so if anybody knows somebody named arctica we'd love to knock off all seven continents and do something there we were the most successful mikrotik global integrator we build thousands of hours in micro tech engineering across six continents and our three offices in North America we were the first consulting firm to offer 24/7 mikrotik technical assistance so a lot of you guys come by and like why do you have a tic tac outside your booth and I told this story in Europe and there was like a line outside our booth afterwards but the story goes we came from the Cisco world and so when we entered the mikrotik world we kind of wanted to offer 24/7 support to the micro tech world like a Cisco TAC so we're like oh well why don't we build a mikrotik attack and we're like it kind of sounds like Tic Tac so that's kind of where the whole tic-tac thing came from and so it's just kind of a little thing that we do but that's that's a service that we offer and it's been very popular because a lot of people need a critical resource that can help them out and bail them out you know when they have issues that's 24/7 and can cross all the time zones at the globe so that's something we've been very successful with and certainly at scale everybody operates at a different scale you know some people operate at you know small medium scale some people operate at a large scale and one of the things that we do is we've been fortunate enough to work in some really large networks some large publicly traded companies and some really large environments so one of the things that we try to do is a lot of the lessons you learn in networking are the same whether you're working in a really large network or really small network so we try to take some of the lessons we've learned in networks that have tens of thousands of routers and switches and apply those to networks that have you know just a small number of devices because we find that a lot of the lessons we learn tend to to crossover and develop best practices for small and medium networks as well so our services we offer global professional services consulting all over the world fully managed network services so if you want just at you know a chassis or something managed and completely monitored and managed around-the-clock we do that we also have 24/7 support contracts by chassis so you can put a couple CCR's in your core on 24/7 tech support with us and have a four-hour SLA so that if you need that lifeline to bail yourself out of an outage you can call us if you've got that support contract we have support now in four languages we support an English French polish and Spanish and we're looking at adding you know potentially Russian and some other languages to our portfolio so we truly can't be a global support provider so let's let's talk about MPLS for a little bit you know first of all it's hard to try to distill MPLS down into just you know a thirty minute presentation or a 45 minute presentation so I'm gonna do my absolute best not to bore you and try to cover just a little bit about what MPLS is and then get to the parts where how it's relevant for you as a wisp so in the theory of MPLS and pilla started back roughly in the 90s it was originally designed to solve a performance problem for a Cisco before Cisco had Asics and all these things in their routers and their routers were CPU based they had a performance problem and so they thought MPLS could help them solve it's called tag switching back then and what tag switching did was it replaced your standard IP address and your your your 32-bit address with an MPLS label and so because they were dealing with less information the idea at the time was that if you had less information to deal with in the forwarding of your traffic you could actually make the network go faster and actually did have some sex success with that and now it's not really why it's used because a lot of the stuff in different vendors is ASIC based and so a new mikrotik I've never observed it to be any faster I know I've heard people say it should go faster in theory it should go faster but I don't know that I've observed any major CPU reduction as a result of that so what it really does is it helps you it gives you the tools to build some really elegant solutions to solve some very complex problems in your network and scale your network out even if you're a small provider so we're gonna talk a little bit of a theory of MPLS networking we're gonna talk about the design of MPLS networking we're gonna talk about some best practice designs and things that you should be putting into the design of your MPLS network if you don't have it in and one of the important things that often gets overlooked is we're gonna talk about the business justification for it because a lot of people in here are small business owners and that you know they want to turn a profit so it's very important Stan how does this help my business how does this technology help my bottom line and help earn money in revenue for the business and we're gonna talk a little bit about how MPLS can help you do that and in the building aspect of it if you guys want to get into deep dive technical we can certainly just hit me up with a booth and we'll get into like a real deep dive but I'm gonna kind of show you about four different scenarios of how you would deploy MPLS um reasons you would deploy them pay less and how that can help you and then if you want to get into some real deep dive certainly will be time for questions after this and then we can certainly go out and talk more in depth after the type of the presentation so here are probably the I would say the three main things that are the problem we're trying to solve with MPLS as it relates to a small and medium provider the first one is going to be isolation of traffic MPLS is probably the gold standard in networking for isolation of traffic if you haven't need to build separate routing tables if you haven't need to privately transport customers through your network but not let them see other parts of your network or if you have a need to connect to data centers whatever it is MPLS is going to be the protocol of choice to build that isolation because its ability to transport routing tables and exchange routing tables using bgp with MPLS is there really isn't anything else like it until you get into the Sdn world so certainly and if you have to deal with compliance if any of you have to deal with PCI compliance HIPAA compliance some other kind of standard a lot of the security standards that come out now require logical separation of networks and so MPLS is a tool that you can put in to do that if you have those those requirements around your network transporting other protocols over MPLS MPLS does a great job at this the one in the mikrotik world we tend to do most frequently is putting Ethernet inside of Ethernet with VPLS but if you branch out you can actually put things like ATM into MPLS you can put tyonne's into MPLS so there's you know if you have a nebulous backbone of mikrotik you can attach other devices to it and transport other types of protocols over it if you need to and that's actually something that's still really popular because there's still a fair amount of ATM and t1 infrastructure at least here in the United States and if you have a need to do away with a legacy circuit and transport that over an IP backbone then using MPLS makes a lot of sense and then reducing complexity and increasing flexibility I can't count the number of times people come to us and say well you know I've got my network and I've got this customer that is gonna bring me a lot of revenue and they want to do this thing where they want me to connect their locations and they want internet and they want you know all these different things and I have no idea how I'm gonna connect those guys together and so MPLS is almost always the answer to that because it's like a Swiss Army knife of protocols it allows you to take these things that you need to isolate and transport through your network and solve all these different problems in a much more elegant way than doing policy routing and just trying to build isolated routing tables inside your network it kind of glues everything together into a cohesive solution so let's talk about what it is in a protocol level essentially you're often going to hear MPLS referred to as layered two-and-a-half people talk about it as a shim header you know if you get around a lot of the network peaks in IETF there's there's a whole fair argument around what MPLS actually is but it's probably accurate to call it layer two and a half because if you look at the frame header in Ethernet it sits right between layer 2 and layer 3 in the IP packet you've got your 32 bits that makes up of the label value which is 20 bits your experimental bits which is your quality of service so when you get into quality service Limulus you have to map whether you if you're coming out of dscp you have to map into the experimental bits and that's something that especially in the mikrotik world which is a little bit different than other network vendors with MPLS once you've put something into the MPLS network actually actioning on it and QoS in the middle of the network as far as I know in version 6 it's currently not possible so you'd have to have a layer 3 switch or something else to action on QoS in the middle of the network you have to deal with it at the ingress at the edge of the network so that's something that is unique about MPLS in that respect when you put it on and pls in micro tech and then the the s bit is the bottom of label stacks when you get to the last label on the stack the the s bit can be turned on or off that's why it's there and then just like an IP packet it's got a TTL so that you don't have MPLS packets circling the network forever so the one of the things that drives MPLS and makes it work is label distribution protocol now there are ways to distribute labels without label distribution protocol you can do static labels which you know you know other than doing it in a lab exercise you do it in the MTC I and II it's really not practical to do anywhere else it's it's useful to kind of understand how it's done but with the advent of LDP which is the protocol that acts as the distribution of label protocol there's really no reason to use anything else unless you get into traffic engineering which which can exchange labels without LDP so it's certainly something you can use if you need that it's kind of like a routing protocol it's not quite a routing protocol it kind of acts as the control plane for MPLS and it allows the label exchange that MPLS can build its forwarding table and it relies on an IGP so in mikrotik your only real choice is OSPF I think technically rip works in mikrotik with with MPLS but I have no idea why you would want to build a an MPLS Network over rip so OSPF tends to be the protocol of choice when you're building a LTP and MPLS network with Microtech if you get into integrating mikrotik with other network vendors you might run into using is is or ERP which are also valid iGPS to build an MPLS network so let's talk about the forwarding a little bit of routing v versus MPLS fib so when you get down to the guts of actually getting a packet in and out of a router you're really in something called the fib the forwarding information base and this is pretty common across any router you touch whether it's cisco juniper mikrotik everybody has a fib that the routing table gets pushed down into and it's the actual determining of which interface does this go in and this go out based on my routing table and that's what the fib is so this is just the routing fib this isn't the MPLS fib this is you have your route cache the information is drawn from the routing table and then it gets pushed down at the forwarding information base is where you actually push your traffic out and I actually asked I asked Mycah gee I don't know that the graphic exists for the MPLS fib there is an MPLS pippin mikrotik but I don't know that graphic exists so I had to pull a more generic one so this may not be the exact flow but it will kind of give you an idea of how this works when you're converting to MPI essentially you have your IGP up here which is OSPF where you learn all of your routes and I don't know some of you if you stopped by our table we have the little world smallest MPLS network that we've built and set up that's a great topology to illustrate like how an MPLS Network works with OSPF and the role of OSPF and if that's something that you want to understand better come by the booth and I can kind of show you where OSPF fits in where BGP fits in and where MPLS fits in on a topology that you can kind of touch and look at because it can be confusing if you've never done MPLS before what routes going to SPF what routes go into BGP and then how MPLS glues this all together so OSPF is going to feed information into the IP forwarding table and then BGP is going to use its routes which are what we call traffic routes so traffic routes or anything that are your customers your hosts anything that is an end station that you want to route whether it's a server or a subscriber OSPF only manages loop backs and transit subnets so and we'll get into that in just a second all that information gets dumped into LDP I think he takes the connectivity information from OSPF builds an LDP database and then builds a label fib and that's what eventually it becomes the forwarding information base of MPLS here are the basic components of an MPLS network this terminology if you go talk to any provider pretty much in the world whether you're talking to here in the US like AT&T or Verizon or those guys everybody uses this terminology to describe their networks so you have those are actually key routers in the middle this graphic is wrong the the middle router is a p4 provider all it does is label switch traffic that's it's only job is a high capacity router to take in traffic and label switch traffic and we have an example of that in the those small MPLS demo that we have out there at the booth then you have your PE routers which sit outside of the P Network which are your provider edge routers these are the routers that are the demarcation of your network they face your customer that doesn't mean they physically have to be located but your customer is it just means from a logical standpoint they face your customer and then at the outer edges of the network you have the CEO outers which is the customer edge router and that can truly be a router that your customer brings and peers into your network and takes routes from your network or it can be a router that you provide and you manage it you know it doesn't matter a lot of if you have small companies that don't understand networking and routing that's a business opportunity for you to own that CEO outer and even though you may sell it to the business and they may lease it and maybe theirs but you manage it and that's a way that you can add value to your company by by doing a customer management solution like that but you still keep it isolated from your provider network so that's a great opportunity to get some revenue so provider edge router we've already talked about this it's also known as an ingress egress label switch router it's a router that is between one service provider area and another area that's administered by other network provider that's how wikipedia defines that it just means that your area of control is your provider network and the provider edge is where you demarcate between you and the customer P router is almost always what you would call a core router it's something that doesn't face or touch the customer at all it takes in all the PE routers and routes and switches them inside of a court and then the customer edge router again is on the customer prem and this is typically when you get into brf's which you're going to talk about which is the isolator routing tables that so many people are using MPLS for it's called routing mark it's actually called routing mark and for inside of mikrotik so it gets a little bit confusing because you have both terminologies that essentially amount to the same thing and that's where you would deploy that in your customer edge router if you want to have a separate adverse inside your network for that customer pushing that out to the customer edge network and the PE network is where you would have that so let's talk about some of the guts of MPLS so this is I put this slide first because in in the several years that we've been doing this as consulting network architects for ISPs and for wisps this is the single biggest problem that we see when people are trying to deploy MPLS as none of the MTU czar right and it actually goes beyond just making sure that you've set your MTU is right it is very important to actually audit using pings and other troubleshooting mechanisms how much MTU a device will actually pass especially on the point in the world of point-to-point radios and commercial RF there's a number of times where we've seen devices of all different manufacturers where you'll send a packet in and it'll be set for jumbo and it may be set for 9000 you think I'm all good it's set and when you actually audit it with a ping you find out that it's not actually passing there's a bug or there's some other issue and it's not actually passing that size of a frame and that's probably the most common thing we trouble shoot where people say oh my my MPLS networks crashing and I've got bugs and nothing's working right I'd say nine times out of ten it always distills down to either an MTU is set incorrectly or an MTU is set correctly but it's actually not honoring the MTU size that needs to go through that transport segment so before you ever think about putting MPLS in your network you really kind of need a full audit of all your MTU capabilities and if you can't meet 15:30 which really if you're gonna do MPLS I've listed what you have for MPLS basic which is 1508 which adds your ads what you need to get into MPLS labels you're all three MTU being 1500 for a standard non MPLS layer three segments and then your l2 MTU needs to be 15 22 if you're gonna do MPLS there's very little reason to go with the basics because you're gonna shortchange yourself at the services that you can deploy like VPLS you could do untagged VPLS those empty requirements are 1526 for the layer 2 1500 for layer 3 and then 15 26 for the MPLS MTU but typically most people who want to deploy be pls wanted to play it tagged and most of the gear that's coming out now can support at least 15 and 30 so the gold standard is really 15 30 or higher if you if you want to set higher you can but typically 15 30 is sufficient since a lot of you know ISPs are trying to transport 1500 byte Internet segments there's usually not as much of a reason to go above 1500 unless you know you're gonna have heavy transport privately in your network so you may have a section of your network that goes jumbo frame and then go back to 1500 the edge and it just kind of depends on what your traffic flows look like in your network so and mikrotik will put this out this is the slide that you absolutely have to know by heart this is the thing that when you put this in if you don't have it set like this all throughout your network you're gonna have issues so let's talk about getting your wrist ready to support MPLS CPU I can't say enough about making sure that you upgrade your routers your tower router routers that you have in data centers kolos to keep your CPU as low as possible the happiest MPLS networks when you're deploying micro tech gear are networks that see very little CPU usage as load as low as you can keep it so as much budget as you have to bump up your routers absolutely put it in because it will it will pay you back a hundred times over by keeping those CPUs low and this is something that's kind of an important distinction between the way micro tech does MPLS and the way just about every other network vendor does MPLS if you get into the world of dealing with like Cisco or juniper or brocade it's all Asics witched so you have an application-specific integrated circuit that will send that traffic at wire speed so the CPU is really only there for the control plane of the network and it's all ASIC wire speed in the mikrotik world we have things like fast path coming in so you have some of these things that are intended to optimize the flow of traffic but it still all has to go through a cpus the way you have to think about designing your network for MPLS but mikrotik is just slightly different than the way you would approach it with a different network vendor so CPU is critical to make sure that you have a very happy network and then memory yeah memory is one of those things where you want to have as much as possible so that if if by some chance you need to dump a full table somewhere or you need to do something else that's gonna require a large memory maybe you want to do some caching or something you know it never hurts to bump up the memory if you're gonna have to go get a bigger router because someday you're gonna use it you may not use it right now but someday you're gonna need it and it's a whole lot easier to have it on tap than it is to go forklift something out of the quarry or network or in the distribution of your network and put it back in and quality service we talked a little bit about the experimental field you've got to really understand the way dscp translates into the experimental bits if you want to have a properly built QoS network now you can get away with building QoS without dealing with DHCP and the queuing an architecture that mikrotik has but if you want to expand your network and you're going to integrate other vendors into your network then you absolutely have to have a dscp QoS mechanism to be able to deal with other network equipment because that's the gold standard in networking for QoS and then when you deal with experimental bits which are different because those are part of the MPLS label not the IP header you've got to do a mapping dscp to experimental bits so and that's a very critical thing to get right so that you have a well-tuned service provider network the only other thing I'm gonna say on QoS is the highest priority of QoS in your network should not be video it should not be voice it should not be any of the other real-time protocols network management should always be your highest priority and quality of service because if OSPF can't form an adjacency if bgp can't peer out but there's not enough bandwidth for all of your control protocols then none of your other traffic matters so network management always gets highest priority and q of s so MTU we've kind of beat em to you to death so I'll leave it on to you alone but certainly the slide will be there for you to review so using BGP and OSPF to support MPLS this is an example of the network that we have out there you can physically go look at and this is kind of illustrates the differences between BGP and OSPF and the roles that they play so one of the things we see with a lot of wisps where they're growing and you know everybody kind of starts out the same way it's an organic thing you get built on a shoestring budget and then you get a little more and you try to add some more capacity and you know trying to wrap your head around some of these complex things is tough like OSPF so usually we get a lot of OSPF networks that will get up to several thousand subscribers and then they'll start to have issues because OSPF convergence will continue to start going down and down and if you add redistribution you'll see the performance go down even further as you scale and to maybe close to 10,000 users and things like that something because OSPF its main job as a topology protocol it's designed to map the physical topology of a network and understand paths it's really not designed to load with thousands and thousands of routes that's what really what BGP excels at so the way to have the best of both worlds is to put all of your transit subnets that you have here in green into OSPF and then your loop backs as well those are actually blue but they should be in green to put into OSPF and in some cases you'll have multiple loop acts that you will advertise in bgp but the loop backs you peer on those will all be in OSPF and then only those subnets and the clouds that are in blue that are what we call our traffic subnets where the your subscriber lives those are the subnets you hand out maybe they're public maybe they're private those are the ones that go into bgp those are the ones that are gonna scale those are all the routes that you're gonna have they're gonna get into the thousands and then that putting that in BGP gives you the ability to scale I mean the global tables 560,000 routes now so you have an immense scalability capacity by putting that into BGP and the other big advantage is you have policy control now so you know I would say raise if you've ever built your wisp into a ring raise your hand if you have some kind of a ring in your wisp so most of us what we dealt with have some kind of a ring and they get to a point where they start messing with OSPF costs to try to get traffic from one way to the other once you bring BGP into the picture you don't have to sit there and mess around with cost as much you can just write a policy to say if you're in this subnet I want you to go this path and if you're in this sub that once you go this path and you can kind of start to load balance your traffic so one of the other tools MPLS brings is traffic engineering so if you combine MPLS traffic engineering and BGP you can pretty much dictate any subnet in your network wherever you want it to go you can make it take any path that you want to and not be bound by the rules of cost and OSPF so from that aspect it's great to really use all the available backhauls and point to points that you have in your network so when you do have pls do it carefully get yourself a lab get yourself some test equipment and start playing with it and try to understand what it's about and how you put it in is the first thing that you want to do when you get ready to the point where you want to put it into your network pick a low priority segment I always tell wisps that the next tower that you've got in line if you got a tower that you're that you're not quite ready to put in production but you've got this stuff make that your first MPLS segment rather than trying to retrofit the whole network get yourself some MPLS gear that you're ready of the core and put that next tower onto MPLS get it all tested and working before you put the first subscriber on it and then you'll have an MPLS ready segment to put new customers on to and once you kind of understand the mechanics of it you can start to retrofit your other towers and that's a migration strategy you can use to not have to try to bite off every part of the Apple at once you can kind of do it a piece at a time and again back to the CPU thing don't be afraid to use new hardware even to the point we have wisp it's a combination of a wisp hybrid ice P that's fiber up in the Northwest and we actually made the decision to put new routers at all the sites rather than convert the existing routers because converting the existing routers was going to take about ten times longer so the cost in time to convert all the existing routers was actually way worse than just buying new routers and putting brand new routers in in parallel and doing cuts over to the new path so don't be afraid to bring some new hardware online and just do a quick cut over rather than trying to reprogram something that's that's there because sometimes that can be a faster way to get going so let's talk about the business case for MPLS so one of the things that you'll find if if you're struggling to compete with the 80s and the Verizon's and the Comcast's of the world especially to your business customers anyone offer this out to your business customers and this is something I did some googling just pulled out some average MPLS circuit costs versus a raw internet cost so if you've got a business that needs a synchronous pipe let's say in each five by five for internet maybe you charge $200 for that and this varies all over the country so this is a general example if you take that same circuit and sell them an MPLS circuit where you're gonna manage routing for them connect their business together or maybe you do some managed router services whatever it is on average you're gonna be almost caught charged almost four times more for that MPLS circuit because you're providing a premium service you're gonna put quality of service on it you're gonna guarantee that their traffic gets there better than best effort internet so even if they end up buying internet from you that you put out of the data center you're still giving them a more premium service and you can charge more for that and not everybody is gonna want to is want to take that but there are businesses that are gonna see the value in having priority access and want to get into something like this or they're gonna want you to manage the routing for them and that's a way that you can take the exact same shot that you're gonna do to that customer and make more money on that so and that's something that we've been doing with a lot of a lot of the larger risks that we do consulting for and it's been very popular they actually a finding that they can compete with the larger carriers by offering some of the same services that the larger Tier one carriers have so the other reasons in the business case are lowering the OP X costs by increasing agility MPLS gives you the ability to roll out just about anything you can think of if you need some kind of a service at the edge of your network or to cross two edges of your network and you can do it in a fairly template and repeatable way you're not having to do all these one-off type configs to try to bring things through the network you can throw an MPLS endpoint router out on one end of your network and throw an MPLS endpoint out on the other end of the network and you can do you do a layer two VLAN all the way across if you want to with VPLS you can do an l3 VPN where you build a verse through it you can even provision multiple services off the same router you may provision VPLS tunnel for private transit then you made provision i/o to VPLS tunnel for bgp peering up back up to your head end and become a bgp peering transit provider for an enterprise customer or somebody that needs it so there's a whole bunch of things you can do and it's just like the Swiss Army knife that you just you pull that blade out when you need it but it's a very you know organized way of doing it so it's going to lower your operational cost by by not having to do one-off things building private customer networks outside your service area you can actually extend your service area by leveraging a number of different tools we have a lot of ISPs that are actually extending their service area by either buying Internet connections and doing VPNs or maybe they buy dark fiber or layer to transit and so a lot of times we have customers say well I've got this customer and they've got like five locations in my service area and but they've got two locations that are not my service area so I can't serve them so why not they said well they're out to my service here I said we'll go by transit and sell them a solution stop selling circuits and sell them a whole solution an MPLS allows you to do that if you buy the transit that you need and this is what all the tier ones do in the enterprises we work with I'd say there is no Tier one that we work with for large enterprises that serves a hundred percent of the circuits themselves I'd say at least thirty percent of the circuits for the big publicly traded companies are fulfilled by another carrier because they just don't have a last mile everywhere so they'll just go by if it's Verizon providing MPLS they'll go by the last mile they need from level three or AT&T or cogent or whoever owns it but they'll put their name on it brand it manage it and sell it as their own and so one of the things we've encouraged a lot of wisps and and and smaller ice peas to do is do the very same thing sell them a whole solution instead of selling them just the links that you have in your service area and your revenue is going to go way up and in that way you can think and act and be like a big carrier to your business customers and then resell your network you know there's areas that you reach that nobody else reaches you know the game of carrier is when you get into the tier ones and tier twos all they do is resell services to each other and paths and fibre all day long so don't be afraid to reach out to other carriers and say if you need transit in my area I will sell you transit they may say no but there's a chance that they could say yes because if they know that you're willing to sell transit and you have the ability to peer with them in a way that they understand whether it's an MPLS exchange or something else then you know they may say yeah I've got this customer I have no other way to get to and we want to solve this service so we'll pay you that $2,000 a month transit cost and transporting legacy technologies we talked about ATM frame relay PPP t1 you may have somebody that has a need to transport a legacy technology and you may be the only person that's able to do that but if somebody doesn't know that you have the ability to do those services if you're not interacting with other carriers and cultivating those relationships then you're not going to get approached to do those things so that's a really important part of it as well so we've got for use cases and I promise we're getting almost at the end here that we're going to go over that kind of illustrate where you want to use MPLS in wisp so the first one is pppoe aggregation with MPLS if you do pppoe network whether you're a DSL shop or the euro with us but if you do pppoe then this is a really popular model because pppoe requires a continuous layer to broadcast domain to get all the way back to the beer as where you're gonna terminate your traffic so this is actually a model that the telco networks came up with a while ago this was really start to get really popular in the middle 2000s with telcos where they would use VPLS and MPLS to backhaul VLANs over fiber networks in DSL that works back to like a common CEO or data center to aggregate all their pppoe and so with a wisp you can do the very same thing and build VPLS VLAN tunnels back to a common point and then have a beer as whether it's maybe a 1036 a 1070 - you may spin up a VM and do it you VM and that kind of software but you can use layer two tunnels to isolate the sections of your network and the regions of your network and bring all that pppoe traffic back to a common VRS so you know that's something that you can really use and that model works really well when I was the telco engineer before I became a consulting engineer we had about 25,000 subscribers in the DSL Network and we we back called about I think about 900 VLANs back to different be arouses so it's something that can scale a lot it can go way up there and it works pretty well so BGP peering with a full table some of you may have come across this yet some of you may not but when you when you get to a size especially when you get your own a s and your own up streams typically when you start to get into several thousand subscribers a lot of wisps are gonna have customers that say I've got coach an upstream I've got a teensy upstream but you know you guys are in my service area and you guys have got wireless so you're not I'm not dependent on like a physical fibre cut and I would love to do appearing with you guys over RF so that you know I've got redundancy in my a s so can you guys send me a full table and if you don't have MPLS in your network you can do it but it's a lot harder to build that into your infrastructure because you would have to carry likely a full table through your network unless you build you could do a neo IP taller or something like that but that's scaling that we get difficult with VPLS you don't have to bring a full BGP table through your network you can only bring the BGP table into your edge routers and then bring it down into you know say a route reflector on a VM that's in your data center that's designed just to serve your customers and then you can use VPLS to transit that public / 30 all the way to the customer so if it's 10 routers after the customer you put an edge router out there as a VPLS endpoint build your VPLS tunnel back to your core and then you stretch a public slash 30 and do a BGP peering with them and then hand them off a full table and you've not killed your entire core by trying to bring a full table through it which is a mistake we see quite often in in the wisp world where you know there's a thought you have to bring the full table through the network and the performance is just you know it's horrible it really slows down the network so you really want to keep those full tables up at your edge routers and then advertise summaries or May some specific routes along with defaults to migrate through traffic around until you get into MPLS traffic engineering and then private all through transit this is what people call the MPLS cloud so a lot of busy here of like Verizon Business AT&T business level threes got this they will go into an enterprise and say we've got two hundred branches across the United States and we want them all to go into an MPLS cloud and we want you guys to manage the routing and we're just going to connect our routers to this cloud you can do the very same thing with an l-3 VPN in mikrotik by essentially building that private slice of the network through your MPLS network and connect customer site one to customer site two and use private routing and not have it overlap and that's a really common deployment scenario and that's something you can charge a lot of money for if you have a business that once that or needs that that's a service that you really can capture a lot of revenue on and then private all to transit you may have two sites that just they may want something as simple as they just want to be on the lanes same land segment and share printers and services and maybe a Microsoft network when you get into some of the heavier stuff you may want to connect data centers it's incredibly common for data centers to need layer two transit and so if you know where those are and can be one of those providers to connect data centers together whether it's you know a large Colo datacenter maybe it's an enterprise data center they're constantly asking for layer to transit between data centers and they can't build enough capacity to serve all the data centers that are being spun up so that is and any other layer to services that you need to sell between two points that's a huge way to increase your revenue share is selling those kinds of services so now I want to go ahead and open up the floor for any specific questions that you may have doing code questions questions okay all right well thank you very much appreciate it yeah thank you Kevin
