 hey guys I'm then today I'm going to be demoing my home automation system home automation systems can be kind of tricky to demo because if they're done right they should be pretty subtle unless I did it so my home automation system is based on home assistant home assistant is an awesome open source of automation platform that runs on a lot of different devices I run mine on a Raspberry Pi but you could run yours on any number of systems home assistant is great because it connects all the different devices in my apartment most of which are Wi-Fi but a couple of them are RF besides automating things home assistant has a great user interface that lets me manually control a lot of the devices in my apartment lights lights lights more lights cool lights unnecessary lights more unnecessary lights lights things more fans my computer my TV lines more blinds and more blinds besides having devices I can control with home assistant I have a few that pass information into home assistant like cameras and sensor nodes having these devices is awesome because it lets me track things in my apartment like light sound temperature humidity and motion it's particularly useful for designing automations based on these things such as alarm systems and motion activated lights my phone also passes information into home assistant it shares its battery life its location and navigation information this lets me automate things based on where I am where I'm going and what time I'm going to be there I don't have every switch in my apartment automated really isn't any need generally just having a few devices here and there can give you the desired effect plus I live in an apartment so I can't change anything wiring hashtag apartment life but the true power of home automation comes from you guess it automations I have a bunch of different ones that run at different times and do different things one of my favorite automations is one that turns off the lights when I start playing a TV show or a movie one of my favorite things about this is you can design scenes to keep some lights on and some lights off so you're not totally in the dark and then when you're done watching the TV show or the movie if the lights come back on it's pretty handy almost this and also keeps track of who's home or away it can turn on or turn off devices accordingly it also arms an alarm system if nobody's here and because it can send notifications to my phone lets us know if anything's going wrong this is what it does when nobody's home and this is what it does when we get home in speaking of alarm systems this is what our system does if it goes off and nobody's home as soon as it detects motion it turns on my lights red in a blink step it also sends me a notification to my phone and lets me know something's wrong my home automation system office attracts when you're sleeping and condemn the lights and turn off devices accordingly warning no alarm said if whatever reason you wake up before sunrise it'll turn some lights on for you too one of my favorite features is that a home automation system will turn on the lights for you if you get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom or get a drink it turns lights on red so it protects your night vision but still lets you see these lights are on a timer so as soon as it doesn't detect motion it'll turn off my home automation system also turns off my fan it opens the blinds when I wake up it also closes the blinds and turns on the lights on the sunsets and when the Sun rises in the morning it will open the blinds a noble ModNation system is complete without a party button come at you straight from my childhood dreams in the year 2000 this pretty lame right this is like a fifteen dollar button I built that really only has one purpose it lets me show off my own automation system to my friends when I come over if I had any the best part about this button though is that anybody can press it but you have to have this key to stop it it has two toggles on it that let me trigger four different scenes so it's actually more useful than you might think party time sexy damn prayer time and an emergency stop button in case the home automation system goes crazy so that's basically it like most some automation projects it's always a work in progress I plan on adding an Amazon echo and probably a few more sensor nodes in the coming weeks let me know in the comments below if you have any questions or if there's any videos you'd like me to make and if you could thumbs up & subscribe that'd be great whatever my sign-off will be Cheers thumbs up it's kind of dorky I think I just say cheers Cheers
