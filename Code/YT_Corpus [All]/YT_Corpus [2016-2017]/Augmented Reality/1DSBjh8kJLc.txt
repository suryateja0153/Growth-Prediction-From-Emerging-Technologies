 welcome to coffee with a Googler today I'm going to be chatting with Jared fender who's a software engineer on the tangle platform and if you're not familiar with it it's all about augmented reality and we're going to be really geeking out over the amazing things that you can do with AR and tango come check it out so Jared you're a software engineer on the tango platform here at Google and yeah I keep hearing about tango and seeing cool demos and I know it's got something to do with augmented reality and could you clarify it for us what is tango so tango is where we're adding some extra technology to standard Android smartphones like this one this is Lenovo's phone coming out later this year ok and we're allowing it to basically have this 3d understanding of the world so that you can place virtual objects that like feel like they're part of the real world ok now what kind of technology wedding to the phone it must be hardware as well as software right right so on the hardware you have this extra low fisheye lens ok no depth camera and so combined it's like kind of how humans work to understand the world in 3d it gets to know like where it is and it knows the shape of the world around it ok so that the depth camera is that like what the sensors on video games used to be like where they bounce an infrared or four walls and map the environment around you yeah yeah yeah it sends out infrared light to figure out how far away everything is and then the fisheye camera works all visually to figure out how far you've moved in where you are in the world and so together when you combine these you can play something on the table and as you move around know how far you've moved around the table so it all renders and looks ok it's just part of the real world ok and now there's a software element to this as well the tango and I assume some kind of tango SDK what's all that right so our tango SDK that that allows you to basically plug into the existing technology on tango phones and so you can add that to any existing app it basically we have a lot of people are writing you know 3d apps for the first time or they have an existing three-act they want to port to tango and so we integrate with like popular through the engines like unity unreal okay oh cool so like if I have assets already in something like unity then I can reuse them in my tango app I don't need to have yet another 3d modeling format yeah it's really simple you just take our SDK bring it into your existing project and then you would position the camera based on what our SDK has and then it's like how far you want to roll with it right do you want to start having a special interaction where you place things on tables you place things on the floor right where you add these extra 3d objects that are you know virtual but they seem real all to the existing world that's pretty cool so that's a kind of useful if not just for gaming but like architects surveying you know for if you're buying a new house you can visualize what it would look like with furniture that type of thing yeah exactly we see this kind of being useful in terms of games of course and I'm a big gamer but also for education and utility one big thing I've seen that I didn't really realize is like how big dinosaurs are until I walked around one with a tango device oh wow cool how big are they it depends on the Dinosaur their tails are so spectacularly long though like a dinosaur that's like this tall would be like no super long tail since would like to balance right that's I assume so I haven't been with one so like they know that scene in jurassic park when it comes down and takes the guy out of the back that hasn't happened to me you don't want that to happen in AR yeah it could be a little scary you have any damage agencies so like one thing that we've been working on this is something we wrote internally is this measuring tool so it just figures out where different points are in the 3d world well you know where they are you can measure like how big this tables how big do you think it is a big about four feet three and a half feet I don't know I'm not very good at measuring things it's like one hand to hand three that's right so let me actually start up this app here okay and so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna place a point right here on at the end of my table you kind of place a point here that type of thing yeah it's actually right here okay so now I'll place a point over at the far end and how big did you say it was mm maybe three and a half four feet yeah so it says here you can see three feet 10 inches own I say so oh I see there's a line 9.23 test and there should be a line from like the right around here to way over there very cool I like it nice so that's one thing we see that's really cool what it's doing here is it's adding virtual objects to the world so there you notice that there was one right around here there's one down there and they like as you move the device around they lined up so there's even though they were fully virtual they look like they are part of the real right and it was interesting how it was able to calibrate the length in the real world I'll measure the length without any kind of calibration right that was just because as I moved it around it knew how it move re and moved like another thing you can do that is you can add virtual objects to the world so that you can know like if we want to add an extra chair here well yeah it's a little uncomfortable here so something I can put my feet up on ya do we have room for it it's kind of the question so let's place this a bar stool right here and it's filled up and so now I'm going to position it just right on the floor and so you can see we've got a little virtual bar stool right here here you can see exactly moving around as you drag yeah and as you gave the phone to me it stayed in position right that's pretty cool second I put my feet up on it I'd like nice so to get a model like that one all you had to do was like you're using something like unity the Unity engine right so this was written in unity because it turns out writing the 3d engines a lot of work and so lots of people like to use existing through the engines so that they don't need to become experts in 3d rendering right so now building something like this and you work on the actual platform and I believe you work on like integrating things like unity into the platform yeah yeah I'm sure you saw lots of interesting demos and probably slots of interesting things went wrong along the way like yeah kind of what's what's the funniest bug you've ever encountered so the best time is that like this is very intensive processing and so it turns out that a thing you don't think about I think with phones normally I normally really don't think about it except for when I'm in developer mode is how the phone generates a lot of heat okay and so some bugs only come up when the phone gets really hot and not when it's really cold those are a particular class a bug that's kind of like when you have multi-threading bugs that you end up having to spend a lot of time on and so I had one bug that was like that and I was trying to identify that yes this was only happening when the device is hot okay so we have ways to simulate the device being hot but we don't have a way to simulate the device being cold okay so I just take my device and I put in the fridge okay to the water it's i was worried i had to walk away for five minutes while actually cooled down yeah i was really worried someone's gonna come in and be like was wrong in the fridge exactly right they'd be like why is there a phone in the fridge did someone lose it here let's take it and give it to lost and found that's like and then I'd come back and not be able to see my defects but it all worked out fine and in fact that was the bug the bug was in fact I was not cold buzz and so when it cooled down I was able to fix the part of the platform that was having issues so what I'm learning from this is I have to add a refrigerator to my suite of debugging tools though our whole goal is that we worry about that so that is an app developer that stuff just works okay now actually as app developers go like I know there's an upcoming summit for the google developer experts the GT e--'s right for tango yeah so you guys are putting together a lot of information what kind of stuff is going to be available well so the whole thing right AR is really new right and so we're really looking to find who want to be or who already is being the AR experts and so we want to find like a our experts throughout the world where we are just looking for people to make lots of cool apps and so we're looking for a gde who are going to be a are experts and we can educate them and how news tango how to teach other people about tango how to make apps using tangle okay so big effort coming from google to start training the trainers effectively so if I'm not lucky enough to be able to go to the summit how can I get started with a tango so right now we already have like a really good developer website you can just find it on google search for developers tango it's developers google com search for it we also have a really good stack overflow community where you can ask questions and then other people who are interested tango developers or help you out and then our samples we have published a whole bunch of open-source samples that you can use to build up and build an existing app off of and so we're trying to hit different use cases you know people are interested in measuring we have a simple measuring example people want to add virtual objects we have a natural object sample nice so those two things you just showed me are they available to samples so there are samples that you could see to do that off of these things yeah cool I'm really proud actually of the adding virtual object sample because I spent a bunch of time there's like my first sample always like you know the first thing that you add and I spent a bunch of timing cool cool so if I want to get started off anybody wants get started developers.google.com / tango yeah yeah so all the docs are their samples those kind of things there as well as a great Stack Overflow community right we've links to everything else from there so from there you can get to our samples you can download our SDK and yeah go to the stack overflow community cool well thank you so much jared this has been awesome it's been a lot of fun i'm inspired to go out and start building and yeah oh no did I get a phone yeah so it's just other than that it's just normal Android smartphone so it's like do you want your smartphone to do AR get a tangle phone sounds good thank you so much yeah it's great so if you want to learn more about tango augmented reality take a look at the links in the description below and if you have any questions for me or for jared has always just post them and don't forget to hit that subscribe button thank you
