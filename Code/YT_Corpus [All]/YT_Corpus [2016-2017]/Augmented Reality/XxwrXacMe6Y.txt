 so I just tried the new meta demo and I've got to say it was an experience like I've never had before I'm sort of gets pitched a lot I've never seen a demo of this one what I just was a life-changing experience the biggest product introduction demo the most interesting product demo that I've ever had in my life the best augmented reality heads-up display that I've experienced I was actually holding an object in my hand and I put my head inside it and when I did I actually felt I could smell the object and I can grab it and I can move it around and it's real but it's really not there when I saw a demo of what it looks like what the desktop of the future would look like I can definitely see myself using that it's exciting this opens up a whole new playing field for creative folks in music film storytelling right now you can manipulate in the space right three-dimensional space I would really like the 3d model with it really ask them to sculpt with my hands again this type of technology would make the whole play process with Donna we're gonna have amazing everyday use and access to this realm that will be incredibly important there's this idea of what the future should look right it's the thing that we've seen in science fiction movies and this was the first time actually put something on and felt like I was living in that future in promise all these years this is something that will change the world I'm emotional because I've never seen a product like this since the Macintosh it's definitely here and it's definitely real
