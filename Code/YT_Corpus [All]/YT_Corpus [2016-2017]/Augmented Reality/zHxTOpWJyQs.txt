 hi this is Chris Pietschmann from build hololens calm I'm going to show a little example of playing the Robo raid on the microsoft hololens that is available within the Windows Store so I have the game put on my wall and a tap on it to start it now it's going to load up the game tap to place the target of the game on the wall first put it right here now it's ask an environment to walk around looking at walls to scan them this is so that the Robo rate game knows my environment it's probably good to start with tap on start game and we'll see where they start invading from first to select a level with those level one now I have a whole my wall well that's just great is there anything around where is it there it is interface establish okay we need to protect him so the arrow shows where they're coming from breaking through the wall I can shoot them with lasers blow them up starts out fairly easy I think but it's a little hard to tap with the finger if you use the clicker it's a little easier now look in that hole in the wall that's a pretty deep hole it's more oh great there we go they keep destroying the place Oh
