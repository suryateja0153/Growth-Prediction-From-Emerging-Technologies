 This is an augmented reality sandbox. Its a topographic map that you can manipulate... ...in real time. Whereas you have a topographic map that's a 2D representation... that you can just look at it, but it's sometimes hard to visualize the changes in elevation. But now you can have a student look at this and you can see - “okay, well this is what a mountain looks like.” It actually has the contour lines on it so you can understand if they’re closer together it's steeper, if they’re farther apart it's not as steep of a grade. It runs off of a first generation connect camera... off an X-box, and it uses an infa-red camera. It’ll read if it's above that elevation or below it... and it will run through that algorithm, and it will give you the contour lines. And all you gotta do is push the sand around. If you hold you hand over a certain height it will rain on it. It's really just interactive. Teaching is always evolving and if it helps somebody learn, that's the best thing.
