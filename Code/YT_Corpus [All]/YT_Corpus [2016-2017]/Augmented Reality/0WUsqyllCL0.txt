 just turn it on with my eyeball in almost 18 years since I've done teen there's only two things it would give me to go skiing first virtual reality or augmented reality goggles check it out camera on this thing sensors the second thing is my buddy hungers son we're gonna see if dam can shred what there's like a little thing inside I feel like a robot dude video game style real-life skiing had to give it a try so really cool yeah I dig it last 10 2 jumps plus 4 2 speed we need to try these goggles now see how they actually work on the slopes but they're like before we cut them open and I'm not gonna try them on my backyard and give it a go so we're up here at a place called Powder Mountain it's like one of the secret top resorts here in Utah that people don't know about the patch resort and you ty don't tell people about it [Music] [Music] you'll live I could sit here all day and watch that this is fun goggles are fun now I've got to find my way out of here Shawn kind of abandoned me not a bad place to be abandoned though that's how you wrap up a day of skiing get the pizza if it's too big you fold it like this sandwich overall thoughts from me and from Shawn I don't know yet because we don't know if the footage there yeah if the footage is inside the goggles having to give it like an 8 out of 10 if there's no footage of those guys I'm gonna be super mad and give it a 2 out of 10 it was cool to be able to like just look up and blink like this and then it starts recording that was really cool can I do this where am I we're gonna go try to download the footage that really opens their up so even if it's not it still gets a 2 out of 10 because it protected my eyes so this network is goggles that there's that you saw a little bit out here about the adventure like us snowboarding and skiing but you got to go to show us Channel and watch the entire adventure like some of the little ridiculous stuff that he did mandatory this is weird and looking for the footage that we have of your views I hit on the hill were not that great because the audio was so poorly done [Music] there's no way you would use that if you wanted to just have video and audio while you're skiing or snowboarding I would suggest getting a GoPro and putting it on your helmet we could not get the GPS to work because the maps thought that we were in France and you can't change it on the app it's stuck every time you click on it it just won't even let you type and it just clicks right out of the screen there's nothing you can do there's a simulator mode that looks pretty cool at one point shonduras we put it on a set he thought it was powder Mountain and he looked around and thought it was pretty cool but turned out he's just in France what the heck virtual reality there's the ski resort it's a different one though I was crazy I think that's a Potter Mountain we're in France right yeah I think that's perhaps the rest of the features we were not able to take advantage of them it looked cool on yet good job at going to school and not coming with us watch I said turn it on scream well right on right on right on man that's what I think of whenever I think of their name let's take apart the camera the power thing let's see what this side is right here let's cut down the middle of the glasses just because why not so we've got this Dremel right here we have this big saw right here let's just put it right here it's cutting right like that yeah you've been a good friend that looked easy for you to cut I was great nice clean cut it got just to the end where it was just about to hit I'd have to flip it around wires right there that I see and then there's two layers of glass okay check it out two layers of glass inside of that thing like and see if you can pull those layers of us nicely apart oh it's tight in there huh look this little thing just okay that's this regular glass part on the back and then the shiny reflective sunglass style on the outside so we were able to see what's inside of ski goggles check that off the list you can see some wires of course you would know they would talk to each other going from side to side but now let's cut open these two boxes right here I think those are the batteries I'm thinking this side is probably the brains of it so let's cut into this part first and see if it's the brains of the battery whatever that is right there oh I'm good I didn't get into that it's the battery look how close I was to cutting into it here's the VR part somewhere in here there's an image that somehow shoots onto there and it shows you everything here's the outside with a video camera the charger is right here on the bottom you push this button right here and that's what actually gets it going that's how you charge it and transfer the files to you just connect the same cord right into there ah there we go headband off okay break off that thing to to give it away yeah okay there goes the goggles part there's the VR part looks like there's a spot right there to flip it off yep there we go here it is I took off that panel here is the part that's kind of like Google glass with a little thing that comes out oh good okay so there's a little mirror am I just gonna hit this part right here just a light slight little hit or a big one don't do that camera here's what it looks like before you take off the camera part and you can see where the actual camera would be right there ooh check this out check it out there's some there's some glass right there that's where the image comes out of if you think about it it makes sense why this thing is rounded right there by these glasses because when you're wearing the goggles it's just like VR where you go like this and look around and the image stays stationary where you're looking but it knows where you're looking and so it keeps everything the same so it's like a cube and on both sides it has a rounded piece of glass on it it's like mini VR in your snow goggles why is it scary I see a my lithium-ion batteries are not scared I feel like after the news on lithium-ion batteries with like segways and certain cellphones I feel like there needs to be like a PSA public service announcement that batteries are not bad in general think about many lithium-ion batteries we have in all different kinds of electronics and how small of a number of them actually like blow up or explode or catch on fire they're not that dangerous they're not scary there's still a percentage to take lower don't be afraid they're still it's a bunch of layers of glass yeah like rounded glass on both sides - they are I am a little buddy you're in my fingers right now I can squish your head squish my head group overall I think this is a really cool idea I don't know if the technology's quite there super interesting to see what's inside and I hope there are more things like this on motorcycles on I don't know increase the technology within skiers and get it better with through the beta testing if you see interesting technology send us an email and let us know hit us up because we love playing at these things shonduras got me to go snowboarding for the first time in
