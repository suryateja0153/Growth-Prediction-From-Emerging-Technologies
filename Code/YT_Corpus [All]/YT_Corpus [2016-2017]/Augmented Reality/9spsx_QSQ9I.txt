 so one of the new emerging kind of information technology revolutions that we're seeing nowadays this idea of augmented reality right this notion of taking the world of everyday perception and tweaking it and augmenting and impregnating perception with mindedness with agency with aesthetics right and so how do we do that well it essentially means that the information technologies the instruments that we're using today to manipulate and transform the world are now allowing us to overlay digital information on top of the physical world they apps already that looking through the camera in the app you can place virtual elements into real environments with this notion that you're mapping the real world and overlaying agency information gamification mind into it so what does that mean it means that more and more of the world starts to feel Riaan chanted more and more of the world can be turned into gamified experiences there's more cognitive activity occurring in the interface between self and world until self and world become become one I think that's where we're heading it's certainly the idea of augmenting reality is part of what it means to be human from the moment that we started to create architecture to put objects in the world to make art to carve tools we've been augmenting reality so for the digital revolution to finally catch up to that is a perfectly natural emergence
