 one of the hottest topics today is augmented reality but just what does it mean to augment or mix realities and how does it work hi my name is Nicola and I'm going to talk about project tango augmented reality and the exciting new world that's now at your fingertips augmented reality has been around in some form for years pilots for example utilize a head-up display to navigate in low-light of bad weather representation of obstacles are projected onto the windscreen along with other vital data such as airspeed and altitude to allow a pilot to see when it's not really possible to see so what does it take to make a artwork on a mobile device in many ways AR works just the way you work when you walk your eyes process images while a pair of tiny canals in your inner ear called the vestibular system provides information about spatial orientation and movement your brain automatically links the data and you maneuver without even thinking in order to analyze your movement at project tango device processes images of your immediate environment dozens of images every second as you move and point the device the images change and the project tango software interprets and presential movement in the AR world at Project tangos high resolution clock to sync all of these elements and you have a tool capable of capturing and presenting a high fidelity virtual image on top of a live camera image to understand how this works in more detail what's the introduction to motion tracking video creating an AR experience that's believable is a delicate exercise and I want to walk you through a few of the key elements so let me show you what I'm talking about as we walk along this hallway the project tango device is taking pictures and you are essentially seeing a live picture of your world each of the little dots that you see represents a physical feature that project tango locks onto so it can track your movement as these features shift in relation to the device project tangos motion tracking tracks your progress now let's amend reality in this case we will add a box to our room as we move around it projects encode tracks our movement in relation to our physical world and redraws the box to keep it fixed in place to make this work you must make sure that the camera image and the device pose our time synced if they are not you will see the virtual overlays out of sync with the camera motion we say the experience is slushy if on the other hand the two our time synced the virtual object will follow the physical world and we say we have good registration now there are some things to watch out for imagine riding a roller coaster your eyes and your vestibular system float your brain with sensory data over time your brain gets overloaded and you lose track of time and space same thing in the AR world if the project tango system cannot process data efficiently enough then the system can no longer draw the virtual world in the right position and it will look like it's moving randomly on top of the physical world not synchronizing pose and camera image is one of the most common mistakes so we are created sample code for various platforms pretty neat right you must also manage the properties of the camera and the motion tracking system the parameters of the virtual camera and the physical camera must match this includes their field of view any lens distortion and physical displacement of the physical camera and the inertial measurement unit if you don't address this errors will accumulate and as you move the device further and further away from its starting point the virtual world will appear to shift yep this is pretty tricky and you need a bit of math to nail this we've got you covered with ready to use samples here when you are thinking about how to program in project tango think about working in two worlds the physical world and the virtual world where the shared element is time that in a sense is augmented reality now there are some limitations which you need to consider when you are imagining an a our app several factors affect the accuracy of motion tracking light surfaces and how fast we are moving can all create errors and here is why again remember the project tango device works pretty much the same way we work low-light can make it difficult for the camera to accurately detect the surroundings without accurate images project tango cannot recognize your physical environment just as we cannot see in the dark neither can a project tango device also the environment needs textures in order to accurately gauge movement imagine standing in the middle of a snowstorm everything around you is white now try to gauge how fast you're moving and in what direction same thing with project tango project tango is a leap forward for mobile devices that enables them to run room scale and markerless AR experiences just in matching the possibilities augmented reality can take your world and enhance it and with project tango you can do that right now for more information and code samples on AR + project tango go to our developer site and visit our Google+ community and join us on our journey we are excited to see what you will build with project tango
