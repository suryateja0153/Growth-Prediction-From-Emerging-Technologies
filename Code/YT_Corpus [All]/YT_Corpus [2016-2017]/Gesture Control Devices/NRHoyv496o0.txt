 what's happening folks it is an ER here from i download blog today we're going to take a look at tiny player tiny player is a tweak available in the BigBoss repo that has a little popup window that allows you to control your music this is basically an alternative to controlling it inside a control center it also looks a little bit better and it's kind of easier to turn on and off if use an activator setting it's really nice that you can just move it around you can hide it here on the bottom with a few your icons are put it in a blank space on your screen it does float always though so even if you change different home screens it's still going to be hanging around even though it looks simple there's a lot of controls built in like double tapping ghost the necks on and triple tapping goes to the previous song if you have this installed they do add a little preference pane inside of the settings application screen long settings and go down here to tiny player light a pro version will be coming soon in the future with hopefully a lot more features inside of settings you can enable or disable it and more importantly you can tie it to an activator setting so if you want to do something like triple tap your home button to show and hide this window you can do that and that's actually setting that I have set up so just triple tapping the home button will hide this window completely triple tapping again will show this so no matter where I am I really like that a dark mode is also available simply hold your finger on top of the tiny player for a second and let go I'll turn dark mode do the same to get back to light mode if you hold your finger on that play stop button you'll also have a pop-up control which allows you to easily go backward or four and play and pause if you swipe to the side on this it also has a few sharing options so you could share the song to Facebook or Twitter now as I mentioned this is always hanging around this is always on like the top layer of your phone whether it's the owner home screen lock screen or even if you're inside of an app so if I'm in here reading the i download blog website because who isn't it kind of gets in the way but I have that activator gesture setup so you can just triple tap my home button and it goes away completely when I want to get back to my music triple tap again and it comes I guess the only really missing feature is the ability to actually see my music as far as like choosing music but maybe that's something that we'll see in the pro version if you'd like you can pick it up for free in the BigBoss repo let us know what you think of tiny player light down in the comments and please subscribe if this video is useful otherwise until next time this has been Andrew for I download blog
