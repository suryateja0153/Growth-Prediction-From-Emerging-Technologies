 alright guys what's up Blu sigh right here alright today I'm going to show you how to use a MIDI controller with Sony Vegas the version I'm currently using is Sony Vegas Pro 12 point oh I'm not sure if this works with newer versions or older versions but I would assume they would since I don't think much has actually changed so you have to start you're gonna need Sony Vegas and second you're going to need a media controller and in the one I'm going to be currently using is the Novation launch control and you can pick these up online I think for about 80 to 100 dollars something like that anyway so first what we're gonna do is we're going to go to options and we're going to select external control what this allows you to do is use exactly what it says external control for any Sony Vegas function so we're just gonna select that and then as you can see it is selected now we're going to go to preferences and here's the Preferences window all we're going to do is jump over to meeting now I already have the drivers installed for my launch control I'm sure your MIDI controllers drivers as well and it should appear in this list so what we're gonna do is we're simply going to select it and then we're gonna click apply ok now the next tab we're gonna go to is external control and automation now this is where you're actually going to be programming all your buttons to use with all the functions you want for each key in for Sony Vegas so so what we're gonna do unless you already have like a Mackay controller transport driver or presonus faderport driver you can just use these but but since but since I have 18 ovations launch control we're just gonna click generic control and then we're gonna click Add so as you can see such generic control template new years a map because we're going to be creating that mountain and status one controllable channels so now we're going to right click and then click configure and this is where we're gonna actually do all the fun stuff so so as you can see this is where all the functions are going to be for for all of the for all the commands and stuff like that that you can hook up to your controller this is just an example so we have channel down channel up channel Bank town channel make a master fader mute so you know that kind of stuff and there's a ton of different categories for you where you can pick them for any kind of for any kind of control that you want okay so just for an example we'll go to I don't know let's go to audio channels as you can see we have channel one fader pan pan rear center send are for record so these are all stuff that you can program two buttons and and faders so but because my my launch control has eight different functions as you can see right here we are going to change the number of channels to eight now obviously it's gonna vary on each MIDI controller and how many channels you actually have but in my case I have eight it's as you can see now we have all these different options for four channels and different functions so let's say I wanted to go to I don't know let's no tools isn't a very good one let's go to project let's say I wanted to create a new project just by pushing a button I can do that by at first we're so first we're going to do is we're going to select it so so right now it's highlighted and that we're gonna do is we're gonna click learn now as soon as I push the button on my lunch control they gave and give us some input um you know as you can see the meaning message has the channels been put on note on media data is nine eight zero so but maybe I wanted something else maybe I wanted to use it as button number two on my controller I can do that so as you can see it changed from from nine eight zero to ten a hashtag zero or a pound zero as you can see see even then they can switch between the two so what this allows you to do is you're able to choose any kinds you're able to configure any kind of function to each button yes yeah so let's keep on messing around with this a little bit more we're just gonna reset this let's say I wanted to go over to track view so let's say I wanted to change let's say I wanted to be able to zoom in and zoom out well I can do that let's say I'll just push button 1 here make sure make sure learn is checked is check marked and then let's push button 1 as you can see I give us a value and then zoom out let's make that button number 2 on my controller and and now let's just go back to ok click OK and now as you can see whenever I push these buttons I can zoom in and out so that's pretty cool and then we'll just go back to preferences here and we will go ahead and go back to configuring and I'm just gonna reset all just for the sake of this tutorial alright so now what's really cool about this is you can make different user maps and stuff like that so I already have one I already have one made for myself it's just editing XML it just saves in an XML format and I'm just gonna open it and what I can do is I'll have this um I'll have the link to this file in the description this is what I use for editing if you guys have a launch control um and just want one that's already made then you can just go ahead and pop it in there and and now we'll just and then we'll just click OK and what I can do now is say I wanted to play the video all I have to do is push one I want to stop it so you can push two if I want to pause it I can push three let's say I wanted to render to render the video with just one button I can press 7 as you can see it'll just open up I don't know why that's now loading cuz it's just being annoying now it's because I don't have anything in the timeline anyway or maybe I just wanted to save the project I can push that why pushing 8 so this is really really useful if you just want to find a quick innie you know if you want to maybe speed up your editing you know let's say you know really complicated functions like what's a good example maybe if you wanted to add like an event effects or something like that but just the push of a button you can do that with a meanie controller another example would be like the master would be like you know would be like the master volume so as you can see I can change them yeah and you can program them to pretty much any buttons you can program you know like you know you can program these switches to like you know a different audio tracks I just don't have them hooked up right now um but yeah that's that's pretty much it it's actually really really simple if you like this video if you have any questions leave a comments yeah just like subscribe do all that stuff or you know whatever people are doing these days and yeah and I will catch you guys in the next one peace
