 I'm going to talk you through using the just balls application so the very first thing we need to do as you can see there is connect to leap motion to our computer and then wake up our Sphero as you can see it's going three different colors in this case white orange orange those correspond to the name of the actual Sphero so you can see here I'm opening up the application and putting in that name we were discussing white orange orange and then I'm selecting the color that I've like my sphere to go once I start the application so then to those details I'm taken through to a landing page which gives me some instructions on how to use the application then when I'm happy with those I can go ahead and click the connect now this point a number of different things are happening behind the scenes your computer's connecting to the sphere but five Bluetooth turning off its stabilization allowing you to orientate it using that back LED and set its direction of travel once you're happy with that connection goes ahead and as you can see here we've been able to move the sphere around using simple gestures of your hand now obviously at some point seeing as you're controlling the application with your hands you may want to disconnect your spirit before it rolls off into the distance now to do this as you'll see in a second all you have to do is simply curl your hand until fist and the sphere is disconnected it's allows you to then click the reset button which takes you back to the app and you can play again actual at your bill thank you very much for watching I can draw using the just Falls application you check my nerves hanging rail in my brain imagine traveling soon you broke my wheel of water three mrs.reyes is great balls of fire the spine you came along and I change my mind woodstock ball by just baby it was good
