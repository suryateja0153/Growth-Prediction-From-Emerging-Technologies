 ladies and gentlemen please welcome Eric Shapiro site ismat and Mike James good afternoon everybody and welcome to the evolution of user experiences with apps and to hope to make sure that you guys are in the right session since we changed the title of the session several times during our preparation I've had it on the board here so you know what we'll be talking about I think this is a really great session we're going to have three speakers and then if there's any time we'll have Q&A at the end and our our goal is to actually talk about how app experiences are changing and what you actually need to be doing about that in your thinking of and how you're creating your apps so let me start by actually telling you a little bit about Who I am and why I'm here so I'm a CEO and co-founder of Arc Touch which is a mobile and connected experiences studio and basically what that means is we're a hundred person company where we focus on working with companies like you see here to help them come up with a strategy design and implementation of their apps across all devices from phones to tablets to smart watches etc so we are seeing this evolution happened today and it is it's pervasive in everything from consumer apps to enterprise apps to apps that go to employees as well so as we go through this if you need any thoughts or help on actually building any of the apps that we're talking about please come up and see me afterwards so let's do a little history lesson in the beginning there were just apps for smartphones and it was good and that's how we were for several years we all created apps we played around with them we launched them the App Store grew and everybody had this experience that made a lot of sense mobile phones were used in environments like commuting to work we're standing in line at the supermarket and being able to pull up some information not as not as much information as you might have on your desktop but being able to really interact with brands and your company's data etc while on the go and then job said let there be iPad and we thought hmmm just a big iphone and suddenly the experience changed companies and developers who simply took their apps and expanded them having them fill the ipad screen and I remember we did this with some of the apps that we did we said oh in two weeks we can expand it to fill the screen those apps failed the reason those apps failed is because the experience the users experience with an iPad or what tablets is different it's a more laid-back experience people use tablets when they're sitting on the couch or in bed relaxing it's a shared experience it's not a phone experience and so the apps that succeeded the apps that really really took off are those that reimagine the experience for the user now that was just the beginning of how the experiences have changed we are now in a world of connected devices we've got wearables and smart watches and TVs that have apps installed on them in homes that you can talk two cars vr AR and now the year of the chat bot that's what people are talking about so the way people are experiencing apps is evolving and you must evolve the way you think about your app experiences as well each of the items that you see on here is a different experience and you need to be thinking about that your app needs to be different don't just try to cram your app into these different experiences so give you a real concrete example of what we're talking about and how this might work what I'd like to do is actually talk about an app that we created for the San Jose Earthquakes professional soccer and and tell you how you could see this experience working in all of these different connected devices so we'll think about in two different ways the first is as you go to a match and here you have the ability to look at what's coming up you can find out a little bit about the match you might be able to look a few stats up etc but a key focus for this client that we worked with was quick micro interactions we don't want the user of this app focusing on the app we want them focusing on the game that is not the thing that we want to do so we think about that when we did the experience and then when the Apple watch came out we gave people the ability to have a glance and Apple call this glances it really makes a lot of sense because really you have seconds to get across the point here is here's where your seat is here's a way for you to get into your your your location with your ticket etc very fast very short experience no one is actually interacting with the watch in this example except to quickly look and see and where am I supposed to be going and then when you're in your seat and you want to do something like order a hot dog what's the best way for you to do that and we've imagined that that experience could actually be a chat bot and so what we have here is we've designed what a chat experience might look like in this case where you're in this is a this is a the facebook messenger chat bot where you can actually say I'd like hot dog and the chat bot will interact with you to find out where you want and we'd like that hot dog to be delivered to so when you're at home the experience is also different and it started with it started with an experience of sitting back on your couch and experiencing the game from your iPad being able to look up things or be able to do instant replays etc the experience got bigger and more involved and the users of these apps are actually engaging with your app in a much larger much more time intensive fashion and that expanded when Apple introduced the Apple TV and we now see it with with google chromecast and fire TV and now what we have is television experiences smart apps that are running on your television where you actually can experience the entire game but customize the experience you can choose what will display on the screen around this and if you guys have had a chance to check out MLB's app for Apple TV is a great example of how this is done and finally with the smart home and connected devices your entire experience can be come immersive your entire living room can come alive when your team actually scores interacting with your home interacting with your Philips hue lights and the example we have here so these are these are real examples and in fact in a moment site from Phillips is going to come up and talk about how all these things can come together the most important thing for you to take away at this point is that as developers we do not just create mobile apps for smartphones anymore we need to be thinking about we need to be evolving our the way we think about experiences and we are creating connected experiences using all of these devices so with that in mind what I like to do is call site up and he will tell us a little bit more about Phillips and Phil to you thanks Larry hi everyone my name is Lizbeth I'm the R&D director for Phillips you in America's so I think Eric gives a nice message right so we should not just think about making mobile apps it's about connected experiences and as philips Lighting we are also going through some transitions as a lighting industry so i would like to kick it off with a short movie let's just see what we mean by connected experiences in lighting can light it go beyond elimination when it gets his up there and starts out there when it remembers for us when it brightens how streets and when it knows we arrived helping us to be more productive can lighting go beyond illumination when it gathers information allowing us to better understand and manage our buildings can lighting go beyond elimination when it guides and informs us when it knows what we are and then make sure what is awful is a period can lighting go beyond illumination when it gives us the complete picture helping us fix problems as they have with new efficiencies keeping a second improving our environment and making our cities better places to can write it and go beyond elimination yes when it connects so as lighting industry as lighting industry we are going through a very big technology transformation as many of you are aware we are changing to LEDs so that brings 89% energy saving nice for the planet nice for you but it also brings opportunities because all of a sudden we start putting semiconductors and light bulbs or light sources so we can make them smart we can make them intelligence we can connect them to the Internet but why would you why would we do that so there are two aspects of it at one hand the light sources we have they are becoming more capable so now you can create different colors different shades of white with light you can dim them you can create dynamics effect you can react very fast weight with older technologies that was not always possible it was very limited within the capabilities of that technology and on top of that now we are getting very exciting ways of interacting with light it's not only the two dimmers or switches you have in the wall or the let's say the buttons that you have on your luminaire now all of a sudden we have things like wearables we interact with lies using mobile apps our homes are becoming smarter they are getting integrated with more smart devices sensors and also let's not forget I mean voice is coming in right now this is one of the hottest IOT products out there amazon echo where you can actually say Alex I please turn off my light or you can talk to Siri and you can control your lives and what we do is that we use all these different ways of interacting with lights also at the same time so when we are designing experiences when we are let's say developing products you cannot just think that okay I only focus on my mobile app because while some ways playing with that mobile app another person is actually hitting the switch and that knows what my son is trying to do it yeah so this all requires also a different way of thinking I mean historically lighting is not a very emotional category so usually once in a while your light bulb breaks down and you take it out you go to the supermarket or do to yourself you look for the highest wattage lowest price you make sure that the stock is fit and now you buy and now you have light but now we have opportunities now we can do much more beyond elimination so we can create experiences so that also means that we need to think in a and talk in a different language not on technical specs technical capabilities so now we think about how lighting can contribute to your peace of mind how it can scare goes while you are at home and while you're away from home while we can comfortably interact with it how you can basically transform your spaces to fit the moments of your day and how we can trigger your imagination with lighting and what I would like to do in the coming few slice is I would like to give you a few examples of these things just give you an idea what we are talking about so right now using geolocation geofencing we are able to know when we're at home and we're not at all so we can now talk about welcome home or leaving home kind of things we can talk about when I'm away from my home that my lighting can mimic and can actually mimic my presence at home as if I'm there if I Madame beach having a vacation then I'm also i have my peace of mind but I know that my house is taking care of and I can take this further so I can also make use of for example web services so i can I don't know how many of you are familiar with ifttt but I came for example make sure that when the Sun rises at my lights turn off and the Sun sets I make sure that the light at the front of my door is actually on if it's going to rain I can make my life blue if I get a social media like I can make my last blink and let's take it even one step further as Eric mentioned the homes are becoming more smarter there's more and more connected devices are coming into your home so we are not only talking about intelligent light bulbs anymore so we are talking about intelligent door locks we are talking about connected door bells talking about connected thermostats let's say smoke detectors security cameras smart fridges so all these connected devices are smart devices they are implementing their own use cases but what we are also now seeing is that we can actually call inc multiple of these smart devices to implement even more unique use cases which we call one plus one makes three so if I leave the room if my nest cam detects that I can turn off my life if my nest thermostat knows that I'm away from home it can automatically trigger that my life scenes are actually triggered as if I am at home and you know hopefully it never happens but if my nest smoke detectors text LSA detects that something is happening it can also turn the lights red and help me to get out of the house and warm and again we talked about transforming your moments so we don't want to talk anymore about what is the demon level of a light or what is the Calvin color temperature of a lamp and so on so we want to talk about what is the right light for the best moment so we can set the lights or relaxing mode we can set the lights to the best light setting that is good for reading if you want to work we can set them on a concentration mode if you want to if you just woke up you need energy we can put that in the energy mode so we can really make use of the biological effects of life and we can even take that one step further so how can I contextually trigger those light settings so we already know what is the right place settings for those occasions so with the smartphones with our homes getting more experienced and let's say intelligent where we are also making use of more mobile as social media whatever how can we make sure or how can we try to find these simple triggers that for example we say that a family sitting in their living room watching watching TV so let me set the lights to relaxing not so how can we have contextual driven lighting so those are the next step that we are exploring right now and they are not very far that we will actually start experiencing that those in your homes and of course I cannot give you a presentation about you without showing the fantastic colors of you so you can also paint with you so you can also actually create much more immersive let's say ambiances in your homes you can make those static but you can also make them dynamic that they are slowly changing colors or changing let's say the experience that you have in your heart let's talk a little bit about entertainment and let's talk a little bit about your image nation so this is one of our most let's say popular apps developed by two brilliant touch developers it's called Hugh disco so what it does is that from in the microphone it listens to the music and then according to the music it can actually turn your living room lights or your whatever lies in your house into disco lighting you can become a light choke yourself and you don't need professional equipment it doesn't matter where the music is playing you can transform your house into a nightclub and then this app is so amazing at the end actually we also use it for special occasions so with me let's say live nation for example we organize something called living life sessions for upcoming artists and then we shoot videos where we put online in a living room setting and then we actually see disco to create those really interactive immersive experiences there couple of months ago we sponsored an album launch for Star Wars head space which is an electronic music album so I was literally standing in a living room in D and then I had to disco I was creating all disco lighting and there was to start troopers next to me it's really amazing and of course you can talk about music but what about video let me give you the example of sci-fi sci-fi sinker what Syfy's think that is that if you're watching at home series like 12 monkeys expands sharknado actually there are light scripts associated with those series and then using this sync app you can actually have light scripts playing in your living room so you can't take that to the experience that you see on the screen as Phillips we have these NBA TV's where we actually try to extend that experience to the wall at the back but now with you what we want to do is that we want to make it 3d we want to do is surround lighting and these guys are already doing then so you become part of that immersive experience and this is just a start there's already quite a lot of other things cooking which you will be seeing in the coming period where you will be able to have very immersive video series experiences in your homes just watching your TV and of course gaming I'm sure a lot of people enjoys it we already have a let's say game from a company called Freeman on the market called chariot which actually sings with utilizing and then as you are playing basically you're your game at home what you see is that depending on what is happening in the game then also your life starts interacting with you and then again this is just an example of what we do today and we are discussing with many more my gaming studios to actually take this to the next level for the first person shooters to all kind of different game generals this is again just to give you a bit of flavor of how we actually now as a lighting company start talking about connected experiences and I how close connected experiences actually it can help for your peace of mind or your moments of your day or your imagination but we also know that we cannot innovate everything you also know that this system has much more potential these connected devices have much more potentials so that's why it was very important for us from the beginning to make sure that we have an open system so we have an open SDK and an open API because we wanted to make sure that the whole world develops and then in a ways together with us I would like to show you a second video we're actually one of those brilliant developers there's something to really improve people's lives with light now let's see what I did I was more death my family's my parents my brothers all of us we grew up having these using our native language America time so we had these amazing intellectual conversations we discussed politics are just like everybody else but one thing it was always different for us was the technology we had this huge clunky art a typewriter type team and for the ratings a separate box the white ball screw pin the top of it and it's only function was a ring but what a grand would bring the entire house with the Congo lights in the philips hue technology it allows us to design what other words I could leave the phone on the table and I have to worry about it allowed us to be mobile in the room the lighted would adjust I can change it to a customized drink talk whatever I want in a specific mol as well when I connected at all connect to a call I'd have to worry about the lighting everything comes up fully to better quality video call now I feel like I've got my own customized ringtone we're able to add music to color soft bright energetic for everyone it's able to customize my experience add functionality within the app everything's smart light I have to worry about move around the room adjusted lighting everything's taken care of at the Phillips youth lighting system automatically does it right there miss call then I have notification to a red light just like you have a red badge right now everything's right there with this system we've never had something like that it really is fine and this is just one example of the men so currently who has a who has about 500 independent apps in the App Store and then we see people doing really amazing things with it we see people trying different ways of controlling light we see people for example creating dynamic light scenes in your living room we see people already showed you doing things with music we have people experimenting new technology what you can do with gesture control what you can do with smart plugs and let's say in how slow indoor local localization so that you know where you are in the room we are people doing things for kids you know for families for learning so there's all kind of things there that's also I think they really depower of having an open system name and of course as Hugh and we also take it by the heart I mean for us it's the core of our story as well so we want to make sure that our developer community becomes part of our story so we also for example communicate constantly with our users and so we have a recommendation for the app of the month where we say it's either it can be a very popular app but it can be also something maybe a niche a very unique use case that we want to make sure that people become aware of it sometimes we organize social media campaigns around specific ad so for example for Hugh disco we did one social media campaign where we said ok let's teach you if we can make best use of this best use of this experience in your home that you can have best entertainment experiences with life or if there's a special event like Halloween down with sometimes team up with our developers and then we make some special Halloween apps and so just to give you some ideas so with this being said now I would like to end the word over to Mike and I'm I can tell you a little bit about the huge developer program and he can also try to show a few things to show how easy it is to actually get started with you thank so who here has already done the mini hack so a couple of years so there's a lot of people in this room that after this session you need to head out there grab a stool and start writing code because this is awesome so before I work for xamarin I worked for an architectural lighting control company I actually went to university and studied lighting control you can believe that that's a degree I used to control things like the the lights for the things like the London Eye all of the bridges along the Thames as well as fear to show so lighting is kind of you know a real passion of mine and normally if you want to kind of go for home automation and intelligent lighting control you know you would have to go and spend a fortune you'd have to go and get lutron or start chipping away at the walls and run lines of DMX and it was hellishly expensive whereas with Philips use I was able to add home automation and intelligent lighting control to my home the very minimal expenditure just by going and buying some new lamps from plugging into the existing sockets that's something you loved it and I still do love it to be fair now as a developer the thing that interests me most about the Phillip Hughes is how open the platform is you know we're not just stuck to the app that Philips produce for us we're not happy with that we want to extend it to do something new but we can just use the same AP is that their developers are using to build something that works for us so to get started with that you probably want to go over to the Phillip Hughes website and register and the reason you want to register is because you get access to the API dots so this gives you information about everything you need to know that a developer doesn't matter what language if you're a c-sharp developer if your Swift developer objective c java it really doesn't matter you're going to find all of the information you need to know in order to get started in the developer portal so i can't recommend enough just getting on there and signing up for that now there's a couple of SDKs because I mean who really wants to be parsing JSON themselves you want an sdk to abstract that away from you and just focus on the core functionality of what you're trying to create so Phillips ship an appo SDK built with Objective C and a Java SDK or Android SDK built with Java now we could create bindings to these you know we ship objective sharpie which is the same tool that we use internally to create the bindings so when Apple next month release iOS 10 and there's a whole new load of api's we fire up objective sharpie and we pass through those header files and we get that one to one binding to all those platform api's now you could do that for the official Phillips SDKs if you want but actually there's some third-party SDKs that are going to make your lives much much easier and allow you to share even more code so the mini hat that's out in the mini half area uses a nuget package called q42 but Hugh hey API now I actually found out when we were when we were setting up the mini hat one of my colleagues came over and he was like what are you using to control this and I showed him the q42 QAPI new get and it's like that I've got my code in it so if you have any issues I can definitely go and point you to him and you should I'm sure he'll hate me to say here so I won't but with that said let's let's jump into a demo boom so we're over onto my Mac here now I'm going to walk through the mini hat and I've completed it already the mini hack is nine steps super simple I've tried to make it as easy as possible so even if you've got no experience with C sharp after 10-15 minutes you should be able to get this up and running we don't want anyone to leave evolve without having done the mini hat and having turned a light bulb on and off from their iPhone or Android device Oh is there anyone here using uwp or Windows Phone so there's four of you if you want to do the mini hack I can I can make it work for you come and find me and I'll make it work it's just a couple of extra lines on my part but there's four more than I expected so because this isn't a Marin forms that we've got three projects within a solution now you don't need to do anything within the iOS or Android project all of the work that you need to write is within the shared code I've already grabbed all the packages for you I've already done all of the glue code so it's ready to go I've made it even easier by adding these tasks so we can come in here and we can see I've got a to-do item we need to set the a plane and device name so i can just come in and click on that and boom we go to the exact line of code that we need to implement now you're going to need a unique app name and device name because that's how the bridge knows if your app is allowed to control the lights because what you don't want is your friend popping over for a cup of tea very British of me and they pull out their phone and they start turning your lights off you want to be able to control who has access to your lighting system so to do that you have to register your application with the hub now there's a button in the middle of the hub now this is a new hub you're probably thinking this doesn't look like the hub that's outside this is the one that supports home kit now this is one everyone wants because we can walk around and we go hey Siri turn my bedroom light on and boom it works it's amazing so you definitely want this one but you'll want to be pressing the button in the middle to register your app now you want to do that first before you make the next call or number three which is register so we use this hue local hire a local Hugh client I should say and there is a remote Hugh piont as well so this SD case supports doing this all over the internet if you want as well but just for this you know the Wi-Fi conference Wi-Fi is never great so we decided to keep it local and even then we've had in a couple of issues getting it working but I T managed to fix that for us it works first time every time at home bring it here put 12 of them all together all broadcasting separate Wi-Fi channels madness but it works flawlessly now the IT got involved so what we want to do is we want to register our application and here is where we use that app name and device name and we're not animals so we use async and once it passes back a key that the bridge will give you it's a string key we want to stall that so that next time our app launches and we try and register we go well we've got this key there you go and the bridge says yep I know of this device I know this app you're okay to go through you don't need to go and find the bridge and press the button again once you've done that you'll want to discover all of the lamps that are connected to the bridge so this is going to be the second tab and it's going to show you a list of every single lamp that's available to you and you can see we've got this type of light which comes from the SDK I don't have to worry about that it's a super easy SDK to do you get like a sink and boom you get the list of lights and then we've got the commands now the commands where it gets fun because we can do almost anything you can imagine here so we can build up States and then send it as a command so we can select multiple lights and send it as one command and it will go out to all of them and set them within this mini hat I'm just controlling one lamp at a time but we ask you to extend it and do something interesting now we've got this on get help so why don't I just load up github so you can find it look at that I need to make some more things public now this is just a mine and but we also have it on the exam room one as well and you'll see you can literally copy and paste the code if you don't want to learn the API and you just want to complete the mini hack you can come in here copy and paste a code all the way down to step 9 and you're good to go now to win a starter kit which is the three lamps and a bridge right and is it the is it the nice new bridge it's enough nice so to win one of those we ask you to extend it and do something interesting with it now I had a guy that was you know the vanity mirrors that you go and sit in front of to do your makeup no I kind of surprised that no one in here does that well what do you wanted was an ibeacon there so that when you walk up the lights fade on now I've got the idea that my philips uses at the moment it's got the alarm clock set for a six o'clock in the more in the UK so that's telling on every morning well that's not great because i'm not home so i want to put an ibeacon next to my bed because that's where i charge my phone so when I put my phone down it knows that I'm home so it knows in the morning to turn the alarm on so that's another example of how we can extend it and build it all together in an integrated system so that's kind of a very very quick demo as I say this this stuff is super easy to get started with so if you have an idea of the kind of home automation that you want and there isn't a nap already out there for you just go and build it so thanks very much and they're going to pass back all right great thanks to everybody if there are any questions that anybody would like to ask we'll take questions now otherwise you can come up and see any of us after the session as well have a question at the back over there yeah can you speak a bit louder oh that's going to make it much easier yeah so can you guarantee this they're worried as if you look at it from the communication protocol point of view than we are using Ziggy there so that's really coming from the lighting industry so that's something we try to coordinate everyone goes with it but it is that something we try to get as a standard from the communication perspective but in terms of functionality of course with you we add quite a lot of functionality so that requires also that we have a separate less API for it but yeah so that's how I can answer for the same time let me add to that also that with the home kit support home kit is becoming an apple ecosystem standard and although Philips hue doesn't support google and the weave as yet I don't know I don't know if you want to speak about ad yet that's another competing standard that will start to see come out as well and what I think that people are doing now if they want to bring in solutions that span multiple devices of different types is they're using solutions like the if this than that to pull everything together and it's it seems a little daunting at first until you go to their website and you see that almost anything you can imagine that you would want to do with different devices has been done and all you need to do is grab it and click on the the recipe as they call it I think it's a good point so I think if you look into smartphone platform providers I think they of course there they below for a certain level of abstraction where but again what I would like to express their is there will be let's say some standard lighting who like to things and I think those are things that you can perhaps have some standards around that it can be just you can run off any lamp or you can teammate and so on but once you start creating very LS a relatively complex user experiences then that there will be some differentiation zeroes any other question one over here microphones I so sick decreased mesh network mesh network so the thing is actually more box you have in your house more better reception you have to hope for those difficult but what we indeed too is that lamps also talk to each other so that you can reach the difficult points in your house so if you look at from a lighting control point of view of course you would like to make sure that if I say turn on my light it really turns on right so you don't want to have a situation that once in a while the message get lost and so on so indeed they talk to each other to make sure that we increase the chances the more lights you have the better chance of reception as well any other question so who has you at home who is using you who is built an app for k-12 yeah come find me afterwards I want to travel me too okay great thank you very much everybody and enjoy the rest of the show thanks
