 hey what's up guys I'm full and I'm back with a quick look on the Samsung Galaxy s7 from China Steven did a review on it you'll find a link down in the description but now we have seen some other videos on YouTube that it is water-resistant or it's durable for quite a time when you put it in water now today we're from Austria we want to try and take it to another level we're going to test it with Red Bull we love Red Bull and today we're going to test if the galaxy s7 likes it too so guys let's jump into the camera application and see if the phone likes the Red Bull as much as we do mmm tasty look what's the image dude that's one I think that's enough maybe a bit more just go for the two so it's still working but the camera or the application here is jumping around so that's a bit weird we're going to leave it in here for quite a while and then maybe later put it into the freezer so yeah so the display is still working but it's not responsive anymore because of the water but yeah if we go here on the home button note oh yeah still working here I get through the applications but yeah that's it as you can see the phone is still working but it does some random tasks we're here in the kitchen of my grandparents well this is my students fridge and now we're going to put it into the freezer so it's still doing some crazy stuff I can feel still feel the vibration but now let's close it and check it out in a few hours so guys we've been waiting for one day the fridge is still empty but let's check out the smartphone solid super frozen we'll take it into the office and then see if it's still working alright guys let us check out the smart phone now let us add some boiling water holy crap here we go use a smartphone well there's still some ice there still super cold but yeah now it's clean so as you can see there's still some liquid under the display and the battery is empty and let us now check if I can still charge it so guys as you can see we took the smartphone out of the red ball but it's not working right now maybe it's empty maybe it's damaged but let us have a closer look so first I'm going to charge put in here the power cable okay let's wait here can you see something oh yeah awesome it's charging but somehow the screen looks a bit weird so yeah even if I press here you can see that there is still some Red Bull underneath the display underneath the glass so as you can see the phone is still working the screen is flickering of course I won't use it anymore we won't use it anymore you can see there are some droplets in between the screen and the glass and yeah you can push them around and kind of transform them somehow let us go quickly in here camera is working as well but yeah well not good conditions at all so guys as you can see we don't recommend you doing this at home your phone will break redbull is not very one it's better for your body than for your smartphone anyhow Stephan is going to do tomorrow a teardown so you can have a look inside and check out the components so stay tuned thanks for watching and bye bye
