 hello my name is Jess McIntosh I'm from the Bristol interaction group and this work was done in collaboration with the df' ki and Saarland University so there are many techniques for hand tracking and each technique is suited to certain applications due to their accuracy and form-factor an EMG is particularly useful as a mobile gesture recognition technique but the practicality of this device is often ignored so to quickly explain how EMG works so muscle cells produce an electrical potential upon contraction of that muscle which results in a signal like the one highlighted above and this is measured using electrodes which are shown here on the bicep along with a differential amplifier so the number of electrodes and the placement of these are important variables to both the accuracy and the ergonomics of a device however currently existing wearables are worn around the wrist which are ergonomically acceptable to designers and users so given this we decided to find out whether EMG could still be used effectively at the rest so that it can be aligned with existing wearable device form factors as those shown in the previous slide so to give you an overview of the talk and we want to give a particular emphasis on the notion of these kind of trade-off between accuracy and ergonomics and I want to emphasize that also the results from the main study are more important because of potential future work and the implications of those results so there's usually a trade-off between practicality and accuracy for on body tracking techniques for example there are some techniques which look at the change in shape of the wrist and this happens as a result of the tendons and muscles shifting as hand gestures are formed and whilst they can be quite smaller than like they're usually not the most accurate optical techniques on the other hand are very accurate but they may not be entirely suitable for a mobile wearable system due to practical issues such as occlusion so you can't wear things like sleeves and one up inserted gloves are perhaps the most accurate solution but you probably wouldn't want to wear this everyday for long periods of time EMG can vary significantly in impracticality and accuracy depending on the number on a number of factors and no particular order this is the number of electrodes so the more you have the better but it becomes less ergonomic as you start covering your arm in electrodes secondly the type of electrodes so dry ones are more convenient but the gel ones perform better and the signals are weaker at the wrist than at the floor arm but the of course is key here that we try and restrict it to the wrist as this is conforming to existing socially wearable acceptable placements of wearables so typically EMG is used where the bulk of the muscle is and because of the stronger signal you get so the trade-off that we had assumed from moving EMG to the wrist was that the wrist location would yield worse results and also at the wrist there is less surface area so there are fewer places where you can place electrodes and it's also more difficult to differentiate between different muscles because they're so compact so we have this trade-off between economics and accuracy and the variables are shown here which contributes you each end of the spectrum so our objective is to try and find out what this trade-off in accuracy is where the focus on changing these two variables so that it's on the wrist and it's ergonomic so we performed a study with 12 participants to compare the wrist location versus the upper-mid forum location classifying individual finger digit flexion movements and for this we used two pairs of bipolar electrodes these are the dry variety with no foam and this was worn on the anterior aspect of the forearm and our results showed that actually the wrist location performed better than at the forum location and this surprised us because of course we had seen that the trade-off was that you would lose accuracy but we have a thought about you know why why is this the case and the wrist shape changes a lot due to tendon movement at the wrist as the tendons are more superficial and as explained earlier there are devices which work on this principle and there is not so much of this kind of change in musculature at the mid forearm location so it's quite quite specific to the wrist and after observing the signal in more detail we found that the EMG signals affected quite significantly by this kind of tendon movement and we theorized that this was in fact the reason why the EMG works better at the wrist so we created a hypothesis which was that the motion artifacts that arise from this tendon displacement in fact facilitates the classification of hand gestures at the wrist in order to test this hypothesis we created another experiment this time measuring the change in shape of wrist and removing the pressure modulation from the EMG signal the idea is that we treat this modulated signal as a combination of two different signals and by separating these signals we can investigate the contributions of each sensor type so in order to separate the modulation from the EMG signal we used wet electrodes with foam adding which help to remove the artifacts caused by pressure and we used these for sensitive resistors pressure sensors to infer the change in shape of the wrists as some devices deep and thus what would have caused the modulation of the EMG signal in the previous experiment so in our main study our experimental prototype had four pairs of EMG sensors which is an extension of two more from the previous one and four pressure sensors spaced evenly in between these EMG sensors our gesture set consisted of these 15 gestures consisting of both rich gestures and finger movements and we categorized these into three different subsets so our main study again had 12 different participants and each of those 15 gestures would perform 10 times each and as the gesture was performed the Machine captures and spacer and this is kind of what the data car looks like so we have EMG on top and pressure sensors on the bottom and from the from this signal we extracted several different Wandy time series features such as the rms the standard deviation and the peak amplitude and then using these features we trained a machine learning classifier so we used an SVM with an RBF kernel and we use the 10-fold cross-validation technique in order to assess the accuracy of the classification so here are our findings from the study we've got accuracy on the left-hand axis and gesture sets in the bottom and each line represents a particular configuration of sensors so FSI here is the pressure sensors it's a different name for it and to know first the EMG is quite successful when used by itself with an accurate accurate an average accuracy of above 86 percent for all gesture sets and finger gestures EMG outperforms the pressure sensing for by about 5 percent and we saw the opposite for wrist gestures with pressure sensors having an advantage of around 10 percent over EMG and we used a two-way repeated measures ANOVA and found that statistically these there is a significant complementarity between these two sensor types and for these two gesture sets so that is to say that finger where finger gestures carry classified better by EMG and that wrist gestures can be classified better by pressure sensors and when they use together they are better than when each technique is used alone and this is particularly true for the case when we're classifying the entire gesture SEPA so this includes the finger gestures and the wrist gestures so to summarize the results we think that these findings support our initial hypothesis that the motion artifacts that arise from the tendon displacement does in fact facilitate the recognition of hand gestures but furthermore in a complementary manner so in order to answer our initial question yes EMG is still effective by itself when used at the wrist for a range of gestures but can be improved significantly with pressure sensors and in particular for wrist gestures and now that we know these results we know that pressure sensor can in fact facilitate for certain types of gestures and it can be useful when used in conjunction we think that this could this could have you know potential implications for future work so for example you could combine these jeff's these sensors now so you can stack them on top of each other and in this way you have less surface area which means there's more space for senses and you may also be able to potentially measure the pressure and in fact correct this modulation from the EMG if if it's useful we didn't actually test the cross session performance of our device but they've been shown to be shift compensating algorithms in the past and this could quite easily be used for our current work but furthermore because we have pressure data which senses the shape of the wrist you could use this to infer the orientation of the device around your wrist to help get the kind of shift the orientation shift and lastly but quite importantly is that I realized that you know wet electrodes probably aren't the most ergonomic sense of type ideally you'd want it to be dry but dry electrode technology is improving and where lately results have been showing that the accuracies in fact comparable to wet electrodes and conductive dry conductive bones have also been developed recently and and this could be a replacement for the the foam that is used around wet electrodes that were reused in this experiment thank you for listening to the talk I am happy to answer any questions you may have yeah Gerald from Openlab Newcastle University and so did you you said he didn't get cross session drift what about during the session and also did you see HC did you require placement of the sensors and very careful positions before you started no actually we we kind of so the positions look like this so you they're pretty much the same for each person then because because the wrist is so small in fact there's not really much much place for variation anyway yeah what was the first part of the question so during the session did you have any drift yeah in the census no no we didn't a tennis pawn over Xavier was a trained as a user independent as a player award did you design it like you trained for a particular user yeah it was another life there's a tyrant and yes you did it like posted it analyzes all the data all right pardon was it imposed another license or did you also had a life classification oh no it was it was done post but the classification could run in real time and we found that it agree you could run in sort of a few milliseconds for the classification okay thanks cuz the bomber from economic thanks for talk I have a question you showed quite high accuracies for the finger flexion for solely EMG did you see a difference for let's say thumb and pinky because those are the muscles that are located close to the wrist and for the other fingers the muscles are located far away from the from the wrists did you see a difference when you you looked at the results in detail actually I in the paper there were there is a confusion matrix so you can see I think yeah so this is the confusion matrix for finger gestures which includes the thumb actually and I think know that the thumb that then was actually okay though they're pretty much the same across the board okay thanks oh you went from sin why University so I wondering if the finger gestures are static or not or I mean if you maintain the gestures when you test them or they are inactive for the recognition so it seems from the the picture of the gestures they are static right but you hold this yeah so it's so we record for a duration of about two and a half seconds about two and a half seconds and that's that's for like flexion and extension thank you one last question um you said you will use the temple cross-validation what other polls and why didn't you maybe just leave one out so yeah we did do a leave when I went out test 10-fold cross-validation so so we trained it on nine of the subsets and then we classified the last fold and then we iterated ten times okay you
