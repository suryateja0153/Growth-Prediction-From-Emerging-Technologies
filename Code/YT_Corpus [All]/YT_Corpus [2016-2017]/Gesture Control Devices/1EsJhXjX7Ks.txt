 in our next project project soli we explore how can we use small set of fine finger gestures to control everything around us in technical terms so li can be described as a small tiny picker radar for gesture sensing it's a radar and we created new radar sensors running as CC gigahertz that can track hand gesture using novel algorithms that we developed which allows us to create completely new gesture languages and gesture interfaces so we develop a vision with your hand is the only control that you need one moment is a virtual dial or slider or a button and using this virtual controls you should be able to control any device around you with the same set of gestures where both speakers or any other objects Internet of the things world we decided that by this Google i/o not only we're going to improve it what are we going to make it run it on a SmartWatch for example we had to drastically decrease size and power of the of the entire system by working with our partners at Infineon we completely design a solid ship we optimize the rudder control algorithms overall system architecture and reduce power consumption 22 times from 1.2 watt to 54 Millie what what slowly allow us to do is to expand the interaction of the touchscreen into the 3d space around it so you don't have to you know use the tiny screen to interact with you watch it to interact with information on the watch we using large gestures around the word so you can move your hand like this and you can scroll through messages or see see parts of the interface pattern informations so we didn't build solid just for smartwatches we think it as a generic interaction platform to control all sort of devices with a very simple set of simple gestures also allow us to control the speaker you can see I can you now use the virtual tool to turn it on okay let's try another track so to conclude so Lee's introduction platform for connected world it proposes new universal instructional experience because multiple connected products of the future it can be wearable mobile Internet of Things automotive industrial this it's all up to your imagination what it does it offers a third dimension of interaction which complements and enhances our the interaction modalities such as touchscreen and voice input we don't fight with them we work together and working with our partners such as Harman LG Infineon and others we want to bring this new experience to products
