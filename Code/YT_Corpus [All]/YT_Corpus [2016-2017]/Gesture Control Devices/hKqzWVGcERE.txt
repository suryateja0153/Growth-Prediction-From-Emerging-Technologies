 you know textiles at scale and our presenters today will be non wangkong and she hopeful Kihara thank you my name is nama gana this is my colleague hoof cara and we're here to present predator card interactive digital textile at scale so a project a card is about manufacturing interactive textiles and interactive garments that skill we're inspired by this world full of objects that are made with textiles so imagine if you can make textile that is interactive that means that we can make almost everything around us interactive which brings us a step closer to my crisis vision about your biggest computing in 1991 how the interactivity will be woven into our everyday lives now we look at what we're used to interacting with these days this the display of our smartphones if you really think about the touchscreen of structure the capacitive touch sensor has this roll and column conductive traces that gives you the X Y position of your finger touch and it's similar to how weaving works because we have the warp and the weft in a loom and this is really similar to the woven textile so imagine if you just changed some of the conductive yarn in the woven textile structure we can actually leave a touch screen with soft textiles and now our first attempt as you can see on the right is a a woven patch of the touch screen that's similar to a touch screen but it sucked moreover just imagine that you can't survive it it can be presented in any materials that were used to in textile sell cool in any color materials and even in different patterns so if we think about interactivities in our material in this way you can start thinking about gadgets and devices for more about materials and the interactivity can comes in a jacket okay so so we're about an interactive garment it's not a new concept this is an example from 20 years ago done in the MIT Media Lab about a Levi's music jacket but the technique that they used back then is embroidery and as with all a lot of the DIY etek style projects but embroidery with conductive yarn works it's designed for functionalities and it's not for aesthetics it's like an additive manufacturing approach instead of working on the base material and another example of existing of related work is mass-produced functional wares we can see these in the market but it focused on sportswear it focuses on biometric detection having sensors on a shirt it's not focused on interactivity like what we want to do in project a card and we also see a lot of really great work this is a piece by Maggie orthe in own eye and it's color-changing textile but this kind of project shows us that woven textiles are connectorized by hand is impossible to scale so given our previous work search and we realized that in order to design for skill it requires a lot of innovation in both of materials in the production techniques so we created this map this is a simplified map of how a garment is put together starting from the ground up from the yarn manufacturing and this is how we started an exploration of my project on the manufacturer interactive garments at scale so Shiho is gonna talk about the yarn and the textile and how we put the garments together thanks no way so I like to start from the young because that young is essential element of the textile production so this is the catalog or the young swatches that textile designers use and this is the example of the conductivity and that people use now and the problem was that there were not many variety of materials and choices or colors and one of the common stainless steels were not suitable and the other expensive are silver so they're exposing these exposed young are connected to electronics by hand sewing and they are exported that because it exposed that it oxidized and short with component easily so this is jacquard low and column structure okay capacitive sensing creates intersection between yarns without proper installation the lines will short each others yeah okay so we have to come up with the problem so we had this we have to invent our own yarn so it has to be compatible with electronic productions and robust enough to stand on existing looms and also it to give more choices to material to create to produce variety of products in future so this is our design to solve these problems we have copper as a code to give enough conductivity and much they might multi-layer braided to structure insulates the the copper so that's how look so braiding gives the young ultimate strength so when it put the outer layer contracts the inner tighten structure to improve the strengths for bending and pulling of the undoing the weaving and washing process so that enough starts work on any any existing room so here we have rods yeah that that's the you can try data to break our here so this is the this is our yarns so by pressing the outer layer we can design the yarn in any colors any materials cotton silk polish a wool and so on so I still show you how that works remaking so we're making our young in Japan it's actually this technique is not so common in textile it's it's actually coat making we got the idea from when you look at the kimono when you have a at the end of the wearing kimono on the top of the belt you have coat and we pull the core so strong and we look at that that it's beautiful you can change the material and it's strong enough and this is very traditional place and our spirit don't know how to write email so we have to visit him all the time so this is our young so if you see the variety of the so we tested our young and it's actually can the test result of the yelling of a single strand of finish shows that it can stand eight pounds of the pulling force so it's about three kilometres quite strong okay so after we made our young we have to move to weaving interacted textile so the textile production industries hasn't change over two hundred years so this is the picture nineteenth century and today this is how our loom looks like it's called Dhabi and jacquard so this one is jacquard so we can actually with the so are woven sensing grades we can create a large area of interactivity so you can actually move and all across what when the West but moreover we can selectively place more interactive patches anywhere of the textile with multiple layer even structure using 3d weaving technique so the yarn goes up top surface then switch to bottom surface and the float which is important for connector ization later so because our young is strong enough we can actually use any looms existing so he's our weaver he knows how to use handle thanks God so what you don't have to be the him all the time so this is our young so you can see that on the walk which is what practical and also horizontal and this one is quite big scale okay so because it's fabric we can actually design any shapes of the pattern you like on the surface so this is the example our jacket textile we can weave the patches into any shape like circle or triangle oh can we make it completely like wool and as part of the textile design you see it on the bottom you have this interactive parties here so it's part of the texture and you can make it completely invisible in the world and also very fine garment like silk and also of stretchable too and of course we can produce in the super logical - so after weaving fabric it goes to very aggressive finishing process that happens to every fabric so this is tying our young and textile are robust enough to go through this process so I'll show you this is the this is the another example finishing changing burning the textile when you read that the denim you have a fluffy part you have to burn it and if you burn your mobile.phone won't survive so this is some Friday stretching the fabric over the hot iron rolls to make its shape also so our instance that stretch strong hearts how cool environment so after we'll meet our young so our next step is called garment construction so that's kind of the basic process you have fashion Italy you measure your body and you have sewing studio you cut the fabric and sew together and the tailor shop to put again over the body and they sought to adjust it so it is known that making garment means that turning flat surface into 3d shapes so but this didn't change all by years and we have to carefully plan the location interactive areas so that that you know get even in the right location when we make a fabric and for decades I patent as well so we have to collaborate with apparel makers so this is the one of the example we made so that this one was made in London at the Sevilla observe at the Sevilla oops this is not playing too bad so actually Sevilla didn't change that the way how they create the common this is strange but it's actually play something we can hear the music I could talk over so basically that he didn't have to know and like knowledge like what it did does what this does and there's no knowledge for doing electronics so he just was given our role and we made we show him this instruct this this illustration asked them to say this kind of fluffy yawns coming out we didn't tell him what it was but please make sure it plays here and he just cut in the sole and put it together and when we fin well if he finished no we went to through to London and indeed a soldering and the connects today looks like components and then on the video well sorry can show you now but please sit down on website it does work so when you swipe it's connected to bluetooth so I could call phone call and he said oh my god holy you didn't know what it was before okay so I pass it - no way okay thank you she holy okay so once the garment is designed as you can see like we have different clothing patterns it's on a row and it's cut it's being constructed and then it's like from the textile industry they need to give it to us because this is like a marriage of the two worlds so the next step is how do we connect array so how do we connect the electronics to textile something that's soft at the very beginning of the project we were like yeah we just get really really thin wires and solder them together it's not everyday this is how it looks like it does not work very well and then we try with like snaps because like clothing accessory it can do this but it doesn't work at all so so we try to use like some more advanced manufacturing technique I use flexible PCB and I try to design this board that has the same pitch of the degrade but as you can see we create a really really fragile compact point between the yarn and the pet and if that's the case then we will have to construct the garment like this with solder joints that's just that doesn't work it breaks very easily so if you solve this problem we caught your pen and we started trying to develop this 3d woven textile structures just designed for connector ization so as Gio just mentioned we can create patches small or big but more importantly this can be in 3d so we can design this is all woven front of loom we can design a 3d structure with floating yarns in the places that we want we can even sort them to the pitch that we want so this free free like dimension allows us to introduce a machine in the place where the scissors is and we create this flow of collector izing the textile to electronics so the first step is how do we ribbon eyes this floating yarns we have a jig - ribbon eyes it and the second step is to strip the insulator of the yarn and exposed a conductive copper so we tested with the laser and heat stripping both are like really common equipment in the textile factory in fact and and it's similar to cable assembly so we use hot barramundi to bond like a PCB to these wires and steel with epoxy so the water won't seep through the of the wire to the electronics and the next step is encapsulation we encapsulate with silicon so it's been resistant so this is one example of how how the connector looks like as you can see it's ready to be connected to the electronics world so we make this first prototype and with processing unit that communicates with the phone and like a power unit that charges this device and it runs more than a week and once we have this for the prototype we're ready to do some function tests and usability tests and the first thing that we're interested in is you know does it work for a long period of time is the strong with you I mean this strong for pulling but what happens if we use it for three years so we just assume that if we are developing a product there's a three year expectancy and maybe use it 200 days per year 20 times per day so we've got this robotic arm to do the same gesture over and over again and it turns out the recognition rate is about 95 point 12 percent which is great the the test looks like this and after thought well twelve thousand swipe there's no visible damage on the garment and you can see like it's doing okay next thing that we did is like a usability evaluation with people as you can see the rate is not as great as the robot because we're not robots we have 12 participants and we asked them to do three gestures let's write and hold on there are three different conditions you can read the details in the paper but there are three really critical design factors that we found through the study that is increase the gesture of cognition rate in the interactive clothing the the body posture is really important like how what posture were in and where you place the interactive is really important but most importantly is the correlation between them okay so once are we're ready with the test we think that we can start trying to explore the marketing and user experience going back to our vision and our inspiration we pick two examples one is with when Intergraph in traffic clothing another is with interactive environment with a IOT environment so yep the poem running out of time but so this is the application that we have as you can see that it is just a heat map of the sensor data and also we have applications that allows you to link different gestures to different intention and Android app so you can use it to call different functionalities like call a number or even call uber so different gestures linked to different applications or activities in your phone we that the project was released at the Google i/o last year and this was the demo that we had for the 6,000 users to you know abuse this piece of textile that 7 meters long we have Internet of Things demos including lighting music controls and this is like a 2d heat map of the interaction and I would like to conclude my talk by saying that the goal of project jacquard is to build a platform and we're at just at the very beginning of the textile structure and just connecting electronics and you know connecting things data to the cloud to the mobile phone devices and our goals to create a community so that everyone can eventually make your own interactive garments and and our first project partnership was released last year at Google i/o and next week is the Google i/o this year it will be on the 20th 10:00 a.m. and we'll have the latest news about project cart and you're welcome to join us and we're also hiring please thank you hello dawn from MIT Media Lab I loved about this project a quick question here are you thinking of ways to show some output on on the clothes like using thermochromic displays or stuff like that yes we definitely have a project we work with Berkeley and there's a paper tomorrow please come into the talk thank you
