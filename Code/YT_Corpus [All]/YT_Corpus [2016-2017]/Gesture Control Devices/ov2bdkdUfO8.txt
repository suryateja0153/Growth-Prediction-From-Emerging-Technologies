 hi this is a demonstration of digitally controlled home automation project so this is a system that allows the user to control home appliances just by using his mobile phone so for this purpose the user can control is the PO appliances using DTMF connection a DTMF stands for dual-tone multi-frequency where a user can call this mobile number here this mobile attached to the system and then pass the values of which loads to turn on and which loads to turn off that is in simple words after calling the user will just del 1 2 3 4 2 & 5 to turn on and off these loads so for this purpose we are using a DTF decoder along with the multiplexer and flip-flop ices to achieve this and the entire system is powered by a 12 volt transformer and these lamps are used to demonstrate at loads AC loads so let's see a life working of the system so the system as we turned on now now what we need to do is call at this particular number to the phone attached to the system so let's make the call and let's pick it up here so once the call is in picked up we can now use a DT of technology to dial one two three four we must type one to turn the load one on so as you can see on the tapping one load one I was turned on similarly two three four and five to turn on respective loads similarly pressing the same number again turns off that load so as you can see this is how we can use the system literally controlled control home appliances without making use of a microcontroller so this is how the project works thank you
