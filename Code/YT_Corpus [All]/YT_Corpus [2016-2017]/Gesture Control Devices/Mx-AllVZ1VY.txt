 good morning it's really nice to be back we were here for the last start somewhat about a year ago you're a half now and yeah we got all sorts of cool stuff to show you today so my name if you don't know me is Eric Seidel I'm the manager of the flutter project at Google and if you haven't heard flutter while we do what it says on the tin we help you build beautiful fast apps for iOS and Android and I think we just get right into it so we started out with this mission to build a better way to develop for mobile and you might ask yourself why why would we need or want to do that and some of it comes because much of my team did mobile development themselves wrote apps themselves before coming to flutter and as we were starting out we talked to a bunch of other mobile devs both inside and outside of Google and we kept hearing sort of the same refrains the most common complaint that we heard was that folks have trouble with mobile that mobile is expensive to them because they have to learn two systems two languages two frameworks deploy to two different kinds of devices and they end up building two teams or three teams if you end up building for the mobile web or not including of course your desktop and and other web teams and you end up then with this disparate feature sets so your iOS version does one thing and your Android version does another and your users end up confused another complaint that we heard was that even just developing what for mobile depending on what you're using can be slow we heard cycle times inside Google ranging from a minute to tens of minutes so we heard about clean builds that were over an hour and this can be obviously expensive and it's also your user expectations on mobile are higher than they were on desktop than they were on the web they expect you to stick to their finger you expect the app to dance underneath underneath you and to do that sort of delightful can be hard and then of course you have to do it twice and finally we talked to a bunch of teams and asked them about whether they were using existing cross-platform solutions and some of them had tried them but the feedback we got there was that they weren't willing to accept the compromises and they listed things like compromises in performance compromises in being able to meet their design expectations or compromises in terms of reaching their user expectations the expected feel and so with this information we thought to ourselves I mean come on we had done lots of various other development we knew that there must be a better way we felt that you should be able to build a single unified team where you have one team where you can send all your code reviews you know one single codebase you should be able to build features only once and make them maybe twice as beautiful with twice the people that custom could and should be easy and that once you've done your awesome custom branded thing it should be portable and then finally that dev cycles could be fast I mean we had this on the web right we have sub-second dev cycles for some configurations why can't we do that on mobile and so we set out to build something and well we built some cool stuff so I want to show you and I'm going to start movement of this device here and so what I have in front of you as it boots up there we go what I have in front of you today is an Iowan android app on which i've installed or sorry an iOS an android phone um not particularly new phones on which i've installed one of our demo apps the flutter gallery we built this to show off all the widgets that we've built for Google teams and the first thing you'll notice is it's fast you may not have even noticed that but or you may not even seen it was so fast but it just boom right back up it's fast it sticks to your finger it scrolls the animations are smooth the next thing you might notice is that it's pretty like the text is pretty on both iOS and Android different you know fonts the animations are pretty the widget sets are pretty you get a ton of widgets just out of the box and then of course one thing you'll also notice is that it should feel natural like it does the balance on iOS it does the over scroll on an Android the iconography is different as you would expect and even the gestures are different but there's one more thing which is particularly applicable to this crowd in that everything you've seen so far every pixel every widget every gesture even the compositor and the text editing is all dark so let's go back to the slides we can toggle or tada so what did we just see so hopefully you got to see well first of all that footer is real it's a thing it exists it's fast and again scrolls fast it animates smoothly it responds to your finger it should be pretty it's beautiful it has tons of beautiful widgets built in it does animations easily and it should feel natural and be natural we believe strongly that you should come to the user you should match their expectations that if their thumb has some muscle memory about what to do that that's what your app should do and so we embrace that with flutter that you're not writing one least common denominator app rather you're writing the app that fits the users expectations of the device that is installed on so we're obviously not the first to think about cross-platform there's many others in this space but I do think that we there's a bunch of insights that we have some things that we chose to do differently that I think do make us special and the first that I want to talk about is actually how we went about building this so when we went to build this we went looking around for what is the technology stack that that a better cross-platform solution should be built on and we were perhaps a little bit surprised that it was all just lying right in front of us but the difficulty was that these awesome pieces of technology were actually buried deep in other platforms buried under layers and layers and layers of legacy and tons of features that either didn't matter on mobile or they didn't need anymore and so we went digging quite a while we went mining in the hills and I think we pulled out a bunch of really nice golden nuggets and this matters to you because this is battle-hardened software this is not you know from green implementation this is just the slim down and awesomest versions of the platform's that you already know and love so like we took some of our graphics stack from chrome some of our graphic stack from Android we took a bunch of our text from WebKit and chrome but way way way slimmed down as a pair as to what is in those platforms and of course we actually started on a totally different language that didn't work out so well we tried a couple other languages those didn't work out so well and went on a rather long search in which we found eventually dart and we use an even slightly slimmed down version of dart inside our executable so the second insight that we had in building this was that we learned that other platforms that have these expansive api's particularly these cross-platform these expansive API surfaces that are often least common denominator and they're all packed inside the engine itself the down below the widgets other platforms often are like icebergs you see and deal with the top little level widget layer but there's so much buried under the surface we tried to invert that with flutter and this matters to you because it means it puts you way more in control we found that dev cared about the fact that we had shoved all of our interesting code up into the framework layer which meant even things that you might not have expected here like editing and our gesture detection and our compositor etc it's all up at the framework layer which means that you can you know jump to definition all the way down see exactly what we've done fork change you're in full control and due to the beauty of dart and darts ability to tree shank you only pay for what you use so another insight week that we had in building this was that modern mobile developer well modern mobile os's don't necessarily need to ship a UI framework they do today obviously but we've seen success on desktop we've seen success on the web that many applications ship beautiful apps bundling their own and the same is now true on mobile you see this all over the place with games no game uses the built on to the rom system there is no built under the ROM system for games they all bring their own beautiful engine and do amazing experiences with them and we found that there was an advantage to doing the same on mobile and why this matters doing the same for apps and why this matters to you is that it puts you again more in control you can deploy way back in time to older phones to older os's when the tides change and you want to change your look and feel you don't have to wait for your users to upgrade so you can use the latest widget you just push them a new version that you compiled yourself the next insight we had was less about technology and more about market shift we looked at what people were doing on mobile we looked at what the best apps were what were the apps that were winning awards what were the apps that users were downloading and it turns out there's a lot of custom and this is a growing segment we see the the best-in-class user experiences our bespoke experiences that are very brand forward very custom and so we decided that we want to target this that we wanted to build a system that was designed to make this easy and the value for you is obviously if it does make it easy you can do more of this yourself so let's go back to that demo and we will I want to show you that same demo but now with a different understanding so this time we only need to use the Android phone so go ahead launch the gallery again so now you understand again that all of this is Dart everything you see everything you feel is all Dart and one of the cool things you can do or something I'm here to do to illustrate how custom this really is is that there's this little debugging feature we have where we can change what the framework thinks it's running on and I can tell the framework you're running on iOS and now magically you have different scroll physics you have a bounce you have different iconography and you have cool gestures and I'm not telling you you would ever want to ship this because again we believe in coming to the user and matching their expectations but what this is is an illustration to you of how much control you have if you want to have a back shimmy you know go for it the entire gesture detector is yours to control so let's go do our little shimmy between devices again go back to the slides so that was our demos we are at a developer conference so we should talk a little bit about development I think maybe we should show you what it's like to develop a flower app so let's go ahead and bust out IntelliJ which is a popular editor at Google there's many editors or you can write flutter code in but this one happens to be nice so let's go ahead and create a new project and we also have a flutter plugin for IntelliJ actually just released last night um which makes make some of this easier so we go to footer and let's make a totally rad demo we'll call it rad demo and what's happening there is that it is going off and telling you photo tooling to go create the underlying Xcode project create the underlying Android build setup and dump you a very small little flutter app and so now we have our little 70 line demo flutter app most of which is comments which we just click the Run button and it again tells the footer tooling go run this on some connected device tell it it doesn't have to know and flutter of course abstract cyou away from the idea of is this android or is this iOS it's just a mobile thing to you but the mobile thing we're going to run on today is this iOS simulator here so here we have you know whatever that was 90 seconds in we have running on iOS and Android our very first flutter app and it just has a little counter put to the button Croesus but we can make this fancier and that's what I actually want to show you so say we don't like blue because we like green instead we'll just change it maybe my designer likes orange today now I'll go back to green yeah so we measure our development cycle in milliseconds and you'll notice that we never lost any state we still tap the button seven times our app is still running but we can do more complicated things so say we want to change this text maybe this is touched we have to date the text you see of course it changes maybe you want to change this Center too we can make this a column we run it oops we made an error we can see it IntelliJ it tells us it's underlining this child saying that is not a valid parameter for column and flutter took the the reload but it's like ah I don't know what to do ah no I could go read the docs to remember what column does orga just click on column because again all of our code is up in dart you can just keep clicking all the way down we can go read and say oh Colin takes children not child of course so we change this to children and now now it's still mad enough the analyzer is still giving us little red squiggles which were used to in dark so let's change this to be an array like that's the one I wanted and then we can of course reformat it and we run it again and we've still touched it seven times we fixed our air so let's go ahead and add some more text because why not new text demos are fun and now we have two lines of text we could maybe change the spacing right on this we could do main axis alignment spread evenly spaced evenly sure great now they're all spaced out we could do something a little more exciting we can do like new flutter logo that's too small we'll fix the size there we go hey well maybe we'll change the color whoops colors there you go so obviously you could build much more complicated things than that but that's what photo development is and here again it took us two minutes to do this tiny little pretty app um but I want to show you more than just IntelliJ because maybe you don't like we're getting an ID that's fine some of my team work and Emacs or vim so just like our framework is layered heavily layered we also have done our tools in layers so we can pull out a command line and let's up the size a little bit and we have a little flutter tool which you know spews all the commands that it supports the flutter tool abstracts away the idea of mobile so you don't have to care about iOS or Android it just handles the details for you so if we like connect our Android device here this is our physical device we were just using and we say type flutter devices you know flutter now shows this both of course we also some other fun commands in here like you can take screenshots and do performance profiling and debugging and stuff all from the command line we can do flutter dr. flutter dr. is something that we built because we found our customers had some trouble getting all the various pieces of mobile development set up so we wrote a little helper helped them know how to walk through the steps and verify if their environment was set up correctly but so we can go back to our to our demo that we both write so we wrote this rad demo oops and we can just flutter run it let's do it in release mode so we can use darts ‰Ùt and we'll do it on our Nexus device and so while that goes ahead and builds I'm going to go ahead and swap back over so right now flutter is talking to the underlying tool chain and it you know it goes and gets itself a donut or whatever the tool chain does and then it'll come back to us with a signed apk and it'll install an apk on our device it looks like it's finishing up now again this is not your development workflow but now we have our released ready to send to the store app that still counts buttons running on Android pick it up take away so that was a taste of our developer experience there's a whole talk on our developer experience after this one if you want to learn more there's lots of interesting details there let's talk about what we saw or maybe wasn't all obvious one of things you did see again is the fast developer cycle we're doing sub-second millisecond measure developer cycle you got to see a little taste of our functional reactive framework you can learn a lot more about it it funded on i/o but this is just a modern way to write you eyes the idea is it simplifies the data flow in your application it's easy for you to understand where the data is going because it always goes from your model to your view you write that code once and then of course you did get to see a little bit of the to the metal nature we compiled straight to native code on Android we are of course talking to the GPU part of how we get fast so but we all haven't just been building technology for the last year and a half since we last talked we also have been actually shipping this technology but just inside Google so we are entirely an open-source project but we do know how important it is that we have Google customers when we talk to externals are like well what apps at Google are shipping with this what apps with Google have this on the Play Store and the answer is there's a lot in progress but none are shipping today but we have had close relationships with Google teams we've been paving the road right in front of them as they've been building out we've been working with them to make sure that we're building the right thing that it's being battle-hardened as we go and one of the teams that is visiting today so I can talk about their app a little bit is the Google CRM these guys had used dart already successfully on the web and also built themselves an Android app natively in Java and then they came to flutter because they were not particularly interested in paying to build another team to do an iOS app like hey can we take some of our dart knowledge our Android familiarity and just build for mobile and they did and they said it took them you know less time fewer engineers less code I got 3x the productivity versus their Android build-out and they also of course got the other OS for free so I should tell you that we are still tech preview and that's you know for variety reasons but we're not entirely ready for all apps that's not what I'm here to tell you today we have very much tested our hypotheses we know that the hard stuff is done we're working really on production ization now all the testing make sure that all our matrices of devices that sit are all covered and we do have some big arcs of work left some of which we've started on you know making sure our accessibility is amazing making sure our internationalization is amazing making sure you can develop for Windows which I suspect many in this audience do but all of our source is open on github today you can try flutter today you can watch us do development and of course there's more to learn about our flutter today there's not just this talk there's more about our dev cycle in the next talk they talk about all the cool stuff that was built in Dart to make flutter possible at later talks and you're hearing from one of our customers this afternoon so I hope you agree that we've made some significant progress since we last talked there's no more spinning cubes we're a little past that I hope that you better understand after this talk how our approach to mobile is different we're not using OEM widgets you know we're doing direct to the metal and that we believe that this provides us some unique advantages and I also hope that you understand that even though you don't see it in the wild yet flutter is actively at use in Google there are lots of people writing flutter code and you can learn a lot more at fluttered IO so thank you all very much you
