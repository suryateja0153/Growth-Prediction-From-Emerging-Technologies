 good morning we are from s we assemble the project title name is called vision of an intelligent combat robot for war field horse self-regulation robot for military application in this project I am using an battery power source not transformer I am using wireless camera it is in 2.4 gigahertz camera so those are evey cameras ok I am using PC and 1gb module that is our fzb module 2.4 gigahertz receiver I am using so here like this I am using an camera so this is av camera so we are giving these two outputs for the USB that is able to USB converter and I am giving an 9 walls power supply 500 milliamps this is transmitter unit and this is receiver unit you can connect it to the computer or you can connector to the TVs but depends upon your requirement and this is my block diagram in this project I am using an m7 l pc - 1 4 8 it sent 32-bit microcontroller so in this microcontroller I am interfacing ultrasonic sensor it's an obstacle sensor up to 1 meter distance it can detect that obstacle is present or absent if the present the robot will be take left direction or right direction depend upon my requirement and there is one another sense of that sensor is metal detector sensor here normal metal detector sensor it will detect the metal and it will gives the input to the microcontroller microcontroller if the metal is detected then the robot will be stops and it gives the alarm and it gives sending the SMS to the predefined mobile number of GPRS latitude and longitude values and I am going to control the robot by using a zig beam with forward backward left right stop if the robot is going on the forward direction if I am giving you forward command then ultrasonic sensor it if the robot is going forward direction any obstacle will come the robot will fetch some abstractly scheme so the robot will come back it will take left and right and it goes forward so we have a a V camera that a V camera is fixed on one l293d when DC motor upper side so we are going to turn the robot camera left direction right duration left direction right direction continuously so why because of we need to get the image from front ahead and we I am using n the components arm seven power supply l293d ZigBee module ultrasonic and al-ahram metal detector and wireless AV camera and gsm sim 900 GPRS model I am using kill software and embedded C language kill micro vision for embedded C flash magic so dumping the program onto the microcontroller and input/output like that we are using n hyper terminal means we will see the output on the weather metal detector or not and we are giving the input from the keyboard so this is my unit so so I am using 12 volts one pint three amps batteries so one battery is connected to the ARM processor board and ZigBee model a sixteen cross two LCD display and ultrasonic sensor and this AV camera is connected to the is doing the power supply op some separate battery and there is one ultrasonic you know there is one metal detector that is given to the battery power source separate battery for the metal detector camera separate power supply and this battery for the separate power supply with the motives and here separate battery is there that was connected to the G GPRS modelling 900 I am giving a GPRS settings it become it works under HTTP protocol and so the AV camera is transmitted the data and AV receiver will receive the data I am giving am taking an easy cap so it will take input AV and it is giving to the computer there they are giving separate CD to this and whenever you are installed you you can see the output on to the your computer so this is an RF receiver 2.4 gigahertz receiver and it has to be connected to the PC dogle okay so here this is an 4 pin ultrasonic obstacle sensor ok and this is in metal detector this is SIM 900 850 megahertz to 1800 mega H frequency it works under 9600 baud rate okay I am using an atoll SIM card so this is an RF model it is connected to the max 232 and that was connected to the UART 1 and the UART 0 it is connected to the GSM modem so here this is an ARM processor development board in this development board I am taking an EEG rectifier filter capacitors separate 0 for a regulator after that I am getting 5 volts output that 5 was is giving to the LCD this is 16 cross 2 LCD display whatever the process is going on to the controller that should be displayed on the LCD and here match to 32 is called it works under 5 volts so it is communicate with WR u at 0 and U at e1 there is internally to UART options are there so we are sending the data and we are receiving the data and we have to l293d SR there one l293d for 2 DC motors another l293d is connected to the this cable and here one op-amp is there a operational amplifier will amplify the signal of here I am taking the metal detector it gives the 9 volts output but if I am giving the 9 volts output to the l-29 arm processor that ARM processor will damage so that's why I am taking the operational amplifier will amplify the signal and gives the output of 33.5 volts so this will take the three pan-fry words as an input or output so here total of 64 pin IC 2 ports port 0 and port 1 port zero consists of 0.02 0.31 31 pins Porto 1 consists of 4 2 1.15 to 1 that 31 total 16 so it can execute a 16-bit architecture and 32-bit architecture here 12 megahertz crystal is there crystal is the heart of the circuit for the controller to generate the clock pulses to the internal CPU to run the program and we have to push buttons are there whenever we are going to dump the program why are you at a zero we need to press ISP button and press M release the reset then only the program will be dumped onto the ARM processor okay after program dump you need to execute you need to press and release the reset button then only the program will be execute so now I am going to execute this project wait so I connected to the PC one is for the ZigBee module is connected to the USB and AV receiver also connected to the ESB cap ok so here I am going to open the camera so it is in video and this is the hyper terminal so we have to watch the data on to the computer of a V and here the output so now I am going to operate on the supply here now i only all the power supplies so and now I am going to on the main power source ok you can see the output self military application wait for 2 seconds it will send the data to the GPRS and we will get the output onto the PC ok so here there is no metal detector and ultrasonic no and a robot once so you can see the output okay okay now I am going to give here no forward Direction no I am pressing the far body F no I want to all operate the camera see see D funny okay we have to see the where the obstacle is present if we continuously operate yay captain I suppose forward action is going in the obstacle chain it will take some metals suppose the robot is coming forward direction Oh cor anyone is not like metal is detected it is taking this GPRS data and it is sending the data to the particular mobile number latitude value language or valium GPRS Center here also the metal is detected okay similarly where they continue to talk on this publish' found this oil attorney I detected I detected the output bomb detector bomb detector of latitude value and longitude value if I am pressing it will ask for the maps maps okay always it is going for this satellite ya Wincott ready : go to Punk and it is showing the latitude value and the longitude value with exact places okay okay object okay it will show the exact way the exit where the bomb has detected latitude value and longitude value so bomb detection using GPRS so the GPRS model will detect the exact accident occurred exact bomb has detected that bomb plays will fixed and that should be displayed on the camera okay after that metal is detected metal is detected so now we are going for the camera to detect where the bomb is present so we are taking C D means left right left right and the robot will so go there and we will detect that and we will defuse that after that we are going to add some handle so diffusion we are going for a pickin place robot in this project and we are adding to the future on that thanking you there is any doubt let me know to SVS embedded
