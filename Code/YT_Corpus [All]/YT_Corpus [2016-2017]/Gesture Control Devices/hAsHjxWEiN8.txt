 thank you i'm judy kaye as you probably could guess this is the work of my PhD student Chris arcade and my colleague Martin Tomic's from the design school so I want to introduce this since we're doing a bit of a shift it's a gesture-based display but it's really about the user representation for feedback so what is the context and motivation of our work and it is a system that is on the outside of a building that you see on the left there facing onto a courtyard with the theater across and there is the display we use a connect to detect the user gestures and here's an example of it at play the user swipes to move it along arm up to get more detail and then swipes along and then again can put an arm up to do a like so this was designed so that people walking through our courtyard could come along and see this exciting display funded by our Dean because he thought what else would you want to do they know about the research and the faculty of engineering when you come to the theater and so we built this display and here's the part of it that is about research in the faculty there were actually 132 to 155 items depending on when we were running it because we actually had other content too so the idea was you came along like the person you saw and you had to on the fly first of all notice that you could interact decide you want to and then learn how to do the gestures because I assume none of you knew that those were the gestures and then of course you have to read our wonderful content so this is the context it's a large display predicted on a glass wall just to make things harder it only operates at night there are pedestrians walking on these routes unlikely to catch them mostly they're catching the train and theatre goers who perhaps got a bit more time until the bell goes so what's all this about user representation and we had a hint of it in a previous talk obviously it's partly for feedback prefer large screen display it's much more important so here in case you missed it in the previous slide is the skeleton that is the user representation in one of the conditions we looked at now this display is our coding interface you've seen the depth image on the left the users didn't see that the main display is what the users did see and then there's some coding stuff on the top so here we have the other our user representation a silhouette and otherwise your sing again this is the coding interface the user only saw the stuff that doesn't have the depth image that they look awfully similar in this case just enlarge this is a skeleton this is a silhouette and y know if did we want to compare them well we started our work and we looked at what happened in our own in the wild studies when we analyzed data from the longest sessions and this is the sort of stuff we saw they weren't there reading about the Faculty of engineering and it's researched they were dancing really dancing there was lots of play there was some browsing I don't do under rate that but we got to seriously consider this issue of play which to be honest I hadn't I would also point out that nearly all large screen display work has involved playful interfaces I think I see why now anyway that wasn't where we came from we then did quite a lot of work published last year and you become on could people learn the gestures and in that we also had the same issue that there was a lot of playfulness like this person here who is clearly well probably not the least bit interested in the content by when we didn't interviews people could actually tell us about some of the content but this person is absolutely plain so we asked ourselves could it be the skeleton that's causing all this play so at this point the next bit of the background I have to give you is why do we need a user representation for a system like this and there are several reasons I briefly mentioned them slee all of us have a lot of displays and we tend not to notice the much it's called display blindness but when the display echoes something you do you're more likely to notice it interaction blindness is because most people don't expect to be able to interact with large screen displays and again the skills and perhaps gives you a hint it's really important for helping people learn the gestures since it's echoing what they do and we thought it would encourage engagement all of these so we designed a study with three hypotheses the first was that the silhouette would be more likely to have people do browsing which was our original design goal but the skeleton would be more playful and we are still convinced we need to think bit more about that and we are working on that but thirdly that the skeleton would be associated with longer stays because if you remember I said that we initially analyzed the longest staying sessions and they had a lot of play so what do we do we collected 56 days of data with roughly similar numbers of people in each condition and fairly similar sessions where a session is when the first person in a group enters and is tracked by the Kinect and it ends when the last person that group leads we did lots of automatic analysis of the sort you'd expect the time at which things happened and the gestures that were recognized and so on but we did qualitative analysis using the interface you saw before to determine whether people were playing or not and to get a sense of what the interaction looked like and here are results so first of all previous work had led us to expect there be a difference between the conditions on this first measure so this is looking at the percentage of people who face the display compared with those actually detected and it's pretty much the same certainly not statistically significantly different however of those users facing you can see there is a statistically significant difference in the numbers that actually went on to interact and in this case the silhouette looks as though it's doing quite a lot better as we'd expected the session length also was quite different in this case with the skeletons being quite long compared you know almost a hundred compared to about 70 seconds quite a long time to spend in a public space we then teased out the details of the play and non play i put use here because it would fit in the table it means browsing seriously serious use and here we found again the same picture the silhouette had seventy percent of the sessions had people just using it seriously meeting our original design brief which may have been a flawed design brief but nevertheless that's what happened and then if you look at the two rows below they weren't significantly different but the only play sessions were longer almost ninety seconds compared to 30 and the last two rows combined where there was any play at all that was more common in the skills and condition again strengthening this understanding that foreplay really does seem to be something to do with the skeleton what's more the nature of the play was different so just as in this video this person is dancing or playing with their representation by contrast when we had the silhouette we tended to get people trying new gestures and seeing if they worked still quite playful but quite different not large enough sample to get statistically significant results we didn't report from in the paper so overall the silhouette was good for encouraging more people to do serious browsing the skeleton again as expected was more playful and people stayed longer and the key thing is that this was the first exploration of how a user representation effects the level of play when we design an interface for serious inter action rather than just play and that's it ready for questions hey thanks for the talk Doug Bowman from Virginia Tech so I'm wondering what your theory is about why the silhouette leads to two more serious browsing behavior there was a there was a paper at I triple EVR this year about hand representations in virtual reality and they compared abstract hands to skeleton hands to very photorealistic hands okay and the finding there was that the photorealistic hands led to more ownership of the body but the abstract hands led to more agency IE more interaction where control over the interaction so that's slightly different than what you found so I wonder what your what your theory was our sense is it just looks more playful actually it just sort of jiggles a little I don't know how much you noticed it in those but it I think it just looks more playful but I don't have a deeper theory than that I'm afraid hi menatt from von Bruener thankfully tox was very interesting and i was wondering i've tested differences between adults and children how they react a good question we only had adults yes we only had adults in this study as it turns out it was runs it only in the evenings because of limitations with Kinect not entirely the kinect we have has to work through a plate glass wall and yeah so there were any adults in the videos we analyzed on this occasion in previous work we have had some children our ethics means we don't interview children but we do need to view parents with with children so I guess what you're getting at is with children play even more and my guess is they probably would not only but that would be more complex because this content wasn't really written for children I mean of course you'd want to know about research and the faculty of engineering but it wasn't written for them and another question is I guess it's for ethical issues but have you tried instead of silhouette having the image of the other people okay we did consider that it's been quite a lot of work frankly we actually tried the image ourselves and it felt weird it felt very uncomfortable to us there was other literature that suggested it would have worked well I just didn't feel comfortable with it just based on the people in our land and that might be wrong I don't think the ethics people minded the only thing they were fast about is what we kept and we're only allowed to analyze the depth image thank you very much
