 This tutorial is going to show you how to use the Mogees audio unit plug-in with Logic Pro 10 I've already got the plug-in installed on my computer is so I'm going to open up logic and I'm going to add an audio track with the input set to number one The first thing that I want to make sure is that logic has found the Mogees plug-in so under preferences there is the plug-in manager I can see that Mogees down here the bottom of my list if it's not appearing on yours you can reset and rescan The Mogees installer put the file in the default home library with the following file path so let's add the Mogees plug-in as an audio effect onto this empty track I値l use the audio unit version if this is the first time that you've opened the Mogees plug-in you'll have to enter your registration code and email and create a password for yourself However if you've already registered before maybe you registered it on the iOS version you can just login here so now I'm just going to enter my email come up with a password and enter my registration code you値l need to be connected to the Internet if this is the first time that you're registering your messages ok so now I'm going to get my Mogees I'm going to take off the cap and stick it to this old frying pan it needs to be attached very firmly so that it should have quite a lot of resistance if I try to take the back off and remember if the stickypad gets dirty and looses its adhesiveness you can always just peel it off, wash it under some water, wipe away the dirt ,and then wait for it to dry before putting it back on Im then going to plug it into the 3.5 millimetre to quarter inch adaptor and then I'm going to use a standard guitar cable to run from the adaptor into channel 1 of my audio interface I then want to set the correct pre-gain so I値l use this microphone level input I'm going to start tapping with this pen as loudly as I believe that I will be playing and increase the gain on my preamp it's very important that it doesn't go into the red and start clipping if it is clipping than Mogees plug-in will be far worse at the gesture recognition so now then logic audio preferences I want to make sure that I have my correct sound card selected your input device may appear different to this one here but this should be the name of your audio interface you can see now that if I tap the object to which my Mogees is attached I've got some input level coming in and it's not clipping so that's good If I turn on input monitoring we should be able to hear the sound of the Mogees plug-in so here is the Mogees plug-in at the moment there are 4 sound engines you can just click on them to select them and each sound engine has a list of presets and each preset will allow you to change some of its synthesis parameters as well and using the keyboard you can you click on note to change the pitch you can also change the octave if you wish by clicking on these labels So lets say I致e got a song and I want to play the melody live with my Mogees we can send midi notes To The mogees plug-in so that the pitch of the Mogees is always in sync with my track to do this I'm going to create a new external midi track and I'm going to just drag this midi clip onto that track and quickly loop this section when you have an instance of the Mogees plug-in running there will be virtual midi ports open that allow you to send midi to the Mogees plug-in or send midi from the Mogees plug-in if you look at the settings for this midi track we can send midi to the Mogees plug-in by selecting Mogees is 1 as the port If i now hit play and go back to the plug-in we can see that the notes on a keyboard and moving around and as I play the notes for correspond to the notes in this midi track there are a couple of advanced settings that I want to draw attention to now. So lets press on the icon with 3 lines if you're using the Muon sound engine you may want to tweak the audio gate So if you set this to zero it will simply let all of the audio come through the physical model of the Muon sound engine however if you were to turn it up you might have to play little bit louder for the raw audio to come through When using midi input you might want the pitch to change with very gentle touches if so you can reduce the trigger threshold However if you only want the pitch to update with very strong hits you can increase the trigger threshold we値l talk more about these advanced settings later with Mogees you can assign different types of hits or strikes to play different notes or sounds first you need to train the plugin to recognise these different types of taps we call these scrapes or strikes or scratches or whatever we call them gestures so all ive got here is an audio track with the Mogees plug-in and I want my first gesture to be tapping my thumb on the handle and I want that to trigger a bass note so I'm going to click on the plus icon I'm going to provide it with at least 12 training examples Its very important that only one dot appears each time I tap if more than 1 dot Is appearing then I might want to go into my advanced settings and increase the trigger threshold and begin the training process from scratch However if no dots are appearing then I might want to reduce my trigger threshold so that it picks up quieter onsets The trigger time slider sets the number of onsets or hits that will be detected within a certain number of milliseconds so if I知 playing on a rattly or wobbly surface like a cymbal for something that shakes a lot I may want to increase the trigger time so that it only recognises my hit and not the object shaking afterward ok so back to my first gesture I'm going to tap a dozen times giving it a variety of amplitudes and playing around the area not exactly always on the same spot this circle now represents my first just gesture If I select it I can change the sound engine and the preset and the note if I wish So now if I perform my first gesture it's going to play the mute bass sound with middle C I知 going to train a second gesture this time I値l use my Knuckles in the centre of the pan so again I'm going to hit + And give it training examples with a variety of amplitudes and around the area just as if I were performing And when I知 happy I値l hit done so now the plug-in can tell the difference between my thumb and the centre I知 going to click on the blue icon and change the preset to mute bass and select this note In order to be recognised as distinct gestures need to be quite different from one another for example if I were to train a third gesture using my thumb on the edge of the pan you値l see that the circles will end up overlapping this means that the plug-in will have a hard time telling the difference between the two so I'm going to control click or right click on this yellow gesture to delete it in Instead of using my thumb I'm going to use this pen and tap the edge of it So I値l select the Muon sound engine and this note And now I can play all three independently So just like we were sending midi the information in before we can now send different midi tracks to different gestures I'm only going to use two gestures for this example so I'm going to right click on the yellow one to delete it So I知 going to create two new external midi tracks I'm going to quickly grab these clips and put them up and I want to send the output of this midi track to Mogees number 1 channel 1 on the output of the second midi track to Mogees number one again but this time I'm going to use channel two so what this means if we take a look at the Mogees plug-in again my first gesture is listening for midi information on midi input channel number one so since this midi track is sending it to midi channel number one these notes are going to stream in real time to this gesture for my blue gesture you値l see that the midi input channel is number 2 so thats going to listen to this midi track to make this a bit clearer I知 just going to change the sound preset of my second gesture I値l record enable the Mogees track again and I'll hit play Mogees can also be used as a MIDI controller or trigger by sending midi out so I'm going to create a new software instrument track and I'm going to load up the alchemy plugin. The alchemy plug-in is currently listening to all midi ports I'm going to turn down the output of the Mogees track and make sure that it's record enabled I can see as I play I'm actually triggering the midi notes with my gestures if you want to route specific Mogees plugins to control specific synths then you値l want to use logic痴 midi environment Now with Logic 10 this is hidden by default so you may want to go to logic痴 preferences go to advanced and tick on the Midi option this means that you can now go to window and open the MIDI environment what we want to do here is create a new physical input You値l see that this is a list of all of my input devices and Mogees Number 1 is available to us that's because I've got the Mogees plug-in loaded up on this audio track so I値l go back to my midi environment I'm going to select the tiny triangle from the Mogees #1 and plug that into the synthesizer that I want to trigger this becomes important if you've got more than one Mogees so I'm going to duplicate this track and you値l see if I go back to my midi environment there are now two instances of the virtual midi ports for Mogees so this means that I can route them to independent tracks so that they can control different synthesizers this is useful if you've got a set up with multiple Mogees plugged into your sound card or are working on a track with a few plug-ins that are triggering different synths the midi velocity slider in advanced settings can be used to set the range of midi velocitys that are output by the plug-in so that's all for this logic tutorial if you致e got any questions please head on over to mogees.co.uk/forum and thanks for watching
