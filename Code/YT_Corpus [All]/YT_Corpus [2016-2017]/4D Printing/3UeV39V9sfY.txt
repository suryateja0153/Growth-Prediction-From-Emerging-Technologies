 hi I'm Ken Mingis welcome back to Mingis on tech where we talk about what's hot and what's not an IT I've got Lucas here with me and a 3d printer thanks Lucas for stopping by and we're going to have a mystery gadget guest in a few minutes so hold the applause he'll be here soon with the mystery gadgets we're going to try to guess what it is first I want to talk about 3d printing Lucas you're just back from the rapid conference down in in orlando right which is 3d printing for manufacturing sort of the big boys and what i was fascinated by was you came back with a story about 4d printing right so what the hell is 4d printing we're not talking about time space dimensions yet right no no you're obviously 40 is a marketing term but it's still 3d printing but it's used for medical devices that can be implanted in the body and actually grow with the body so these are it's not living with is it living material it's it's by it's biodegradable material basically its material that doesn't affect the body when it's implanted and can degrade over time and I be absorbed back into the body and exuded waste material so it serves a purpose for a limited amount of time as stint you know or as a forum for say building cartilage around it like an ear or nose for facial reconstruction or in this case saving lives by opening up bronchial tubes well that was what caught my eye this this was actually designed so that was it for children who were having breathing problems yeah and they're so small but they're growing so you put something in to sort of open up the airways that you know something that's 3d printed or 40 printed if you keep it at one size they're going to outgrow it very quickly very quickly and that's that's part of the issue so what happened is there were four separate children started out as three that were various hospitals and they had a condition called bronchial Asia okay and it's a basically a week weakening of the cartilage around their bronchial tubes and in for it and it causes them to collapse in so that they can't breathe so they have to be on aerator are not aerators but ventilators high pressure ventilators to keep oxygen flowing into their lungs otherwise it would could close up and biomechanical engineers at the University of Michigan developed a method of printing stints so imagining printing the 3d printing distance that look a little bit like if you've ever seen irrigation hose use for landscaping so they're perforated ribbed hoses okay yeah that would go around the bronchial tubes and open them up so think of the stint like a tent and then the sutures like 10 posts that hold it open and the cool thing about it is they can actually expand over time as the child grows and eventually get reabsorbed into the body so it's never actually removed when I mean they basically wanted to install once its installed like this that's what you do with it right once it's put into the the children's body they it it grows as they grow and then it gradually just gets disintegrated in the butt exactly yeah and they can put another one in once if necessary but they last two to three years yeah so in in every case there were four different cases in each of the children were able to be taken off the ventilator or in one case was reduced from high pressure to very low pressure and the rest of the Chilton the other three or four children were able to just go home okay and live fairly healthy normal lives now we're talking about children who are on ventilators for like 16 months of their initial life and they've 3d printed these tents you know surgically implanted them in boom they're off the ventilators and gone home is this sort of a sign of things to come you know in terms of health care and being able to 3d print body parts and put them in your body and then what let them to centigrade over time absolutely well these are these are kids right no no these are stints there you eventually going to see these four things like heart surgery of heart valves facial reconstruction they're already 3d printing tissue right so for skin grafts so basically if we live long enough yeah we just replace the 3d printing of everything we exactly will be able to extend life for thousands of years right right you're just getting doing body okay well let me ask you to you we've got on the desk here one of the newest printers that you're you're going to be reviewing I see the pink hippo um tell me what tell me what this printer is and I know you've only been able to use it a little bit but I wanted to get an idea real quick you know as to how this one's working out because it's it's nice to have sort of a tabletop model that you can kind of move around yeah this is very cool it's it's kind of Apple esken its appearance you know how it's very sleek and white this called the mod t and last year it was just a crowdsourcing project and it earned nearly twice of their original 375,000 dollar goal that they were going for it's a very cool looks pretty simple in terms of you know what the hell you'd set it up you've got the spool of fiber back here in the back and it goes into the printhead and then boom it was I mean it was Bob probably a five minute set up from the time I opened the box to put it together I this is for the the newest 3d printer user out there I mean there's nothing to it and it's actually kind of a cool design the print platform the black rectangle you see in there where it prints on it's actually kind of ingenious it just sits on top of these these little rollers and roller bars right if you don't attach it you just lay it on top of them the roller balls move the print and they move them yeah they move it around as it is it prints and the printhead is tiny they gave me too and as you can see it's right underneath them the mechanism here it's just unplugs you just you know pull it out on plug it and replace it with a new one if you have any problems what kind of very cool about this is that there's a community a social network community built around this printer from from New matter okay and you can share STL files for printing various objects on this social network it's a lot like MakerBot's thingiverse which is the largest online community for a lot of sharing of a file like that oh yeah tons of files is it mostly toys I mean what are people here everything so let's say that somebody figures out a method of replacing a ear piece on your glasses and you have a particular model of wanted an eyeglass in fashionable people yeah that's what they sent me unfortunately okay but yeah they upload these STL files and you can go search for them and print you own your piece for your pair of glasses or for any for that matter I mean they have like paper you know toilet paper hangers and all sorts of stuff out there some of its kitty some of its you know silly of 3d printing my own toilet paper hanger is some of it seems kind of you right you know in terms of scale to I can probably do more better than I can do it at home well I mean the majority of 3d printing today is still for rapid prototyping you know start to see if something is going to work so you make one of it and you see if it'll work and then you make it out of the traditional fashion of you know injection molding or you'll laving on cnc machine sort of thing but for hobbyists they're actually communities out there of makers that sell this stuff on eBay and other signs of files noorullah sell the stuff they print but it's not everybody has all they print ok I see sleep and stomping selves and prints things up and then start selling them or sell them online and they also sell the stl file so this new matter our social community can they allow them to sell their STL files because you create these in the cad software yeah and and they're not easy to do sometimes some of them are pretty intricate and useful like if you want to repair your glasses for example so in other words as a whole market out there for 3d printed objects and 3d printing files among 3d printer people yeah yeah okay so all right so you'll be reviewing this for Computerworld of time yeah I just got it it's you know I printed made my first print on like the home does Lou but you know hopefully yeah very slow about five hours to do this puppy which is very very young or hippo very slow compared to other parents but you know who cares it's very quiet sitting on your desk walk away that's the other nice thing is has a little bar of onboard NAND flash memory so you uploads louder the way over i'm in there and i'll pick up off you go disconnect your computer and it just goes a prince great alright well thank you i appreciate the update on 3d printing both or 3d printing and 40 printing now for our fun time we've got the mystery gadget guest it's keith yay is back with his mr. gadget alright with a mystery gadget that was it right out yes it's a hippo it do you see the Warner I'm sorry so mystery gadget guessed what mystery gadget have you got for we decided I think we were going to do this as a new segment yeah like I come in and I show you something you try to guess what it is oh here it is uh you can kind of look at it it's it looks like uh i would say for drawing looks like a hard drive yeah or battery perhaps Luca see the ports on the side but I'm thinking rechargeable battery okay that looks like a lightning know maybe USB feed out one port okay and I don't know what it looked like almost an hdmi port on the back but I don't think that's what it is alright so if you saw I mean it was a hit don't tell us what it is don't give you a hint yeah my it's related to is it bigger than a bread box no related to the title of your website mingus no let me guess drive it's a world now try the other one computer yes there you go this is an actual Windows 10 computer you're kidding there's a full set there's a full version of Windows 10 this is the kangaroo mobile desktop plus the gift guy if you saw the network world gift guide and I think everybody you know everybody had access to that the first version of the kangaroo desktop was this and then it had a little docking station that it could slide in and with it you didn't identify I think the hdmi port that was correct on oh it's on this this is now the docking station that it comes in okay and you can see some additional ports there there's a VGA port an Ethernet port that's the the mobile desktop pro version the initial version came out with an hdmi port you plug in this to the hdmi it has a couple of USB and you can basically run a computer off look at the new home on look at monitor good word mas you're all set and you know this is the main the main thing what they've done now with the plus is that you can attach this and now you can actually put a two and a half inch hard drive on the bottom of it has screws that you can take off put a hard drive on there it gives you some extra memory you've got 32 gigs built in but then you can just you know expand that if you want more storage space you know it does connect to the cloud via Wi-Fi so this has this one has Wi-Fi on it but then if you have an old ethernet port you know our jack you can do that vga if you've got an old monitor him and then they added an audio port which was great because i was doing hdmi audio before now I've got like a speaker system that I can hook up to it what what it's great for is not necessarily business purposes because I think it looks like sort of thing you would travel around with yeah this this can you can travel around with this quite easily if you if you also then have access to an HDMI monitor and a keyboard a mouse no but I'm thinking that I you know I give this to my kids you know and they can now do their web surfing and and as their faces all virtual windows 10 it's it's really awesome now there are some downsides to it there's only two gigs of RAM on it okay I wish there was for you write two gigs right you know and then it's an intel atom processor 1.4 so the processors is a little slow but your is a computer yeah but what do you know about 200 bucks right hundred bucks for your windows ok go and a few peripherals and you're ready to go exactly so we reviewing this on network world along with some other cool pc tablet types so is the on-board storage flash or is a small hard drive ah that's a good question i guess whose problem can you think i don't know if you can tell i can shake it David rattles yeah I you're not good I think it's flash memory although this does get very hot yeah but I don't know if that's because now is the driver get hot pleasure okay I fell in a better / will check that out and you know I figured that the operating system was taking a majority of that it takes up about probably half which is why you'd want to then install this on your the ability to expand is what makes it useful right right truly so i did i stump you or not I did no I thought it was a hard drive or maybe a battery and I certainly wouldn't have thought of it as a computer with Windows 10 so yes we're stumped all right again well I look forward to the next time you can stump us all right I think that's gonna do it for this week thank you mystery gadget why Thank You Lucas thanks Keith that's a wrap
