 so my research for the last number of years has been trying to build 3d printers that can create 4d objects specifically for artificial muscles and the idea is to create soft structures which could be implanted in the body can act as replacements for valves or reinforcements for muscles which are damaged disease or have degraded function so at the beginning of my research I was talking to some surgeons and they suggested perhaps am I'd like to work on contractile or peristaltic tubular artificial muscles these are things that could perhaps age somebody and with incontinence who needed a new sphincter or in the south if somebody had an esophagus problem I am also been talking with some cardiac surgeons they suggested perhaps this would be a a good method to create a replacement fully implanted pump which could age the heart in case of cardiac disease something that they already do with the balloon they they can put him beside the heart and it will inflate and deflate but a balloon requires an a tube through the through the stomach hurt through the leg and so the idea is to make a fully implantable electric version so I like this idea and I started to research how it could be done and I realized one of the things that needed to be created with a 3d printer that could actually create these structures and so this is where I really began trying to make the printer to make the object so just 3d printing itself it's in the news a lot every week there's a new thing being made there's a lot of hope and a lot of hype around it and but it's really an exciting way of manufacturing it it grows objects from the ground up it designs like nature does itself using sparing materials while trying to maximize strength there's lots of different ways to M to produce 3d printed objects sometimes they start with a resin which they use a laser to harden other times they they take a plastic and squeeze it through a nozzle and they melt the plastic and squeeze it through and this in itself is and an idea that's been around for a long time you know we've seen Baker's do this and build up structures from the ground this way and using soft materials but then also in this traditional machining which is where you're taking a solid block of very often metal sometimes plastic and using a drill and moving around and removing material now this can create fantastic structures but it's limited another way is firstly you're there's a lot of wastage but also you can you can't build internal structure in the object it's all about surfaces and this has been around for a long time since the 1950s really we saw the beginning of computerization to control these machines and it's and 3d printing still uses the same language of these machines used in the 1950s which is building upon it but the thing about 3d printing is you can make these fantastically complex objects and natural they look so natural and organic in many ways in this case we've got lots of em jewelry objects and things that have been made for home decor but they they mirror the idea of lungs and viruses and things in these pictures and really beautiful geometries and and also in the fashion industry it's slightly more bizarre but you know you see these these wonderful and clothing these really crazy zany objects that people are wearing or could wear at the moment just models and at the bottom you see the printer that they actually make it on and this is something that looks a little bit like a printer that you'd have at home but you can get a sense of scale if you see the door in the background and also the Aerotech for aerospace and heavy engineering they're starting to make metal objects by taking powders and shooting them with lasers and binding the powder together and this is really good for making lighter way stronger structures or as you see in the bottom this this kind of grid trailer structure which couldn't be made in any other way and the problem with 3d printing that they never really mentioned is firstly it's very expensive and also it's it's slow you know and so for this it it's more suited to bespoke high value low volume pieces rather than trying to mass-produce things and no better place for bespoke objects than 3d medical devices and this is where we're seeing things like jaw bones and and vertebrae being tailored and implanted and and also for for objects cosmetic and augmented objects such as the ear dam the bottom which has a cochlear implant finally surgeons are finding a lot of use in taking CT or MRI scan data of a patient before an operation and using it to and practice on before they actually go in but the problem that I saw is all of these objects are hard lifeless stiff and you know if you're trying to make implants for the body well human bodies are quite squishy for the most part and you know a person to bones you don't want hard things pressing up against organs so I started to look at how do you make objects which are soft print objects which are soft flexible and able to move and actuate so one of the kind of new forms of printing that a new term is 4d printing and this is essentially 3d printing but with an added dimension of time afterwards and this is the object can can move after it's been printed and so really the the printers are essentially the same but it's all about the materials and how they react to a stimulus this could be heat it could be light BHU meilahti or electricity there's there's multiple ways of making it react and there's a lot of work done in MIT and Harvard on this and some of my colleagues in ETH in Zurich also have created ways of aligning fibers as they're being printed with magnets and it's all it's really fabulous to watch these these forms starting to move and come to life so my side of 4d printing has been the idea of artificial muscles and these are essentially robber or elastomeric objects with different levels of stretch and tension compression within them now you see the video there and this little black dash that is kind of pulsing and growing like almost like a pupil in the eye the way that works is it's it's taking a thin sheet of rubber and putting two conducting electrodes either side and if you if you charge up these electrodes or apply a voltage like magnets they're attracted to each other and they squash the they squash the piece of rubber in between them and you can build up many many a big sandwich of this and now the voltage is required are quite high but with certain processing they and you can reduce it and the thing about it though is they they're called artificial muscles and termed dielectric elastomers if you want to be technical but and they act like a an anti muscle they grow with their stimulated rather than compress so one of the things about these these muscles is they they really need to be stretched first the piece of Robert needs tension in it to work well and now you see the video there this little thing is kind of pulsing it's twitching really there's about 5% elongation and that's because it's not stretched when you stretch as you get much much more and the reason to stretch are twofold one and something that everyone might be familiar with when you're trying to inflate a balloon if you take the balloon and good stretch first then it's much easier to blow up your softening the rubber and the the second reason is well a little more complex but it's analogous to a bow and arrow where you're taking a stretched string and you're putting a huge amount of energy into it and then attaching the bow which is able to hold this and the tension so then when you try and fire an arrow you're only adding a little bit of extra energy and getting a huge amount it's an amplifier for the mechanical strain and so this I was studying and Nottingham I really loved the idea of this bow and arrow you know it was it seemed the right thing to research so I am I started to look around and see how how does this work and so I came across some of the work done in Harvard here and this is using these kind of again a bow and arrow analogy stretched stretch membranes with a frame that you can attach to it and you make a flat frame and kind of build these structures up like a patchwork quilt the problem with this is they were handmade and they weren't so predictable so repeatable it's it's difficult to make something by hand like this especially when the stretch is involved that I'm you can be sure we'll always collapse in the same way and we repeat it especially if you want to put these inside the body they have to be repeatable they have to be predictable and so I kind of I asked myself you know is there a way of making a 3d printer that's capable of stretching an object and imparting different compression and stretch and strain inside the object as it's going and so I am I began to make printers I began to put them together so first thing that I did was I took a spray gun and started to spray silicone and now I have to make very very thin layers these are 40 or 50 micrometers which is about 125th of a millimeter and in the bottom corner you see a cross section of these these layers thirds and the white section is rubber and the black is these electrodes made of graphite in this case then following that I needed to find a way of inflating and this and I realized you know or to stretch a balloon and especially if these are to be tubular structures and I was talking to some friends and they suggested well why don't you use this really old technique that they used to use in ceramics to make a body and permeable to air and so I tried it and you see in the the top left there's a and an image of air being blown through this this solid object into water in your repetitive bubbles and now the choice of shape here is entirely arbitrary you know the idea to eventually start working on MRI a date or a CT days and making patient specific shapes and so anyway I was able to build these these structures build these balloons and at the bottom you can see they can they can come out in nice interesting shapes so if you've whenever you've blown up a balloon but be sure they're never going to blow up the same shape each time there's always going to be a slight deformity in the shape and if you want to 3d print onto the surface of this balloon and you really have to measure it first so I said about building a 3d scanner to start pinpointing we're using a laser both sizes this balloon where are all the curves and everything and so I came across problems with this of course a balloon is partly transparent when it's inflated and you know a laser well visible light tends to try go through this and and also things like the reflection it's very shiny and it's difficult for the laser and roam all over the place but I I finally managed to figure out how to do it and I brought all this data into a CAD program and started coming up these patterns to print over the surface and the patterns were specifically to be a support laughs a bit like an exoskeleton around the balloon to try and hold some of this tension but I needed them to collapse down and grow and so that the type of add geometries is a specific name for them which is organic and this these exotic structures are able to collapse onto themselves without buckling in funny directions that become nice and flat and smooth so after quite a while I managed to get to start printing on these balloons and then this is really the most exciting time in my life I feel but it was you know I just sitting there watching all the time and eventually these things I print and build up layers and layers of this thing and him let it harden and eventually you'd end up with them these structures which this was when I was really excited I haven't actually worked so that oh this is so good and so this was kind of the first stage of where I got to I was building the machines and able to make these structures this of course still a lot of work to be done this was the first iteration of the the printer that I built and I'm now working on new machines trying to make it more accurate and in terms of the making implantable devices there's a lot of regulation behind this and hurdles that have to be overcome particularly when you start involving batteries and voltages you know the medical regulators freaked out a little bit and so really what I've kind of almost taken a step back and started to work on more passive devices so these are things like valves or stents and things that don't require a voltage but require the same tension and things that called bi-stable um but the hope is you know and there's many many people researching this and the bio bioengineered prosthetics either will become a bridge to full regenerative medicine this is where they use stem cells and micro organs but that's quite a long way away still and or maybe as an alternative to getting donors and having implants and I think transplants sorry and using these implants and kind of hopefully help a little bit that way and so thank you very much
