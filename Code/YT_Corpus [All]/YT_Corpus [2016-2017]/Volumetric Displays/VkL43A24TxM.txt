 this is the BMW tent here at CES 2016 and behind me we've got the BMW I vision the first thing that stood out to me was of course the dual displays there's a two layer display so that's a transparent display on top of a more traditional LCD display directly in front of the driver as well as a large super wide panoramic display so an autonomous driving mode you might have the display in front of you with pertinent information about nearby cars for example on the foreground display with the route actually displayed in the background since you're not operating the vehicle anyway so it's a kind of secondary importance
