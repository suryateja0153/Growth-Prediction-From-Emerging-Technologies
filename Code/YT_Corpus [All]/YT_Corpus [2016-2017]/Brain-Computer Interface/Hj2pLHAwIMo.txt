 it's a brand new one of a kind simulator that may help reduce the number of officer-involved shootings a team of developers and engineers from the University of Utah are using emotions and touch to train officers on how to calm tensions and nerves Fox 13 Jeff macadam joins us live in studio to tell us more Jeff Tamara this new software won a major national award in San Francisco last week and the team says it all started from watching news stories like the one we saw just a second ago up there between salt lake city resident James Barker in Salt Lake City police where things escalated from calm to hostile quickly simply them for me using voice and hands users can work to calm down tensions certain words and certain tactics dis make the difference programmer Shabazz say Khan is part of a behavioral ethics strategy tactics team or best at the University of Utah the team has created a virtual reality video game for officer training as you can see I can use my hands to kind of calm him down it's still in the testing phase but the team hopes to roll out the software to police academies nationwide starting next year it's a supplement producer Jed Merrill says in this scenario the officer gets a call to a house where he or she finds a man agitated in the garage it's kind of natural instinct I think to to respond and 22 reacts it to whether it's the body language to proximity if all these things affect the way that people respond to police officers based off of how the officer reacts this scenario changes and the anger level will either increase or decrease this time the man picks up a hammer even if it turns out negatively it's still something that they can talk about and say why did you make this decision why did you make this decision so it sounds like a great idea but what do police have to say about it I got a mixed reaction from the officers I spoke to today we'll share what they had to say coming up later on at five Tamra Jeff you mentioned that the software still in development do developers have a price tag on it i imagine that might be a factor for police agencies if they consider it yeah exactly it sounds like those sell these in sets of three and they said the sets of three will be sold for 750 thousand dollars each I said that is a lot of money they said yeah well doing police investigations for officer-involved shootings cost a lot of money too so this is a one-time fee which will hopefully help prevent those other fees that they might incur later Tamara thank you so much chef
