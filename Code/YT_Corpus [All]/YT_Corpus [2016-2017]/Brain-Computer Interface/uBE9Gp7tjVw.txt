 DARPA is investing sixty million dollars in neuro technology hello cyborg brain you know we often compare computers and brains against one another but the truth is the two do not process information in the same way or if you will allow me to channel my inner 1980 stand-up comedian it might go something like this but humans right we think totally different it's like electrochemical impulses across synapses in a neural network this part of our nervous system agree what's that all about the point is in order for computers and brains to communicate with each other there has to be an interpreter in the middle and traditionally this has been a bottleneck they just can't keep up with what our brains produce and communicate it to a computer fast enough DARPA wants to change all that the organization is going to invest 60 million dollars in the research and development of devices capable of translating thought into computer code at rapid speed we're talking high resolution high bandwidth and this device has to be small it can't be any larger than one cubic centimeter wine cuz it would be implanted in somebody's brain now DARPA won't be doing the research on its own that's not the organization's mo instead it provides the money for other research organizations universities and colleges to do the work instead what DARPA does is define the goal it's up to the different organizations to figure out how to get there this means multiple organizations might come up with different solutions to the same problem which will inspire further innovation and you can tell I'm getting really excited why well think about the potential applications of this technology early on we're talking about therapeutic applications things like allowing blind people to see or deaf people to hear but beyond that you could imagine a world where people are able to interface directly with technology without ever moving a finger or saying a word so you won't have to type a command into your computer or click a mouse button or even just you're at a camera or speak a voice command you just think and it happens but I'm getting a little ahead of myself it's not gonna happen that quickly DARPA plans for this program to last for four years and even if we do come up with a solution within that time it's still going to take more time to get it approved for therapeutic applications let alone anything else but that leads me to a question for you guys do you think the sort of technology will always be restricted to the medical uses or do you envision a world where enhanced human beings are running around interacting seamlessly with the technology around them I want to hear your thoughts in the comments below thanks to Toyota for sponsoring our showing making it possible if you enjoyed this episode hit that little like button down there for me would you and join the forward-thinking think tank by subscribing to this channel finally I'm directing you to watch these other videos with my brain you
