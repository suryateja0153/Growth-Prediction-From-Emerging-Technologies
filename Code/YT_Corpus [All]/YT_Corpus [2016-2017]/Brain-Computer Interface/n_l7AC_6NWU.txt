 it's a very hot area in neuroscience to be able to take powerful modern computers and use them to interface with patients brains and give them a better quality of life you know it's the potential hope for improving function after a stroke for example right now when you have a stroke you were cover son after a stroke you go through a rehab but we don't do anything to actively restore function this is the potential for restoring function we're citing point in history it's like the start of aviation where the Wright brothers right now and you know when the Wright brothers started out could they imagine that people routinely hop on 747s to span the globe it was unimaginable at the time and that's where we are right now we're just starting but it's very exciting so one of the goals that my laboratory has is developing a brain computer interface that will take a visual image recorded by a digital camera of sorts and transmit the necessary information directly to electrodes on the brain and translate the visual image inputted through that camera into the neurons in the brain that normally perform the act of visual perception so it's called a brain computer interface and this would be a visual prosthetic of cortical visual prosthetic to restore vision to patients who right now are hopelessly blind and of course there are many millions of patients in the United States and across the world with incurable blindness so it's a it's a real problem and right now it sounds like science fiction but we're not that far away from this becoming a real solution for patients and in the coming generation so it's exciting to be on the cusp of this really promising you
