 I've always had a fascination with the mind brain relationship ever since I was a kid how this beige pudding between our ears explains these uniquely human elements of consciousness thoughts memories emotions its captivated me my entire life and how how we can capture that and how we can understand that has been a core to my thinking it's the reason that I studied both biology and theology as an undergraduate I wanted to on one side understand the mechanisms of how the brain works but on the other I never wanted to lose my off for that miracle of the mind that thing that makes us human and that's carried forward today I lead a laboratory that focuses on creating brain computer interfaces devices that link machines to the mind to enable people to restore function after a severe neurologic injury to highlight some that technology let me introduce you to a patient that I've gotten to know who's inspired me his name's Rick and here is with his wife Kim Kim always referred to him as her Superman here he is here he worked as a paramedic for the Ladue Fire and Rescue he was there saving lives at the front lines when people were having a heart attack they were in a car accident he was there when they were at their worst let me introduce you to Rick's kryptonite it's a small blood clot that filled one of the arteries that was supplying blood to his brain when that happened a portion of his brain died now let me introduce you to Rick four years after that stroke and here he is trying to pick up a marble I can't usually go sales can you okay I got the first step in so many ways it's a heavy heavy marble beyond not being able to pick up that marble Kim had to help Rick get dressed every day he couldn't go to the second floor of his house because his arm couldn't reach up to reach the light switch this rigorously independent man this Superman was really laid low by that blood clot so it begs the question how do we fix Rick so there's two words that I want you to remember as we think both about the problem and the solution for how we can fix Rick one is the word contralateral this idea that one side of the brain controls the opposite side of the body the other word that I want you to remember is it's a lateral this idea that one side of the brain controls the same side of the body now before Rick had a stroke it was the right side of his brain controlling his left hand contralateral control that green area that's his premotor area making the plan to move and that blue area the primary motor cortex sends the commands down his brain through his spinal cord to the nerves so he can actually move his hand but then four years ago he had a stroke and that part of his brain died if you want have a sense for what it is to lose hand function how deeply it affects you wear a sock on your hand for a day you'll find you can't tie your shoelaces you're gonna have trouble putting your clothes on all those little things that you take for granted all become a struggle but our hand is more than just touching the physical world because if you ask Rick what did he want most after that stroke this is what he'll tell you all I really wanted to do was to be able her hand and the very beginning was to hold her hand he wanted to hold Kim's hand our hand is also an emotional organ we don't just touch the world around as we touch people so how do we fix Rick so when we think about fixing injuries in the brain they're very different from fixing injuries in the body when you think about something like a broken bone for instance you realign that injury in space you basically put that bone back together with a cast pin screws and eventually those edges grow together now for the brain it's different how do you fix a broken brain you don't put a bandaid on it you can't put stitches in it you can't put the brain in a cast rather than realigning in space you realign in time now what do I mean by that so the brain is a fantastic organ that manages extraordinary amounts of information different parts of the brain have to work together to manage motor function speech function visual function and you can they all separate this information out by having different time scales or frequencies and though you can almost think of them as different radio stations and those different radio stations we call brain networks now we can tap into those radio stations for these different types of information with what we call a brain computer interface now a brain computer interface has three parts sensors some type of electrode that takes signals from the brain computation we convert that electrical activity into information that converts it to an output by controlling a robotic arm and we boil it down a brain-computer interface is a device that allows you to control a machine with your thoughts alone now originally people always thought that the brain had to be intact for you to use a brain computer interface it was perfect for people with spinal cord injury or Lou Gehrig's disease where you couldn't move your body but your brain still worked we really set out to challenge that notion we wanted to use it in stroke where the brain is injured and so if you ask Rick even though he can't move his hand he can't send down that execution from primary motor cortex he can still imagine moving it he can still try to move it and the reason for that is that there's a portion of his brain on the uninjured side called the ipsilateral motor cortex that maintains the motor plan and now we have someplace that we can tap into with our brain computer interface but if you remember brain is kind of like a bunch of radio stations that different information is carried on different frequencies or you can always think of it as different channels and one of the things that we discovered was that EPSA lateral motor signals signals associate with same side of the limb movements had a distinct frequency from contralateral signals opposite sided modes they're a higher frequency so now we have the opportunity a different location a specific physiology to create what we called the ipsy hand system and again a brain computer interface has three parts the sensors electrodes that were on his scalp computation a computer that he wore on his forearm the output and a robotic exoskeleton that moved his fingers in a pincer like grasp here's what it looks like in real life here's Rick putting on his EEG headset these are electrodes recording brain activity through his scalp there's a computer on his forearm the robotic exoskeleton so when he thinks about moving his hand the brain computer interface does it for him but we wanted to take it one step further and there's another lesson here that we wanted not only give him control with the machine we wanted to see if we could actually fix Rick we wanted to see if we could rewire Rick and there's another lesson here in wiring the brain together that when things happen when neurons fire together at the same time over time they eventually formed new connections that's called heavy and learning and so we not only wanted to have Rick realign his brain and time meaning he thinks about moving his hand and it moves but over time that as he continues to use it his neural populations are firing in a different way that new connections are made so that that external circuitry that brain computer interface changes his internal circuitry to rewire and reconnect his hand to a new part of his brain so let's fit all this together before Rick had a stroke his print his promoter and his primary motor areas were sending signals down a spinal cord to the nerves to his hand and he did the things that we all take for granted holding Kim's hand putting his pants on tying his shoes but then four to five years ago Rick like 800,000 other people had a stroke and that part of his brain died so he couldn't send those signals down to his hand anymore but one of the things we know now is that he still had maintained the intentions to move his hand and that was located in that EPSA lateral premotor area that area and green and by using our brain computer interface we could record signals from that area and so that every time he thought about moving his hand by the by using an EEG head cap we could pick up those intentions so when he thought about moving it we would see that specific electrical signature and that would lead to the movement with his exoskeleton now here's the interesting the extraordinary part of it as he continues to use it over weeks to months a fundamental rewiring happens he now creates connections with that if Schlatter alaria of his brain to his hand so he doesn't need the ipsy hands system anymore now that's a nice story it's a lovely video the question is does it actually work so here's Rick once again trying to pick up that marble several weeks after using the ipsy hand system that was a big moment for Rick but I'll tell you was a big moment for me two weeks later I see Rick waiting to once again do a motor screening he said dr. Lou's are dr. Lutz I just want to tell you I can put my pants on again after doing ten years of research that meant more to me than any paper any patent any award so I'd given a man his dignity back and I knew that it wasn't just him that I had the potential to do that for tens of thousands of people more and so Rick is now a year out from using the system he's moved out from that house and he now lives on a farm with his wife Kim he can now pick up vegetables with that hand he's now working I'll let Kim described her experience this is the last year when he started it was enough fist and he couldn't do anything and just seen him come back and being able to hold my hand and seeing the joy in his face from doing the simple things but and so I'm getting my husband back and every day there's more improvement and I think there's a lesson from Rick that I want him to convey every day is Christmas it's all working it's just falling into place the way you wanted to be and everybody's biggest smile on your face like I've got because I'm going way way beyond any thought including myself over there we'll get this better much better and that lesson is people are always told after their stroke if you've lost that function it doesn't come back six months it's not coming back Rick got some hand function back for years after his stroke now Rick is not alone he's not an aberration he's not a fluke we've now done this in ten patients and seven of those patients have recovered equally a significant function and I think what's so interesting so extraordinary about this approach it didn't require a drug it didn't require surgery this technology enabled Rick's mind to harness the powerful human plasticity to change itself and I would argue just as Rick's fate was not set because of that stroke neither are yours so often I hear people tell me I'm not a math person I'm not an athlete I can't do this I could never learn a second language most of the people in this audience have not had a stroke or a brain injury you don't need a brain computer interface to change your brain's destiny all these limitations that we place on our brain are simply cages for our brains development another example what does we told this young man you're not that good you're not that athletic you're not that strong what if he listened he wouldn't have trained day in and day out to become this man who's saying bolt the fastest man on earth and I would argue your brain is a muscle just as Usain trained his body to exceptional performance you can train your brain to do amazing things I remember on a personal note I was told as a fifth grader you're not that smart Eric you shouldn't set your sights so high and I would challenge each of you today use your mind engage your brain you have the potential to be more than you ever anticipated so it would challenge you all today to be more be more thank you you
