 okay so this will be a friendly talk you're welcome to interrupts if you have questions you can ask questions in any language that you want if the language is not English or Spanish or German I will not understand you so many people are familiar with the idea behind the brain computer interface so I just have a few slides to to review it a brain-computer interface is a device that enables communication without movement so most forms of communication speech and gesture and typing mice all require movement you have to move in some way when i was at goodman last time elated showing me something called the nose mouse that you were using and you know that many patients can use assistive technologies like the nose mouse or reading switch or a Jeep muscle switch but for some patients who have very severe mood with disabilities late-stage Lou Gehrig's disease or ALS or brain stem stroke or other conditions there may be no way to move at all so any system even when the requires only limited movement is not possible for these types of patients so a brain-computer interface enables communication with no movement at all instead the system just to text your activity from the brain and sends that on to a communication system it might be a wheelchair or a speller or another type of system and so after you inquire the data here and then you send it his signal processing you can do a lot of things with it and this has been my background until recently I was mostly working with BCI for communication so we did a project a few years ago called drainable where we were working together along with another colleague in philly fan is here and the project was successful and it was to try to establish communication and control solutions for people so if somebody wants to control a wheelchair or develop a speller and ideally someone wants to be able to do that from a real world environment not just from inside they can do that that was the goal of rainfall and recently there have been a lot more applications so i mentioned spellers control of an orthosis a lot of people are looking into games and remote control devices control of a an artificial robot but these two are showing virtual reality applications that are are also getting a lot of attention recently so I'll talk about that more for the end with DCI first stroke and with coma most people know of course even if you're not medical doctors that if coma is a very severe state persons who were diagnosed with the coma cannot think or perform other tasks and so of course these people would not be able to use a brain-computer interface either the problem is not simply that they have difficulty moving its else that they have cognitive damage that is so severe that they cannot communicate they can't even think of a message or command and this figure here shows that coma represents a person with basically no motor response no reliable control of voluntary movement and also no indication of cognitive function so you might apply a test like the coma recovery scale revives which I understand that you use here and from the behavioral response you see no indication that this person could communicate or could make any decisions however persons with coma may often emerge into another state the vegetative state or the minimally conscious state in which they may have some improved cognitive ability so to return to this image here you see that the motor activity is still quite low with vegetative state or a minimally conscious state they may still not be able to control the voluntary movement and thereby send a message or command but they might have enough cognitive ability they might be able to hear and make decisions and this is something we were demonstrating in the morning so we were we met with some of you and we demonstrated the system called mine beagle that allows people to communicate even without being able to see or move and different studies have found that about 17 to forty-two percent of persons who are diagnosed without any conscious awareness do exhibit some indicators of awareness this means often that the situation is that they have improved since their initial diagnosis but there's no way to observe that because you're not getting any kind of behavioral response so you might do is in the crs scale for example you might look for spontaneous speech or see if the patient responds to a stimulus and you see nothing and therefore without something like my legal you have no other information you have no way to measure their mental activity can they actually hear you but they can't communicate with you and so that's what we're we're trying to work on so again persons with coma if they are correctly diagnosed they're still in a coma than a VC I would not be helpful to them but if they have emerged into a better state where they have some potential for communication you can use a DCI or a brain computer interface to reassess them and then potentially provide communication so this is the my legal system that we demonstrated this morning and for those of you who have worked with a brain computer interface before maybe if you work with the away for example on the earlier project you see some common components there's an electrode cab there's an amplifier and there's a laptop and pretty much all BCI's have something like this but because we have to use non visual stimuli for these patients we also have these earbuds that we place in the ears and then a vibrotactile stimulator here that's on the side there it's collecting electrodes mainly from information from the top of the head and the earbuds are the tactile or the auditory stimuli and the tactile stimulators go on the wrist so you can put them on the wrists or wherever you want here is what they started here is what they look like I'll show that later nevermind what we are detecting and part is motor imagery so many people know that you can imagine moving the left hand or the right hand and this activates motor areas of the brain and this is what it looks like in a classic motor imagery BCI you're trying to detect left hand bruce's right hand movement and even if you don't actually perform the movement if you just think about grasping for example you see activity in the brain that reflects that you have successfully imagine left or right hand movement so of course if you can grasp if you can move your hands then there may be no need for ECI to communicate you can you can type or wave but if you can only imagine movement you can use that for communication and you might for example think about the left hand for yes and the right hand for no this is one way that you can communicate and shortly I'll demonstrate the p300 approach and we usually find that questions about the patient's background or best so if you ask about what is your father's name for example or what city were you born in things like this it can help to get the patient's attention this is a sample result and this is an example from a healthy user so we just got the motor imagery system we've been mostly working with the p300 approach that we show this morning but this demonstrates a nice sort of classic response where you see over the left hand versus the right hand you have a clear activation in one hemisphere or the other basically this area of the brain is right over the cement and water areas areas that respond to touch and the process movement and my needle can also use a p300 approach which can use auditorium or tactile stimuli and I'll show you so this is a very easy way to demonstrate the p300 this is a visual version that's not those of you that were here this morning this is a visual version not like the one that I showed if this is how most vc eyes work if they use the p300 they have a visual display that has maybe all the letters on the screen and what us the subject to do is silently count a certain target letter so this is a system of used with many ALS patients most of them are able to see even though they don't have good control of I movements they can't all see but most of them can focus their attention on a certain target and so you guys can play the p300 game because it's friday and we have an easy game so please just notice whenever the p flashes whenever you see the p flash just yell out loud say hey I said way the end so whatever the p flash is to say hey hey hey so we can play this game all day and and it's tempting we get to stay here even all weekend but the point of this is to demonstrate that this is a voluntary task where you choose to pay attention to something that's the key element that you think that something is important so of course you can count anything you want you can count that a or the eye or the J I don't really know what you're counting but in this case it's the letter P so we won't do it again because it's just too much fun but the point is the computer doesn't know what you're trying to communicate so what it does is after each flash it looks at the resulting brain activity and it's looking for something called the p300 which is over there the big bum what this is is a positive change in the eug a positive change in your brains voltage that occurs about 300 milliseconds after an event so if the event is a flash you get this only if you're paying attention to the flash so if you ignore the flash you see the p300 doesn't here but if you were silently counting it or you're yelling hey or any any task then you get a different brain wave and so this is how you can communicate with the brain computer interface you could use motor imagery there are different signals but a very common approaches like this you flash usually they're not individual letters but you group them in rows or columns so that it's faster and you tell someone to count whenever you hit the target letter and usually you get a clear p300 only when you flash that letter and as a result the computer says ok well we see this brain signal whenever we flash a certain letter and so we'll just put that on the screen and you do that a few times that you spelled a word and so I'm not going to talk about it much today because I'm mainly talking about mine beagle for communication which doesn't use visual stimuli this is just to show you an example of this but also as a side note I was talking with with eloy a little bit about patients in a locked in state and that's who I've been working with for almost 20 years for BC is it it's only recently that I started working with brought a variety of patients like minimally conscious and stroke so most of the people I worked with their late stage ALS and that the system works for them so it does provide communication so I think you'll I know it knows about it and is familiar with it but we just had a new partner in Italy we started using it with patients there and they're getting the same result they say yes it can provide communication and their main thing is how do you make it faster their various ways to make you faster but they're they're not worried about basic technical problems and we did a demo this morning with my bagel I'll get to that and it worked so this is the the vibra tactile stimulator that's connected to the wrist so when you're working with patients we would tape them to the wrist and the demo this morning you can just have people hold them all it matters is these vibrotactile stimulators are creating some that you can pay attention to that you can count in this case the event is a little feeling on your wrist just because it's so it's not an electrical stimulator it doesn't pass a current through the wrist it doesn't hurt it just vibrates so of course most of you don't know me but there are colleagues here who try to and say yeah it's easy it's not a it's not a painful or unpleasant stimulus but it's certainly enough that you can detect it and so the patient's task is to silently count whenever you stimulate one risk or the other wrist so for example we say the right wrist so imagine that you have these little things that vibrate periodically so you feel and whenever you feel a vibration you silently count it it's the same thing as yelling out hey but of course these people are going to can't speak so you use silent counting as a test whenever they silently count you see this bump this brainwave called the p300 develop but when they ignore the stimuli you see nothing so this is the same thing we saw this morning with developing a nice p32 with the healthy person of course but it was developing a nice p3 only to the target stimulus and we also tried it with tones there is a version with auditory stimuli with earbuds and you play a series of different tones a low-pitched tone and a high pitch tone so it's like boop boop beep and you tell them to silently count the high pitch tone and this will give you this brainwave only if they're able to follow the instructions so what that does is it provides a way to assess or reassess patients instead of having to use for example in fMRI or a more elaborate method you can use this to determine if people are able to understand you can they choose to count a certain stimulus are they able to remember long enough to do the task and they pay attention so for you or need to do the task is relatively easy but for a patient with severe damage they could different cognitive functions and also attentional functions it's actually showing you kind of a lot in terms of what spared function they have and we have different tests that we were showing this morning that can go along this hierarchy of function meaning that you you can start out by testing very basic detection of tones can people notice that something is different and then you can move up to using this approach for more advanced testing and also for communication so the way that you would use this for a communication like I was saying before it's pretty similar to the assessment you just have these taxes that are active in the left or the right and then you can tell someone that if you count the left hand that means yes and the right hand that means no and then you can start asking them yes or no questions and this is also in the protocol that I I'll send you that we were discussing that one of the things we do also to test the system is we simply ask questions like I was mentioning before is your father named Mario where you bored at Rome did you go to high school at France things like this because then we can tell from the yes or no that the system is working they can communicate and then you might go on to other questions where you don't know the answer are you too cold do you want a different room do you want to try rehabilitation therapy of course you might even ask about end-of-life decisions so in Italy they were very concerned about that and in theory you you can ask any type of questions so we're working on more advanced questions right now we only have yes or no or skip the question so we have a variant where we have three tacklers 33 different stimuli so that lets you say three things either yes or no or skip so we don't have it yet we won't have it for several months but we're working on new things with where we have for example a belt that you can wear that allows you more different distinct stimuli or maybe a bracelet on your wrist or neck device we saw a colleague in the United States and she had a device with 12 stimulators around the neck and so you can feel if it's stimulating here here and maybe you could get more advanced control but right now we don't have that so this is the vibrotactile stimulator that that we show this morning it's it's basically not a not a big deal technically it's pretty easy to simulate this is a common trick that people use when they're kids they put this little thing on that wrist shake your hand and it goes are you happy okay so in the next six slides I'm going to show three different participants and the reason I chose these three is I wanted to show a continuum of different responses the first one is with a healthy person and so this is just to show that it works with wealthy people we we found the same this morning so we are happy to say that one of your neurologist who we tested his conscious did have conscious awareness this morning good job Andres so it's fun doing these demos because if you're in a room with neurologist and it shows that a doctor is not conscious you can't explain that you can't say no it's his fault he's not doing the task if you're not conscious in this demonstration you it would really have been embarrassing for us but that didn't happen so we got hit accuracy and if you just look on the far side there on your right side you notice that the red line which is the p3 is very distinct there is a large clear p300 and the red line is for target stimuli and the blue line is for non target stimuli so for now I'm just focusing on these tasks there are also verbal tasks that you can do but just the p300 one which we demonstrated today you see that there's a very robust difference between these two and so just from looking at that with the human eye you should think well that must be easy to classify because I can see it looks pretty obvious so this next slide will show the accuracy that we got with this healthy person and you see that the accuracy there very quickly goes up to a hundred percent so often with the p300 the first time the very first pulse the first time it goes you often don't get a hundred percent because you have to average together a few of them to get a good signal this is common with the visual ones also it often takes a 33 stimuli and so with visual or auditory or tactile this is a fairly common result so if we get anything different if the healthy person does not show high accuracy we're gonna basically means the system doesn't work or the person wasn't doing the task for some reason then I would have been mad at it son not what happened alright so that's the first person there's nothing surprising there so we didn't learn anything from this we already knew that he was away but now here is a person this is an mcs patient and he had a traumatic brain injury and you see the crs our value is is 8 so this person got a score on the coma recovery scale that is consistent with the minimally conscious state the person had very little ability to move or respond to test instructions and you notice that if you look over on the p3 the difference is much less obvious and this is what you see in the literature with the p3 which is also used in clinical assessment that it tends to reflect cognitive ability persons with dementia with Alzheimer's disease with various kinds of injuries usually have smaller p3 in fact I could be something for a grant proposal but we can get into that later also depressants make it smaller so they've done studies with alcohol benzodiazepines marijuana any kind of anesthetic drug they've also used this as a tool for detection of awareness during surgery so if someone is anesthetized you can also if they have a p300 that means they're awake they're processing stimuli therefore the global anesthetic is working that well it may be maybe you want to do something about that but it's it's a commonly used tool so in this case it indicates the person does seem to have some some brain damage but there is enough of a difference the computer can detect and so the next slide shows what you get from two different runs and this is showing that it takes more stimuli but you can get up to a hundred percent accuracy what that basically means is it would be relatively slow instead of a healthy person where you could just have a few stimuli you might need to do it's a 10 x equals 10 times in tow meaning you can still communicate you know at a reasonable rate enough that you could ask yes or no a few times per minute but not as quickly as a healthy person could use it and then I wanted to put up another result just to emphasize what I was saying earlier which is that a lot of asians will of course not exhibit any conscious awareness and this was a patient who was in a vegetative state it was also a male person with traumatic brain injury but you see the crs our score was a little bit lower it was only a six instead of me and the p3 really doesn't look like much of anything and this is also what the classifier found so you see the accuracy is very low in this task the average accuracy by chance is 12 and a half percent because there ain't a vibrations going to the wrists and so you see it's about chance actors so you actually did get a nice response there over one channel but it wasn't really reliable and part of why I wanted to show this is that if you are some of the people who work with my beagle if you get a response indicating that someone cannot communicate it doesn't necessarily mean that that the patient is is permanently unaware it doesn't mean the system is not working it just might mean the system is correctly detecting the brainwaves this person produces while he or she does and do the task so if the person cannot do the task the EEG will reveal that there is no indicator of conscious awareness but it also indicates something else that we were discussing this morning which is that people may not be responsive during one session for different reasons so of course they may only be conscious at some times so patients with mgs made a sort of unconscious and not conscious it's hard to know when they're away tour or alert and able to respond and we had a patient just a couple weeks ago who fell asleep while we were collected data and we could clearly see right when it happened the beginning look really good the accuracy was up to over eighty percent and then right after the patient went to sleep it went down and we tried another run anyway with the same patient just to see but did work so one of the things that we were discussing is that you rarely want to assess somebody just one time or even two times if you get a no result you might want to try try again just because you know maybe they were they were asleep they were fatigued they were not motivated it's possible they didn't understand the task the first time you explained it to him and we have this in our protocols that we have instructions where we try to be very clear about what the task is we try to choose questions where it's really obvious so everybody knows if someone can only say yes or no make sure it's a question prefer that you can answer with a yes or no so to summarize this part and then I'll talk about the new system for stroke many persons are diagnosed and in some cases misdiagnosed as having no conscious awareness so again the common cause is that someone might have not been conscious during an initial assessment or improved after the initial assessment but of course it's always possible that when they did the assessment initially there was a problem with the equipment someone made a mistake the example of that that we're thinking about too is this might also be useful for low resource areas where you never have the chance of a proper assessment in the first place so here you live in a region where if you had a traumatic brain injury you can get to an MRI you get to not just a medical doctor but acknowledges to specializes in this but this is something for later on it's not something we're pushing with the Goodman Institute but we have a partner in China that we're working with who wants to explore it in the mountains and western China and he says he grew up there and that if somebody has an accident there they often don't see a doctor they have no diagnostic ability so it might be useful here too and the sea ice could provide reassessment and communication so the first thing that you want to do with this system and this is what I guess you're you'll start testing further with it soon the first thing is to see if they have a conscious awareness so there's no point trying to communicate with the patient who cannot hear you or doesn't understand or doesn't have enough memory to do the task so that's why we have assessment first you want to first do this assessment which takes it a few minutes so we showed it this morning it's not a really long thing and there are different tests that can assess different levels of mental abilities so you can assess for example do they have the ability to notice one tone that's different from other tones can they shift attention from left to right these are all things that are are important for rediagnosis but if they can't do these things then there's no point trying to communicate yes there's room a little cooler and EEG activity can vary greatly across sessions so I think you already know this but yeah like I said one session they might be sleep another session they're relatively alert and at this point I'm going to go to the second part of my talk with the new material for stroke but first I wanted to see if you have any questions but I showed so far and I'll be here after the talk of course to handle questions and I do realize I'm competing with both traffic and a weekend so don't worry I will not talk so long I think that I'm interested but I'm not as interesting it's going home for the weekend and it's a nice day at sunny so okay this part of my life this is not interesting because you know that already so stroke and lead to move the environment yes we know but so in physiotherapy what you often do is you can ask users to perform specific movements well imagining them so some persons who have a stroke have partial ability to perform movements but some some of them can no longer perform the movement so one example we work with the law is wrist dorsiflexion so many people have simply cannot raise their wrist and if you ask them to raise their their risk they can't do it at all some people can maybe do it a little bit and it with healthy people you can do it more and this is a common enough thing and you know it's on the fugu Meyer test and people do physiotherapy for it fairly often so what physiotherapists might do is they will manually help someone perform a movement after you ask the patient to imagine the movement so say ok I know you can't move your wrist but just try to think about lifting your wrist and then the therapist will manually lift the rest or sometimes you use functional electrical stimulators you put these fest ads here and here that stimulates the muscle it causes the risk to lift the basic problem with that is that it's a type of feedback in which you're doing feedback without knowing if the patient is actually performing the test right so a physiotherapist can ask someone to imagine moving but you have no objective way to verify if they're performing that movement nation right if they can move their wrist then you can objectively verify it you can see it you can put an EMG sensor or a position sensor but if you have none of those opportunities than how you know if the person is actually thinking about wrist movement and so this is essentially what God is thinking about it from a BCI perspective there's no objective way to measure that and so what this system is doing is providing that objective mechanism that is you you have an electrode calf and with the electrode cap you send the data on for signal processing like the slide I showed very early but the new part the thing that differs from conventional physiotherapy is that the feedback that's provided such as from a monitor or an FES is only active if the person imagines movement right so the electrode cap is there to detect the movement imagery I mentioned earlier that if people think about moving the left hand or the right hand and you can clearly see the difference in the EEG is it left or right and if they think about moving the feet or the legs that's more right in the middle of the head and so that's what you're you're getting toward right here you have a system that can detect whether someone is thinking about moving the left or the right wrist to the left or the right hand and you use that so that they only receive video feedback which is you can watch a monitor with with ends the video feedback only occurs if they actually imagine that movement so if you think about for example grasping than the left hand on that monitor will rats or if you think about doing this and the left and we'll move move up it will dorsiflex the left wrist and so this is a closed loop feedback system where the patients are only getting this feedback for the movement that they're imagining so a patient might not perform the movement imagery for a lot of reasons maybe they they don't understand or maybe they're they're not responsive at that time it could be you with motivation or depression another common thing when I talk about this with physiotherapists as they say that patients will try to do what you tell them that they're doing they use a compensatory strategies so instead of moving the arm they try to move the elbow or the shoulder in some way and they're trying to help you but of course that's not what you want what you really want is that the the feedback that they get is occurring only when they imagine the movement you're trying to basically strengthen the neurons in the brain responsible for that movement and you're trying to do that by re-establishing this connection to the physical movement and so that's what you're doing here is you're essentially providing a closed loop feedback you're providing a way that the feedback only occurs when they're imagining movement like they're supposed to and the feedback with the optional fest this is what we will have here hopefully next month so we're looking at returning because we have this new system that has bets I mean we've we've had it for a while we've been testing it and stuff but we will have an extra one soon and so with fests they they only see their wrist move if they imagine movement so the fest for those of you who haven't used it it just sends a current here through the wrist extensor muscles it will cause the risk to to move so if you have damage in the brain's such as from stroke or traumatic brain injury you might still be able to think about the movement in fact you typically can you can imagine moving you just can't cause these muscles to activate with with your brain this way you can so you think about moving and that causes the muscles to to activate but it doesn't do it directly it's not because you think about it the signal goes down the spinal cord and it goes to the muscles instead you think about it the signal goes to the electrode cap the electrode cap goes to the computer the computer controls this muscle but that can still cause this dorsiflexion so at this point I'm going to just pause the presentation the show a well show this video first and I'll show everyone so here is a video and this is a video with the recovery system with colleague and Romania and you see that that the hand movements there are being caused by the fest so that it's the stimulation that causes that to happen and you can also see a bar that goes it's kind of hard to see and what that reflects is the strength of the movement imagery now we have an avatar but this was a year ago and so you see that if the person thinks about moving the left hand a bar goes to the left and now it's going to be the right hand so you see this blue bar is going to the right and at the same time the person's right hand is active and so this is keep it playing while I'm talking over so this is something that is that it is new that you're using a brain-computer interface where the goal is not to say yes or no or other things the goal is to control your arm these a relation yes just as a stroke patient so i have a few slides later on that will show where I give examples of stroke patients and what happened and so also this is an older electrode caps so we used to record from 45 or 64 channels because we wanted to learn what channels matter now we just use 16 channels so the system that we want to bring here if you get ethical approval and if everything works and you're interested we have a system it's only 16 channels and the other big improvement like I was saying is that it has a real avatar so the visual feedback is not a bar that moves to the left or right it's the actual movement of the wrist and this is also an open question so recover X is of course a new system what you saw there was a prototype we don't we haven't proven that this visual feedback is better than just watching your own whoo we're seeing a bar move or here in tones nobody knows that yet people know that that the the immersive avatar is effective and this is actually a group in Barcelona that we work with named else later who works at the University of Barcelona has done a lot of work with virtual avatars and feedback for stroke patients and also I guess you're friends with this guy image before if I leave it is who works at wait a cat and they also are interested in this you know the best ways to really provide feedback but we don't know it might be better to just have your own arm that's moving so I'll show some of this and then as i mentioned i have another short video this is an example of one of the patients we worked with with the prototype system so this is in 2014 it's a person from romania and the guy had a stroke he was right-handed and this here shows the performance on the nine-hole peg test with the right hand so many people have seen the nine-hole pen test but some of you haven't it's a test you know where you take pegs you have to put them in holes so for healthy people just like this person with the left hand it takes very roughly 30 seconds to do the test there's some variety but that's what we were getting here so it tends to be a little bit longer for persons who are older they take a little longer to do the task men and take a little bit longer than women to do the task I'm not even going to get into that one but you see in this case with the right hand this person started out pretty bad it took more than one minute to do the test and he used the Republic system from about june until about September and then you see that it a follow-up run a few months later and their performance with the right hand was it up normal so the results that I'm presenting here again this is a new system so what we don't have and what we're just starting is a large-scale clinical trial so I can't say for certain that this is a better result than he would have had if he got conventional physiotherapy instead but it does at least validate the system it shows that it works at can provide improvement and so again this is what we might start doing with you if you're interested is working with with this with a larger control study and I'm just curious is anyone here a physiotherapist and you physical therapist coalition of hippies too yeah occupational favorite school yeah so I might want to talk to you more later manthous so g-tech actually has been hiring new types of people we hired a physiotherapist who's been helping with all this system design and it's it's fun to be working with a new patient group basically a new application so again like I was saying before with my bagel this is a new goal the goal is not really to provide communication the goal is rehabilitation the goal is to help them regain motor function more quickly than they would otherwise and here I'm not going to go into too much detail with these slides because I know it's not it's more medical and not engineering but one interesting thing here this is basically showing you the the experience from the computers point of view which you know we care more about the patients but the computer cares about whether it can separate left hand movement and right hand movement and you see that they they can so here is the first session and you see the blue line in the green line which reflect left hand and right hand look almost identical there's no real difference there and at the end after training the blue and the green lines look separate so that means the computer was able to separate left movement going out to the left and right movement going off to the right and this is not just our work so there have been a few studies one of them was from another hospital of santa lucia foundation in rome and they were finding that this tends to occur with with this kind of training that if you train people with a brain computer interface that controls the fest system you tend to see a clearer separation left and right hand which is consistent with improved recovery from stroke and also if any of you want any of these papers or anything please just email me I have my email address at the end or I'm happy to talk to you but I have you know numerous papers that i can stand not just from us but from from other people and this is an interesting patient because she already completed conventional therapy several years ago so this person had a stroke in 2010 and she was unable to move her left hand so she was an example where this hand couldn't move at all and after a conventional therapy of 2010 she still could not move her her left hand so that was the end of her experience for therapy and then four years later she came and saw this brain computer interface system and decided to use it and so it's interesting for two reasons first this is the only patient we had who was in that that timing system where first she did conventional therapy then we had a gap then she did this kind of therapy and it's also interesting because this is well into the chronic state so four years after the stroke it's not to say that physiotherapy is useless but usually physiotherapy is recommended more in the sub acute stage when people had more able to respond so we in a sense we had a disadvantage relative to the conventional therapy she did that right after the stroke and then four years later we tried this and so after ten sessions she got some ability to move her hand we never did the nine-hole peg test with her because she was never sufficiently recovered but this is showing a case where the recovery system worked when prior therapy efforts did not even invent the chronic state and this is another thing I guess we can talk about more later we have different kinds of testing partners so this recover its project we just got new funding to do larger scale tests that just start a little early and so we're finding that we kind of get two kinds of people one of them is dealing with patients usually in the sub acute stage right after they have a stroke in which case they have to give the patient's conventional therapy for ethical reasons but then they can also do recoveries therapy and then the second type that we're getting our examples like this person where they work with people who have completed conventional therapy already so they did conventional therapy it didn't provide full movement restoration then they want to try something later on which is kind of scientifically different than they do one kind of therapy and then they do a different kind of there so we're open to work with those because i know you have basically all kinds of nations but you have some subacute and then somewhere here in the longer term for rehabilitation so I just have a few more examples and then I'm done so this is showing similar to the for that this this woman who at the beginning the left and right brain activity look very similar so when the classifier is trying to figure out is she thinking about doing this movement or that movement the classifier can't do it and by the end of its it's pretty good and this is another example of someone so we've worked with a total of I think six stations so far with a recovering system prototype so again it's a new system for just using it now and this person we also couldn't do the 9-volt peg test as the right hand was paralyzed but you see in there the class separation wasn't much better but the thumb and finger movement improved so they were doing in Google Meyer an upper extremity and they also had am I forgot the name of it that they had another test that i can find out that was specific to finger activity and this is a another person and gave the ability to move the hand from about the stomach all the way up to the mouth that was really good and so the interesting new finding that we have is that functional improvement not require a high classification accuracy right so what this means is that lets say for a communication system they would only get maybe eighty or ninety percent or even seventy percent with yes/no questions that can be kind of frustrating but we find that the therapy still is providing improvement they're still getting the feedback fairly often and so we're still looking at that that's a new and new observation so we'll go on to my summary and then I'm done so conventional therapy relies on feedback that may not be paired with motor imagery that is people might be told to imagine the movement but they might not be doing it for various reasons and so DCIS can monitor the EEG to add a real time measure of motor imagery it can tell you without any delay so in true real-time there's no real processing delays and say this person is thinking about left hand movement and then you might for example activate the left fest or you might take other activities that that would improve the physiotherapy loop and in non real-time it's also just useful for assessing compliance so if you see day after day that a person is not performing the required motor imagery that you can say hey what are you doing going to work harder and we need further work to show that it's better than conventional methods so again it's still something we were developing now but it's good enough that we wanted to talk to you about it and maybe work with you on it and so I first I'm of course grateful to Eloy for setting up the talk and for hosting us and these are a couple locations where you can find more information about it and the last thing to say is that on the GTECH web page we have webinars so if you can email me too or just go to gtech and type webinars we have a lot of webinars that last one hour they're free they're similar to the talk that I just gave but we also have a live demo so and if you can come I give my talk and then we have a demo so you can you can say okay I want to show that the system works tell them to imagine the left hand and you can see the left hand activates and it provides a different way to help show how the system works how long it takes to set up which we did it today it's only a few minutes and other such things so that's it for my talk and I think we have a little time for questions really all right yeah question time yeah using the robeks can you will position the fair Zoe and every particle that whether you want our your intent on before at least extension good question that's still in development so right now all we've been doing testing with so far as wrist extension we now have in addition elbow elbow extension knee extension and there's one more that they're working on and those just became available in the last few weeks so we just started doing that this is another thing to possibly discuss with you is if you want to try other types of movements one good thing about Goodman is you have access to patients with lower limb disabilities in addition to upper leg so yeah we we don't have it we want to start using it so the fest pads themselves they just they just work anywhere so you can put the pads here at the back of the knee we have two different paths sizes so the only cause of the delay was developing the new avatars and then testing it to make sure it's safe so I think we'll be back in a month or six weeks somewhere around there and so if anybody wants I'm happy to visit with people and we can talk about if you're interested what kind of patients you work with what protocols you you would be interested in doing what kinds of things you want from us so we can try to develop things around you guys just just one for you and ready just as well to the record rigs you said that you're gathering data to somehow make the end its pieces this is effective compared to a conventional therapy right but and you want us to become one of the partners to two I mean to collaborate this trial but I thought that there were some evidence already in the literature conveying that this therapy I mean providing fairs and motor imagery is is okay guess there that that's where they're both true so there have been several papers published and there's a lot of data like I shown you that shows that this approach is more effective I meant that we haven't proven it in this and nobody has with a large-scale clinical trial so the reason I mention that is just for billing reasons and practical reasons at this point we can't honestly say that we've clinically proven or anyone is clinically proven that it's it's better because the papers are with a dozen patients or twenty patients or something they come from different groups so it doesn't have a clinical trial where you have a much larger number of subjects but yes there have been papers that have said that we compared this approach with DCI and a functional electrical stimulator to something else or to a sham therapy where you just don't turn the amplifier on and the DCI therapies is better so yeah it's it's not it's not that unproven it's not like we just have this crazy idea that there hasn't been a clinical trial thank you very much ok thank you very much there you
