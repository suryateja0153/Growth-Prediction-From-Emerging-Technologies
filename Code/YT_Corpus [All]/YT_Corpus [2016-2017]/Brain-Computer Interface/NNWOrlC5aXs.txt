 There are two things that limit us... ...our consciousness and  what we can understand. I had a traumatic brain concussion a few years back. And... ...for months to maybe  even years afterwards. So that was the first time  I really got interested in this... The world inside of our head is just as as complex as  the world outside of it. And that's why I started OpenBCI. BCI stands for brain computer interface. I believe that brain  computer interfaces have an amazing potential to help us... One thing that humanity  has always been good at is... If there's something we don't understand, it frustrates us and  we need to figure that out. I don't think we're ever going to reach the limits of our consciousness. But it's still fun to explore it, and to break it down into components and figure out, how can  we improve this one? 10 years from now,  we will be a different species We'll still be humans, but we'll be different humans  than we are today.
