 brain-computer interfaces allow communication without movement of muscles they are used by paralyzed patients as a last resort to communicate with our environment typically these interfaces require expensive research grade hardware which impedes widespread use and development of these interfaces researchers at the dunder Center for cognition invented a fast new brain computer interface with so-called noise tacs or broadband visual stimulations these fast flickering patterns can be presented as buttons on a screen and used to detect reliably to which one the user is attending the brain responds to these flesh patterns can be measured reliably with an EEG headset and even with consumer grade hardware the cap shown in this video can be put on in seconds and connects wirelessly to the computer after a short calibration phase to learn the brain response this interface can be used to spell words the patented noise tagging technique opens the door for many users to start communicating with a brain-computer interface oh she for more information on this technology please contact us you
