 We restored locomotion in primates with spinal cord injury and for this we developed a brain-spine interface that decodes motor intention from brain signals, bypasses the lesion, sending this information to the spinal cord below the injury in order to produce the intended walking movements. For the first time, I can imagine a patient, completely plegic, being able to obey to his brain commands through this brain-spine interface. If you have a lesion of the spinal cord, then the command is not going to reach the legs and is going to stop at the level of the spinal cord lesion, and the primate is not going to walk. So concretely, we inserted 100 electrodes in a small region of the cortex that controls the leg and send the information from all the neurons we recorded to a computer that decoded the motor intention of the primates based on this signal. This means, the extension or flexion movement of the leg. And the computer sends then this information to an implantable stimulator that had the capacity to deliver stimulation at the correct location with the correct timing in order to reproduce the intended extension and flexion movement of the leg. The brain-spine interface required the development of a fully implantable wireless, real-time system that enabled the primate to behave freely without constraint. We understood how to extract the motor intention with mathematical algorithms, and where and when to stimulate the spinal cord to induce the walking movement. To make the link between the decoding of the brain and the stimulation of the spinal cord – to make this communication exist – is completely new. This is the first time that a neurotechnology restores locomotion in primates, but there are many challenges ahead and it may take several years before this can become a therapy for humans.
