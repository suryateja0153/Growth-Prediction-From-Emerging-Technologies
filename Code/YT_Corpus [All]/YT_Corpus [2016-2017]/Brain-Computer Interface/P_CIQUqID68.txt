 well thank you very much it does it matter which one of these I use I don't know so neuro technology is a relatively new field and also one that is exploding you'll hear about it over and over again more and more in the press and it is a field that has very high ambitions its goals are to do things like cure paralysis blindness depression and memory loss but not through drugs but by using a combination of neuroscience knowledge how the brain works and combining it with technology not only to treat brain disorders but also to even make replacement parts that can fix the broken brain so the there have been really some spectacular successes in this field already one is the cochlear implant it's allowed about 250,000 people including a large percentage of them children to hear again they have useful hearing as a consequence of this little device that can be placed inside their ear and stimulate their brain the the however a lot of the the really creative ideas that are emerging from universities are languishing in the laboratory because to produce something as complex as a neuro technology a device that interfaces with the brain you need to combine neuroscience and technologists engineers clinicians and this is enormously complex it requires a different kind of culture than we used to and it requires the enormous resources to carry off so last year what I want to talk about is last year I left a very comfortable position as a professor at neuroscience researcher for 30 years at Brown University to establish a really a new and unique model of being able to bring the ideas of how to use neuro technology to treat human disorders to a much more accelerated pace and a much more efficient paste paste that brings together these various cultures so what I want to do is start from my own personal perspective to develop a brain-computer interface which we call brain gate so let me let me explain what this is so you're seeing Matt that's Matt Lee's a guy in his 20s he's playing a video game and he's supposed to hit the treasure chests and avoid the goblins which are the little squares now you'd say for a guy in his 20s you know that he's not a very good gamer well in fact matt has had a really terrible spinal cord injury that has disconnected his brain from his body so he's completely paralyzed he can think about moving but he can't move his arms or his legs or any part of his body at all so what is he doing well what we did is we developed a tiny device about the size of a collar button that's that little array of electrodes it looks like a little hairbrush a neurosurgeon put that into Matt's brain in the part of the brain that actually creates your intention to move your arm and we are able to take that signal out put it into a computer and we have the ability to translate his thoughts about wanting to move that cursor into the actual movement of the curse or a language that the computer can understand and allows him independence that he never had so this was the the the beginning of a brain computer interface this was 2006 and I realized actually as I came here this was bookended by wired stories Matt was interviewed and actually played pong with a wired us a reporter and now jump really 10 years ahead also covered in a wired story you saw Kathy at the beginning there in the wired story from from wired here and cathy is a person who is completely paralyzed due to a stroke actually 10 years before this this video took place and now we're not having her move a cursor on a screen but she's actually using her thoughts to control a robotic arm so she can move she's moving that robotic arm merely by thinking about it and what she's doing is for the first time since she had her stroke she's able to feed herself for morning coffee in other words she can do it on her own without having somebody bring her the coffee hold it in front of her mouth and let her drink so in some sense this is a really amazing accomplishment but to me 10 years of development and work going from cursors to robotic arms so what what you know do we have a product do we have something that's really developing well let me just let you peek in on and we'll just show you first Kathy's response to be able to do this was really I think an iconic image that's captured all over the internet but but let me show you what the scene really looks like you know it's it's a lab you can see that kathy has a plug on her head that the surgeon had placed there there's a technician that's connected that kind of a box which is amplifiers and electronics it goes to other boxes goes to that card of computers that does the translation which then goes by other wires over to a robotic arm this is definitely not a product so in one sense I feel very proud that we developed something on the other sense I said we don't have anything that's really out there in the world that's really helping people how can we convert that into a into a product and a lot of people worked a long time to get this far so what's our vision so what I want to do is show you a quick animation that will last just a minute but it gives you the idea of the vision of what we want to do is a person where somebody who's paralyzed you don't recognize them as being paralyzed they're just doing everyday things in the world but have a technology that allows them to reconnect their brain back to their body so i'll let this charming British accent women explain the idea to you the vcenter is developing new technology that will enable people to reactivate paralyzed limbs through thought this system consists of a tiny micro electrode array which is implanted on the brain surface this array is connected to a communication unit which sits on the skull beneath the skin when the person thinks about moving this implant transmits the intent wirelessly to an external processing unit worn on the belt here signals from the brain are interpreted and relayed to a small pacemaker like device which is connected directly to a nerve cuff electrode the unit stimulates the nerve which activates muscles to turn thoughts into action so so this kind of technology goes from brain to technology and back to the nervous system we're back to the body again now so what what the question is why can't we do that and one of the reasons is this this path of especially for neuro technology but for many devices is going from the concept which is emerging largely from universities from research centers all the way through early stage prototypes animal testing human pilot trials and finally into something that a company would say is attractive enough for them to be able to say we want to commercialize this and make it available to people who really need it that that pipeline actually has a lot of holes in it it has what's called the valley of death in which because we don't have all of the resources that's in terms of people the interdisciplinary teams and quite frankly the money to put all this together a lot of these ideas die and they spend ten years going from cursor control to robotic arm control so the vcenter is a new model in which we can bring together experts and technology and financial resources in order to accept not only sort of move things through this pipeline but also be able to accelerate that development so it made possible by a very generous gift from hansjörg visa swiss philanthropist we have moved into a wonderful new center in geneva that is a new hub of neuroscience there which contains both academics and and other other people and what in the vcenter what we've done is really bring together a sort of unique clustering of people and technology and funding that I hope will be the accelerating force for this pipeline so I think one of the innovations is the the way we've structured the experts so we have this vertically integrated team so unlike businesses or academia where people the same mind tend to work together here we have neuro scientists engineers clinicians regulatory people and even people from project management and industry that are all working together that they work as a team to help take that idea and bring it forward in addition we're very fortunate to have invested in technology that brings state-of-the-art engineering tools and state-of-the-art neuroscience research tools so that we can develop new prototypes we can test them even in humans and where we can't do that we have partnerships with leading industries that were forming now and the ideas then when we can't solve a problem we know who to go to an industry in order to solve that problem and bring innovation into it and of course thanks to mr. visa we are very fortunate to have a really generous gift so that we can support all of this so let me give you an idea of the kinds of projects that we're trying to support we're beginning to support and we've just started doing this but of course you've heard about the brain computer interface project and that's one of the things that were supporting with the vcenter in addition we're supporting a project on a bionic eye engineering genes to restore hearing stimulating the virtual reality to combat pain brain stimulation to boost memory and Alzheimer's disease reshaping the brain in dyslexia and engaging brain plasticity to recover or maximize or optimize recovery of function from stroke we don't expect all of these things to work but these there are brilliant young academics that are providing us with the ideas that we're helping them to take it to become a real world solution so I don't have time to talk about all of these I'll just pick two and one of them is dyslexia so dyslexia is a a reading disorder and it is in which when when people read it's a in about ten to twenty percent of children you can the words are not spaced correctly so it's an interesting and very puzzling kind of problem because what you see when you look at this sentence that says the words are spaced correctly and what lands on the eye of a person with dyslexia is exactly the same it's in the brain that this is broken up improperly so you get a perception of the words in a way that isn't orderly and doesn't make sense and so it makes it difficult and challenging to read so in collaboration with an leisure Oh who's a faculty member at the University of Geneva and now a V scientists working with us she had an idea she studied language for a long time and what she found is that in us we have this sort of rhythm in our brain in the language areas of the brain a kind of hum of the brain some people think it's just like the idling of your car but you actually hypothesized no in fact this might be the rhythm that helps us break up our words into phonemes or pieces that make sense to us so she looked in dyslexics and sure enough she found that this rhythm is wrong the rhythm is too fast and so it led to the hypothesis that maybe what we could do is retrain the brain come up with a device that will retrain the brain and stimulate it so that the frequency is shifted downward and the idea the hypothesis is we'd be able to cure dyslexia so this is an early stage project it's just getting underway there is a technology where we can now apply brain stimulation from the outside and we can try to oscillate do we know whether it will actually drop the frequency down no we don't but we have the beginnings of technology and a very solid hypothesis from a very bright scientist that will will help us go forward with this kind of a project and we think if we can reshape brain rhythms in dyslexia this might be applicable to a large number of other disorders where the perception is disrupted so let me get back to brain gate is another project to talk about and one of the things you saw is that in in the case of Kathy you saw she has a plug on her head she has this big electronics on her head and she has this cable and one of the reasons that we have that way is because the electronics the the is extremely sophisticated that we need to process all this information we're basically working at internet speeds and there was no way to put this kind of technology inside the body but working at the vs we have a project on going that will allow us to develop the world's most sophisticated radio from the brain working at internet speeds it will take the channels of information that we pick up from that tiny sensor and process it from a device that is implanted just under the skin on top of the skull and it will broadcast out and one of the challenges here are enormous one of the reasons why we didn't complete this say in an academic setting is because not only does this have to have the most advanced electronics inside very sophisticated radios but it also has to have materials that are safe for people has to have batteries that you can have inside under your skin that are safe but these are challenges that most academics have no idea that you have to have titanium this has a sapphire window it has all kinds of complex technologies but by bringing together the engineers and the scientists we can really tackle this problem and we expect in two years that will have this this this device in humans and an even better version of the device in a couple of more years after that so I thought I'd end by just taking a message from Cathy and going back to say well from the patient's perspective what would they like to see so Cathy wrote me an email to tell me what she would like to see she liked the garden and she liked to to do she liked to make red pepper relish was her favorite thing and she really missed that she said though that even something simple like holding a book in her hands or even with a robotic hand would be a big deal for her and then she said as you recall I said she can't speak so she really didn't like the idea of not being able to speak so in terms of her wishes I think we're well on our way with a model like the vcenter can provide to being able to provide Cathy at least with the robot arm to hold the book but better than that I hope be able to restore movement to her arm and with the skills and the knowledge that we gain from from doing this project on her arm maybe we can apply that same knowledge and be able to restore speech to Cathy and have a device that's not only available just for her but something that's commercially available in the world to all of the people who need this kind of technology so we can succeed in that then I think the visa model is really something that really works in little courts make me extremely happy that we've put together a really creative and new and unique kind of environment no thank you John it's some brilliant an inspiring work so we're in a world where Moore's law continues processing power keeps rising miniaturization of sensors is still happening and over the next five to ten years presumably the implantable devices will get smaller and more powerful is the limitation what we can understand about how the brain functions yes so so there really is both I think that that you know designing these devices that are better and better able to communicate and understanding the brain go hand in hand we can't separate those two there are there's a challenge in the United States now to get rid of these kinds of implanted sensors and maybe pepper the brain with dust that will allow you to record all over the brain and then we'll put the that really how you separate them the brain depends on our theory of the brain I think one of the big revolutions in the past for four or five years is that instead of looking at the brain one cell at a time it's really the community of networks that interact on the brain that has the message how we study that as a big neuroscience question if we crack that then the sensors that the engineers can build us can tell us much more about how the brain is operating and we can make really even more and more sophisticated devices which in fact what we're trying to do is to emulate the brain make a piece when that when there's a piece of the brain missing was a piece of the brain not off operating properly we're trying to make a technology that will replace that and it's sort of a lot of hubris to say we can do that but I think those two things working together engineering and neuroscience can give us really a new insight a new way to do this now science is quite messy and doesn't move in a linear direction you had a lot of people who have a family member who has a physical constraint will think well this is my solution this is what I've been waiting for how much do you worry about creating unrealistic expectations in the potential patients so we're very frank when we deal with each individual participant in a trial that that we you know we are only promising that we will learn from them and we have learned tremendously from them but we can't give them any direct benefit it is really an ethical issue not to promise too much I think there's a lot of hype around neuroscience and understanding the brain I think we're those of us who dig deep inside the brain are very humbled by how little we really know and so we do have to be extremely cautious that these are long-term events someday you know there are these breakthroughs that give us a step function improvement in understanding but those are extraordinarily difficult to predict very difficult to know when those things come along so whenever we're asked the question by wired interviews or other press that that we you know they say how long will it take and I think we need to be very cautious as scientists to say we just can't determine that but I am very optimistic than a decade you know there'll be people in the audience here who have some form of paralysis who will be maybe not typing on their computer but moving their mouse around and they'll be doing it with a brain gate like device one final question I'm getting tired typing messages onto the screen and Siri doesn't always understand what I mean how long until you see healthy people wearing the little device that converts thought directly into text so you you would think that I would be the sort of big proponent of saying you know implant everybody in the brain I have to say that that hands are really extraordinary voices are really good at communicating these have you know millions of years of evolution to really produce them I think know the problem with voices of course Siri doesn't understand that well or if it's a noisy environment it's really a very difficult of a difficult challenge but I think there really is an extraordinarily big barrier between the time when we're sort of you know having lots of electrodes put into our brains which unfortunately is probably the only way we can get that level of information there's a really a big barrier to doing that I have met one young gamer at Google who didn't care he would have had electrodes put anywhere in his prey I think where most of us are not ready for that yet I'm sure Mark Zuckerberg is working on it thank you very much from Geneva in the visa Institute John Donahue
