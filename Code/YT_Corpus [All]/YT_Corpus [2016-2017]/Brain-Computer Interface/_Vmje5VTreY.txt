 Mike and his collaborators realized that if they could read these efference copies in the brain synthetic telepathy could advance to the next stage transmitting thoughts not just in Morse code but in common phrases finding and isolating an efference copy in the electrical jumble of the mind is no easy thing the exact location of neural activity is difficult to discern because the scalp scald and cerebral fluid surrounding the brain scatter its electric signals before they reach the electrodes of an EEG correspond emotion to what you actually see expressed in the characters face it was a very very exciting time where we realized that we had rounded that corner and that we had true human emotion captured and performed by a nonhuman character but they sent me here to learn your ways what are you saying Jake you knew this would happen yes what about this one run don't run run definitely run neurorehabilitation is whether the cells in the motor cortex and other parts of the brain whether they continue to function the same way years after that original injury it is possible for people to use their thoughts to control devices either a computer or a robotic arm the way that happens is that we implant a tiny sensor just about the size of a baby aspirin just into the surface of the brain and that sensor pick up the electrical impulses from a bunch of neurons and each of those old neurons are like radio broadcast towers putting out impulses and when they get to the outside a computer translator converts the pattern of pulses into something that is a command one of our participants was able to do something that when all of a thought for the first time gave us all pause she reached out with the robotic arm she thought about the use of her own hand she picked up that thermos of coffee brought it close to her tilted it towards herself and sip and coffee from a straw that was the first time in nearly 15 years that she had picked up anything and been able to drink from it solely of her own volition there was a moment of true joy true happiness I mean it was beyond the fact that it was an accomplishment I think an important advance in the entire field of brain computer interfaces that it was really a moment where we helped somebody do something that they had wished to do for many years then fought back we boys simply just unplugging him right there's a story that scientists built an intelligent computer the first question they asked it was that their God the computer replied there is now an a bolt of lightning striking a plug so it couldn't be turned off holy that's the most terrifying story on a manhunt hold on who is talking to me right now is it you or is the sentient computer pretending to talk on your behalf it's me yeah but how do I know that Professor because if computers had become sentient what better way to convince people they hadn't then by co-opting the voice of the most intelligent man on the planet you're an idiot yeah he's saying that Stephen you in the machine
