 we are developing a new method of controlling wheelchairs for those with severe movement disabilities state-of-the-art wheelchairs interfere with conversation and other daily tasks wheelchairs also limit the users independence our solution uses head mounted sensors to receive input from the user when they want to act the system outputs action options to the user with a vibrational band to declare intention the user imagines moving their foot when they feel the corresponding vibration from the band a head-mounted sensors detect the intention and the simulation acts testing showed that our system is above usability average and learn abilities within thirteen percent of the benchmark
