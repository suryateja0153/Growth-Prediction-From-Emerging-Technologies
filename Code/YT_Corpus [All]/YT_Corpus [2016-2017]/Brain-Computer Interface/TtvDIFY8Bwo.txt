 hello hello I am to hear a computer science student at the University of Minnesota as a kid I fantasized about controlling things with just my thoughts today I'm lucky to have access to this neat Emotiv EPOC plus neuro headset at the University lab so I thought of playing around a bit with it but I will be demonstrating today how to turn yourself into a cyborg just kidding but that will be in a future video kidding again today I will be presenting a video in which I use the sensors on this headset to play a computer game so I'll be playing a computer game without using my hands at all how cool is that well not clearly as cool as turning yourself into a cyborg but not too far right not too far this is the Emotiv EPOC plus headset that extracts all your thoughts and controls you in your sleep kidding kidding right this does not do that this is a non-intrusive device which means that it can only read your brain signals but not in any way manipulate them the set set comes in built with 14 in eg channels and to reference sensors which basically means that it can sense your brain signals and then lets you access them through an API so the game used for this demo is a multiplayer first-person shooter game called combat 3 the reason I've chosen this this game is because firstly it's free and it's online and secondly basically it can be operated both on keyboard and mouse so I'll be able to show a variety of actions that I can map them so let's just stop the jibber-jabber and get on with the demo so since I since I have already recorded this part yesterday I'm just going to go ahead and show you the clips that I that I recorded yesterday of exactly the the movements I was talking about so blinks and I winks and basically basically any any muscle action like smile raising my eyebrow so I'm using mainly muscle actions to trigger events whose immediate action I would need mainly because of two reasons the first firstly and most importantly these actions are ones that I that I can control at will I know how to control that will like for example smiling and and raising my eyebrows I can't control these at will and secondly it will also be much easier for you my viewers to basically see how my actions correspond to different in-game actions so first what I'm going to do is I'm going to quickly start my program and you won't be able to see this dear and let me go to the game so now you can see I'm controlling without my hands and I'm going to keep my hands here just so that you know I'm not cheating so without my hands are basically controlling the mouse and I can go and I can basically select any room like that and I just I just winked to to click basically oh yeah so now if I smile I'm basically moving in front there is everyone oh alright so looks like looks like you've got just dis friendly people in this so as you can see have if I blink if I blink I can actually tell people if they went from it seems better this guy is is a friendly guy so no point in shooting him this is this is how it can be done yeah if i wink basically i can start playing so i go to level 1 and level 1 seems pretty easy i shoot somebody and yeah that was level one and we can so so as you can see I'm I'm controlling I'm controlling this very simple game pretty effectively maybe I should head somewhere there and as you can see I'm doing I'm doing both mouse clicks and mouse moves and and I would say I would say it's pretty easy to control this not at all hard maybe I should hit somewhere there no really sure maybe some whatever not really somewhere there yeah that's that's better mm-hmm yeah so as you can see I I won't go further so basically I mean this is this is a demonstration of what I've built over the last few days all right so now that you've seen movement controlled by different muscle actions let's see how a non muscle action can trigger an event since you can't of course visualize when I make a non muscle action I'm going to log that onto the screen so that you can see the actual values of that particular motion that I'm gonna log so for this demo I'm tracking short-term excitement levels in my brain how this works is that when my excitement levels reach a particular threshold value in this case I've set it as 0.5 that will reload my in-game weapon and with practice I've realized that I can make this happen by thinking something happy and just by just by looking at the numbers and kind of like trying to get myself excited about the numbers a bit weird I know but yeah that that's the way I've learned to do it and this is a bit hard because it's I mean excitement is usually an involuntary kind of action so it is a bit hard it may take a little time so please bear with me so they go have started the program and I'm now trying to increase my excitement level so just shoot a couple of bullets and then as soon as my excitement level reaches 0.5 come on come on before someone kills me there you go so folks that was my demo for today I had a lot of fun building this game controller and I hope you had fun watching this video - thank you and see you next time
