 I was traveling in the United States and I had been reading about the field of brain machine interfaces that was developing in the United States and particularly funded through the US defense force. The organization that was conducting this work is DARPA the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency which is world-renowned for developing radical innovative research and I met with Colonel Geoffrey Ling who at the time was the leading military neurologist in the US defence force. I pitched to him the idea of utilizing a brain machine interface system that was built onto an endovascular electrode array that is a stent electrode array. With a pat of the back and hearty chuckle he said that's a nice idea will give you a million dollars to do that and I had to go home back to Australia in trying to put together a team that could try and put this work together. So with that motivation I spent a couple of months in the states I went to laboratories and I came time with this idea and I approached the University of Melbourne and particularly academics Terry O'Brien, David Grayden and Tony Burke who at the time working on the bionic eye and we put together a team and we put together a team that was capable of delivering a this technology and we started working on it. It took us two years it took several million dollars and support from various government organizations including the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia and we built a system which could record brain activity from the brain without having to conduct open brain surgery or a craniotomy
