 brain computer interfaces are a direct communication method between the brain and an external device they are used by paralyzed patients as a last resort to communicate with our environment this pci is robust to typical EEG artifacts therefore I can talk blink with my eyes or even eat a candy bar well I am communicating typically these interfaces are very sensitive to muscle movements such as talking head motion I blings and even I movements researchers at the donor center for cognition invented so-called broadband visual simulations to increase the efficiency of brain computer interfaces brain responses to these fast flicker patterns can be measured reliably with an EEG headset using these recorded brain signals the computer can predict which flash pattern a user is attending this works so well that this new interface is even robust too common ed artifacts the patented noise taking technique brings EG based pc ice closer to the consumer market this opens the door to a broad range of new devices and applications b0 with artifacts for more information and this technology please contact us you
