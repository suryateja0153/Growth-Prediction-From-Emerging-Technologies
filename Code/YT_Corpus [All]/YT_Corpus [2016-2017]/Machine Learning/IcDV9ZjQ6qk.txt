 today I'm in the Big Apple meeting with Josh Gordon from Google to talk about machine learning where we will dig into how it works why it's important and where you can learn all about it welcome to coffee with a Googler in New York City I'm Laurence Moroney and I'm here today speaking with Joshua Gordon now it's something that a lot of people don't really understand what machine learning is in a concrete manner so learn so machine learning is all about learning from examples rather than writing manual rules got it so regular the short way of saying that it's regular programming is you write a lot of manual rules to solve a problem and a machine learning you let the algorithm find those rules for you got it from examples some pattern matching it might be visual or it might be like other patterns that are hidden in absolutely and so the input to machine so the beauty of machine learning like the real secret sauce is that an algorithm that learns patterns from data can solve thousands of different problems and the reason is if I write a Python program to recognize digits my program is hard-coded to work with digits got it but if I write an algorithm to learn patterns from data right I can use that for speech recognition image recognition medicine basically anything that you can start with examples just tell apart a and B my same algorithm that I wrote just once where I can tackle all these problems and that's a really special and actually fairly profound thing absolutely yeah now one of the things in your class is that you're talking about that you're starting with language right you're starting with Java and Python I think it was these yes absolutely so how is the class going to be structured for people who want to be these data scientists absolutely so first of all there are zero prerequisites let's not sure there's one pre-race favorite yeah okay well what's the one prereqs a sick programming ability okay in Java or Python ok and by basic I mean like you can you can run scripts and you can tweak them okay that's it go um a little bit of high school math and that means like basic algebra okay a sick geometry when I say basic geometry like to be totally honest if you ask me like what's sine and cosine like I would happen to Google it I don't remember honestly so just basic familiarity okay and that's it and we're gonna teach the class in three ways we're going to teach it totally from the ground up so one problem I had with these with some of the academic classes I took is that they'll talk about a fancy like neural networks but they'll talk about in terms of math and so at the end of the class I don't know how to build that I can't really do it we're doing it in Reverse way we're building it step by step and we're explaining only the math that's really necessary as we go okay and instead of equations we're gonna use visual examples perfect so an equation could be like if you talked about gradient descent gradient descent basically means finding the minimum of a function mm-hmm so if I just say that like it's developer I'm like all right like what does that mean so you can think of like any equation like X cubed plus y squared plus whatever equals 7 yep there's some value of x and y that's going to be the bottom of that curve or not equal set like equals some value yeah right yeah anyway you can find the bottom of that curve but literally by thinking as a bowl you can like drop drop a pizza like fruit in a bowl and it will roll to the bottom yeah and like gradient descent just means finding like where this function is zero and like you can actually describe that really simply like only like ten or twelve lines of Python actually sure instead of like five slides of equations and I think it's also important to understand why you need to find the bottom of the curve and neck absolutely I just focus on that example absolutely so that's difficult to describe concisely right so oftentimes anytime so in machine learning let's say you're writing an algorithm to let's say it's to distinguish apples from oranges all right you always want to know how accurate is my algorithm right like I can solve that problem in one line I can just say return you know math dot random and then so like one line mascot right yeah that would be the perfect one my accuracy is crap 50% right yeah right between an apple it's a one-liner yeah right but really we want to we want to get another way of describing accuracies you can think about in terms of air mmm like high accuracy means low air okay and you can you can have an equation that describes your air and the minimum of that equation is going to give you the highest accuracy so you can write your machine learning algorithm to try and minimize the equation that describes the air got it and like we'll make that super concrete in the class but that's that's where minimization comes in and that's where gradient descent comes in so one of the things you're saying in the class you're teaching just a pure java python version but there's also a version where you're bringing in preexisting libraries that have come from academia absolutely solve a lot of this for you absolutely so I want to do a couple things one is I want to provide the TLDR okay so like honestly like as a developer I like to get up and running really fast so we're also going to use open source libraries from just different universities there's one in New Zealand that I really love we're going to show you how to build so basically first everything from the ground up step by step from scratch and the reason we do that is because it keeps us honest yep if you build every single piece you have a some understanding of every single piece and if you're relying on somebody else having done the work you don't fully get to understand it exactly now another thing is using the open source libraries honestly you can solve probably 80 or 90% of the machine learning problems you would like as a data scientist yes now when you get to the really gigantic problems then really it makes sense to use the cloud so we're also going to teach how to solve problems using Google API s but that's at the very end of the class and it's totally optional it's if this is all on YouTube all on YouTube there might be some ads on it but that that's literally it we think it's gonna be awesome like source code and stuff that you've done your source code beyond get up that's all I'll be okay perfect and the reason I was hesitating is I'm writing all this as we're speaking it so like I'm totally exhausted but yes totally 1% out there you still looking energetic to me some I've had a lot of coffee with a Googler yeah good so like well yeah iPhone I'm really looking forward to this course I'm looking forward to you know learning what you have to teach I've had the same kind of struggles as you when trying to understand you know the math behind this and why I'm doing the math which is why I had those pointed questions earlier absolutely so thanks Josh that was a whole lot of fun and I've learned so much about machine learning just just from these three minutes with you so I'm really looking forward to your class thank so much if you've enjoyed this episode of coffee with a Googler and if you want to learn machine learning for yourself if you have any questions for Joshua if you have any questions for me please leave them in the comments below and tune into the Google developers channel for more great videos including episodes of coffee with a Googler thank you you really can learn machine learning and it's faster and easier than you think we've gone through a ton of classes textbooks and blog posts to bring you the clearest and most concise explanations of the hard concepts we really think you're going to be able to learn it and have some fun on the way click here to get started you
