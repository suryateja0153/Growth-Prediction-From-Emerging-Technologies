 Let's discuss the machine learning based approaches. Machine learning approaches can automatically build a model using the labeled normal training data. That is, a machine learning algorithm fixes input examples of normal data and outputs a model. That is then able to classify subsequently observed data as either normal or anormalous. Machine learning base models can automatically handle small changes or variations in the observed data. It can also capture the inter-dependencies or the deeper connections between the measures of the observed data. On the other hand for these approaches to be effective the normal training data must be representative of normal behaviors otherwise when we apply the model to detection there could be a lot of false positives. In addition in the training phase it required a lot of data and a lot of of power. However, once the model is produced subsequent analysis is typically, fairly efficient.
