 welcome to coffee with a Googler I'm here today to talk with Christine Robson who's a research PM for machine learning we're gonna talk about what's new and exciting in the field of machine learning including project magenta which is all about machine learning for generating music we'll also take a look at some of the things that are happening in YouTube as well as advances in image recognition so that video that was an artist who did a cover of a track that was generated by computers that yes exactly so the piano that you were hearing that's us that's the machine learned music that's the generative model the tensorflow model coming up with a piano track and then we put this out there as part of our open sourcing efforts to put all this generative music models that we're doing online and these artists they they listen to the music they were interested in it they were inspired by it and they decided to sort of jam along with our music track were you expecting somebody to do that no we weren't expecting that at all it was it was really very excited we got all we got excited in the office we're all like passing the video around taking a look it was it was really pretty exciting but this is what we hope will happen right that we can use machine learning for these really creative purposes and really get a partnership going where artists and creators want to work with machine learning tools to to be more creative and have fun I remember you said something once it's like not about replacing news it's like almost like inspiring musicians yeah exactly and and something um you know Doug who's the lead on this project he talks about this all the time that it's not that we're trying to make the best music out there I mean I'm not even a musician I you know it's that we're trying to make tools that the best musicians can use tools that that spur this kind of creativity and the magenta project that's the project that was open source that that we generated this music from the magenta projects really about making those tools for creators you know starting with music but you know we won't have tools for creators to do our generation to do videos you know to really tackle all of these questions of how can you how can you be creative and work with a machine learning model to to make yourself more creative and now for this piece of music it was I recognized that first bars was like twinkle twinkle little star yeah and it took over from there exactly so we give it this quick bar like thum thum thum thum okay and then the model is trained over a huge swath of music everything from Bach to the Beatles and it's just trying to predict what the next note should be so but it uses a type of type of machine learning called recurrent neural network so it looks backwards in time over the music that's been played already and tries to predict sequentially what the next note should be okay based on all the music it's seen before so you give it just a couple of notes to get it started and then it just takes off yeah that's pretty cool it is really cool and this was built with magenta yes rights and I know you're a product lead for magenta and could you'd like if somebody wants to get started with magenta and maybe start inspiring other people and some other kind of art form or maybe with music how would they go about doing this so everything from magenta is online we have a github it's part of the tensorflow project so if you go to the tensorflow slash magenta on github you can go and you can download all the tools we encourage everyone to download to contribute to play with what we've got there and see if they can they can do something creative to me that's why we've put it out there nice and and it's not just music right there are other art forms too well right now we've been focusing the project on music but the tools are very general right the tools are really about generative machine learning this idea of generating music generating art this tools to create rather than just making predictions with machine are ok cool I like machine learning of course it's not just the incubation it's it's in use in the real world already like things like YouTube are using it for recommendations when you think about a machine learn model and you think about all of the possible data that can go into it and what the places where the signals are gonna come from if you can capture more signals than you might be able to think of as human you can do better than a rule-based system and there's also this notion in it's a very hard concept to explain there's this notion of embeddings in computer and computer science and machine learning research where you you capture you have you put a way to capture all this information together you capture relationships which aren't easy to describe by simple human labels like maybe the relationship between these two things is really easy to explain you can imagine writing a rule for it like and I really like cat videos so maybe it's a like this cat video is similar to this other cat video they both contain cats they're both you know both from Japan something like this but then there may be other factors that are really hard for a human to suss out like maybe what I really like about this is sort of a abstract feel about the video the way in which I like watching the cat jump in and out of the box and that kind of abstract feel translates to this totally other also kind of cute video involving pandas on slides these two things are related but it's hard to put your tongue on exactly why but they're obviously related and they're related for everybody who looks at these YouTube videos and that's something that a machine learn model can capture really easily especially with these embeddings that we use and that it's really hard for a human to write a rule for right got it so it's like if you like acts you might like why and you may not realize that but when you have all these variables coming out of an ml model there you know it can actually show you that you can actually learn that about yourself yes it's like an emergent type thing does feel emergent sometimes these notions of ideas that you wouldn't have thought really mattered for your preferences like things that I might not have realized I wanted to see in a YouTube video how I want to spend my time that I really like this particular niche II kind of cat video and I've discovered lots of music that I like in that way where it's like I'm watching one piece of music and then it suddenly goes onto something else on the playlist of somebody I've never even heard of in a style that I probably don't even like but hey that's not bad yeah and we actually do that we do machine learning for like music music lista curation it's actually the the lead on the magenta project Doug his his role at Google before we started this project was in the music recommendation system he's a musician he's got a real passion both for machine learning and for music and so we spent a lot of time working on how to predict what music you're gonna really enjoy listening to based on what music you already like right and looking not just a very simple thing like which people like the same kind of music but actually analyzing the structure of the music and understanding how different musical pieces are related to each other in sort of subtle ways and fundamental ways and being able to to really do a very curated playlists for you that finds things that you're gonna be interested in so I understand that YouTube it's done so well with this kind of stuff it's even won some awards is that right yeah so um you don't think when you're a computer scientist that you're gonna be working in a field that gets an Emmy but actually YouTube's won an Emmy for personalized video recommendations I was a technical Emmy and Emmys an Emmy I know it's true and this was awarded because we do such a good job of personalizing video recommendations you know when I see that perfect cat video that's because we're doing such a good job prioritizing what you want to watch and prioritizing how to find the perfect video for you in this moment so then like so don't be on like recommendation engines not gonna thing one of the things that keeps reading about is how ml is now used for image recognition and for attributed images and you know you've been involved in that a little bit yeah so if you haven't used the Google Photos app you should use the Google Photos app it's my new favorite thing I love that I can pick up my phone and ask it to find me photos of my son ask it to find me photos of my son you know playing with my cat and that it has this great model where it knows you know can do face detection and find my son for me it can do protection on my cat and find my cat for me and it does this because it's seen we've fed this model all of the images we've seen from the web of all of the different kinds of cats and it has this model built up where it sort of knows what a cat looks like and so it can label it very effectively so like one of the things like about image recognition is I remember you had like read something from you like even talking about a cat and it could recognize a cat's face even though the cat didn't have ears and the ears are one of the most distinctive parts of a cat yeah that's my cat um so a few years ago my cat who lives in California of course in suntan's all the time she gets some skin cancer in her ears she's fine now but we had we had to have the vet had to remove her ears to clear the cancer and so she looks a little bit funny now she's still really cute but she's got no ears and she looks less like a cat than we might imagine but our image recognition software is fine like it can still recognize her as a cat and so if I ask my phone for photos of my son and my cat like it still it still recognizes that she's a cat and can find her and it's this kind of this flexibility that you get from training a model with a lot of different data you know there's not probably a lot of examples of cats with no ears on YouTube but we can sort of extrapolate when we use these really powerful deep neural network models to sort of we know we know basically what the cat should look like and so we can extrapolate past things like the fact that she doesn't have ears anymore I'm glad she's doing well though a couple of months ago we had a Joshua Gordon on the show and there's one thing that he said to me that I thought was really fascinating and that was he was talking about like three four five years from now the skills of machine learning and the techniques of machine learning will be as important to developers as like JavaScript or SQL are today and it's a and I think it was right and it's I would love to inspire people to go out and do more into this they learn more about machine learning do things such as creating music or art or who knows what other kind of things that come up with and I know you've got a wealth of resources and they're just what kind of things would you ask developers to take a look at well of course I'm very passionate about this because machine learning is my passion but I do think that josh is right you know we've talked about this a lot but the thinking about machine learning is so different than thinking about other traditional kinds of software engineering right I often make the analogy that the difference between like functional programming and object oriented programming that that paradigm shift is much smaller than the shift of thinking about machine learning versus thinking about traditional programming methods so this this shift is very big and very important and that's why we want everybody to be together on it from the beginning that's why we're putting so much effort into open sourcing our tools we're really open sourcing the best of everything we've got to try and get everybody together around this so developers in the outside world can already get the best of Google yes right which is just mind-blowing when you think about it yeah and that I mean this is why we've put so much work into open sourcing tensorflow and why we really want to put this all out there it's so important to think about what you can do with machine learn model because I really think this is going to be transformative for the kinds of things we can do I mean everything from you know YouTube where you're predicting the next video or other other angles you can think of that affect your sort of day-to-day life to these more esoteric creative things like music generation right things where you really want to have the best tools at your disposal and you really want to be able to be as creative as possible and machine learning is going to enable all of these things so we want everybody to be really yeah I just thoroughly recommend it for anybody any developers out there just go take a look at the sites that we've linked below with some fabulous stuff out there and you're getting ready for the future so thank you so much Christine this has been awesome thank you it was a real pleasure chatting with you had a lot of fun
