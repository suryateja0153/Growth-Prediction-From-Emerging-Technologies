 oh hello everyone hey good morning thanks for coming here it's been probably been a long week the last couple of days have been crazy here and the traffic's not being funny there so hopefully it's been working out well for you guys some of you made your way from a long you know different parts of the country many different areas but I'm hope it's been worth it and there's a lot of interesting things that we've been doing so we want to talk a little bit about some of them you've you know how our keynotes and the great products we have etc today I'm going to talk a little bit about machine learning right the title says machine learning is not the future which is kind of weird given that we're talking about machine learning and everything we are doing here but the point that I want to bring across here is it's it's not really the future it's part of everything we have today as you're seeing with our products as all the things that we are talking about we using machine learning today and everything we are doing and I want to talk about some of that and tell you how you can do that too but first let's start with where this all started right so and this goes back to 1907 I don't know how many of you remember this tick-tock from The Wizard of Oz he's one of the early versions of robots in modern times really although there are references to automatons going back to the 5th century BC and stuff even the Egyptians and others way back when but in the modern times this is probably one of the earliest references to something that was close to a robot any of you familiar with tick tock how many of you familiar with tick tock tick you not too many so let me tell you a little bit about him so this one is in fact the term robot was he wasn't even coined back when tick tock was created by frank Baum and what this robot would do is it had a you know a winding thing and you you needed to wind the robot and it would run and it was almost it could do pretty much what a human could do but not really be alive and it was a great reference to things that we've always wanted to do and so a lot of this AI and robotics in a lot of these things have been part of science fiction for a very very long time in fact a lot of what we do today in science has been driven by what people literary authors etc are able to really build up and and think about what the future might be like right this is one example but there many many more for example if you know some of you read Assam of he has a bunch of books and he has this whole robotic series again way back in the 30s where he talks about robots and how they might be like in what the kind of things that come with it and that was very interesting a lot of people over the years have been inspired by these science fiction books and movies to do a lot of interesting things another one another example of that is back in the 70s from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy there's this robot called Marvin which is you know this depressed it's always depressed it's always talking about these things he's not happy about he's just too smart for all the things happening around it and it's a it's really a great one a great example of you know what thing what people have been thinking about what's going to happen in the future in a going to another example Star Trek right another thing the the example that I put here that's cool Jochen color data in Star Trek who talks about you know this is a poem he composes which is I thought is pretty funny and how people have been thinking about the eyes and what they would do right and what they would be doing in the future in this case again it's like a robot like a humanoid somebody who can do a lot of things but is not quite human they're then coming coming to more recent times more closer to like 2001 if you've seen Steven Spielberg's movie AI called AI itself they have these mechanical robots that can really do that look like humans that can do all kinds of things but they don't feel and then they build this little kid David who can actually feel in love as well and really changes how the perception is and what they you know how they think about AI or what it means to the people around them and then much more recently there's this movie called her like in 2013 which talks about AI is without the shape without the robotics and all of that but what de AI is just that live within the within your computer as an OS essentially that can interact with you that's your assistant but much more than that right it can do Wallach it actually feels as well it understands things etc so all these are great right there are so many different things that people have been talking about people have been thinking about but these are still science fiction right this is not really what machine learning is about today this is still this has always been the future it's still the future maybe at some point it'll be a reality but that's not what where we are today that's not what we are talking about but there are some real things that we can do today and those are some of the things that I'm going to talk about right so we've actually made over the last few years real progress in terms of all the different things that we can do with AI with machine learning right use use all the products that you see around you and I'm going to talk a little bit about those there's so much in there that has benefited from machine learning from what we call AI as well and so this is you know some of the small list of products really act Google that we've made that use machine learning in some ways but at Google we really think about anytime we think of a product there's of course programming and you build it and you do all sorts of things with it but machine learning is an integral part of everything we do in building that right because we want these products to be really smart to give you the right things to not just follow your actions but really give you the right things when you want them as you want them and I'll go to go or some examples about these in later slides as well so before I go into other things let's just go a little bit into what deep learning in machine learning is about and I'm just quickly going to give you some examples on a website that we have so you know part of the slide is going to talk about tensorflow and recently we put the site up called playground or tensorflow org that allows you to play with neural nets and allows you to really do different kinds of things and allows you to really understand how these networks work how machine learning works and be able to you know play with some of those problems so I'm going to start with a very very basic problem classification right the goal in this case is there are two kinds of points I just want to classify whether it's a or B in this case the orange or the blue ones right and I'm going to use the very simplest case right it's a very simple linear classification if any of you guys know what that is but the idea is you have some inputs in this case you know the x axis and the y axis are inputs and based on those into inputs you want to decide if it's a blue one or a white wire or an orange one and so what this model is going to learn is some parameters to figure out okay if I get some point I skip an x one value and an X 2 value how do I decide that right it's some mathematical computation that it needs to do so in this case it does that iteratively let's just quickly run this I just set it up as a linear model so let's just run it very quick and as you see here it's looking at X 1 and X 2 in very very quickly it figures out how to separate this out it just draws a line in the middle and it's just optimizing what that line looks like how to separate these out very simply right so this was a very easy problem this is typically not how real problems are but it's a great place to start so so let's go to a slightly more complex problem now so let's go to this one here where you know now you still have those two kinds of points but now they are clustered differently so there's one in the center is a circle in the rest around it so can we actually solve this using the same kind of methods can we actually classify using the same thing if I run this do you think it would work any guesses let's try it out so it's trying to separate this out it's basically trying to draw a line but it's lost right it's really not making a progress if you if you see what's happening here so there are a few things you can do god that's right one in terms of classification again going a little bit into machine learning into the details you can add more features more kinds of things about the input data that help the model understand or how to separate them so if you guys remember your math back from high school or college there in this particular case given how these clusters are structured if you looked at a couple more features from based on the inputs like in this case x1 squared and x2 squared you can probably use those to separate this out better so let's try this let's add these two and see what happens and taking those two values now it knows how to separate those and you know clearly separate it out and recruit super different classes so this works this is great right this is what happens or used to happen in machine learning very often for every single thing that you do you take a bunch of inputs you want to solve some problem it's typically the inputs themselves are not in the same kind of mode that you need to solve the problem and what you do is called feature generation where you're combining or processing those features in different ways to really solve your problem right but there's a lot of work you need to do in figuring out the right features that make sense in this case it was a simple problem so we knew x squared X 1 squared or X 2 squared would work but in some cases the problem is not as simple and you really need to do a little bit more so for those kind of cases you know we have something called deep learning which which seems to work really well so let's go to go back to this example and and let's see if we can solve it in a different way as well so let's take take out these two features first let's change this linear to a non-linearity in this case I'm going to pick a rectified linear unit and I'm going to add a hidden layer with a few more neurons so what this is doing is it has some inputs as we said in this case just X 1 and X 2 I'm adding another layer which is basically trying to combine those inputs in whatever way is interesting to solve our particular problem and then let's see if we can train this to actually solve the same problem as well so if you see this we took the same features no feature generation we just added one layer this is a simple problem so one layer works and it's very easily able to separate those out right this is essentially what deep learning is doing for you as you add more layers it can understand and learn the right layers of abstraction that are the most interesting to solve your current problem right and of course depends on the problem it doesn't have to be a simple classification it could be regression it could be recommendation whatever you trying to do really you can apply similar techniques to do that so let's go back to our slides you know in a sense deep learnings basically you know the same machine learning ideas with more layers there that allow you to get different kinds of abstraction of course as part of that you get many many more parameters you learn things differently this example is actually for what we call inception v3 which is our state of the art image model for image classification so you know if you and we'll go through some examples of where we use it but this basically gives you something near human accuracy so machine learning has been around for a long time in fact way more than 10 years so what's really changed since then right one of them is more compute definitely over the years our computers have gotten faster we have more of them we've been using newer chips you know CPUs GPUs now TP use here and so a lot of things that we're doing here with that and more computer allows us to really build more complex models we'll bigger models you know but pack needs a lot more lot of a lot of other things to go with it as well for that to work in this case better gotham's and more data help as well so over the years we've improved the algorithm slowly you know a lot of these algorithms that we talked about in deep learning are 30 40 50 years old but over the last 10 years we've seen some improvements in the right places for example in case of deep learning there are some improvements to back propagation or kind of nonlinearities that we use that really make it much easier to optimize those it used to be really really hard to train some of these models even if you had the computer even if you had the data now it's much easier and there are better techniques to do that so the math and the algorithms is improved and of course the amount of data that we have that keeps growing and that really something where machine learning can help if you think about it with small amounts of data humans are great you know you can maybe read 10 pages or a book and understand that and sift it down but what if you had a million pages you can't really expect a human to go through those million pages understand those and summarize it for you you really need some machines that can automatically do this for you and that's really where machine learning comes in so now let's talk a little bit about what's happening in research and machine learning now right there's we've talked a little bit about science fiction mentioned a bunch of products that that are using this and I'll go a little bit more into the products later but let's talk a little bit about the research where this is going some of the examples of where things have made improvements in the recent past so the first one I want to talk about is alphago how many of you have heard of alphago now quite a few so if you remember like 10 actually almost 20 years ago now there was deep blue which was a similar chess computer and some some sense it was similar that you know the goal was okay can we really beat the best humans Kasparov the reigning chess champion at that time using computers and back in 1997 was the first time deep blue which is this computer built by IBM that actually beat the world champion beat Kasparov in a full championship match that was pretty amazing right and that was 20 years ago it took a long time to go from there to go partly because go itself as a game is very more complex than chess --is the the possibilities that you have at every level at every step are much much bigger much more than what chess is and so one of the differences there is with the blue you could get away with some smarts and a lot of brute force right you could have a large supercomputer you have some basic smarts and a lot of rules around you know there are a lot of chess players there that actually taught deep blue in the sense it will train them on okay here the good moves here not etc plus allowing you to do a lot of brute force in trying out okay looking ahead how many different moves you can do now those same techniques just could not work for go because of the different possibilities at every step at every step it can do a really large number of moves and supporting that or being able to go past a few steps is extremely hard even for modern day computers so what really worked in this case was a combination of smartness and the computer and in case of smartness they apply deep learning to figure out okay looking at a board what kind of moves make the most sense and then let's try them out and see what makes sense and you know which one of these play well and so it's a combination of improved algorithms improved machine learning combined with the compute power as well another example is image net which is this data set of a million images with a thousand classes of different kinds in fact a lot of classes are so close together that's very hard even for humans who don't know about them to identify without learning for example there are breeds of dogs which look very similar at least to me for people who are really know dogs of course it's easier over the last few years over the last five years the especially on this data set this has really driven the state of their vision understanding for machines is so about five years ago the accuracy that computers would get was maybe seventy seventy-five percent this was the measured top-five accuracy which is basically is the the most like the correct answer among the top five results that the computer predicts now five years ago this was something like 75 percent today it's passed it's over 96% which is considered to be better than human accuracy really humans also make mistakes in this kind of thing right so it's really coming a long way and just shows the kind of progress we can make if we really get to improve in machine learning this one's an interesting one taking the kind of image models that we've trained and really letting them dream you know that this is what we call deep reme there there's some folks at Google who basically took those neural networks and wanted to understand what's happening these networks what are they learning right and so in this case what they did was took a few neurons in the in the network just let them train from that point and try to see what we can generate from those neurons what they might be understanding from the images and so that they converge to some of these so in some of these images on the top right it's basically started from some kind of palace or whatever and combine those and you know it's fascinating of that the one on the top left it has some fountains in there and a bunch of other things that's sort of combined and and this is very interesting because this is in some ways there are similarities to what people do as well of course you know this is a very different view but but it's starting to learn in many many ways right machine learning is really kind of doing the same kind of learning that people might do so now I'm going to give you some examples let me just go to this and play some couple more videos for you in this case it's doing what it's basically taking the video and applying different kinds of painting styles and this particular one it's just taking a blue painting style and applying it to the existing video in real time now it's a charcoal sketch this is just an example of how we're mixing machine learning with things like art to build all kinds of interesting things and the you know kind of interesting combinations of things that you can do with these you know here's another one where you know makes it look like a newspaper so this one's from a paper based on by Justin Johnson and others here at Stanford let me give you another example of similar things that we can do so this one's interesting where the network learned from a bunch of Chinese characters it looked at how they're drawn and was able to draw completely new Chinese characters I'd never seen before these aren't real characters I right for those of you who understand the script I don't but then they look very real even for people who understand the script or who know the script they feel like they're almost there they're like clearly not the right character or anything that they've ever seen but it's it's really understanding what's happening there it gets that it's supposed to look like this and is able to understand that whole domain pretty well I'm going to show you one couple more videos here's one where it's basically learned from a lot of numbers these are house numbers from Street View let's just go back to here and play it and pause it at the end and so it's learned a bunch of it's looked at house numbers from Street View and and is able to really generate those it's actually never seen these particular numbers the network is just generating them this is the kind of things that these networks can do today and the last one in this case it's actually generating faces and so again it learned from a large face dataset and now is able to generate faces in all kinds of ways right again these are not faces at scene directly it's really generating them based on all its understanding of what faces look like yeah the another one that we've actually released very recently is this model to parse sentences so this is a very semantic parsing of sentences where it looks at a sentence in this case I booked a ticket to Google and tries to understand what the subjects are you know all the grammatical stuff about that actually things that I predict personally don't understand it's hard for me to learn but this is able to actually learn from a lot of sentences that were given to it in this example it's actually taking the sentence piece by piece and then you know building a tree of hierarchy in you know doing the parsing in this case this kind of thing is extremely useful when you're trying to understand natural language and this just goes to show how much these computers can understand the language that you and I speak in some cases better than humans can as well or at least better than kids can here's another example so going back to the data example where you know in science fiction they said here's the sort of poem that computer might generate this is actually something that was generated by a real program today or a real model today it's clearly not great but in this particular case it just learned from a bunch of books it read those books or understand understood those books and was able to generate this this particular poem I guess so now let's talk about this great for research now let's talk about a few products and how we are using them so you know we have this slide early on where I showed you a bunch of products that we may be using this let's go into some of those products let's see how we are actually using them what are the kind of things we are doing with machine learning in these products first is search you know I'm sure most of you or probably all of you have used search or using search in some ways this is a very good example of how machine learning is used now the slide that I show you here there are at least two ways we're using machine learning here the first if use voice search here so if you click that icon on the right for the mic and you say something there's machine learning being used to understand what you're saying and converted it to text right so you have you say something that's really a bunch of bytes for the computer it really to convert that into actual English or whatever language you're speaking it needs to understand that and they're pretty sophisticated machine learning models that do that for you today then the next part is once you have that what results to show you right google has billions or trillions of pages really indexed which you probably don't even think about what do you see typically when you do that search it's just 10 pages on that first page and you really want those 10 pages to be the best ones the most appropriate ones for you in some cases you might go to the next page or so but most people are just going to look at that first page and make that decision so how do we really take those billions of pages match those to your query and then you know even then it's probably millions or maybe more and then put them down to those boil them down those top 10 pages and that's again machine learning at work in many many forms we are taking all these pages understanding your query matching it to all the data we have maybe you know if you're looking for a restaurant in your mount who you we're going to leverage that and understand that that needs to be combined with the kind of pages that are there if it's something else again understanding the query and the documents together combining them and then ranking them and sorting them that that's something that machine learning does really really well this example is of pictures you know we talked about vision models they're actually in use in everything you do now so for example over the years image collections the amount of photos I have are huge right they're just growing with digital cameras coming on it's been so much easier to take pictures and just keep collecting them right you never throw them away but then when you want to find a picture and you really want to go through those collections it's really really hard so how can you do that in this case the same kind of research that I was talking about which understands those images is really indexing and labeling all the pictures you have in Google photos and in this particular example if you search for cherry blossom it really shows you all your pictures of cherry blossom and you can display them for you another example is email so there's this thing called Smart reply which we launched a few months ago which you might be using insert in email and what happens there is you you get an email you typically in this case you probably just want to get a quick easy answer right and it just gives you some choices here pick this one what it's doing is it's really understanding what your email thread is about and then suggesting a bunch of reply is ranking them whatever makes the most sense and showing the most interesting ones to you if it makes sense in other one is Google music right there are many things happening in there and one of the things that we do is we recommend a lot of things that you might want to play maybe albums that you might want to play maybe actual songs that you might want to play based on the time based on what you're trying to do right now right based on your interest it's really understanding all of that sorting them and again ranking them recommending the right things for you we really want to make it easy for you to find what you want you know the ideal case would be you go there let's say it's afternoon or let's say you're driving back from work and you typically like to listen to say classical songs at that time it should really just recommend you the classical song and maybe the top station that you do every time you shouldn't have to look for it just because just before this you were doing something else so all of these are examples where machine learning can really make a difference and are helping us in our everyday lives and one more that I'm going to talk about is spam so everybody uses email you know a few years ago maybe five ten years ago spam was this huge issue for everyone we're mostly email in your inbox is starting to be spam you are to actually filter them out manually so it's not that from that time on to now spams reduced in fact spam continues to increase it's just that our filters and algorithms have gotten a lot better at recognizing what spam again they're not perfect you chew locationally still see spam or maybe we would say something since spam where it's not but it they're getting so much better that I don't go to my spam filter on box and see what I might have missed or the other way around I rarely get email that's actually spam even though if you actually read the numbers about how much spam emails there are these are still you know way more maybe 10 times more than the real emails of spam itself so so lots of improvements in machine learning lots of improvements in the products that are driven by machine learning right so it's not about tell gotham's or the technology itself it's about how do we apply it to the products that we build how do we make things better for all the things that we're trying to do right all of this technology and the algorithms and the compute that we are building it's all towards solving real problems solving real needs for things that we do today so now let's talk a little bit about tensorflow that's the product I need and it was built to help push machine learning forward you know our team is a research team and you know part of the goal for us was to really push machine learning forward and that's why we built it but that's not the end goal right we want to take that machine learning as well and apply it like I was saying in all of these products intensive flow allows that us to do that and now you as well right I'm going to tell you how we can do this so it is it is open source it's a machine learning library available on github it's in fact the most popular machine learning library v-v open source six months ago and it's very rapidly under the top there's a lot of interest a lot of people using it in all kinds of areas some of the research that I talked about are actually people outside Google who have taken up tensorflow and used it in doing a lot of those you know building those new things and new ideas people are including it in different kinds of products as well so at the core it's a library that's let's go step forward so what's this library for right there there are many different things that we can do like I was saying our group is doing a lot of research so it is for researchers who want to take machine learning it really push it forward make it much better than it is improved algorithms improve how we can do things with it so it is for them but then there are data scientists who want to really take those algorithms let's see have data let's see have a product and you want to improve that product by applying this machine learning to the data that you have and so the data science can take those algorithms because they're also open now they're made available to you on all kinds of places you can take those you can use those and make some improvements and then there are developers like a lot of us here actually who are trying to make say an app and want to make it better or say deploy a product to the data center and tensorflow allows you to really take all the work that researchers and data scientists have done and really run those same models the Train models in production using the exact same API without having to worry about ok how this seems great but how am I going to deploy this to production right that's other complexity that that's a turd so we've definitely tried to make sure that from the beginning from the point that you get started with machine learning you actually pushing it out to production it's a very short time cycle you shouldn't be stuck because if infrastructure that's taken care of you it that's taken care of for you and you can focus on what's important for you in the most ways right which is really building the products helping your customers helping your users so just a couple of examples of tensorflow I'm not going to go too detailed into the code but this is a very simple example where we - - just take two inputs mult do a matrix multiply and you know just print out the result so what it's doing is in the first two cases it's creating two nodes in the graph and actually that means just oh yeah it's creating two nodes in the graph and really you know doing a multiplication which is another node which takes the inputs from the other two nodes and then the last one really evaluates based on those two inputs combines them and generates the output this one's actually a regression problem so we talked about classification earlier in this case it's trying to predict some values based on you know you have some inputs you have smart puts you want to learn to predict outputs it's basically doing something similar to what we were seeing on the playground where you taking the inputs you're multiplying it by matrix and you know you have a loss that you're trying to optimize which is a typical machine learning thing and then you just loop through so the last day at the end you basically have these you going through a bunch of steps and say 200 times in this particular case and you you know just print this out and over time you are basically learning to predict things better again very simplistic examples typical models might be much bigger but in a lot of cases you might also be able to use models that are already there want to just give you some examples of the kind of performance we provide comparing it to some standard benchmarks that are there on an open-source website and you know early on when we launched tensorflow it wasn't the fastest library out there and there were a lot of improvements that we have to do had to do but over the last six months we've really focused on that and at this point it's really at the top in terms of you know compare compatible to everything else out there and we continue to improve it there's not the end of it there are many more improvements that you can do in this case we are comparing you know four different kinds of models in this case they happen to be all image models and as you see the the lower is actually better a you know in a few cases it's just slightly worse in few cases it's slight in one case it's slightly better and so on so it's roughly about the same ballpark performance at this point now one thing you can do with tensorflow as well is you can run it across many many machines rather than running on just one machine so the previous benchmark that I was showing you was basically running on a single GPU and you know training these models on GPU is something that a lot of people do in this particular case we were training on many many more machines so each machine having a single GPU going all the way to 100 and you can see it scales quite well you know in fact up to 16 it's almost linear and then it still continues to scale even past that and this is something that we use internally as well to Train really large models and large data sets which is as the data is growing it's really important to be able to do this to to be able to run on clusters which many of you probably do already oops so next I'm going to talk a little bit about tensorflow for poets so there's actually a chord lab for this as well if you want to look at it and look at it online or I believe there's a place here too so the idea here is let's say you have a bunch of images in this case flowers and you want to learn to recognize those flowers right or maybe just identify if it's a flower or if these are five different kinds of flowers and what you can do is you don't have to have a million examples you might just have a thousand examples let's say but you can get started from a model that works really really well for example our best image model that we've open-source and made available and that's what this example talks about take the top part of it just train that on your data set from the pointer it's already trained on so it's just going to learn to classify the flowers it already understands image as well so it doesn't have to really learn what kind of features are important for classifying images it knows that already it can just take your particular models your particular data and learn to just separate those out into different classes so there are a few tools that I would like to mention at the end that you can play with or that you can use before you go in terms of you know just making things work well for you so you know a lot of you are probably familiar with Apache spark which is used for doing analysis and doing learning on large data sets so there are there is an integration of spark wit with the tensorflow somebody a data brick said that where you can actually take some images you can create it's very simplistic in the sense you can clean a lot of different models and really use it to pick the best model you do that a lot because there are some hyper parameters like say learning rate or how big to your model be etc you maybe try 10 different models and use that to pick the best one another thing I would like to point you to is Google's own cloud machine learning platform we announced this a couple of months ago it's under limited preview right now but you can sign up until we'll make it accessible to you soon where you can really have the same power of tensorflow that you have on your machine say but maybe you don't have the compute resources or you don't want to manage all the resources that you need to really run it large-scale and cloud takes care of all of that for you so you can basically do you can experiment on your machine make sure you understand what you want to do and then push it off to the cloud later take care of running large-scale stuff there are a few examples of what you can do with models that have already been trained by others and really take them and just apply them okay there are some API is on the phone today for what called the mobile vision API is which allow you to do face tracking so let's say your pictures it allows you to it identifies parts of the faces it first identifies the face and then like parts of the face like the eyes nose etc so you can do different kinds of things with it it also recognizes barcodes and QR codes and automatically understands and you know parses them for you the on the cloud there are also some api's for vision in speech and translation which you can basically just send your image and it tells you what kind of image it is among a lot of different classes for speech again you can upload data upload speech energy give you back text of whatever kind for translation you can give it text in one language say English or Japanese or whatever makes sense for you and it's going to convert that to another language so so many different API is in that this is a growing area that you should continue to watch out for so now for the future right it is really you know I started by saying it's really not the future but it is it is the present and the future it's just wanted to call out that it's important for you to start thinking about it now not wait for the future really and it's really you know your turn to start thinking about how you can incorporate machine learning into everything that you do what people are looking for today is not just applications that do what they want right there are tons of things that are already doing that how can you add that edge how can you make it really better for that user by understanding what they want right before they ask for every single thing and that's really something that you can do think about this as you build your next application the billion X product and I think that's how we change the future that's how we make machine learning part of the future so I wanted to leave you with some places some pointers to where you can read more about tensorflow it's on github and their Docs intensive Florek and going back to my reference for tick tock tick tocks waiting for you to very make the difference to do these things now and thank you
