 welcome everybody so what I'm going to do now is my name is Susan Eric I work for Microsoft as a Technical Evangelist and I'm going to give you guys a fun introduction to the world of machine learning machine learning a fascinating area and I think one of the things that's really interesting about machine learning is for a lot of us in the past she learning nothing new but I think in the past it's something that seemed only accessible to PhDs and data scientists and people who'd spent grad work studying data science and seemed maybe inaccessible to the rest of us but there's been sort of a critical movement in the last three to five years in terms of a data we have available to do machine learning and the tools that are available and the cpu power we have available with things like the cloud so but it's become a lot more accessible than it was in the past so what I want to do today was teach you how to run some basic experiments using a machine learning the tool I'm going to use this machine learning studio that the principles I'll be showing you are confused in any machine learning tool and hopefully you'll be able to have some fun with it and explore the world of machine learning all right so without further ado really the reason she's learning is very exciting in the industry and there's a lot of buzz these days around machine learning you're seeing startups created off machine learning concepts and you're also discovering that there are companies and big companies who are trying to use machine learning as well and really it's all about trying to predict the future because of course if you're in a company you can predict the future you can make more money you can be better prepared you can anticipate and take actions to be best prepared and take advantage of your knowledge of the future and that's where Xin learning is really all about it's about taking historical data to make predictions on what's going to happen down the road so the most important part is the data in the background so we have to have past data to identify patterns which we can use to make predictions on what's going to happen in the future it's a little bit vague I know if you remember way back in grade 10 and 11 they probably had you're drawing graphs in school you were calculating the slope of the graph and they'd say hey if you added this additional point what would be you know the value B if you added this extra point and you would have to extrapolate your lines to try and predict what the values would be well that's kind of what machine learning is doing except it can make some pretty complicated formulas too represent the pattern so it's a little more complicated than just calculating the slope on a line but in the end computers are good at calculations are good at formulas and that's why computers are so great at machine learning so a tool line with you I call your machine learning studio it's a fun one that lets you explore machine learning without having a degree in statistical analysis so what I'm going to do here is I'm actually going to launch a browser and I got lots of windows open so I got to find the right one this could be funny W dum dee dum there we go found it dum dee dum I want that one that says experiments dum dum there we go so this is a tool called Azure machine learning studio now if you want to launch it yourself all you do is search for Azure machine learning studio I'm terrible with URLs I just look things up when I need them so I type in Azure machine learning studio you'll see this URL here studio as your ml net and if you click on that then it's going to take you to a site and mine's already signed in so let me go to my experiments but if you've never done machine learning before and you want to try it with me there is actually a guest sign in you can use so even if you don't have any cloud credits on Azure you can still play around and have some fun with the experiments by clicking the guest sign in you get eight hours worth of free machine learning experiment if you have Azure account so I'll give you links later on how you can get access to a sure and get a more full-featured version but this still allows you to do a lot of playing and to do a lot of what I'm going to show you here so that's a useful link for you so I've already launched signed in and launched it and when I go to the open up the tool you first time you open it you won't see anything listed here these are some experiments I've run already in the past machine learning is really about running different types of experiments and the experiments allow us to explore and find patterns and data so I want to create a new experiment so I click experiments and I say new and I really like to do my demos with file new project because that way you really feel like hey if I had to do this myself I could actually reproduce what Susan's doing completely from scratch there are a number of sample experiments that you can go take a look at here you can open those up but I like starting from an empty experiment so you can really see how we do something from scratch so we'll pick that blank experiment and what we need first of all is some data because machine learning is all about looking at past data to try and find patterns to predict the future so where do we get this data well if you have data of your own saying it's something like a CSV file or inside a database that you can extract from the database and then load into a CSV file there is the ability to actually down here you could say create a new data set and then you could actually upload a CSV file and use that data another option you might have is there is a task I'm going to use this search box a lot by the way it's really handy for finding the tasks I want to work with and that allows me to add a reader task if I drag that over you'll see that I can use properties to say go get data from a web URL so I could do something like an RSS feed data feed providers hive queries for people who are doing things like Duke as your sequel databases and so on so you can read directly from tables that's a useful feature but I'm actually going to take advantage of the fact that there is some data built right into this tool which is great for playing and exploring and learning and that way I know all of you have access to the same data set and try it as well so I'm going to drag over this data set here called flight on-time performance because this says something about my life I like this one because I'm going to try and use this data to predict whether the next flight I'm catching is going to be late or on time the first rule of data science and machine learning is really to spend some time getting to know the data the data is the biggest part of your work when you're doing machine learning the more you know the more data you have the better format of the data is the more successful your experiments are going to be since we don't know this data you've never seen it before there are tools built into this machine learning studio to let you look at the data so I can right click on this and say data set visualize and when I visualize that data it actually shows me lots of interesting information about this data set great when you're using somebody else's data I can see that I have five hundred thousand rows of data 18 columns I can see that I've data over different years quarters month day of a month day of the week so this is all information about different flights this data actually came from open data from the Department of us Department Transportation website so this is actual flight data for different Airlines and the carrier is which airline is making the flight and you might be wondering well is all the data from one airline well if you look over here when you select an individual column it actually tells you information about the columns themselves as well so you can see that there are 16 different values for carrier and if you scroll down you'll even see a histogram to give you an idea of how many records there are with each of the different airline values so you can sort of see that we've got y am just probably American Airlines I'm going to guess DEA lvls Delta you'll notice there's no Canadian Airlines this did come from a US Department of Transportation data set we have the originating airport ID so where did the flight leave from where did the flight go to the destination Airport we have scheduled departure time the hour period during which the flight left departure delay how many minutes after scheduled departure time the flight actually left whether this departure delay 15 this is a boolean flag it'll be a 1 if a flight left more than 15 minutes late it'll be a 0 if the flight left on time or less than 15 minutes late scheduled arrival time the scheduled arrival time block how many minutes late the flight arrived if it's a negative value that means that I'd actually arrived early and we also have arrival delayed 15 and this is a really important column this is a column that will be a 1 if a flight arrived more than 15 minutes late it will be a 0 if the flight was considered on-time so less than 50 minutes late this is the value I want to actually try to predict so I want to look at the patterns of past flights that were late in on time to try and predict if future flights will be late or on time that's what I'm going to try to be doing it's also good idea to learn so you need to sort of learn the columns you should also click on the different values themselves and look at some of the information for example when you select quarter you'll actually discover that the number of unique values recorder is 1 that's a shame because if you think about it when I do is she learning the other thing I have to think about is which of these columns do I think would affect whether a flight is on timer is late you know what airline it is it's possible at Air American Airlines is on time more often than us air or Delta is off on time more often than Alaska Airlines so I think the carrier is a factor I would want to look at when trying to analyze if a flight is going to be on time or late and the day of the week I think I'd might want to consider that as a factor as well because there's a different pattern sort of weekend travelers are tend to be more casual travelers on Saturday Sunday whereas the business travelers Monday to Friday so I think the day of week might be a factor in whether or not a flight would be late so I can select that when I'm doing my machine learning and the quarter when I think about the quarter well hey we live in Canada so flight that leaves in winter versus summer versus spring versus fall I think that could also give us a pattern of which flights are more like but flights in certain quarters are more likely to be flate late thin flights and other quarters for example if you're flying in February I think it's more likely your flights going to be late than if you're taking a flight in June but unfortunately when we look at the data set we discover all the data in this data set only there's only one unique value of the quarter it's all from the same quarter and in fact if you actually look at the month you'll actually discover that there's only one unique value in the month column and it's a value of 10 so all the data we have to do our training is from October of 2011 so that's why it's important to take a few minutes to visualize the data set get a feel for the data you've got because this will help you realize what data you do have and what data you don't have and the better you know the data the faster you're going to get an accurate model when you do machine learning so what I've done so far is all I've done is said taken a great asset and put it onto my page the next thing we have to do is we have to do what's called pick our projection columns so there's a task called project columns and by the way I am going to give you a you are Rell at the end of this presentation and that URL is going to take you to a page where you will find a link to step by step instructions to completely reproduce everything I'm doing in this demo so if you had lost at any point along the way don't panic there is a nice URL I'm going to give you at the end of it that one URL is going to give you said step by links to step by step instructions so you can reproduce everything that I do here and even give you some follow-up materials to learn more if you're interested so back to my demo flight on-time performance what I need to do is I need to say take that data but I want to tell it but you know what there are some of the columns in there but aren't worth using to trainer model they're not going to affect the outputs for example we notice that all the data was from the same year the same quarter in the same month so what I can do with project columns as we save here is the columns we think are important and we'll effective a slightest later not said year quarter month even though they might have an impact all my data is from the same month quarter in year so it's not going to help me find patterns and data and predictions the day of the month maybe maybe the beginning of the month the first of the month you have flights they're more late than in two months I think day of week is definitely something that might affect whether flights later on I think Monday morning is a very busy time for flights I think the airport could be a factor I think if you're flying out of Chicago O'Hare or Pearson Airport you're more likely to be late out of those ones just because of the volume of traffic then you are if you're flying out of save a winnipeg Airport so origin and destination Airport ID definitely things I think could be a factor in determining whether flights later on time departure time that one is owned I want to include as well because I think there's sort of a rush hour for planes in the sort of you know in the early mornings for between 7:00 and 9:00 a.m. and in the evening team 4:00 and 7:00 p.m. there's a there's a lot more flights at that time so if you're catching a flight of 5 p.m. it's more like to be late than a flight at 1:30 in the afternoon maybe even the scheduled arrival time is a factor as well and you have to select the column which you're trying to predict so that for me is a rival delay 15 which will be a 1 if the flight was 15 minutes late 0 if it wasn't so I select the columns now if you're trying this with me you don't have to pick the same columns I do it's called an experiment if we're not happy with the results of our experiment we might come here and change and pick different columns to try and get better results all right let me go back to my slides for a second so what we've done is we've started with our data so said there's different places you can get the data I've used one of the sample data sets that comes with Azure machine learning studio you can create your own data sets from CSV file so you can extract data from a database or spreadsheets save it as a CSV file and report your own you can also use those reader tasks to get data from a data feeder query there's also the world of open data out there which allows you to find all sorts of fun datasets as well if you just want to find some fun ones to play with check out Kaggle com ka GG Le comm they have some interesting data sets that they make that companies make available for competitions after you load your data set take your time to get to know the data set learn what the different column values are learn what records you have and don't have what columns you have and what data they represent the better you know your data faster you're going to get good results from your training model now but we've got our data we're ready to train the model so the first thing we have to do is not trust the computer I never trust computers you know computers are good at coming up with formulas but how do I know if it's right or not when I do my model training what's going to happen is the Azure machine learning studio is going to analyze the data and it's going to come back and say Susan I have found the most magical formula ever that will represent and make all the predictions you could ever want but how do I know the formulas good how do I know if the formulas going to predict the accurate values what I want to do is I'm going to take some of my data and split it up so I'm going to take so my data on and put it aside so let's take 80% of our data and we're going to use that to find patterns to create our formula to be able to print the future we're going to take 20% of our data and put it aside and once we computer says oh no I figured out the magic formula I'm going to say you think you got to figure it out all right let's test it I'm going to give you 20% of the data like 100,000 records for which I know if they were late or not you run your little formula predict what you think would have happened and let's compare that to what actually happened and then we'll see how well you did making your magic formula so this is a fairly standard thing in machine learning the idea of splitting our data up so we use some of it to test the model and some of it to train the model now when we're creating our magical formula to predict the future there's different types of formulas that can be created and we do this with the different algorithms and which algorithm we use depends on the kind of prediction we're trying to make if you are trying to predict something like a yes/no a 1 or a 0 you try to predict if somebody who made a purchase was a male or a female those are examples of two class algorithms so anytime you're trying to predict if something's going to be one of two specific values we call that a two-class algorithm situation if you're trying to predict so you can even be trying to predict if somebody's going to vote liberal or or PC Republican or Democrat those are all examples where you can pick one of two values classification is used when we need to predict more than two values so if you're trying to predict if somebody is going to vote PC or liberal or NDP now I have three values I can try to possibly have it outcomes so I would have to use a classification algorithm if you're trying to predict if somebody's going to vote for Trump or Rubio or Cruz again that's three possible outputs so I would use a classification algorithm if I want to predict if someone's income is between 50 to 100 thousand dollars between one hundred two hundred fifty thousand dollars or between 150 and 200 thousand dollars so which range they fall into that would be three different possible ranges or you might have four or five or six different possible ranges still using a classification algorithm if you want to predict a specific value so let's say you wanted to actually predict how many votes someone is going to get or you wanted to predict how much money somebody makes or you wanted to predict how many minutes late a flight is going to be that would be a linear regression type example so that's use one we're trying to predict a specific value and the last one you've probably encountered in your own way anomaly detection this is used to find who the entries that don't match a pattern the most common example of this is think of credit card fraud detection sometimes when you make a purchase your credit card company freezes your credit card so that's an example of anomaly detection it said hey you've done something that doesn't follow your usual pattern and machine learning says this isn't your normal pattern we think someone may have stolen your card so we identify it as an anomaly so that's also done with machine learning so anytime you're doing machine learning you have to think about what type of prediction you're making so you can pick the right type of algorithm in our case we're trying to predict if this field arrival delay 15 is a 1 indicating a flight was late or a zero indicating the site was on time so we're going to use the 2 class algorithm and then once we've got our magical formula we're going to test it with the data we put aside so let me show you how we do that in the tool so we've selected our columns so now what we going to do is we're going to take some data and put it aside so we'll have some data for testing once the tool thinks it's entailed a magic formula so we connect our data and send it to a split and then over here on the right when we select split data you see there's some properties and I'm just going to change that fraction of rows to the 0.8 the generally accepted standard is anywhere between 70 to 80% of the data is used to train the model and 20 to 30% is used for for testing so I've taken it so by cuz I said point eight that means 80% of data is going to follow down path number one and 20% of data will go down path to so it's basically taking my five hundred thousand records than four hundred thousand down this path and about a hundred thousand down this path get rid of that little extra window once I've done that it's time to train my model this is when the magic happens so this is where we actually say hey machine learning studio I want you to actually go off and actually find the patterns so you take the output we take that eighty percent of our data and the nice thing is if you try and connect it to the wrong button it actually gives you a red light says you can't connect here connect to the other node so don't worry about it too much but then you have to tell it what's the column you want me to try and predict so we have to go to the column selected and we select that field arrival delay 15 because that's the column we want to print the value for we want to know if that's gonna be a 1 or a 0 now we haven't told it what type of analysis to do yet we don't know if this is linear regression or to class or classification and so on so that's why there's this other node here because this is how we get to tell it which type of formula to do so if you search for 2 class you'll actually discover that machine learning studio comes with a number of different built-in two class systems it can use to do the analysis I'm sure you're sitting there going how on earth do I know which one to use a useful tip for you there is a wonderful little tool out there and if I go here and I just go Azure machine learning studio cheat sheet I love the fact they actually call it cheat sheet do a quick search and you will actually find a handy little PDF file which you can download there it is and it's a flow chart that gives you hints if you're new to machine learning on what the difference is between these different choices so this is a handy little cheat sheet if you're new to machine learning if you take course of the machine learning then you learn a lot more about the difference between these and when to use for different lines and you in fact when you get into more high-level of machine learning you actually learn to write your own algorithms as well and hey little beyond what we can do in 1 hour so I'm going to pick the boosted decision tree if you're trying this with me feel free to pick a different one just to see if you get different results it is an experiment after all if I'm not happy with my results I can come back here and pick a different one see if I get better answers and I'm going to connect that to my trained model well if I run this now will asked about train model task is done machine learning studio will say I've got a formula I know exactly how to predict the future now so this is where I say you may think you have a formula but I don't trust you I want to test it so this is where we use a task called a score model a score model is basically our testing task so we say take that formula you just created in train model take that twenty percent of the data we put aside here when we split our data and send that those rows down here and say you tests your formula against those rows we and let's see how well you predict against records where we know what happened then we just have to say put that result into a nice pretty report so human can understand the result so we take the score model output and we send that to evaluate model and that simply puts the data into a report for us and then we hit run I have now created a machine learning model now this is going to take a couple of minutes to run as it's running I'm going to see little clocks appearing on the tasks the train model will take the longest because that's where it's actually trying to figure out what is a formula to analyze my data and then the score model will take a little while to execute as well because that's the step where it's actually doing testing against a hundred thousand rows but while that's running I want us to think about what do we do if after we go through this experiment and we get the accuracy what if we get lousy accuracy what can we do to fix it if you've got ideas feel free to toss them into the QA window and give you a second to see if anybody wants to throw an odd suggestion out there I could start humming via I can always start humming the jeopardy theme song if you want where do you set input parameters well there are there are some input parameters that you can specify for the different algorithms themselves so some of the algorithms have parameters so you would do that by selecting the algorithm on the tool and then you get a parameter thing that appears on the right but I'm not sure what you mean by input parameters I mean the input data is specified by the data set that we select and the project columns is where we select which specific columns from the data set we want to use so some of the things you can do to improve accuracy well you can have more rows of data right now all my data is only from October of 2011 what do I what kind of you know what if I had data from 2012 in 2013 and 2014 what if I had data for October December January February March throughout an entire year what if I had data from Canadian Airlines as where as American Airlines you know the more data you have the more rows you have the better the machine learning tool can find accurate patterns to predict what causes and what are the causes of late flights and predict what future flights will be late sometimes there might be other data sets that you can join to it what do you guys think is the number one cause of flights being late now when have you been stranded in the airport and why were you stranded yes weather exactly the weather is a big factor well if you go to the world of open data you can access weather datasets so you could bring in a weather data set and join it to your flight data and actually identify the patterns of the flights that left on snowy days were more delayed than the flights that left on sunny days or you know maybe there's certain weather conditions in Vancouver that caused fog so that increases flight delays and so on so you can bring in multiple data sets and join them together it's kind of like joining two database tables like doing a join clause between two sequel database tables it's very similar you just bring in the two data sets and you identify how do I match records from data set 1 to data set 2 so that's a great tool for really improving your accuracy sometimes you might want more columns of data there might be other information we could find about individual flights it would give us more information for example what if you knew a duration of the flight what if you knew what type of plane was being used Navy - eights arrive on time more often than new Dreamliner's or vice versa maybe flights going east to west arrive late more often than flights going west to east because in Canada when we go east to west we usually have a headwind and when you go west to east is usually a tailwind so there's other columns of data we might be able to create find or calculate that could possibly help us get a more accurate prediction as well so again it comes down to the better you understand the business problem you're trying to solve and the data the more accurate a model you can be able to create so if you understand what actually causes flights to be a label on time you're going to be better at bringing in the right data so machine learning can do an even better job cleaner data can be a factor as well whenever you've got missing data that can cause problems one of the most common situations is you know you get a zero value for something I have a there's another example I sometimes do where I try to write a machine learning algorithm to predict the how many miles per gallon a car will will run on what its mileage is going to be well one of the factors it looks at is the weight of a car imagine if you had a car and you didn't know its weights the biggest entered weight of well if you take tell machine-learning to go analyze these records it'll say hey look all the cars with a weight of zero had this miles per gallon I've got this many miles per gallon that's not accurate there aren't any cars that are actually zero zero kilograms or so having a zero value for missing values can kind of mess things up so cleaning up missing and incorrect values can help another scenario might be let's say you had a province code of Oh n for Ontario but another system had the had a value of Ont for the province well machine learnings not smart enough to know but Ont and Oh n are the same province so it's been good to say hey you know the flights in Oh n had this pattern the flights in Ont he had this pattern if you clean up the data first to make sure but all the province codes are consistent then machine learning understands all those records are actually from one province and that will also influence your output so the cleaner data the better in fact I would suggest should say that you probably won't spend 80% of your time getting the data cleaned up joined together and then only 20% of your time mucking around with the machine learning tool different algorithms you saw there were six or seven different to class algorithms but I can use maybe I should have picked a different one and there's different algorithm parameters so when I'm actually in the tool and you select boosted class to class boosted decision tree on the right hand side here you see there's a bunch of parameters and things you can change I'm not going to explain what all these do if you're curious you can click on the help button here it'll actually bring up a page that actually explains what all those different parameters for this is getting into a little more advanced machine learning but basically think of it as these allow the formula to do a more deeper a deeper analysis before it develops its formula so it typically will cause the machine learning to take longer to run but it may give you more accurate result when it's finished now I actually have green checkmarks everywhere so my model is done so I can actually now go to evaluate model and I can right-click this and save evaluation results visualize so we can now find out the formula the model that was created is it any good so if I pick visualize I'm going to see a little chart now on the chart the closer you have to a straight line going across the more your model is just guessing it has no clue at all this one's not bad I've actually got a reasonable curve here The Closer Biz curve is to the top left corner the better your model so there might be it's not bad but maybe there's some things maybe I want to go add some additional columns or change a couple of parameters or try a different algorithm to get better results the graph gives you a quick idea what I really like to look at is to scroll down here and look at what we have is the accuracy so you'll notice here I have an accuracy of 87.3% point 873 so it's predicting with eighty-seven point three percent accuracy whether flights will be later on time and I also like looking at these fields here true positive false positive false negative and true negative what do these tell me well a positive value means it predicted a one so a true positive means how many times did it truly did it correctly predict a positive value which in English means from our model means how many times did it correctly predict a flight would be late sixteen hundred times that's not bad how many times did it predict a true negative so how many times did it correct correctly predict a flight would be on time 85,000 times not bad at all then you have false positives that is how many times did it predict a flight would be late when in fact it was on time or false negative how many times did it predict a flight would be on time when in fact it was late so this gives you a more complete picture of what's actually happening with your model so I'm happy with this accuracy maybe I'd make some changes but I also want to show you once you've created the model how do you use it I mean it's really nice to have is pretty graph but you know once you've trained them all how do I you know could I sell this to Expedia or to Air Canada so that when people are booking flights from their website they can get information to tell them hey this flights more likely to be late than the other one so you might want to take the flight through Calgary instead of the flight to Chicago that might be really useful I might be a big money on that so and to do that I have to deploy this is a web service and at the bottom right on by toolbar there is the option to set up a web service now if you are following along with the guest login you won't be able to set up the web service the URL I will give you afterwards will show you where you how you can set up free trials to explore and try the whole web service as well that the guest sign in because it's a guest sign in doesn't allow you to do the web service part so you won't be able to do this part of the demo with me instead but I'm going to give you a link that will show you how you can try it yourself later I still want to show you how it's done so you know so I set up a web service and I say create a predictive web service and what it's actually going to do is it's going to take the experiment I have here and it's going to make a copy of it so I'll actually have two copies of experiment the training experiment which is one I was just working on and a predictive experiment it's the predictive experiment that controls my web service so this is going to be my predict predict the future web service due to using someone else's keyboard I can only find backspace I can't find the Delete key all right so I'm giving it a name and you'll notice that it's got an imp there's the input to my web service so this defines the data that we passed into my web service and here's my web service output so here's where the data gets passed back out I am going to make one change by default it connects the web service input to the projection columns that means it expects me when I call the web service to pass in a value for every single column in the data set but I know that some of those columns aren't helpful so what I might want to do is I'm just going to redraw that to the score model tasks because that way I only have to pass in I'll only have to pass in the columns which I said were important the ones I selected in my projection columns tasks so it just makes it easier to call my web service then I run it running this effectively is compiling my web service that's all its really doing and it doesn't take too long because it already has the formula so really it's just compiling some code here chugga chugga chug there we go and once it's compiled the code then I can deploy the web service so I down the toolbar gives me the option to deploy and over here on the Left there's a machine learning experiments toolbar and there is the web services so with cenotes created the web service is going to hop me into this web services dashboard so you'll notice it's now changed this to the active dashboard and I can see the information for my web service that's created and there's two ways to call the web service you can call it passing it one record of time using request/response or you can pass it multiple records at a time using the batch execution there's even a nice little test option here you can use the sort of test how would it work if I called the web service so I can say let's say I was leaving on the 25th of the month and I was leaving on a Monday and the originating Airport and sorry I don't didn't memorize any Airport IDs 5 5 6 6 I know their flight digits but I don't know the actual codes and I had a departure time of 14 23 and an arrival time of 17 15 so I'm leaving it at say 2 20 in the afternoon and I'm arriving at 3:15 and you leave the value you're trying to predict as 0 don't pass in the null wise it always returns nulls and when you click the ok button down at the bottom you can see it's calling the web service and it's actually sending thing here's the record that got passed back and if you bring up the details it'll actually tell you here's all the record values you passed in rival a and at the end of the record that passes back it passes you back scored labels and scored probabilities those are the magic fields scored label is what's the value it predicts will be returned for the death specified flight you created so is it predicting the flight I lifted will be later on time and score probability is the value or the accuracy or for confidence with which it's making that prediction so you can see it predicted a 0 here for score play ball that means it's predicted my flight would be on time 0 is on time 1 means it's late and it predicted that with only 10 percent confidence that's probably because I entered invalid Airport IDs those weren't real IDs so you can play around with that to get a feel for how it works once you feel that you're happy with your web service the other thing you can do that's handy is if you actually click on the pages for batch execution or request response so if I click on that it'll actually bring me up a page where it shows me if you want to call this with an HTTP POST here's an example of a call to do that and the header values that you pass in and even better if you click on sample code it'll actually give you a snippet of c-sharp code that actually calls the service for you all you need to do is change the values you pass in and the API key here you need to change that to the API key that was back here on my machine learning web page 50 here so I have to change with that API key to give people permission to call my to call my service and you notice I can get sample code in C sharp or Python or R so this is specifically generated for my web service wonderful little little advantage there all right um so that effectively at this point I have executed an experiment I have deployed it as a web service and I've even got a simple code to call that web service so I can call this from a phone app I can call this from a web site depending on what I want to do so we've sort of talked about how to create the web service now I did want to share if you want to play with somebody else's created web services there's a neat project out there called Project Oxford there's some fun api's you may want to go play with those were all built using machine learning so those are examples of web services that someone else has created somebody at Microsoft went and created these and they allow you to call these web services and some people actually do this as a business model these are for fun ones you may have actually heard of some of them there's an emotion API I'll run one of them just because it's sort of actually I won't have any images so it'll be hard to experiment on my computer but if you go to project Oxford it's a fun little website to play with and you know you can load your own pictures and see what happens this is the one if you saw any tweets or people talking about these ones that predicted what your age was whether you're happy or sad and so on those all come from Project Oxford so you can do some fun things like emotion recognition it's one of my favorites to play with and you pass it in different pictures and it looks at the picture and analyzes you know this person they think is mostly happy a little bit disgust this person is very happy this person here if we analyse that picture you know you can see they come up as mostly anger and disgust not so happy at all you can upload your own pictures by clicking open image as well and play around with this so there's a whole bunch of really cool api's here these are all built with machine learning now these are more complicated ones because they're based on images but it's an example of how once you've created an API you allow and people access it if you want to play with these specific ones just to show you the pricing generally for just playing around with you can do most of them for free it's only if you get up to pretty high numbers of transactions you'd actually get charged so a lot of these you can do for free see multiple transactions for months there are a lot of fun to play with all right now I'm going to leave it open for questions now but I did want to leave you this one URL akms /ml workshop and that URL and I'll bring it up here so you can see it that is a URL to help you try what you saw here here is the step-by-step tutorial on how to create your first machine learning experiment and deployed as a web service here are some other examples you can go exploring how this gives you some tips on different ways to get access to the full version of Azure machine learning studio depending on your scenario if you're a company and they have an MSDN subscription you may get some azure for free through that anybody can get free trials you can explore of a guest sign in a voucher ml studio so all sorts of tips on different ways to access the tool if you want to learn more about machine learning here's some suggested other courses because I am doing this at a training center I will also mention the probably the most useful course you can sign up for would be something on integration services SSIS sequel server integration services because that will teach you a useful tool for manipulating your data so that it will be set up the way you need it to run your experiment so it allows you to create calculated field join datasets and things like that so I would recommend if you really want to get into machine learning a good complementary tool will people learn integration services and at this point I am opening it up to questions but thank you very much for being so as we were getting set up
