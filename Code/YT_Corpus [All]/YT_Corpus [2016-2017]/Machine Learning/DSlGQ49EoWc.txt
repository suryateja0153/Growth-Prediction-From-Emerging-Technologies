 so I came to steal it excites yourself so we're gonna talk about machine learning number one what is it how do we do it digital marketing what is it how do we use it and then how this actually work to use machine learning plus digital marketing we've got automate stuff so that we can get some real life but in fact I this and then I imagine this is probable people or earlier there was some real-world examples of how the stuff works and how you know good yeah look it's a little machine learning okay so this is machine learning in a nutshell so this is kind of you want to wrap your brain to digital marketing person think about the purple stuff and grow every living person this video add some color for you so we start the problem we said okay what data do we need to solve our problem right we're looking at text right then okay we take that data put it some kind of a representation that the machine can understand right so if you're doing something like text that's because it's a language get the languages of vocabulary we're gonna take the text and we're gonna say you know this word is this word from the vocabulary and we're gonna give it a number right all these tokens we're gonna make these tokens we're going to make a sequence of that which is just like your sentence right we take these features and we're going to count them and we get frequencies okay give that into a bottle in this case so they like logistic regression and we end up with something that says it's a probability of this thing being positive to eat organic negative right so just to kind of go over that again so but you better get a nutshell we have a problem problem tell us what they only want to use or vice versa but preferably the data to create representation machine understands that representation we create teachers that we're going to use to be into a model and then for the model make predictions we use the predictions but performant we want to do feed it into the pattern yeah okay so let's just a marketing digital marketing is pathan does plus data right the cool thing about this is we have the other NASA we can do all kinds of neat things of that specifically what are the different things that kind of fall under the different marketing Agrella so mobile apps simply things like you know a story to see a stopped-up SMS text messaging I think isn't particularly cool we start talking about things like chat box ecommerce things that you have bought in the past and you want to recommend things we refine a future email you know of email marketing campaign to attract users they're covered user base is doing video like you know thanks YouTube etc content so websites social media twitter facebook Instagram snapchat etc search ads which is probably what a lot of people think of when they think of difficult marketing things you know other things like I also think a slapping people so other kind of camel for your you know different kind of user interaction these are all tables because there's so many channels and there's actually these are basically things where you broadcast it right so you think about you know Super Bowl has a CD radio kind of sense to be kind of somebody's desk etc right they cannot respond to you okay so if that's really happy because we have lots of channels and lots of data so question for you on what your dollars spent on display ads surpassed $1 spent on search ass nope close those about this 2016 so the curse is crossed so this year is the first year and you actually have display ads surpassing search this is actually really cool because display how to include a native image component so we're getting a lot more kind of rich content that we can look at anytime okay what's you learning enough summer good business marketing and umbrella right so how does it actually work kinda means machine learning digital marketing okay data to operate it wipe on it I think it's really important to actually take a step back at the beginning and say there's something we should even bother doing okay so looking at what are the benefits right one of the clear benefits is you can scale this because it's a machine religion you can't replicate that across the cluster across the fly out whatever you do and this can actually give you a lot more kind of you know evaluations per time that you could probably hire people if you were going to hire them to be people to do this is that a hospital offer as well as it takes time for a person to read something or to look at an image or whatever so that's the person's faster than machine fashion right so one all time is depend upon the please how do I actually ship that content to a person have them evaluated analyzing at the output take it back to do something with it it can take a while but that's still pretty slow you're not gonna be able to get on an app in real time you think and then complexity I think is something that's often you know people forget about but it's another kind of Boston it's greater deal if you want to manage the process to do this kind of stuff like you don't want to talk about details right you want to have something that works but I think about you know your thing in the nutshell we love solving bigger okay so when we think about data this is probably what's going to be kind of print over there so we have two ways you can do digital marketing that's right we've got better graphics based digital marketing who is this person who is consuming whatever who are you trying to market to how do you say that down what are the demographics right who are they connected to what's so good I can go classic metadata or who are their friends what do they like you know what did their friends like who are the new influencers in this niche what if a browser you don't previously etcetera so slow look has been going on to the last few years the trend that we're seeing working now it's actually really interesting it's not so much one of the demographics of this segment it's more what this person is saying right so there's content that people are generating and generating in a way you know we want people to consume that we write we want people to see our beautiful reactive we want to engage so we've tried thinking specifically about the collective into the text yeah how many of you guys are doing this kind of thing yeah yeah okay so on the first one well how do we do a demographic targeted digital marketing campaign listen if we're going to do something with Facebook basically we have an API we can use this API in order to be able to slice but that kind of demographics and market specifically we want to so if you do this just other Doc's right so when you can use things like user location plus some of them RSVP to an event plus that's relationships with other people on the ground I didn't know that all information was available it lives on a server somewhere you have no way of knowing when that's actually captured I think a lot of things you probably can't have a fine-grained control over through Facebook but there's no way you can control other people which is up revealing a lot of this kind of thing is not available better there okay so this is basic have a look if you want to be able to target people so green is the color easy for different marketing Purple's of reason for data sharing stuff right so if you know people apart people serve content to a specific demographic of whatever the hypothesis here being if you can specifically target people who are like the kind of people that that you want to have an outcome for right then you wants to engage then you can optimize your spend so there's a lot of pros a lot of cost of this kind of thing the real pros here is that Facebook has done a heck of a lot of work and got a lot of data at this time right it's a really nice interface the have a guide works you know Facebook is doing well because of this and also can be actually pretty cost efficient repair to you know kind of traditional marketing or you can compare to other channels right so I wouldn't be surprised that we're going to see some real interplay here this is our cats mom's Facebook has control of this and you don't necessarily see what the different kind of dynamic so get what they give you as well as who you know is probably something that happens after you've already made decisions or it's a when you have out there so for example okay so what does this actually mean to the context here let's say that our date and our content and we want to be able to look at content that people are engaging with in order to find people who like that kind of thing that they're talking about a representation is going to get feature vector and in the code we think of tax data in terms of feature vectors we have an API that you can actually digest these feature vectors on your own if you want it's great a little that won't look for the data side crowd should totally check this out it's a really great way to get started into experiments frankly yeah so what's the feature vector everyone I haven't seen Larry get a nutshell before and there was a number of common number it could be the Oh hands so yeah welcome back okay so maybe they look like normal I think is what is the feature right so a feature depends on what kind of model we want to build if we're building neural networks the way girl networks work is you are looking at thing and you're looking at pieces of the thing and trying to figure out how these pieces come close together let me understand the thing right so you can imagine one of the pieces of dog right he's still a dog it has dead eyes as hair and tail right but like all those different pieces can be quite different you can have a great day dachshund to go with the hair but they're great different sizes you know it's nice to you know there's such that etc different colors and so what we're going to do is riven with a model the side on the things like how big is enough but we don't really care helping the dog is represented for right but things like hair dogs have to have hair who doesn't have hair so that's a really strong feature when we say a feature vector these are informative pieces of things like what's that hair of a plank the model right the model because of the way we train these things these are deep neural networks it learns to figure out its own features as it progresses so yeah that's a good question so the old way to do machine learning a few years ago before kind of neural networks that people are didn't came on the scene is you would have to have some expertise about what is about right and then you would say oxide there you say how do I make a filter into this image processing pipeline that detects hair using that and it features four is there air in this patch of the image right and then oh well I guess anybody know I shot a photography editor and this kind of pair actually so you know for something like is it a dog so that's basically that's the part of it it's we'll look at the model if you do a good job with your representation kind of weeklies so remember what I said there's a problem I'm hearing right here a problem forget it together decide I promise that you can decide what here with apples going to be right so if you wanted some kind of a search problem like I want to find users you know where I want to find words or whatever right we can actually think about there's also really a similarity so it's sort of thing I want to find you know dogs you could say I want to rank this list for didn't have dog link everything is you sort the list on dog like output and now we have a sentiment would be like positive or negative is this thing it's a pretty straightforward use case talk about that one and then we do things like emotion or video thank you okay so use cases so at for example sentiment analysis is maybe the simplest kind of hospital machine running model you're literally saying is this positive or is it negative there's only two possibilities we're going to give a probability positive and probabilities negative probabilities have to add up to 1 ok so how would you do this in general right you would go through I was going to do this both from scratch say that you're the only machine learning person or data science in your company you you know person talking about things in a positive way or negative way history right grab a bunch of tweets okay from all these tweets you label them as positive or negative your content here is going to be text your feature vector we're going to say we have all these words we're going to take the words we're going to count on all the key words for ever you need word when you create a vocabulary and then we're going to say we're going to sort them in order so the most common words at the top is all these common words at the bottom and then we're going to take X and match it to the word that it is give it a token ID so the word thought is very common it might get a spoken idea like enough to eat or something word butterfly not very common so am i good-looking I feel fine about 30,000 right be good all these you know top to bottom most common token ideas up things those are our future and our teachers represent a representation we're going to go through our each for our document and we're going to do this analysis right we're gonna take the text we're going to get the token IDs token IDs we're going to skim through a cap how often decrypt the document and then we're going to divide it by total number of words that happen right so we end up getting is kind of like normalized frequency of words environment okay this is like classic kind of natural language processing way to solve this our model at this point really doesn't matter because our feature is only information in that person but good news like the SVM support vector machine regression but really what you're trying to say they're trying to say how important are each of these counts in terms of the science the positive from but one that we begin with may predictions evasion will have a probability with it so you get a probability of the things you've ever won you're gonna set your threshold for what you're calling positive or negative depending upon whatever your Hardy's case or business is if you want to be really conservative my except really strict preference usually you don't slug show everything the first step has to be human to create the dataset they use the trade model it's a human thing and how well do model is typically constantly sarcastic let's look for some of this okay so there's two ways to do this way number one is like we just talked through you're gonna warn on if you're gonna go gather a million tweets you're going to analyze all those tweets to say that the positive negative but if you do it or you hire about two people to do it get that human kind of image on from somehow the other way you could do it is you could also fire up if it go or some other API that does seven analysis right we basically ever done this before you we look at gazillions of things that are already labeled and we encode good features and we doesn't prove the model and we've been evaluation to figure out that we're not do is kind of like bias before happening but basically there's an API let's grab the tape job so you guys want to play with it you know you can grab it there's free about pre cost per month right now so totally do that but ultimately what I'm trying to get across is that the problem isn't part the implementation of it gets kind of messy but there's no reason you need to think about the digital harkening plus machine or anything as being more difficult right did it in walnut data it out right where your data enter all your all your text and your data isn't a prediction so if indigo is so easy to use exclamation mark really positive really possible there are other examples for you can play with a brief of this type of girl things like indigo is so not easy right this actually gets parked that the knock is very kind of several words apart from the thing that it's talking about so you want to model it actually doesn't just look for nothing it looks kind of acne to see wings it figures out what to do does that help us yeah proximity to other words keyword yes so all these questions are kind of like thinking kind of how you would do it I would encourage you to think about what problem you're trying to solve and like what you want in and out and like that chunk in the middle start off just like doing something it works and then when it doesn't work well enough iterate and like get more complicated right you like it so like this whole thing of like assuming we know what we want the model to do and engineering it this is totally nowadays like we just can't optimize as well for the folks like following in the room like yeah sign you haven't been marketing Center this is actually good so what might have go actually I guess this one line of code need to put the librarians pipe up do the binary jack keat and they have a single example which is the thing and I want to pull in an analyze this sentence for you to do it - that's it okay so this is the way you should think about the problem regardless of what API you want to use for stuff this is how you do it right okay next is it not some of an analysis anymore what if you want to look at a chunk of text we want to say the first if you wrote this text what emotions are they trying to be baby right so now is that a st. positive or negative in four categories so we're going to look at things like anger joy fear sadness and surprise you can see on this one like seriously my life is bleep I'm unemployed depressed and I suffered the person angry not really you know but maybe this one here you know included it in this and definitely sadness right so it's really really sad so you can do the same kind of thing you get a percentage for each of these four kappa / hype as bears yeah cool what if we want to say I'm not so interested in the emotion the first time to express the text of Pride FC who's the person that wrote that like what's some kind of like you know personality level characteristics about that person so you guys may have iris Briggs Type Indicator this is a similar kind of thing right so if we take the entry on Wikipedia that describes great descent which is love these pens we used to train a neural nets so creating the set of the first order optimization algorithm talked about that one of the personality types that are most likely to have written upon the test and you find my freaks types there you know associated with life I okay right yeah so this is this idea of persuasion marketing there's a customer arts matter if that was to do this kind of thing as well so influencer analysis people pre type people this is a niche and five things those people are talking about be able to write how it was maverick figure out what everybody on the end is saying you're gonna get right you can figure out they're a very thing you can quickly kind of peel back a layer so you realize well maybe they have like the sediment analysis kind of thing they're doing right or left have some idea of this person was talking positively about this product and this prime about triathlons or sports what's kind of cool so say that you want to grow your audience followers popular right you can do this manually there are services like all over the place to do is through acts like you know follow much people some of them will haul me back you know anything but what if you actually want to say if you want to understand people who are out there might really like the kind of stuff that we're about and we want to reach them to say hey like myself checked out how would we do that you could run a Twitter engagement campaign right flip through Twitter engagement campaign you can do things like find people right and then you assign a budget etc and then a market this and clip that's an interstitial ad when you actually use Twitter right so there's some chance that if you like baseball talk about baseball stuff or categorize their system as baseball person that you will see this hat right no point of doing this is this is kind of small I apologize but you have impressions which is basically how many chances that a person you get for this but like folks ago how many chances the person have to see your content right so you have these impressions that's you know kind of topic or funnel that you're optimizing and then you get engagement ultimately when you're tracking this conversion you want to know how many people actually get all the way through another thing question what program are you using that API pebeo check the fun that's a splitter oh yeah yeah just move her twittering okay don't break up there anything you know your stuff okay so that looks remember we have the two kind of main thrusts you can market people is segmenting on demographics or even American people based on understand right what I just described the way you do demographics this man right what if we wanted to also do that from cricket right so we actually did this experiment it's kind of cool so this is shooting your own example so this is any close Twitter page he actually should check this out for the pool and we want to find the followers who talked about things that are currents all over stock now right they expressed kind of the same interest tweet about some more stuff etc right so how would we do that right we did a little experiment where we compare you I said the first one would use a segmentation versus we're going to analyze the text that's in these tweets people are talking about and we're going to call that our user content and we're going to put an egghead let's see how much conversion to get from one channel or one kind of madman person the other method right now so the way that we do this is we actually take a bunch of users that are candidate users and then we filter it through our own stuff and we feed that into Twitter as a custom list of users we might reach and our engagement sauce so like you compare the two I think this is like play-doh eighty percent just like and this is like you know four times bigger than that so this is pretty cool there's pros and cons to this right what pro for Twitter is they have massive reach and if you're saying that the demographics everybody has all the demographic information available if you want to reach never tell you really does the Boston Red Sox and talk about you know cry at laws that might be overly smaller so even if you have a perfect way of finding those people you can't create right so you still have this kind of like you know scale yeah so we need to make something there's text so we take all the speaks of all these different people and we feed it into a model that runs on our text features API right so our text features API is basically something we've trained out this deep neural network to figure out what things are really important in terms of like topics sentiment and all kinds of things people use English for right and we're spitting out these features and then we use that in order to look for things that are highly similar between our user base and people that are not in raise your base that maybe should be right and when the molarity is really high we put botanist and both people somewhere it's not high so they don't want lists we take that list and we give it to Twitter and we do this doesn't equal a minute experiment you see how it goes but pretty cool stuff talk a lot about text welcome to those images there's a really cool kind of growing trend right now before I want to look not just the whole image to look inside of an image and I want to find things that are going on in that image is specifically quote about and then do something with it so there are certain things that are really strong in this image so look I see a vineyard and I see a bottle of wine as you keep people maybe a forest the background definitely class to the point so what we're looking for is glasses of wine we can train the neural that to actually go look for specific classes of wine and then find all the images that we find on social media whatever channel you're trying to market to that has glasses of wine now it doesn't care if the gossip why this would it be in from the payment or not doesn't gratis to people or whatever it might related for last point you can imagine this being a pretty powerful way to grab users and whatever because our neighbor will be looking for intent so people who post pictures people so look whatever the drink is coffee so you can campaign so you guys know how it works yes I'm going to spend three minutes when you how this actually works and how it goes and if this to high-level multi keeper and it's two in the weeds so it's pretty cool so this is the machine learning kind of landscape is the type of colorful the convolutional neural network with convolutional neural network works is everybody clear the floor top yeah if Photoshop you have like Gaussian work you were wondering how that works yep so if it works if you actually apply a convolutional kernel and slide up in foster image right and you get some kind of a boring result what that convolutional kernel is doing is it's looking at the pixels that every value and the pixels that are next to it and then it's doing some math to make the result so instead of blurring you can also do things like just pick ground this thing right remember that so that's basically what this is to it you have an array of numbers which is your pixels in the image and they're stacked up into an array right we take these and we encode them there's like 1 2 3 but it could be anything could be black and white it could be coming to take our input image we do many different kind of types of convolutional filters like a florist shop like imagine you just get you know 30 years sitting in front of Photoshop developing the perfect custom filters the detective eyeglasses that's basically what we're doing there in seconds right and so you get these you stack them together and then you say which ones are active right now as I look at this particular image you might say don't remember is one for it you know you passed that downstream is something that makes a decision about those two does more convolutions and this is why it's me is because you have convolutions lot of compositions all the way down the final layer we're going to say okay I've got some representation of what's going on so each level we have representation the last one is telling you the most about to get the image right so you want to be able to take that and pass it to something makes a decision is there a wineglass here right so that we're all the way through here and we're at this last thing each little dot would be what kind of thing to be in so you would have a bunch of things that say not a wine glass bottle white lux okay and then you would look at these and you would say the one that's activated the most strawberry is the one for white less so I way to predict the white glass right now the hard part about this image of image is you actually be able to go into an image and pull out just the parts that are white glass instead of looking at the image of the whole it's complicated I'm just going to be that I'm almost want to know more we can address this basically what it looks like these are almost full rashad filters that somebody's like groups with each square it's kind of one of these okay if you guys want to know more this is actually not what a great oz has a really great into or anything so I think we're missing slightly after if you want to know we can definitely send away for it yeah so that's example I think is so a very very kind of visually you know striking things on it builder so if you want to be able to engage users and it kind of scalable by online and you might be able to have your users being content that you're interacting with your users don't count ran make it personal branch right there one person they can decide that they want to do that you probably are responsible for a brand spinner that mistress and there's some private identity and you have to be mindful of that brand identity right so there are certain things you made a point if you're disney you're going to avoid adult content and you're very strict about this if your comic line you solve everywhere risky right like you might actually actively kind of use a little border line a little content or to pull people in for interest rate so there's a lot of things we want to consider when you're doing this kind of life you're using user-generated content for other kind of things specifically the new digital name it's really hard as a classic problem of is this a little content or not great I'll decide everybody might have a different decision but it's really a spectrum and you probably want to be able to say how a bill like is this content and maybe you can decide one professional write this he's an image you get back some kind of score for how you know Topsy for work with this content right yeah so I mean this is actually probably borderline it does and you can think about the SS different I newspapers so social media is pretty obvious somebody posts on Instagram image that may not be something that you'd like to display in a certain kind of context you're right if you're this obviously without the riddle sometimes so you guys may be aware US Airways they'll be clear anymore so the gist is there was somebody doing something inappropriate with an airplane and it was clearly out of context what they thought they were responding to you with Damon to whether they might be the link and it totally blew up and they had to apologize for this and there's brand image and yes hopefully got retweeted and favorited more than regular police
