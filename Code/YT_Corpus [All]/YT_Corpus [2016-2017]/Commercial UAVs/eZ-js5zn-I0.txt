 when you think about it future is the only thing that can be created everything else is created already so it is actually a driving force call it curiosity call it hope that gives you things done that never have been done before that was the idea of the transformer coming home the drones that we fly we call them's axles the space fixes it was really trying to achieve a 3d display as soon as you call them drones people immediately think dangerous but it isn't anything it can't be beautiful ARS electronica is concentrating on the intersection of our technology and our society so really focusing on the future of our society by the means of artistic use of technologies when the angel came and said what about doing a hundred drones oh you know nobody did it yet nobody even tried it it was just like you know yes yes let's go for it for the set up tomorrow morning it's quite important I think to first get an idea of where the air feeds are before we start setting up the tents and then the idea is to go directly into a 100 drones test flight it's a team of 15 people we have four pilots and on four airfields with 25 drones each so each pilot is communicating with the crew on his respective athletes taking off we developed our own ground control software it's an animation software that needs to have quite a powerful machine running it the specs are challenging in the case it's really hard to sketch something in 3d you want to create something that amazes people that people like and that's probably something new they haven't seen before we're just taking technology and making art out of it the reason why we decided to do drone 100 is because we wanted to push the future of technology you need to find somebody to push you across the borders really and this is what we found in Intel it's not just like the technology that is there but what's more important is actually the driving force that is behind that company and the visionary power we're working with different aviation entities around the world to understand what the policies are the rules and regulations and make sure that drones are safe and we can have light shows like this I think it's very important to show people that it's not always Jones that look at you sometimes it's the drones that you should be looking ahead tonight we're gonna have a hundred drones up in the sky synched up with the orchestra we're going to show an audience something a little bit different and it's all happening in tarnish airport near Hamburg no matter what it's gonna be incredible I can't describe it it's years of efforts development and hope exploding in one minute in this one moment of excitement I yeah everybody ready all drones mixed wrong humanity is curious and demand is equipped with hope but that driving force is in all of it and that makes us doing things that are just like one would say crazy probably others will say astonishing Oh
