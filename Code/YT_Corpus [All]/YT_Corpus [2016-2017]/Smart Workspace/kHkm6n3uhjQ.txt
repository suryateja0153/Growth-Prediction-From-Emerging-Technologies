 there are ton of things that I have set up on my phone they make it a lot easier for me to use a lot funner for me to use a lot safer for me to use and I know that you guys love videos like that so I thought I would share with you of five of my favorite things about Android some of these are specific to marshmallow some of them are not but important stuff that you need to know about your phone and things that you can do today just to make your life a little bit easier and better so first off do yourself a huge huge favor put your personal information on the lockscreen in case your phone gets lost its underneath the security settings you just put a phone number someone else's went your spouse's phone number and the email address that you know that you can access from any of the computer just do yourself that little favor get that peace of mind in case you lose your phone if it winds up in the hands of a Good Samaritan they can get in touch with you ASAP while you're in the security settings though you can also take a look at smart lock and if you haven't used smart lock goodness gracious what have you even been doing smart lock is crazy easy to use okay don't worry all it does is it pays attention to what devices are connected to your to your phone whether it's a Bluetooth SmartWatch or Bluetooth headphones whatever it is that pays attention to bluetooth it also pays attention to your actual GPS location so if you're near home you're near work smart lock will make sure that your phone stays unlocked and easy to access mode the best thing about it is that as of Marshmallow it actually works even better than it used to now you can actually use your fingerprint reader that works on the back even when smart lock has your actual lock turned off it's really really easy and super convenient you'd be silly not to turn it on all right let's talk convenience for a second here let's say you're at home you're on the couch you're under a bunch of blankets it's pretty chilly you don't want to get up you're watching a movie and you've got your hot cocoa right on your belly well thank goodness for Google now because believe it or not it works really really well with your voice actions with a number of different apps and services and devices cheaply I want to tell you about nest if you just say ok Google set the temperature to 75 nest will do that for you so long as you're logged in and your nest is connected to the Internet it's really really cool and insanely convenient second the last thing before I let you guys go the system UI tuner is really easy to turn on and it gets you quite a bit of new customization options it's also fairly new to Android if you open up your quick settings pane which is right inside of your notifications pane that gear that you would normally push to take you into the settings just hold your finger on it it'll start spinning and then once it starts spinning wait about 10 seconds and then let go with your finger and it should dump you right into the settings and let you know that the UI tuner has been turned on that's gonna let you do a couple of things first and most importantly you're gonna be able to see your battery percentage up in the status bar at all times but you can also change what you can see in the status bar and change what you can see in your quick settings it's pretty helpful lastly but not leastly I only just realized how good Android actually is at handling Bluetooth controllers go grab yourself a really sweet emulator for whatever platform it is that you miss the most or even just your favorite first-person shooter or whatever game it is that you play and then just grab whatever old Bluetooth controller you can find online you can find some really dope deals on them I just bought one for $30 that supports all kinds of retro stuff and even has an analog stick pair Bluetooth controllers aside that's a few of my favorite things that you can do in android here these days go ahead and leave a subscribe or push a like or do a thing to watch a video I'm gonna fall over on this bike anyway thank you guys so much for watching and I'm gonna crash now you
