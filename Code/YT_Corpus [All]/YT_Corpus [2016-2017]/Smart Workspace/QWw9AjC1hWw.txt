 hey there Pete Mariotti here and in this quick video I'm going to be showing you some of the cool new features that have come out for G suite in October 2016 time for a quick recap so here we are Google has released a massive massive amount of features this month but I wanted to show you two or three cool things and what they mean for your business now obviously there's been a rebrand in the last couple of months Google Apps is now G suite and the umbrella cloud for everything Google is now being called Google cloud so hopefully there won't be any more name changes in the next couple of years we've obviously got to update our branding and everything else that comes along with it when that happens but G suite is the new name for Google Apps and one of the big changes is they've changed the two different editions now they're calling the standard edition of what was Google Apps for work basic and they're calling Google Apps unlimited G suite business now the unlimited version which is now called the business version that comes with Google vault which allows you to store a copy of every single email that comes in and out of the business great for compliance reasons if you're any in any kind of professional services firm absolutely fantastic for making sure that all emails are stored and then searchable as well but also it's got some other great features like similar to the name what's called an unlimited before you're able to get unlimited storage for each one of your team members so that's a great feature there if you're starting to use up all of the 30 gigabytes of allocated data for each user well that's certainly an option for you so I want to take you through some of the new actual features that have come out for G suite in the last month and I'm gonna go to my screen and show you a document of what that looks like so this is our Google Apps monthly summary document and I'm going to share this with you under the video here so you can access to this there's plenty of features that it goes through some are more or less relevant to small businesses but I wanted to show you a couple of my favorites which are the top ones that I think will be most relevant to you so scrolling down here you can see one of the first ones is actually in Google sheets and Google Documents and this has to do with comments and actually a begin giving you the ability to assign the ownership of a comment to someone now you'll see here in the little gif image that there's actions being put into a document here and you can actually now assign those actions you can assign the ownership of comment to somebody so it's not really a fully fledged task list it's not really a fully fledged project manager but I do know that then when we use comments and documents which we use these quite often what it doesn't give you right now is this ability to actually give an ownership over the comment there's a comment there waiting to be resolved but there's no clear idea of whose job it is to actually get it resolved so I'm really excited for this one I'm looking forward to it being deployed to my account has it quite filtered through yet but I expect it will come through in the next week or so now that's the the document view there I'm going to scroll down so you can see what it looks like in a spreadsheet as well so same kind of thing you add a comment to a cell in a spreadsheet and then after you add that comment you get a little tick box there to assign it to a particular user and that user will receive an email and and they'll get the email that hey you've been assigned to this comment in this document and then any time they open it up then they will automatically get access to it there we go pretty cool so next up this is a absolutely absolutely massive one and that is the search actually that's our action items we'll skip that one I'll come back to search where's a search I think it's somewhere else in the document here let's find it I'm gonna go ahead and so this document for the word search here would go great so our integrated search has now been rolled out right across G suite so that means when you search for something in Gmail when you search for something in Drive anywhere else that you're running a search within Google well it's going to search the whole of your G suite account now I don't know if you remember maybe some of the geeks in here remember that years and years ago there was a product called Google desktop and that Google Desktop Search allowed you to search stuff that was on your desktop but it also let you search your Google it wasn't even in Google Drive back then it was just called Google Docs and also your emails but it gave you one consolidated search which I use search for absolutely everything and that was really cool but Google killed off that Google Desktop Search after a while now what they've done here is effectively brought back the ability to have one place to search and search absolutely all of your documents and so this should be rolled out to all accounts if you're not already for your account it should be rolled out to all accounts within a couple of weeks globally but this is really really exciting because what it means is when I'm searching for something in my email well I can find just about anything to do with that search query so really really big one Thank You Google that's awesome and really really happy that we now get access to that let's have a look at the one other feature that I wanted to show you here gonna jump back into my laptop and this is to do with forms now you can see here there's some extra smarts that have been added to forms these are these are pretty handy pretty cool you can see it's got a little bit of a a little bit of intelligence built in now and it can even predict some of the things that you may be building out in your form some of the questions and those kind of things but my favorite one and this is just like absolutely absolutely awesome I'm not sure if it's actually in this document here let me see if I can find it but there's a new file type others new question type and that new question type is the ability to attach files into your forms which is absolutely crazy so what that means is for someone submitting a form that can actually upload a file now there's one caveat with that right now and that that caveat right now is that the form can only go to people within your business which kind of sucks you can't send this form to people outside the business just yet hopefully that will happen at some stage in the future but what you can do is attach files into form responses now you can have the fight the type of question called file and upload that now that one also hasn't been deployed to my account yet so if it's not yet in your account expected in there within the next couple of weeks or absolute most by the end of the month in November but that is a really really great one gonna be super useful if you're looking to have files uploaded so let's say for example you've got I don't know maybe workers on site up on the and you want them to click a button you know from an iPad and you know upload or attach a file from somewhere there or maybe you're taking responses internally and you want someone to attach a photo to a forum response lots and lots of options they're very very useful and a massive massive feature request we know that we've got from customers all over now there's one more thing that I want to show you and the last thing that I want to show you is voice commands so Google have now added more advanced voice commands into their documents now if you didn't already know this you can actually use Google Docs dictation feature to talk straight into a document and have text typed out which is really handy it's a little bit like Siri on the Mac but what this allows you to do is easily author documents just using your voice but what Google have now added is other ways to format that document they allow you to create tables they allow you to change text formatting all with the commands of your voice so I'm gonna give a quick demo show you how that works and and you'll see how easy it is to format your document just using your voice now to bring up the voice menu you just go to the Tools menu and then voice typing and it brings up a little microphone here and once I've clicked the microphone as soon as I start speaking , Google is going to automatically dictate my speech into text there we go so that's the that's the basic voice feature are pretty standard pretty straightforward there but let's see what happens when I add in some extra formatting italics here is some text that I've converted into italics well it didn't like that maybe I use the wrong command there bold bold remove bold oh well we're having a good one here all right it doesn't like my it doesn't like my text formatting let's try that again alright let's go let's give it one more try insert table hey there we go at least that worked we we add one thing that works so it looks like it's got a tiny bit of to do that it did work when I tested it of course everything works when you test it but in a live environment who knows what happens anyway thanks very much for joining in if you've joined in live or if you're listening to the replay thanks very much as well now remember if you want to get access to these videos live as we produce them and in a live environment then make sure you join our G suite user group on Facebook and what I'll do is I'll put a link to that underneath the video you can get access to it there and any questions that you have any feedback that you have or anything that you'd like me to cover in a future video well please let me know and I look forward to seeing you next time until then take care
