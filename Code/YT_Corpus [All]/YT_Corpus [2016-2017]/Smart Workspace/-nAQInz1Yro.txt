 hey there welcome to my desk which is also in my guest bedroom which I'll tell you about in just a moment you may if you've been following me awhile you might be wondering why the change of office space I used to have this big grand office we have a virtual team of about 40 people we've chosen to do all virtual so that we can work from home which is really nice and pleasurable and you know there's a lot of pros and cons to a virtual company but being home is one of them now I used to be in the room next door which is now Kerry's office and the reason I'm here now and I'm gonna take you through my desk I'm gonna show you what's at my desk I've been getting questions like you know what is your workspace look like so I'll tell you about that in a moment but the reason I'm in this room is because ever since we started online and before we started online we Kari and I have had small apartments in New York City 500 square feet 600 square feet we had one that was like 1400 square feet which was huge for us and at every place she always wanted her own room a room that was hers that you know she could do her thing in it could be her room that would be for her created her creative space you know and we just never had room for that and we finally moved to the country we get this big house and somehow or another it still ends up that all the rooms are categorized as not her I mean not as not hers like there's our bedroom there's the guest bedroom there's you know our gym downstairs there's the living room like there wasn't a room that was hers yet I had an office because you know it's important that I have an office I guess but I would be like following her around with my laptop I don't like to be closed away in a room and so we thought what I thought why not why don't you just have this office like what do I need this thing for so now I have a desk in our guest bedroom and it's phenomenal she has an office which is she keeps much nicer than I kept it so it's like a nice room now that you actually want to go into now here's my desk I want to take you so that's why I'm in the guest bedroom in case you were wondering but I'd like to show you what's at my desk like I run an eight-figure business and multiple seven-figure businesses from this desk and so I would like to take you on a tour of it and then hopefully in the comments below this video on Facebook and on our blog you show me your workspace to see it's okay what do we have here well the first thing that we have is a stand-up desk and I'll link to the actual time so this thing goes down it also goes up so you can sit at it or you can stand at it which is nice because it's nice to move and feel like you've got some space I'm not just being hunched over a computer all day so for those of you who do not have a comfortable workspace it changes your life it just you're gonna spend a lot of time working you want to be comfortable and you know if you're working on the couch on a laptop that's just not comfortable so let's get you a nice comfortable open big workspace with a big screen I've got a Herman Miller chair I don't know if it's on camera but it's a nice comfortable chair for when I want to sit down I have my rode ntg-2 Ike rafin comes in and out here and makes me have good quality audio when I'm recording videos I've got a Mac Pro one of those tower Mac Pro's nice speakers you know so that it's nice audio in case you just want to jam out to some prints or something like that I do have some crystals because I'm just kind of a weird crystal guy I'm not actually a weird crystal guy but I do have crystals on my desk and I like them some of them were gifts some of them I bought I've got my jiu-jitsu blue belt here which is an accomplishment that I recently achieved I was a white belt in jujitsu I was like the the world's longest white belt a trained as a white belt for 18 years I got my blue belt and it reminds me that consistency and hard work pays off so that's kind of cool I like to have that on my desk I also have this random bowl of stuff I've got pens in here I've got like poker chips and matches and just weird things I don't really know you know you got to have a little bit of mess I suppose so I got that I have you know of course pictures of my loved ones that I get to look at this is my wife Carrie and this is my wife Carrie when she was just a little luffing playing dress-up so I like to look down at that I got my little lucky cat here I don't remember where I got this but I loved it I think Carrie gave it to me as a gift actually what else I've got my keyboard my mouse oh I have a you be and this is important a Logitech USB camera and it's mounted here on a tripod I don't know if it's visible in the frame but it okay it is visible my friend but it's nice because when I'm doing Skype and I'm doing video messages the difference between an HD webcam and the normal webcam that comes on your computer is it changes the way that people perceive you you will be judged on how you look you just can't get around it we are as people people judge people based on how they look and so looking nice is good so I have a USB and I got you know window I get to look out this window here and see the forest and I get light coming on me and I think that's it for the workspace oh oh what else I have which is important is I have an 8 terabyte hard drive connected to my computer that's backing it up so that everything is in the cloud so my whole computer is is backed up in the cloud as well as on a hard drive so that's important that you set that up as well and for my workspace so I'd love to know what your workspace looks like please post a picture below this video with a picture of what your desk looks like and why you've set it up that way and I want to say one more thing which is you'll notice there's only one screen I used to have two screens I even had three screens at one point so why have I gone back to just one screen well what I noticed was that when I had the two screens I was always slightly turned this way or slightly turned this way and it didn't feel good on my spine and my stomach to be constantly at an angle so with one screen I faced forward my hips are square and it feels much better to sit and stand straight forward and I actually find that I don't even miss the second screen personally now you may have a different opinion so let me know what your desk looks like take a picture of it post below tell me why you've settled up that way what kind of stuff you have on there that people you think people might benefit from so we can all kind of see where we work as we're here from smartmarketer.com thanks for taking a tour of my desk I'll see you soon
