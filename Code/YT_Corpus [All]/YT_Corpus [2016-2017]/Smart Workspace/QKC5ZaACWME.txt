For application request approvers, all assigned tasks are displayed on the Work on Tasks page. Use the Search field to locate specific tasks. The search criteria must be based on task descriptions. Enter whole or partial words in the search string. Tasks can be sorted and organized based on sort options such as Due date, Application, or Priority.
