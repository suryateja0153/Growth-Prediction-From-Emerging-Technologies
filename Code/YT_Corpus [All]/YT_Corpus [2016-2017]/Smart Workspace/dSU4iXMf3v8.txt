 hi there this is Ranjit and in this video I will show you how to actually save up to about 50% data if you watch a lot of YouTube and Netflix V videos and we know that video consumes a lot of bandwidth so again using tools like this will be really helpful if you are on a limited bandwidth or you have some aggressive data caps for example in India the mobile data generally that we get is very limited so it's really useful to save the data and again this is achieved by using a third-party app and this works on Android smartphones and the name of the app is actually Oprah Max and this is made by Oprah again if you have been earlier using Oprah browsers they also compress data now but this one actually compresses sort of everything and to make it work actually as you can see this is the software itself and gives you an idea you don't have to do anything you have to just install this and you can enable it for mobile data or for Wi-Fi based upon your usage so the good thing is that let's say you don't want it for Wi-Fi lets you have unlimited bandwidth so you can disable it for Wi-Fi or wife's words up and you don't have to do anything once you install it it works in the background and what essentially it is is sort of of VPN so as you can see on youtube if I click on YouTube it has saved me quite a bit of bandwidth as you can see it just consumed about 85 megabytes of bandwidth on YouTube and it's saved 97 so it's more than about 50 percent almost about 55 percent for me for YouTube and if we move to again for even for Firefox browser it did try to save a little bit but I've noticed that it does a lot for video for example if we go to Netflix as you can see it consumed 43 MB and it saved about 51 so again for Netflix it's almost like 55 percent bandwidth that it is saving so again this is useful if you watch a lot of videos let me actually show you don't have to do anything once its start and you get this icon over here right like this lock and again as it's a VPN I would say if you're doing any sensitive transactions like banking and etc just disable it but for everything else it works and let me actually show you first wire netflix and let me lower the volume and one thing that I noticed is that for example let's just go to Netflix let's go to this 100 die like this series been watching it for quite some time let's try to play this one the 8th episode and one thing I noticed is that it takes about 5 to 10 seconds for the stream to start earlier it used to start about within 2 3 seconds so there is slight delay in starting that is one thing that I have noticed so again you got to be a little bit patient as you can see and you can scrub also and it will work but regarding the quality it is sort of compressing the video quality so it's sort of not in HD and if you seek around as you noticed if you just move around and seek around like this it can take some time to seek around so about 10-15 seconds but once it starts playing and let me just lower the volume and once it starts playing it starts playing it fine I would say but again the video quality is sort of compressed I would say sort of like 480p though I am subscribed to HD feeds so it's a little bit aggressive in the video compression at least with Netflix that's what I have noticed so it works very well also you can see current but as I told you it takes about 10 or seconds and then it works like this so if you are specifically watching a lot of Netflix etcetera on mobile data you can certainly enable this one and it works very well I've watched entire episodes so specifically if you are using mobile data it's a good idea to enable this one and it works fine let me actually now also show you a YouTube and it works fine with YouTube also let's fire up YouTube over here and let's just go to my own channel and let's try to play this surface video again you don't have to worry about anything it works normally and you can just let me just skip this ad and your experience is the same but when you start the video for the first couple of seconds the resolution will not be that great as you can see it's a little bit fuzzy let me increase the bottom is my own idea but after about 20 or seconds 2025 seconds the video quality starts to improve a little bit so it's sort of like between 360p and 480p that I have notice so but one thing I have noticed is that it takes about 30 yard seconds at least on YouTube videos to improve the quality players so as you can see now the video quality is improving a little bit now as it has played a couple of seconds so you have to be aware of that thing but for the most part it works very well and as I told you you have this control panel and using here this you can gauge how much data you are actually saving again as I told you it does save a lot for YouTube and specifically Netflix and if you want to disable it let's say you don't want it on Wi-Fi just toggle this off and it is disabled you can completely disconnect it also while clicking on this disconnect button again other things that I have noticed is that it can be great option if you are honor what do you say limited bandwidth then this can be really helpful again one thing that I have noticed is that strangely this app does not work on Android tablets this is my Android tablet and when I try to invoke or sorry not Netflix if I go to the Play Store and as you can see this Oprah max oops home it's going to the Netflix one second and as you can see it says that this device is not compatible so it works only on smartphones not on tablets but overall I would say a very interesting app if you want to save data and you watch a lot of YouTube and Netflix again I hope this video was helpful if it was helpful I'll appreciate if you can
