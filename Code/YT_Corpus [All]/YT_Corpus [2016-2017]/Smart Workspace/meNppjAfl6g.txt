 Hello and welcome to the SpinFire Ultimate version 11.0 introduction video. SpinFire Ultimate is a complete rewrite from the previous version and is now 64-bit application it also uses a new file format called .ACT3D which contains additional B-Rep information as well as the 3d preview information and as many new features as well as many updated features a few of the features that we're very excited about and should be very useful are the smart edge and surface dimensioning the boundary area by edges and the calculate 3d area of a void PMI support in addition to CATIA v5 also includes i-deas JT, NX, ProE, STEP and solidworks. some of the additional features include in language translator editor online help is now also in German we now have the navigation cube and a file 3d preview window the 2d workspace has also been greatly enhanced and now contains many of the note and dimension features found in the 3d workspace, then lastly SpinFire Ultimate has the ability to open up just the assembly tree does partial loading, shattered assemblies and also allows you to save notes and mark-ups to user-defined views and now has 2 and 3 plane section cuts available. so now let's get into the demo go ahead and open some files that are listed on the recent documents screen I'll grab the engine as the first one and then I'll go ahead and from the same list select another assembly I'll open and you can see at the top I now have two completely separate sessions that will be opening independent of each other I'll go ahead and grab another CATpart file that contain some PMI information and while those aren't loading go ahead and grab another file that all import this step file that contains additional PMI information and we can see that one assembly has already loaded and I'll see if the CATpart that one's loaded as well and I can go ahead and take a look at the motor that has as well so I'll go ahead and hide some the annotation planes now go ahead and rotate zoom in a bit and using the navigation cube I can go ahead and select one on the sides and will rotate it into view I can select the corners the edges I'm so it's a completely new navigation tool and that's in SpinFire Ultimate as well and you can see we have the PMI information I go ahead and go to the initial file that I was opening its the call the engine and we have additional ways to load just the assembly structure itself so what that allows you to do on large assemblies is load just the assembly tree without any of the components so the time it takes to import is very quick you can see there's no components there because was just the assembly structure and I can take a look at the assembly structure to see what kinda components I have, you can see that they're kinda greyed out that means they're not loaded I can go in in this case select a subassembly and I can go ahead and import those components within that subassembly and if I want I can import just an individual item or I can go in multi-select as well if I want to bring in multiple items or if I want I can just go to the top level assembly and just import the entire assembly so can see that be very useful on large assemblies and we also have the ability in the library function to search for folders on a computer and within that folder we have the ability to search for part strings part names so we can itself it couldn't possibly be the file form and this case CATpart or CATproduct so it allows you to search with folders search for files in the folders makes it a lot easier to find the files that you want work with and lastly we have the ability with the file open workspace to see a 3d preview of a previously saved SpinFire Ultimate file so there we see the thumbnail we select load 3d viewer and now we have a 3d window that we can actually rotate the part around to make sure in fact if that is the file that we want to work with and while we're working with assemblies we have the option of performing searches so we can search in the assembly structure for specific part or components that were looking for those will be highlighted and then you'll be able to perform hide/show color transparency and so on this case will just show those parts in the assembly structure we see certain components are highlighted red those are missing components that are identified If the import process has taken place so you'll know which components are are then missing moving forward but we also import now many of the CAD views that have generated from the CAD system by the user and those can be use in SpinFire as well going to create a couple views here this one is the start view so it stores components as shown were also going to create a new view called dimensions in that view we're going to create and store different dimensions here we see the linear dimensions that are available, we see advanced features and dimension features that are available we see our radial features that are available and we also see the angular features that we have and those are all good what we're gonna show here is the new smart dimensioning both edge and surface dimensioning which will make it much more efficient for users to generate the measurements needed so in this case we're gonna go ahead and select an edge create a dimension a diameter dimension we'll hide the center points for that but we also may want to perform other functions so if you right click on it based on whether its an arc or straight edge we get different type of functions or different types of measurements we can create in this case we're going to create a minimum distance if we just right click we can get the edge length and if we right click again again depending on whether a straight or curved edge in this case the minimum distance between straight edges we can generate so notice how there was no moving cursor back and forth between the part and the and the icons for different measurements so much more efficient and we'll go ahead and change in this case some colors the leader line we're gonna change color so any measurement created moving forward will have this new color were gonna create a new color for the mark up arrow so again any any measurement created after these changes take place we'll show those new colors now we're going to go ahead and get to the smart surface dimensioning and again based on the surface that we select and how we select it we may just wanna get the draft angle by picking the edge we can also right click on a surface and define the type of measurement we went to create in this case its a minimum distance between surfaces so again we're just storing the smart dimension and then we're generating multiple dimensions without ever going back to the the toolbar so now because we created new views I can go back to my start view and see the part without the measurements I go back to my measurements or my dimensions view and I can see those dimensions so all that information is now stored in those views so will create another view on for a few other dimensions and this particular part we want to show and create by using one of the advanced features O.K. and in this case we're gonna do a boundary volume by surfaces and this is brand new again for this version so we just go ahead and pick the internal surfaces we want to work with and complete the process now we have calculated the the volume for those services created so we can find out in this particular case what their volume is and maybe for material ordering and such and then we can put some transparency on there to get a better idea and show it with its mating part we can also generate the boundary area by edges so in this case we're just creating 2d areas just by selecting a couple edges it will go ahead and chain and then generate that area so it makes it very easy to get the volume and the 2d area of your components and can because that is saved in a user view we can turn those views on and off as needed and now we're going to generate the weight of a part first we need to set our units we set the material we're going to use and we simply right-click on the part select calculate and select calculate weight it will then generate a mark-up that will again be stored in the used defined view so it could be shown and hidden as desired another new feature is the ability now to create not only one but two or three section cut planes so we create the first section cut we can then go ahead and enable the dragging on it and move that section cut to the position we want to use and then go ahead and select in this case the second section plane and again if we want we can move that to a desired location or just go ahead and select the third section now you can see we have three section cuts cutting through that part and we can see kind of a quarter section cut through their we can then go ahead and bring up the the properties of the section cut and we can go ahead and hide the section plane so all we see is the cut itself we can turn it back on or we can just flips sections in this case and it flips the entire section or we can flip the plane's individually until we get the desired results I'm so you can see there's many different options with those three section cut planes and lastly we showing the ability to now have rendering effects applied to your assembly or parts we have a simple shadow that you can turn on and adjust the position of that there's also the ability to have simple reflection turned on and again you can adjust the position of that up and down as desired you can use this for taking snapshots and putting into word documents and such for presentations thank you for your time and attention in watching the SpinFire Ultimate introduction video we hope you enjoyed it if you have any questions please send
