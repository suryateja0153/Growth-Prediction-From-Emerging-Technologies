 - Meet brothers Brendan and Kyle, tinkerers, hackers, and best friends. - I'm probably physically stronger. - I wouldn't say that. I wouldn't say that. - We gave them an OnHub router from Google, a box of smart home devices, and a day to see how many things they could connect using OnHub and IFTTT. IFTTT stands for "If Then Then That." IFTTT lets you connect your apps and devices together by making simple "if this then that" statements. Each statement is called a recipe. And recipes let you control and automate your connected devices both in and out of your home. [device chiming] OnHub is now the first router that works with IFTTT. - Let's do it. [upbeat music] Here we go. - All right. - We'll kick off with something simple. When my phone connects, we'll send you an email that's like, "Kyle's home." - You're home-- - Do you care if I'm home? If Kyle's phone connects to the OnHub, then we'll send a Gmail. - Our first recipe. - So I'm reconnected back on OnHub. - Okay. [phone chimes] And there we go. Kyle's home. So, I mean, that's super easy. Really fast. It's simple but--but actually pretty cool. Cross that off. - Okay. - Let's mess around with this thing. [upbeat music] What if maybe you're leaving the apartment, and your hands are full of stuff, you walk out the door, you leave the network, and it just locks behind you? That would be sweet. - We'll do your phone. - Yep. Yep, I'm connected. - Cool. - Coming out the door, I've got a ton of stuff, I got a backpack, I'm walking out, here I go. I'm gonna disconnect, and it should lock behind me. Nice. - Hey, there you go. - Perfect, that's great. - There it is. Done. - Done. [devices beeping, whirring] You still have those ping-pong balls, too. - [laughs] - See what else we got to work with. I think the camera could be, like, you know, security-type feature. [alarm beeping] [grunts] [both laugh] - Brendan, so now my phone's on the OnHub network, so tripping the security camera... - Yeah. - Shouldn't do anything. - Boom. We obviously got our lights. - So we have our hypothetical party here... - As more people join the network, more stuff will happen with the lights. - Right. - Josh and Jen. - Jen. - On the network. - They're on board to OnHub. - And... their two personalized lights. - Carl, Eric, and Frankie. - They're all on the network. It's a throwdown. Look at that. Perfect. One, two, three. Success! - I kind of just want to, like, blow out the next thing. - We got stuff left. [upbeat music] I plan to use the connected switch, and then I'll set up a recipe so that when I connect, I'll have some switches turn on and hopefully these'll just kind of launch into the air. Let me enjoy the fruits of my labors here. - You got it, yeah. - Connect, why not? Okay. I'm on. [cannon whirring] - Oh! - [laughs] [upbeat music] - OnHub just keeps getting better. Now the first router that works with IFTTT. [upbeat music] - How cool is that? [chuckles] - It's a pretty fun party.
