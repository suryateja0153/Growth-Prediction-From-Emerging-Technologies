 hey Thank You Stuart really appreciate it it's great to be here in Melbourne my first trip I've been to Sydney many times but it's the first time I've had a chance to explore this and especially in winter last week I was on holiday with my family on the East Coast beaches where it was about 95 degrees Fahrenheit about eighty-five percent humidity and imagine me landing and then you know walking last night to dinner it was a little bit chilly all right not quite as bad as where I'm from in Ohio where we get a lot of snow and probably about minus 10 degrees Celsius on average but definitely a little bit chilly and then what other side comment a little bit of housekeeping for the Google people and the Stewart great job on your presentation I think the face the fake Scottish brogue is really working for you Stewart is actually from Denver Colorado did this whole I you know that whole thing it's a fake it's really not true just kidding no it's great and oh by the way i think i'm going to rewrite some of your perf comments you're really coming along quite well in your presentation style so thank you very much now in all seriousness it's great to be here what I want to do is I want to transition a bit from the leadership things we talked about from Jon at pwc in terms of how to establish a culture of change to the application of machine intelligence into your daily work live where we're going to enable things like ok Google create a team space for me populated with the content around collaboration invite people from Project X to that team and do that in a verbal command as opposed to all the things that you have to do today to be able to establish a team space within Google Drive and those types of things we think that's going to be an incredible enhancement to your productivity but beyond productivity we think there's an opportunity for you to work in a more modern way so you take the intelligence of apps and in terms of helping you work smarter and more intelligently with the ability to work much more collaboratively work together to build consensus to drive decisions to have intimacy in your interactions with your colleagues with your partners and with your customers so I want to spend a couple of minutes now talking about how do we achieve that and what are some of the underlying product principles and social and collaborative capabilities that we bring to market to help you become more productive in your workplace all right so the theme here as I talked customers around the world I've been at Google in the collaboration space now for a little bit over eight years and I've been watching this whole space evolve and I've had lots of conversations with c-level executives down to individual store workers to banking employees to healthcare providers across the gamut of different industries and what I've what I what I've noticed across the board is a theme that we are all under great pressure to be able to move faster right the world is changing and in some cases you have to make a fundamental decision right are you going to be the disrupter in the market or are you going to be the disrupted in the market are you going to be able to equip your organization's with the right tools to be able to build consensus make decisions hear the voice of the average employee to be able to build the next generation set of solutions and products and services or are you going to be trapped by the tools and the collaboration methods that we've used over the last 30 years and continually to work less efficiently to be slower to market and be part of that organizational element that is being outpaced by your competition both locally and globally it's our goal at Google to come alongside and facilitate that collaboration let's talk a little bit about how so the first observation that I would like to share with you as we've watched the market through is that transformation and the ability to affect that disruption is really the end result it's the end result of big ideas people are in organizations creating new ways to be able to create new products to be able to reach their constituency and interact with their customer to build loyalty to grow topside revenue to be able to manage their operational costs but if you think about those big ideas where do they come from I would submit to you that they come from increasing the level of creativity across and up and down the organization and from within the organization to your partners and your customers right so to be able to achieve transfer pation you have to have big ideas to be able to get big ideas you have to raise the level of creativity within your organization but how do you raise the level of creativity and really affect and impact those people that are working together to be able to deliver those transformations we believe that it's by increasing the level of engagement of those individuals as I work daily with my colleagues with people within my organization between my organization and other organizations at Google and with my partners in crime as we go to market if I can raise the level of active engagement if I can get people to work together more intelligently and more collectively I believe that I'm going to have a dramatic input on their creativity which will result in bigger ideas which then lead to the transformation that people like PwC are leading in the marketplace around different verticals and in some ways I would I would I would argue or submit to you that that journey has already begun but there's a problem which I'll introduce so people are already working from different places right as part of being able to connect with others they're already doing it from a variety of different devices right and in fact if you look at the millennial generation which I argue is actually the most collaborative the most socially connected organization or group of people that are coming into the workplace they're obviously doing that from mobile and mobile first right if I may I'll give you an example of my son so you don't know me but I have five kids a very proud father really excited and in fact my youngest daughter just turned 22 so like where did the time go right I look in the mirror and I think how did I get to the point where I have my youngest daughter to be 22 year old and when i connect and collaborate with them right I am not using the traditional means that you would do if i send my daughter for example an email right i actually did this in a conference one time where at the beginning of one of my speaking engagements I said hey Kelly she's at school in South Carolina and I said Kelly urgent call ASAP problem with mom I sent that email off now I knew it's kind of a dangerous thing to do right but I knew that she wasn't looking at her email right my daughter my kids they're not connected the way we'd trained to work they're actually working in a different way sure enough I went through the piece I had about an hour and a half talk did not get any response at the very end of the discussion I sent her a text message right in an SMS text message I said Kelly when you come home in six months so it wasn't urgent it wasn't mom when you come home in six months what do you want for dinner something totally not important in seconds right it was like microseconds I get an answer back from Kelly and she says dad I really want to go to an Italian restaurant in our local town she gave the name of the restaurant I'd like to invite a couple of friends I'm really excited about that looking forward to see you so I respond to that and I said Kelly where are you right now what are you doing and she responds by dad I'm taking a university examination I'm like like what are you crazy you're taking a university examination like what are you doing responding to me but that characterizes the culture of the Millennial population is coming in to work and that's a millennial population that does a lot more from their mobile device they're looking at the experience that they have in mobile as superior to the experience they have on the desktop and they are much more collaborative and social in the way they work so that's a great start but is it enough all right I talked to a bunch of people that are adopting the competitors products on a daily basis and i will ask them and i'll pick on microsoft as an example but it could be dropbox it could be boxed it could be IBM it could be anybody and i said you've adopted that technology for over a year now what are you doing different in terms of collaboration how are you driving consensus what are you doing to create intimacy between you and your partners and your cross-functional colleagues to be able to drive change in the business what are you doing different and the answer that I get back one hundred percent of the time is we'll bill we're doing nothing different in fact that was the reason we chose that is because we want it to be consistent we wanted to not have to do change management we didn't want have to retrain our organization on how to work differently and with different perspective and then I'll ask the question how is that working for you is your business accelerating are you growing your top line revenue are you seeing new innovation get to market are you doing things in a way that is really transforming and allowing you to be competitive on a global basis and sadly they will look at me at a CIO level and say not really really not seeing that level of bump we believe that change is required we believe that a disruption and a transformation actually facilitates that change that I talked about earlier and in fact old habits are very hard to break I'll give an example as a young air force officer in the United States I was in the intelligence community and spent the first eight years of my life in data centers active duty Air Force supporting a variety of missions and one of the extra duties that I had was to run a first responder team in terms of evaluating our ability to respond to different disasters and and and we would do a lot of planning around how to respond to a bomb attack how to respond to a fire what happens if there's a protest on base all those different types of things so what I did is part of that exercise and building in a capability to evaluate our first responders is I would create a word document in that word document I would then outline the core of the test that we were going to run the outcomes that we would expect the first responders that we need to involve and what i would do is take that document attach it to an email and send it out to the different first responder organizations i was working with so we had HRT which was the rapid response team we had fire police other services that would come in and and respond to whatever activity was going on they would in turn take that document and add their commentary through track changes send it back to me I would be left with the cycle of then bringing that all together producing the next version of the document sending out to that constituency and going through that cycle over and over again to get to the plan that actually gave us this exercise result we were looking for is that the way to collaborate is that the way we want to work together in terms of this method that was 30 years ago I bet many of you are doing the exact same sequence on a day to day basis right now with the tools that you're using right that is not the way to work that actually I believe will slow you down and it's our belief at Google that there's a different way imagine if I would have gotten those first responders together in a room and we spent four hours and actually work through the problem we define the problem together what is the exercise that is going to give us the best test to see if we're ready for a first response in whatever tip let's take a bomb scare all right and then one of the different scenarios that we want to run together and how should that work together who should be doing what how do we actually design the test that's going to give us the best exercise we would then build a plan of action and choose and prioritize one of those scenarios to actually bring to market in our case actually run the exercise we would then begin to build the action plans around that exercise and we walk out of that room we're all in concert we have built consensus we've had a chance to voice our different opinions and point of views to be able to get at an answer that really incorporates the voice and intelligence of everybody involved and we have an actionable plan that we can actually we can execute that is what we believe is collaboration and we think there's a way to do that electronically and virtually with a set of tools where you don't have to be in the same room at the same time but you can actually use a set of collaboration instruments to be able to achieve that same outcome what does that look like well number one it's real-time collaboration where we're working together in the same documents at the same time with a single source of truth we're literally I can be working in a document typing and interacting with a number of colleagues at the same time and I can plus somebody in like James snow who's going to come and talk to you about security in a minute i can say james in this particular exercise there's a security concern about this particular area what do you think James gets that in his email and can simply an email respond and I get it right here in the context this document and James says bill I think this is really a question from mark randall I've plussed him into the conversation and now I'm building a social fabric around delivering this exercise and I'm identifying expertise that I didn't know existed I didn't know Mark Crandall had that level of expert expertise it took James to make the connection for me to build that expertise in I invite him into the document he joins in immediately I can lever that social network to be able to add power to this document which will build the right plan which will achieve the right outcome and I can do it in a way to where we develop it in a face-to-face so you can get this going so not only do I have a collaborative document experience but I have the ability to build intimacy right with the people that I'm working with to where I'm not doing this over an email exchange or even an SMS exchange or in a social way but I'm actually interacting people with a live way where I can click a button all right and from that single button engage with a number of people around the world geographically separated and be able to pull them together and interact with them face-to-face intimacy and trust and the ability to actually create a common outcome that we all share is built on this basic core human instinct to be able to read someone's eyes their facial expressions to derive a motion and intent which as a result builds trust and intimacy which then yields to teamwork and that teamwork actually allows us to work better together so you have to be able to combine the real-time max aspects of intellectual sharing with the physical and social aspects of being able to work together and you have to do that from a common core of assets in a common place so being able to have a single Google Drive where we have all of our assets in a team space where I can invite people to the team space and they can quickly survey all the content that's available they can get up to speed faster on the content that knee and they can reach it from mobile from desktop from a variety of different ways so that they can all be informed on what's going on and if they miss the meeting they don't have to know where to go they don't have to get the email with the results they can actually just log into google drive that content is readily available to them they have a manifest of what's been going on in terms of changes and they can immediately go to the right document at the right time to be able to inspect that because all that content is in one place easy to use it's not stuck on my my box it's not on local file server it's not on the nasara it's in the cloud available to me from anywhere any device at any time and then in like manner I wouldn't be able to do this and I had the right security infrastructure and controls in that document some of these documents involve intellectual property or sensitive content that I want to make sure I can secure so I'm going to share this security document with the first responder leads but not the actual first responder teams because they don't want them to know the exercise right I want the first responders who are who are collaborating with me and I'm going to actually share that document allow them to collaborate but when we're done and we've locked down the plan I want to be able to change their access to view only I want to move them from an active collaborator to a viewer and consumer of that content and when I go to publish I can then say you know what I'm going to share this with a group of people and I'm going to say you can all look at this document for the next two weeks with these rights and I'm going to prevent you from being able to download copy or print that document with right irm controls built into the platform available today in google drive with google docs not just on our content but any content that you populate a PDF file and microsoft office document an excel spreadsheet a powerpoint the same level of controls are available to you and then of course the obvious point is we're all working from the same music the same page right so instead of having do you have version 163 no I have worsen one dot five dots seven right why do we do that why don't we just have one source of truth one document with active change control that allows us to back up in time with a timeline and actually know what's happened to the content throughout the genesis of these ideas so that we all have one place to go do it so one single source of documentation so in effect what we're creating with the collaborative suite that we're building is the software equivalent to that conference room with all the first respond first responder leadership team involved to where we can produce the right plan and build the consensus that we need I argue that I contrast the two experiences between these two pictures on the Left I have a sailboat multiple people are on the sailboat but how many people are involved in steering the ship at a given time you have one person on the rudder everybody else is watching there are pen but they're not actively engaged in the experience and they're limited in terms of how fast they can go and what input they have into the overall process contrast that with the modern version of a hydrofoil sale right where I have a team of people that are working collaboratively together to increase the velocity and achieve a much higher result in a much better experience where they're working collaboratively everybody has their role everybody has their input and they're not just along for the ride they're not just viewing and making commentary there are actually active participants that's what we're trying to achieve at Google that's the core basis behind the services that we provide so what can you expect from those results number one is that your projects are going to move at a faster pace you're going to have the ability to be able to finish things in days and weeks not months in years secondly is that through all the smart innovations that Stuart talked about you're going to be able to do things and save time in microseconds one example is the average person today than average knowledge worker cements about 600 minutes per month right do the math how many hours is that right 600 minutes per month doing calendaring activities what if google was smart enough to say by voice command please schedule one-on-ones with my direct reports every other week and on my preference is to have them on Mondays and Fridays and Google would go out and figure out who are my direct reports what are the right times availability globally because I have a global team people in Singapore and London and Paris and the united states across the u.s. and latin america be able to select the right conference rooms know where people are at any given time schedule the right places for them to me and automatically reschedule things will my boss Sebastian who does this all the time preempts one of my one-on-ones and saying bill I need you to attend this strategic meeting we're making a decision about product we need your input that interrupts your one-on-one I shouldn't have to worry about that I should be able to go and react to the boss's meeting not even thinking about the calendar and the calendar should automatically say I see that your boss Sebastian interrupted a meeting with your direct report individual I know that you like to do them on mondays and wednesdays let me reschedule that to friday and i found an available space and after a couple of times when I accept it it learns it is intelligent and I don't even have to ask anymore it's automatically reschedule it for me that's the world that we're bringing to you that's what we believe we can do all right and then lastly here is the fact that we want to be able to allow you to integrate your life to where you can be available for the moments that matter and work the way you live so that you can start to really integrate your personal life and the things that are really important and it matter to you with your professional life and driving as an executive the things you need to do so I've got some other content here I'm going to skip over we're not going to cut it into this we believe we have a lot to offer in terms of scalable computing and secure computing what I want to invite you to do is join us on this journey let us help you reach max velocity but to do so you've got to have some confidence that what you put in Google is going to be secure that we're going to honor data privacy that we're going to work with the regulators and your industry to make sure that you can adopt these technologies in the cloud and do so in a way so it's my pleasure to introduce colleague that has worked for me for a number of years we work together James snow who's going to tell you all about what we're doing to protect your content in the cloud and how you can trust Google with your content so thank you very much
