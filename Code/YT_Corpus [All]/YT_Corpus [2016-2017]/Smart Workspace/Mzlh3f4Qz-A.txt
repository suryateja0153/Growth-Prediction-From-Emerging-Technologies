 this episode of quite frankly was made possible by our friends from Mac fun great photo editing software for Mac go to our special microphone community website for exclusive deals just for you guys hey guys and welcome to this episode of quite frankly now today I want to talk about something that's called the Wacom Cintiq now what does the Wacom Cintiq you see it over here it's a big screen where you can draw on now you just you just have to see it to believe it it's amazing but they've been on the market for quite some time now I never bought a Cintiq because with the all the versions I always found there was a little bit lagging that means that you draw and you see the pointer coming a little bit behind it now with the new series there's no problem at all now you might wonder do you really need a Cintiq for every workflow well of course not you don't need a Ferrari for a free kind of car drive alright but this in teak has some very very cool features which you don't have in a normal interest now let's see why I switched to the Cintiq this is my old into it and I've done a lot of retouching on this one as you can see it's almost like a mirror so yeah it's had this time and really nice the problem was as soon as the iPad pro was released I fell in love with drawing again now when I was younger I did a lot of drawings and I really liked it but at one point I just lost interest and we did still drawing I never really felt that it felt natural you know and as soon as the Apple iPad pro US released with the Apple pencil I immediately fell in love with it again so I wanted to do drawing also on my Mac and then you have something called eye hand coordination so in other words you look at your monitor and you draw and believe me I tried I couldn't even draw a circle I still can't draw Seocho by the way but I didn't even come close I couldn't even write my name because you have said I hand coordination so I was looking at the Cintiq and I was looking at the 13-inch I really like the idea of the 13-inch but then in the shop I was looking at it like you know it's maybe a little bit small and I ended up with 20 70 so that's the biggest one now let's look at how you can set this up now for a lot of people this will be your only monitor so you do your emails on this you do your surfing on it and of course you do your retouching on it but for some people like me I'm very very critical with my work color wise but also with shadows and what I found out is although I love the Cintiq I still find that in shadows it blocks it up just a little bit and of course I calibrated the Cintiq and I calibrated my main monitor and still on the main monitor I see a little bit more detail now if you don't work with a lot of shadows that's no problem at all but I just love those really really dark shots so what I did is I actually created a desk situation where I can have my Cintiq and I have my BenQ monitor straight in front of my face where I can do my critical color work so I can do all my tinting and I can still see all my shadows the fun part is in some instances I will actually use my Cintiq as the normal interface and just look at that screen while I do my retouching now let's talk a little bit how you use that two screens because that's not clear for a lot of people the Cintiq of course is your main screen that's where Photoshop Lightroom manga studio premiere or whatever it runs on the Cintiq right now I have three monitors that one is my social media monitor or National Geographic or TLC whatever I want to watch and that monitor is my critical color monitor and the Cintiq is - the one with a retouch now there are different resolutions like if you go for a Cintiq 24 22 or the 13 you have a lower resolution than most monitors that means if you do a mirroring you get scaling artifacts and that isn't perfect because if you see scaling artifacts it's very difficult to judge sharpness or color or you just see the transitions a little bit differently so you have to make sure that both are exactly the same resolution now I'm a lucky guy I have two 27-inch the big boy and my resolution is exactly the same as my BenQ so I can use mirroring now if you're not that lucky how can you make sure that this image is also there let's first look at Lightroom now Lightroom for a lot of people is the place where all your images live it's the same for me this is where all my images stay I do my smart albums and do my markings everything is done in Lightroom now in Lightroom you have an option here on window and it will actually tells you screen mode that's easy but also secondary display now as soon as I do secondary display show as my magic they arrive my full screen preview and it's this image so now if one image over there and one image over here I can still work on this image do it fullscreen do it in the normal size but dead image stays the same it doesn't zoom you see this this zooms and then my second monitor doesn't zoom now this is really cool because if you select images and select a few images from a photo shoot you always check the focus on the eyes now I mention this I also want to check of course my composition there we go okay I love this image really cool let's zoom in yes the eyes are sharp let's zoom out it can be a very tedious process now I was not used to anything else I was going like yeah that's normal now what's this that monitor shows me the total composition and I can just go through my images you see in both changing right now what's this if I put this one on 100% like it very quickly go to my images and check composition on the top monitor and check if my images are in focus on the bottom monitor or on the Cintiq so this is very easy I can very quickly see okay the Isar in focus the eyes are in focus here and I on that monitor I can see the whole image so I love this workflow this is really fast okay now let's say you don't work in Lightroom but you work in capture one is it also possible in capture one yes so let's close Lightroom and let's open up capture one there we go capture one has a similar option let's say this is my image I can go to window and I can for example create a workspace now let's say dual monitor large fewer now I have all my images here and I have a few on that monitor that of course is a problem because I want it on the other monitor but luckily with capture one you can just drag this window so now if my image is over here and I can do my critical adjustments on that monitor okay okay do differently yes of course I can do it on default there you go and I can also make for example a floating tool which I can put on that monitor but also the fewer now the fewer is really nice because now I have two options I can do this one here and I can actually go for example to 100% on this monitor and that monitor still shows me my image as it is so the fewer changes and it's exactly the same as in Lightroom as you see here so it capture one we have two options we can put the images all here and the preview there but I prefer this one this is much better okay now here you go like yeah Frank and how Photoshop how do you do this in Photoshop Photoshop has a really cool feature too so let's go from this image into Photoshop so Photoshop is now starting up let me close the fewer from capture 1 show you guys see that it's actually Photoshop I'm using okay now this is my image in Photoshop now let's say I want that image also on that monitor to check my composition and I wanna zoom in here work on the Cintiq and sometimes just watch over and see what I'm doing in Photoshop you can go here to window you go to arrange you see here an option called new window for danique Danica's our model from today i cannot press on new window and what you see is it opens a new window now these two are exactly the same what I cannot do is and I can drag this on my second monitor now this is a new document that means that I don't have a life preview update but what I do have is something totally different if I go to this one I can go to 100% I can do my critical retouching and that one stays the same so I see my retouching here and I see my pro my total composition over there that's pretty handy now if you update something on this image it won't appear immediately let's say it take black paint you see the dead monitor doesn't change it yet right but as soon as I let go there we go and now you see that the top monitor is updated so this is also a very simple way in Photoshop to control your two monitors with a preview on the top one and here okay so let's say we want even more we close these don't save and now of course I have two monitors with exactly the same resolution so what I want to do is of course mirror the problem with a lot of mix is and it's actually the Mac user because this option has been in the Mac for many many years if you go to your system preferences and you go to this place and you go to arrangement you see my three display so display one my main display the Cintiq and of course their display if I do mirroring what you will see happen is that all three monitors are exactly the same and I don't want that this is very confusing for me because I want my social media on that one that one also has normally a different resolution so this is not the way that I want to work so let's change that back again mirror this place off there we go now what a lot of people don't know looks mirror display so there we go but a lot of people don't know if you can press the command key on your keyboard you can actually drag your active monitor just on this monitor the fun part is now it only mirrors these two monitors on top of each other and my third monitor stays exactly the same now if you use an Apple TV and you also want to shoot terror in the studio you want for example the Apple TV also on this that's no problem at all you hold the Alt key and you can move that over so that's a very simple way of getting your monitors in synced if you don't have the same resolution you just use screen sharing sorry if you have the same resolution you use of course mirroring and if you don't have the same resolution you did the tips I gave you before so enjoy your Cintiq I will see you next time you you
