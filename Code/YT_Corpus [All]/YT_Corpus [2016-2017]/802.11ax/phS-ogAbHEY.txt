 Hi, my name is Cherisa, and I am an engineer at Keysight Technologies. The new UXA has a multi-touch display. And with its familiar menu structure, it can help you streamline your measurement set up. Making power measurements such as channel power, adjacent channel power, and spectrum emission mask are common when testing to wireless standards. The new UXA has a PowerSuite feature that makes setting up these measurements very simple and it will save you time. Let me show you how this is done. We are looking at an LTE 10 MHz downlink signal. First I am going to add a channel power measurement. I will hit the Add button, and then I will drop down into our mode/measurement/view selector, and I will select Channel Power. According to your particular communication standard, the preset values are already embedded within our PowerSuite, so all you need to do is select your test standard. Underneath our measurement setup, we have measurement standard, radio standard preset. We have a category for general, video standards, wireless standards, and for today's demonstration we are doing cellular 3GPP-LTE base station test and 10 MHz. And then I will select Okay. Our radio standard is now set. In the same way, I can add an Adjacent Channel Power measurement. I will drop down, and I will select Adjacent Channel Power. And this measurement screen is already preset to our measurement standard. I will add an SEM measurement with relative power frequency. And, again, this is preset to our LTE standard. I can view all of these measurements, all of these screens on one display and then expand it so we have even a larger view of all of these measurements. Please keep watching for more tips and tricks on the new UXA's multi-touch display. And if you would like more information, please visit the URL on the screen. Thanks for watching.
