 it's studion adria tomato this is the demo for the project I have been doing this last month as well as you know it this is a work that involves a lossless audio compression first of all I would like to share about the background 10 asa man i'm in a congress everyone is stalking around me well so let's start with the remote as you can say i have all the food reason that i have one doing these days the first fusion is a predictor you can read the description and follow all the lines but i'm not going to to explain all the code because there are a lot of lines and well-prepared online fiction for about to explain it everything so this is the first function the second one is a preprocessor the third is the entropy encoder and the second part of the project it's the the same system but in bexley so you you have the data color icon structure and there is one left that it's post-processor sorry so it's before the half obstruction okay so for them for the demo we are going to run this dismal future that will load the my audio signal because this is the signal audio input point what this is the output file that was created in the last so I want to delete it okay so you know I have the arm I'm going to run then the name future okay please me mango sure and the input parameters for the line is only the defiled value file input voila so what it's going to do to happen it's dual listen w and then 10 seconds later after the processing elders on the system you will be able to hear the result of all the compression k we are there there will be 10 seconds of more or less of processing it depends of the on the file okay so as you been here oh there is no difference in the two files that the input file that it was a compressed and just output file that that it has been compressed you can check all the results on the conclusions section and conclusion and results are in a section of my document of my wrapper okay and you will see the compression ratio and other information and well the next step would be to to find if the wave to curb represent and plot the the input and output wave okay so for this I have to tear this there dis script this will plug input file okay and then for the output file I will run this and you can compare it to go out to again so you can check that the signal are exactly the same I have been looking for for the maximum and minimums but it's almost almost the same ok so the demo is over you will understand that my my work has been running in every line of the optical system it's not a person where you have to represent at the end a lot of information with such as a question of processing the input file valve file so a good way of testing this the system is to evaluating if the input and output file are the same and as as as i will show you it's almost the same so thank you for for watching this demo and this is a the end of of my project thank you very much as bad as I told you my name is Adrian Romero well thank you very much babe
