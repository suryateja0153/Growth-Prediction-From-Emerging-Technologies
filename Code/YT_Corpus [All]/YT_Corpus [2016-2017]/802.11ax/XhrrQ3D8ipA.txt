 sighs or wireless access points have always exceeded expectations and this one is no different today we have the W a/c 610 three di 11 AC jewel radio Wi-Fi access point with dual optimized antenna and we're going to look at it now sighs we'll say this the industry slimmest and first access point that can be mounted on ceilings and walls without compromising wireless performance so let's get to the unboxing and see it in action as usual unboxing it is very simple and easy to access every component first to find the installation manual which tells you in depth everything you need to know and then we find the access point itself taking it out of the box first thing I notice is the slim and lightweight design a bit in comparison to most other access points which is fantastic for mounting it anywhere underneath the access point we found the mounting plate and the screws one thing to mention is that it doesn't come with the power over ethernet adapter so you would need to buy one separately size will state that position is one of the most important factors when it comes to access point placement as it determines the performance most wireless access points today a design for a single method of installation which is what makes this one stand out from the crowd when they're placed in a way other than what they're designed for signal strength is often compromised using external antennas along with extra configurations might help but that also means extra cost this access point is designed to overcome these limitations thanks to its jaw optimized antenna which enables the antenna settings to be adjusted according to the way it's installed whether it be a ceiling or on a wall switch modes with one click on the access point all with the easy-to-use web user interface and you're good to go as this premium access point will be used primarily for companies with a lot of devices such as schools we decided to test most of the devices we have between three of us to test its performance straight after installation we tested 15 devices of which all with different size and with a different spec and streamed YouTube videos from them for about 15 minutes I did notice a bit of buffering on a couple of devices such as the surface pro 4 when it initially starts streaming but after the first 5 minutes they all seemed to string perfectly with no issues whatsoever all in all I'm very impressed with this product and would highly recommend this on first impressions that's all for the Starzl wireless access point review make sure to subscribe if you enjoy and let us know what videos you'd like to see thank you
