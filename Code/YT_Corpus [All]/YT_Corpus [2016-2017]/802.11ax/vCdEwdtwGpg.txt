 hi guys it's mike here I've just came across some interesting news regarding my pain ads who daily owner has implemented some changes to the program which has asked some questions from members as to why these changes have actually been implemented in myself suddenly I myself was a lil bit concerned as to why they were introduced so quickly but what I have here is a interviewed carried out probably about an hour ago with my colleague cliffy broom was actually interviewed who dey about this and why the changes have actually been implemented Oh day has gone into ice or loads of questions put forward by members and the artists them all and stacey's reasons for doing it or looking at the interview I can understand why he's done them now basically it's to preserve the longevity of my pain ads and and we're very lucky to have an owner who actually acts quickly when it comes to instances like this so here's the video with Cathy it's very informative I hope you take a lot away from this you're beginning a lot of value with this video and I hope you enjoy and here it is okay guys okay ladies and gentlemen thank you for watching this special hang out tonight regarding our new membership requirements from my paying x and today is the first of September 2016 and this is special hang out and look who we got here we've got the owner mood eh naara who dey how are you today make sure you how are you traveling yeah I'm good I'm good okay great fantastic and check memon how are you mate I'm not first a fantastic muffin and there awesome awesome and last but not least 10 zeal how are you mate you've just just finished work Avenue or you're just woken up or here I just woken up our French work in the morning this work in the morning okay plus you're doing this bus all the other work you do so today to today folks we're going to discuss with the main key players in our business the owner and their main people running the business chef and tanzeel what all this means now to kick things off let's say get some myths out the way that withdrawals are still happening as we speak all withdrawals are still going ahead and people are being paid out as they're requesting money from the company says no no no problem with that the big video printer of this particular issue with the withdrawals are the membership no is forced to buy or paper membership if they choose to there's a free membership from level one and the five dollar ad packs up to one hundred dollar FX level two is a ten dollar per month at membership fee for the ten-dollar a packs up to 100 level three is the $25 ad packs is a thirty dollar membership per month and the level four is the fifty-dollar air packs and there's a sixty-dollar membership fee per month now bear in mind in mind my case personally i'm on level four my main goal for joining my paying ads is to strive to get to max out this business because i want to change my life from my situation where it is at the moment so what i have in front of me is a journey that i can get on and aim the maximum two hundred dollars per day US withdrawal as well as sustaining my active at PAX that gives me six thousand dollars is the maximal out currently per month if I can earn that and this is what I'm aiming for and the minimum of the membership fear sixty sixty dollars that 6,000 that's one percent is that affordable or not that is ridiculously affordable other programs out there right now that I know personally are charging way over that way way over that so this is very very portable even at the top level 60 dollars now I've seen a lot of people talking about the business today and the reaction there's a very very small my new amount and not quite sure about it the majority are saying it's what we have to do and who died I'm going to bring him on us in a second is going to explain exactly why the decisions were made from a corporate level because this is an online business that has to be corporately run and business decisions have to be made in the interest of the business for sustainability and the members for their sustainability within the business so the questions we got to ask obviously was it necessary to implement the members took fees what is a financial state of the business what does the benefit it brings to the business having a membership fee what does the benefit brings to the members are having a membership fee and how exactly all the membership levels work and will this affect our position in the market now there are some of the questions that new day is going to answer tonight and purse off I've got to thank all you three guys for the amount of hours and effort that you put into this business to grow from March 2015 where this is the 18th month now is it September 18th month of the business it's been fantastic ups downs and fantastic up to that and this is just like any business whether it be bricks and mortar or online so hats off to you guys are on the panel tonight all the members do appreciate the tireless work that you put in because you're focused that's I think a message we need to get across the other members all the members that must remain focused in these times about the aim of this company and get behind you three guys all the support staff that we have and we're only moving in one direction that's forward so without any further ado who'd i'd like to hand over to you to cover off some of those questions that i've asked and up to you night away you go yeah so thank you Cathy yeah firstly thanks for organizing this so that we could communicate our reasons behind why the memberships have been introduced this platform will give us to communicate with the members and thanks for the questions so I think firstly what I like to say is I like to apologize to the members for the very short notice on this member memberships mainly because of the reason that the membership so have been decided a bit lately and why do why do we want to start today's because it is the first of the month and members have an opportunity to buy the memberships today and it is very easy to remember the day of the renewal so that it looks so it looks very logical that suppose if you buy on the first of the month then you can be able to renew amid every month on the first day without forgetting about the renewal and things like that so that is the only reason that we wanted to start immediately there is no other reason and and and why we also were able to implement this with a short notice is because mainly it is not affecting two things which are very much essential for each member one thing is it is not restricting members to withdraw their earnings even without having any membership you are able to withdraw your winnings for example if you have about two hundred dollars in your account or anything 55 dollars or more as like what you are reading every day you are able to withdraw without the necessity to upgrade your account that is the first thing and the second thing is whether whether you upgrade or not your earnings will not stop for example if you have about 300 ad packs or 400 different aspects and if you are a free member even beyond today you will still receive the earnings for all those ad packs so your regular activity on the site which is a which is like withdrawing and earning on the site's does not stop without being upgraded as well so that is the reason that we were able to start the membership so even with a short notice I hope you understand the reason for this and and agree to what we have done okay I think the reason why why is it necessary to implement membership fee I think this is the key question that many people must be having see the membership is something that we have we have taught so many times I think even even in the last day or much I have thought about it then when I was launching on the side when I was having the plan of the program membership of memberships to do come into our know our view that whether we need to have it or whether we do not need to have it I think that is the kind of a simple question we in fact personally I never wanted to have the memberships and that is the reason that way we took so 18 months or 17 months to bring the memberships into existence at my paying ads and i have i have received I'm very surprised actually and i have received tens of or tends to at least few tens of requests from the members to implement memberships I have received several times people used to ask me why don't you put membership because that site is putting and this site is putting why don't you put membership so that financially the program will be stronger so you will have good reserves to share with the members so these were some of the requests that have made by the very loyal members so they have them there the serious members and genuine members and senior members of the revenue share programs I mean they just they just don't work at MP and they work at other programs and they give good criticism and good suggestions and things like that but we have never took up a seriously for the last 17 months so bringing up the memberships because we do not want to have extra burden on the members but but again as we have been seeing the happenings in the revenue share programs at the moment we can see that the we have to be we have to bring some changes to make the programs very to the next next level so for example i think the program which is undergoing some legal battle in us so you can see that in the report that file they have highlighted the fact that most of the revenue was coming from ad pack sales and not from other services and any legal authority and any legal authority when examining the programs they like to see that we are not just selling the ad packs but we are selling other services also equally and we are really getting the revenue from other services so this is what I was mentioning in my announcement about having a legal compliance worldwide for example sometimes so we are compliant we are compliant with our legal authorities we are registered in Singapore and we are compliant with the legal authorities but nevertheless the program has to generate revenue from other services in good in good amounts so that the program will not go into any issues when government authorities are examining the programs so that is where seen our efforts to generate additional revenue other than the ad packs is the revenue that is coming from the ad pack sales so I think I have outlined in my announcement that we have couple of ideas so we have been working on generating the sales definitely but I think we have to have a paradigm shift at this point of time and the shift is we are doing good in terms of the ad pack sales new members are joining every day and they're becoming paid members and they're buying the services they are buying the ad packs and promoting their businesses and things like that but apart from that we have to consistently generate the revenue from the other services and we have to increase that percentage a percentage more and more as we as we progress I think that is what you that is what the focus have to be and that focus was there from the beginning but what happens is that one has to realize the fact that for any advertising revenue share program to sustain on long-term it has to prepare a base it has to prepare a platform where in we have a good number of members on the on the platform who are logging in every day surfing ads viewing advertisements buying services and things like that and and also being the advertising revenue share program most of the members do by the ad packs with revenue sharing option so what we need to have is first we have to have the stability of the program in terms of the delivery of revenue sharing rewards for the for the members who are buying their services we have to create the platform where in the progress is happening on a steady basis for example it is not fluctuating in terms of the sales that is coming in and things like that for the sustainability and things like that so what we have done is for the last 16 17 months was we have created that platform where in we have a continuous flow of sales happening and members are being paid every day without missing and it is being advertised to the members heavily or in the proper manner and it has it has to make its name and it has to make some good Alexa ranking and it has to it has to create a brand and reputation this is something that we have to build up otherwise the sales of any service will not come just like that we have to build up the reputation for example people have to know that if we advertise something in my paying ads we will generate some leads we will generate some signups we will generate some sales and how that it is how that will will it happen it will happen because we have to build up the build up the reputation build up the members build up the trust and things like that so so that is what we have build up already we have reached the stage that it is being seen as if truster said it is being seen as a study study site and and and now what we are saying is we are putting more efforts in generating the revenue from other services because we have built our name already and we are able to venture over Rome our name and the traffic that we have and membership-based that we have to generate the sales in through other other services and secondly as well as i was telling we never wanted to bring the memberships but at this point of time we we have got convinced that though we do need to bring the memberships because of the fact that we have to generate the revenue from other services in a in a good percentage to have to to really generate the profits that we are sharing from other services so we got convinced that we have to generate that generate that sales so and we understand that when when when we charge the membership we will be able to attract the genuine members we will be able to attract the genuine members for example if or if am genuine member in the sense that who understands the business and and put forward he is a commitment in his time and his involvement and things like that so suppose if a member does not understand the business model correctly he may think that this company is just trying to bring the memberships to fill it fill their pockets I think it's the wrong wrong understanding because we have to generate the profits how we will be able to share the share the profits with you if we are not generating the profits from other services so only only genuine members will come into the company and any company to grow only genuine members when we have the more and more genuine members who understands the business business model well they can take the business to the next level and they can sustain it for long term so so we have got convinced that we need to bring the memberships to build up our revenue from the other services I think this is a requirement when we look at when we when we look at the when we look at how the government agencies look examine the advertising revenue sharing programs so suppose if we are generating a good revenue from other services good amount of money when compared with the ad pack sales we are very safe and we will be able to pass through any any examination that may come through from any agency so I think that is the necessity that has come and and that is why the membership fees are being brought in and we have thought through very carefully I will I will highlight this fact so many times have we have thought through very carefully see for example one thing is we have seen some of the sites implementing this process such that if you don't buy you will not be able to get the revenue sharing if you don't buy the membership you will not be able to get the revenue sharing if you don't buy the membership you will not be able to withdraw ever funds even if you are a entry level member also you need to buy the membership you can see the sights around there are still some sites which are going well and they are charging entry level membership so we have thought through everything and and planned the memberships such that they are affordable to everyone affordable to everyone see for example plan 1 you do not need for example if you want to buy the ad packs from plan 1 you do not need any membership so we don't have the entry level membership suppose if your new member joins in if he wants to test how the system works and things like that he is free to buy some ad packs to check and things like that so we do not charge for any membership for for the new new members and for from the level two so if you are moving to plan to add X means you have already bought a hundred effects in plan one which is total worth of five hundred dollars so only when you have passed through that when you want to purchase ad packs from higher levels wherein you want to see wherein you want to see the you you want to have the more earnings or more advertising services then you are being charged basically we were offering those services free earlier and today we are saying that we will be implementing a nominal fee I would say it is very nominal fee so from plan to if you want to buy the ad packs you you are asked to pay about to ten dollars a month suppose if you will in plan one and plan to which is five hundred dollars worth of at pacsun plan one and thousand dollars worth of ad packs in plan to which is about 1500 what the fat packs you have bought and what we are charging to you is to get to you there's those services ten dollars a month which is very very very affordable and if you if you want to move to the plan three ad packs we are asking you to pay a fee of thirty dollars so having thirty dollars monthly fee you you are able to buy from ad packs from plan three plan to and plan one and if you want to buy from plan for you by you you pay about sixty dollar a month so that you can be able to buy ad packs from a each and every level plan one plan to plan three and plan for I think these are very very affordable we will say so we have thought through and we wanted it to be simple and affordable to everyone and it will it shall not bring in any restrictions see for example today we have brought in the memberships and even if you don't buy the membership also you are able to withdraw your funds so whatever earnings that you have got you are able to withdraw there is no restriction and you are able to receive the earnings from the all active ad packs irrespective whether you have bought the membership or not so we have married tube we have made it very fair very affordable and very convenient so a lot of thought process went to so I I do not see any any anything to feel negative about the about the memberships so what is the next question is what is the financial state of the business yeah I think I think a lot of comments going on in the Facebook and things like that that probably they are running out of the running out of the farms and is where they are bringing in the membership fee and things like that and one thing you what you have to realize is that the revenue that were that membership fees brings in is very small not so big I would say if memberships bring lot of fee everybody every sight every other site which has the membership fee they will sustain for long term and they will they will be very bright it's not very correct as I have been as I have just outlined the purpose was not this so the purpose was not because we are having less sales or less reserves or something like that so the purpose was to generate the revenue from other services that was our sole purpose and and the financial state is we are good actually we are good and sales are happening every day we are showing we are having the study endings we are able to show the study endings because we are having the study sales and things like that every day new members are joining they are being converted to the paid members and and sales and happening and things like that so our financial state is a healthy that's what I can say and what benefit it brings to the business I think it is the same thing the benefit that it brings to the business is the revenue that comes from the memberships so that will be used one hundred percent to the revenue sharing with the members so one hundred percent we will use so very little fraction we might be using for the site maintenance wherever necessary and things like that because when we are growing big we will have more expensive systems the hosting and programmer charges and things like that and we do need to maintain some some teams to promote our program and look after the IT and look after the financial things and looking after the daily administration and things like that so certain fraction will be used for the site maintenance and the remaining hundred percent will be used for the revenue sharing so that is the benefit that it will bring in first benefit and the second benefit is as what we were saying it makes program more lays it because we have to show the revenue that we are sharing with the members we have to generate that revenue from other services so it makes the business more lays it does it matter to you definitely it will matter to you because for example when we are not running a legit program eventually we may have some some issues and if program has some issues and if program is not running you will not be able to enjoy the benefits that you are enjoying today so it brings these benefits to the business so one is in its some it supplements the revenue that we are getting in the business and the secondly it will make the program more lays it and what benefit it brings to the members so the benefit for the members is surely that the stability that comes from the program as i was telling when you have the more revenue adding to the revenue pool the program will be more study so suppose if for uniform some days we don't have the good sales that is coming then this revenue that is coming from the memberships will supplement supplement those revenue so that we will have the steady revenue sharing that is going on so that way it will help you to have a peace of mind and to have the stability of the program and to to receive the study study earnings as well as when it is helping the program to be more stable study Liz it you will enjoy the benefits so you are getting the benefit that way and how exactly all level membership works so as you can see in my announcement so we have four we made it so simple actually very simple we have for membership so I mean one is free membership everybody is a free member when he joins and the second one is Explorer membership so we have four different ad packs plan one which is like five dollar ad packs which you can buy up to 100 at backs and plan to his ten dollar ad packs have 200 plan 3 is $25 ad packs up two hundred and plan for is fifty dollar ad packs so having a Explorer membership will all of you to buy from plan one and plant okay and having a professional membership will allow you to buy from plan one plan to and plan three and having a 'light membership will allow you to buy from plan one and to plan three and plan for basically those are the memberships how it works so you have to plan a plan ahead in terms of what I am going to buy in this month for example if you see that you can you are able to buy from plan to probably you have to just buy the membership of first level which is a Explorer membership so that you can buy any time ad packs from plan one and plan to suppose if you see that though you might be needing to buy the ad packs from plan for let us say so you may want to buy the alight membership which is of sixty dollar per month so the term so that you will be able to buy from any level so if you want to buy from lower levels you do not need to buy if you are if you have what the alight membership you do not need to buy the Explorer and professional membership because the benefits are already included in the elite membership so I think this is how it works so different levels of memberships very pretty simple and if you have any doubts I mean you can contact us through support ticket so that we can clarify at any point of time and next thing is these ad memberships how to be bought only from payment processes I think that is the requirement that we have put in a lot of members were asking why not we be able to buy from the account balances I think that was one of the one of the question that was asked by the majority of the members it is it is for a simple reason we have put in from the payment processor first thing is it is the norm of the industry and most of the programs they require you to buy by the membership from payment processors one is it is the usual practice of the practice in the industry and the second thing is some some sites may have different different practices but it is mostly the norm of the industry and the second thing is whenever we are presenting our finances to the auditing people what they will look at it is the revenue is in terms of how your payment processors have saved sales okay that's what they look at it because that is what we have so when we are presenting for the auditing purposes the revenue is what we show in terms of what we are getting into our payment processors and what we are paying from our payment processors to the members or two or to our monthly expenses for the administration of the program and things like that for any consultant if we are paying so so whenever we present the present of the finances to the authority what we show you though what what we are getting into the payment processors and what we are spending from the payment processors so that way unless the membership fees come into the come to our payment processor it is not really being considered as the revenue to the program so that is for that reason that we have put in the purchases need to be done through the payment processor so if it all I mean it is it may be slight inconvenience suppose if you want to take out your via endings and then put in into the system as a membership fee but that is the way to go so we cannot put any relaxation on that aspect and that is the reason and we have to stick to that aspect and and the last question asked was a will this affect our position in the market definitely I mean in a good way one thing is a the revenue that comes through the membership memberships will add to our revenue pool so definitely we will be financially more stronger then then if we don't have it so the company will be financially stronger point number one and the point number two is our revenue from other services will increase so a fraction if as some percentage will increase suppose if we don't have the memberships that venue from other services is certain percentage and when we have the revenue from the memberships it is more than what we were having earlier so that way it will help the program to be a more legit program so that is so this way i think our our position in the market will become more stronger and and better than what we are today so definitely it will help so i think in a nutshell what we like to say is that the memberships are brought in for the goodness of the members definitely it is not to not to make money for our own purpose definitely not so once if you if you think through then you will realize this and you will appreciate what we are doing and only thing is i urge the members to remember only one thing the the the bottom line is when program runs well you will get benefit so you have to think through whatever comments that you are passing or whatever opinions that you are publishing you have to remember the fact that whether my opinion will help to the company or not or whether you want the company to help you or not whether you want the company to flourish or not I think you have to bring you have to put these questions into yourself before you put any comment or pass any opinion and things like that so and rest I will leave it to you how you want to build your accounts and we are able we are here to assist you to help you go to your journey yeah that's all Katie and I le i handed it to you you don't you thank you very much you die i'll summarize all your points right at the in there but you've covered all those questions at the members of us what i like to do is just our chef and tanzeel to add to that and give a bit of perspective from their part and the areas of the business that over half of what these membership fees will bring from their point of view and they're take as well a following on from ooo DICE far I'll start with You chef fun you're right in the thick of things with the support side of the business and the tickets in the the feel of the members coming in so what would you like to say to all those you know you do our hours and hours of dealing with people with their I guess their frustration through in a lot of cases unfortunately as lack of knowledge or lack of trying to learn the business what can you pass on to the members today no go ahead Oh first thing I want to tell kitty you know like how the they mentioned you know how this membership effect member I didn't understand who they clear mention clearly the hero is stopping anyone with dro revolution still going smoothly and I have a stop I don't understand how they affect them they saying or effectors I said so many comment really hurt you know when we try to do good things and the people think I remember things oh this is not good that's not good you know who they know what they're doing you know before you do anything I know that you know hitting 100 time on 110 thousand times believe me guys whatever we do believe me a few months ago actual every damn day shall we start membership Shelby's from membership list no shock let's do something you know less we do this and that you know after lack of this illegal side is better flows to start of membership for revenue a simple two things first we draw on no problem at all if you buy membership or not issue you can withdraw money perfect second things your revenue every auberly going smoothly no problem at all only they saying if you want to buy more packs more services then you buying membership is simple it's very simple and who give you this operation I don't think so anyone give that and second thing I want to tell guys you know people saying oh this program is struggling this and that right if the program struggling no they force people to buy membership the force no you have to buy if not then what we do we stop your revenue they saying clearly no we don't stop you guys if you know withdraw just make sure if you want to buy membership that's your choice no stop that not at all we are very clear there but some people I've seen who's doing too much noise believe me guys who have a very small type of packs you know I know how this works right put understand whoo-hoo car knowledge to this business definition have this world believe me guy they come towards a thing yeah this is very cheap you put this price sixty dollars like you mentioned kiti sixty dollars is only one person if you see if they did withdraw six thousand dollars a month am i right yeah yeah yeahs want to string this negative side I don't see anything negative I don't know why people think all this if not much people I'm very honest who understand the business they don't say anything they're very positive they come toward the I go so much message this morning till now and today as well I know how they very busy on these messages definitely like don't really know me and turn the disco this morning about this membership and he explained very well in our whatsapp group then some people they just you know start oh what's the point you have to buy membership you have to do this we are tomorrow when it turns will explain everything each in and out like a step one step two step three they understand now okay how the system work yeah right London am i right yeah yeah that's correct so basically they've been a lot of support from members a first of all thank you to everyone who supported us from this designer who been asking for it from quite a long time this decision is not financial driven is more of compliance driven we need to be very very clear on that so the finance side comes with it that you guys will benefit from every single membership what I so they clearly mention now that apart from fraction of amount everything is going to be shared with you so if you want the business to flourish if we want the business to succeed then what we need to do is we need to understand the business as a business person we need to start thinking as an online marketer what we do now is we got we got bigness who are still understanding the business how the revolution work how the online marketing world if we can start understanding exactly how r ebonique ever how an online marketer should act hi online marketer should market himself and the business then these small little things of expenses of the business or unknown and so if you working anywhere a nine-to-five job how much hard work you have to do everything is coming up give you the managers are your companies keep changing your contract just just losing a little bit there 10 0 just another dinner right near the signals this your signals just dropping out there tanzeel so that the sounds the sound is gone from me on portraitist with a minute just just put your hand up when you're ready to go again just go ahead another can hear you but ill yeah not no sound at all I'm afraid at the moment you're ya know now the unfortunately the signals dropped out from Tangier maybe you might log out and log back in and maybe that air that might create some new sound from him but I can cover off basically what what he said dude I and chef said in the hope you join us in a minute but uh the members are in a learning process see you back now at Anzio yeah yeah I'm back like I go hit me when you can do what just recap what you're saying there regarding that the members learning the business and some of them are starting out some of some are experienced but there are a small percentage that I'm not quite sure in that they're a little bit unsure what what this means can you cover up all the neck ways so yeah I was talking about it it's about having understanding of the business so let's say for example if you're working in nine-to-five job what happens is the companies keep changing keep evolving the reason why the changing is that if the company will carry on working if the company will carry on making the reveal you then they will be able to pay the wages but then they will be able to pay all the expenses which they occur while doing the business online business is no difference to any ordinary business it's similar to as that you are working in a job only difference is that you have to only do tiny amount of work for bigger rewards though yeah what what need to understand is if we making any changes what is the reason behind these changes either these changes being fair either these changes are going to benefit the business in long term or not so for example in this this membership free now we are not stopping anyone who is currently doing the business who are currently having ad packs from level 1 to level 4 as a day and chef clearly said withdrawals are going withdrawals are happening right now there is no single withdrawal which is not who process if it is within 48 hours time period and it's going to continue to happen that cause we are in a good financial state so put your business hat on try to understand the business as an online marketer and think about as a normal business of where you work or you have seen around you it is quite normal to have such fees to make sure we are compliant to legal authorities we are bringing some revenue to the business which can be shared among you so it is a very very very positive step forward in the company that we are in a stage now where we can say we are a brand which is well known in online revolution industry if you ask anyone who's my paying it they're going to talk about trust they're gonna talk about dedication they're gonna talk about toughness because what happens is that we always if there is any problem we always come back with a solution which nobody ever have tried as I mentioned chef mentioned that every division share most of them were they tried tried in passes membership fee is essential you can't make withdrawals because they were financially struggling but this is not the case with my fingers we are financially stable and we are saying yet membership freeze is necessary for compliance part and at the same time if you can't afford it or if you don't want to pay you continue to withdraw your earnings as a form of reward for your work what you're doing in the website and then you benefit from it so I have only one thing to say thank you very much for all the professionals and all the senior members who have given us very very positive feedback and I will welcome those who are still learning the ABC about the business to think about it again read the information which is out there speak to the people who are supporting this decision why they are supporting this decision and come on board only way towards success is that everybody is on board and they are doing their part as the owner who they Nora is doing his part as a sport executive chef is doing his part as Edmonds a Facebook group you guys are doing a brilliant job so if everyone we have the same work ethics we there is no way there is no stopping of this business to be going where it's heading and I can see great success in the business because what we what we achieved in last 18 months is just amazing and phenomenal so I will pass on back to you if you have any question which is left out and we can address that now so members can see this hangout and benefit from it testing is a great summary 10-0 so just want to cover off before do that very important to what we've been talking about is exactly what mood ice touched on 18 months into the business why did he start an online advertising business like my paying ads to the benefit of members members of our successful he would be successful writing his business let's look at the numbers I'll just updated my screen here we've hit a hundred and seventy five thousand people 175,000 173 while we mean talking another ten people of join well we've been talking guys we've hit 11 million dollars in payouts 11 million dollars in payouts and as chat and tanzeel and Udo said the payouts withdrawals are continuing I've just made one because I'm at level four so I need to have I'm moving $45 into my pazar account of what twenty dollars seen there there'll be sixty dollars then I'll make my payment for my membership from my back office I'll go and pay my membership Anna Keys done a video today the facebook group of how to do it it's just like purchasing direct putting funds into the account or using that process of type button' it's all set up in the back office there it takes about a minute to do but you must have funds ready to go in your payment processor to move them into paper your membership the bottom line is what type of people do we want in my paying answer we want people to strive to be successful learn as you earn learn about being an online marketer because what is the opp what is the other option stay in a nine to five business work for the boss at the top of the tree and struggle to pay your house your home whatever you have to cover up to live your life with you and your family here is an opportunity created by this man who they nara with the very very best of intentions to do an honest reliable will run professionally run business that is striving to be better on a daily basis every business on this planet will have issues as it grows sometimes it's called growing pains in other other areas of business when you grow exponentially you attractive attention of not only your competitors but other authorities wondering why is this business so successful we'll take a look at how they're running their business now to cover off on that this is exactly what new day is done we are compliant and we're changing our model to adjust in the just so that allows so that compliance to be taken care of as we grow so if you're striving like I am it's what you should be if you're joining a business like this that the opportunity to earn potential from revenue share and your advertising of six thousand dollars per month and there's a sixty-dollar membership fee of that's one percent I'll take that any day now is another tip and maybe you can come in tanzeel on this or chef that some members are asking if I started and I put fifty dollars what $55 a packs and I've got 25 I've got 10 of those and then about some ten dollar ones now got four fifty dollar ones do I have to pay the sixty dollar membership fee well my response to that would be just pay maybe that for the ten dollar ones use the revenue share of the 25 and the 50s to fill up the five to fill up the tends to the lowest levels first one two three and four as you go along because they're all returning one hundred and twenty percent profit share would that be right would you agree with that 10-0 I'll go with you first you know so basically what we want members to decided what exactly their service requirement is so you're well known traffic provider so if they think level one is right for them and the level one ad packs will provide them the quality of service they need they should buy that if they think the need level to miss means more credit more traffic exchange credit so they should go for that from revenue share point of view they should only treat this as a reward and then it is a very healthy reward so when they're looking at this what they should be doing is basically working out by themselves it's simple maths so if they have level they bought level 4 add facts which is returning them every ad pack returns having the same revenue reward as normal so they should be looking at what suits them best as a marketing product and they should be buying that so let's say if they have level 4 so they can then use you know level 1 and level 2 and they can only buy a ten-dollar membership or thirty dollar membership so it depends totally on their needs so we are not forcing anyone saying that not you have to have this level you have to have this level or you have to have membership to make withdrawals or you have to have membership to the carry on receiving revenue so if your own twice what suits them best as an online marketer to utilize the services best okay fantastic would you like to add anything they really died that you're happy with that description just your micro files off at the moment yeah he's not it all right now hit I think if he put it rightly so I think members members how to decide so they want to they want to see that the which level of fat packs that they are going to buy suppose if they have the ad packs in level 3 11 for you had few ad packs and if they are not going to continue buying from those levels they do not need to buy the higher level member have a higher level of membership and for example if they are like filling up plan one finished and plan to going to finish here in few days time then they may want to buy a bit higher level of membership so that they get they have the freedom to always buy from the next level of plan I only suggest the members is don't be too hard this time first time you just test it what membership is more affordable to you I mean sometimes a slight mistake can happen for example if you think that ok I have gotten membership actually i could have bought the other membership and things like that but this is first time I mean this is not the end of it uses so this is this is the first time that we are introducing and a long way to go and you just test test and the check so telling you then you can better take a better decision next time so that's what I I see it is yeah okay share you wanna ba and anything before we finish off you just coming up to bear and i are now so i think we didn't totally covered everything my small advisor guys you know it's example members completed up one and now at the level two if they go 60 plus or 70 packs I really want there before they buy our membership they look twice reason being what happened if they only 20 left in their level tube they can complete it with between five or 10 or 15 days maximum we don't want Imperial one they paid double membership what happened now if they complete the level two they have to buy level three membership now they only pay ten dollars can days ago now they paying thirty dollars again to buy level three it's better guys make sure before you do just look at your account and level one complete if the level to you go more than 60 or 70 packs my advisor person advice to go for level three we don't want guys you pay double membership to towards you know this is my my percentage wise guys am i right oh they yeah yeah yes like that alright guys well we've covered up just about everything there is on the mend Michelle think that's a fantastic hang out I really appreciate all three of you guys take the time to explain to the members it's good to have the whole of you three guys and myself all together and we want to get all the the rest of the admins on to the next couple of weeks so we've got a big massive panel of everyone who's helping this great business and let's get let's focus folks on the real picture my paying ads as 175,000 members were paid out 11 million this is to strengthen the business and make us compliant if you don't wish to pay the membership just run level 1 and use the proper chair and make you withdrawals which are happening as they come what do they want is focused positive members who believe in the company and we've created a brand now so all we're doing is moving forward they'd love you to be on board and learn as you earn with us and here's a bit of a send out a bit of it a call out if you like to all
