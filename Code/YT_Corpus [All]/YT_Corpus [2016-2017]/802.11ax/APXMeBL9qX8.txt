Chuck who is of course the aruba networks you work in the CTO office you work on really grandiose wonderful wireless designs and theory improving things out in the real world and you know comparing new technologies old technologies and you know trying to prove out that these things actually exist in reality yeah right and yeah and yeah and that's okay we're supposed to be quiet and you're supposed to listen so um you know I I think as we have an opportunity to to sit you in the seat and put you on the spot as it were I think that uh you know the first question that comes to my mind when we have an opportunity to sit down like this and actually have a chat with you that sort of one on two to the three or whatever your particular vice is on my Raja there any exactly I ménage à how many is that like a whole lot right I don't know yeah you know really the first question that comes to my mind is what about Twitter okay I'm kidding a joke a joke obviously doesn't want to number two question number two we should just started a White House hydrogen ISIL I I just don't have time that's no that's the thing and that's fair you can barely make it through my inbox so there's no time at the end of the day that's a perfectly fair approach well then how do we alert you when the podcast gets posted or the report we email you old-fashioned email a telegram i watch the site to subscribe so I know I'll get this guy anyone out comes out who isn't subscribed needs to go subscribe yeah and if you don't then shame on you so um Chuck says you can I catch you every Edition every Edition even last one where I where I made a very very snide remark about a ribbon i know god bless okay that's the last one but the one that double check when so don't I might come back oh yeah that's fair okay thanks I was your son so you guys have done a lot of work especially regarding su mano vs mu myo right can you recap briefly for those of us in I'll be surprised if he can do this under the influence um what your general conversation was about you know emiem I'm reverses su my MO and really was there anything that you didn't present today that you think is top yeah so that the Sun bite is a mu rocks right and i think the data that I've presented a week you know BAM you is very new it's exciting as i said earlier right at this time last year we were just dealing with the first we're coming under the first year of wave 1 deployments and had a lot of interesting data out of that now we're just starting to ship wave 2 and a lot of questions about how does it really perform that you know mu has a lot of promise but not a lot of information has been you know made public yet because the vendors it's very new right and we're just beginning to test it and allowed so we had a chance in my lab to sit down and really kind of learn how to drive the car towards the end of last year and what we saw is very exciting so it feels like a lot like a marketing speaking I think to a lot of people in the room especially since we've gone from you know b2g when everybody promised you know whopping 50 format the mg to end where we wrote it in multiple ways that weren't technically ways or you know once make sure stream to spacious room three right right yeah and you know what sort of a lot of us have been through this lather rinse repeat you know we've been there we've done that we've seen the marketing promises we've seen you know we've seen we've been through this yeah a lot so this feels different than also those so hopefully I mean I think there was enough quantifiable content in my presentation actually you know not just you such as bullets on a slide right we looked at charts we looked at data that shows that really we're seeing multiples anywhere from depending on the scenario 1.6 to 2.5 2.6 throughput and we looked at some of the reasons why at a technical level right exactly how it works and we looked at some of the issue challenges right how do you do packet capture right there's a lot of the tools need to catch up right but net net you know is somebody that builds a lot of high density environments you know as an architect I'm very interested in how this stuff is ultimately going to perform because the I density networks are the highest high wire act there is right and and what we see has really got me feeling like the technology is going to add as i said earlier ready to bonus right to the exam we have mostly su clients today so it's going to preserve that level of performance and then as mu clients come into the space in fact a lot of environments potentially there's significant gains on top so i think it's in that win so from a tools perspective of course you know a lot of folks in the audience are you know cwap or how many people here attended the cwap course that was previous in the week not a 101 thank God at least one yes so you know the 15 of 17 it was about 15 total yeah yeah oh oh very nice very nice and and I'm surprised you're still standing because that content is is brain melting of course depending used to be for sure right but but again we see this every time there's a new iteration we have a we have you know vendors driving the market then of course we have 20 vendors plane to catch up I mean we just now saw you know the wild packet Omni peaks folks uh you know talking about the other two of an AC adapter that they can do that but right up you know ap's offensive what's your what's your take on you know the general lag of you know we have consumer first and we have enterprise then we have tools each other that's it that seems backwards well in between the tools and the enterprise you have the clients and the client drivers right as somebody pointed out I saw some pretty funny illustrations today the pic the car flying into the right the stand on the side of the road it was a taco stand for bad drivers for his well Larry's so having a teach at each of these big generational changes right we've had a catch up on the clients and very differently we're gonna have the same thing with wave to you we saw it with way one we saw it within and three spatial streams tues baby I exactly and this is a this is something that you know the client vendors have to work with the enterprise and consumer vendors on right so cuz we're all in it together right I Triple E is able to take a set of ideas only so far and then it turns clearly it because what it becomes with what what in the atty Tripoli is called the implementation issue right so then it's up the vendors to sort of figure out how to optimize on how to make it work well so we're going to go through that phase two and somewhere along the line the tools we'll catch up in the process of helping to make all the rest of it work well you have chuck in the seat realize you have waiting in the wings no I have a question Bob you know with with n we we never saw the maximum available spatial streams because what kind is ever going to do that yep are we gonna see a facial stream access point now that because then we can serve seven single spatial stream clients so great question well we could sort of eight attention so that's a big question is what's going to come next is it so what's after four by four the four by four products are here right we're going to see a lot of those either roll out or you know in the consumer space that are already available now so do we go to six by six do we go eight by eight very definitely the short answer is you're gonna see any eight by eight what about stuffing myself hmm no you're gonna give it a skipper gonna come no no no it is you're gonna go six-day drink more yeah so that point needs so you're saying we can survey finds and wats don't we need one registering for diversity not necessarily depends on the coding and right other other elements is 50 it may be true at four mu wherever mu and su are potentially different so like right now right with the VAP sub so you know with the one that we're shipping right now it's four streams of su and three streams of engine right yeah so you might see the same phenomenon with the a phase I I don't have no idea right we're not that far guy so so would that be like anybody by seven hey 5725 that would be is omega yeah with the math I went through earlier that would be an eight by a colon a colon seven colon for 12 40 to 60 42 uh-huh yeah hi um yeah do we while we have joking the hot seat does anybody in the audience i have a question they would like to come up here in the seat and make love to the mic and ask him so that's actually the first time i've heard of a vendor answer that question but i've heard it said a few times before and I wasn't really sure speak up that we were doing eight by eight or they that we were going in by eight and that you know it's almost assuredly going to happen so so and if it doesn't happen in wave to right so wait one was basically a continuation event right right in a very real sense right so there was there were no for stream and devices the first forestry became AC wave one it tomorrow presenting on ax right and ax actually grows it to eight spatial streams of em use right with with eight stations in the group so it could be that again I said we don't know if it's going to be six by six or eight by eight just yet we're working with our partners to sort of figure that out but if we didn't get to eight by eight in wave 2 sorry then axs country ham is almost 50 ax is almost certainly going to bring us there alright so in general I think the trend is going to be two more and more spatial streams because that's partly how we address the capacity right remotely in the market yet with that it didn't make sense because we really weren't going to see any clients that could take full use of it but but now there's no reason you know a room full of iphones can use yeah so so closing thoughts for Chuck before we totally run the singing of the ground what do ya oh you need to move it to the hot seat make a little my grandest grip oh you could just grab it and make love to it that way yet for sure so how does the group part different different forms of singles single straight quarters I'm sorry for my brother's like four foot like a I colon 88 yeah how's the poor distributing for multi-user yes so that's the maximum number of stations that can be addressed at one time in a transmission okay so in an mu perspective exactly so in other words the the AC wave to the wave 2 component the standard contemplates a world where an eight stream access point is talking to 42 stream stations now it could also be 24 stream stations but realistically we're not going to see four strings so excited it'll never be able to do six seven or eight single stream exactly so in practice it'll be to stream phones each ap could in potentially talk to four at the same time hey hey oh really well hang on make love to the stick you gotta either stand up and walk to it or bring it to you what were the other hey idiots working here Teddy bad flight up you don you can just speak up I look at yo you can yes whisper into it dear sweet nothing no so here's a question oh excuse me is like AC when AC first came out a lot of this you know we didn't know how much value you would get out of AC assistance we started learning about the issue with the channels the channel sighs and we probably never really use practically email in 160 or anywhere you're talking about oh really good um well I hire you know as you know I read education see us obviously in case like that so so in that scene when the same you know in that same line of reasoning we said well we could you know a well-designed end network was going to is going to get you where you need to be so bring that to my mom what are the is it worth starting off with wave one we do with room i'mma or should we hold all of it um where you what types of environments that you are you most going to see the benefit where it's worth saying I'm going to pay the extra money now for this yep even though I know just like what they see the clients are still we're like 12 months away before we start seeing any appreciable type of numbers absolutely so so I mean it's going to be it would mean what's always been true in the in the IT space is different kinds of customers have different appreciations or different risk tolerance levels right so you have early adopters through the very conservative types of customers and generally speaking the early adopters were the first to ba they were the first thing on end so they were the first in on a see if for no other reason than it had been four or five years since they deployed in and it was time for a cycle right and so I think we're going to see pretty much the same timing so I wouldn't I wouldn't slow down on any of it I would say the customer is going to gravitate to you know that the sort of early adopters going to gravitate to wave to and want to have the buy more by now by faster I wouldn't I wouldn't I wouldn't delay right i buy the thing that's most comfortable for your use case for you guys my message today was having had a chance to actually take the car out for a spin for the first time because there's so much that's different in mu and we've covered some of that in a session and not really knowing what to expect I was I was really blown away by the what we actually saw lab conditions right a whole bunch of caveats and so on but very promising from my perspective for there's no reason not to deploy it now was was basically the message that i gave i suppose they see where you'd deal with you know interoperability issues drivers yeah all sorts of yeah yeah so you'll see more value out of hate you my phone if you quit over if you see if the laser there's a question 10 yeah you gonna does is some gentleman elevator he's got a buddy he's got to buy around actually if you get there for a second question of course is free waited to hear what you say there's more just probably you're gonna slip water now you have a marketing than have an EC because McCann moving in large environment you can't really take advantage of what AC only has an offer no no no I'm not I'm not saying that at all I'm saying bye by the by the wave that's most appropriate for whatever purchasing strategy a particular company has writer particular customer environment has and then in addition I'm saying there's no reason not to wait for the early adopters who are wondering because the products have only been shipping for eons yeah right you know there's there's no reason not to proceed if you're interested in it certainly I would do the proof of concept I would try it out I would kick the tires you see we can do application absolutely with the caveat as i said in the session that you know as with each major new generation right the multi-user model is a big change in the phi right there is a lot that's new the silicon vendors have done a huge amount of work on this site rip believes obviously done a huge amount of work on it we're partnered with them the algorithms right now are really conservative about mu grouping and data rates and so on these are all going to get better but the quality of the early results tells me that like after we it's good now and after week after we really get comfortable optimizing it's going to be even better okay I'm really screwing the audio you're okay sorry you don't even have a earphones on it is there a you're slamming easier okay sorry okay I can just like your director seven well okay all right so Randy bonding okay so my question to you chuck is coming from my experience which is background a large customer environment yep new code upgrades first releases bugs always are my risk and concern for stability yep through your initial testing did you uncover any bugs and talk about today found that yep not actually with your product what's your what's your take on drivers wizard there is some initial this early on with a link to my living infrastructure side or from the client side you see the biggest list for stability above yeah so no huge bugs in the code at at at this point in time I'm more interested in some of the optimizations around sort of top line performance or antidote yeah and and you know we were again my interest is high density right so I want to see what I when I when I look at the curve you know the throughput Kerr versus the number of stations I want to see very high out to 50 100 150 clients and I guess what I'll get ya you see any quirky behavior during your test they cause you to stop test but start it like some clients we only dropped off or it was really bad airtime fairness clients and some got stuff and other vision plate with the grouping algorithm for something right I'm know surprisingly little awry me I was totally prepared for that and as you saw we took it outdoors right so like if it we got to working indoors and and and I really didn't have any expectation when we we just picked up the test bed and we moved it in the parking lot right and if it was going to crap anywhere right that that for sure we would have seen it and we got almost as you saw almost very similar numbers to what we saw in doors just a just a little bit lower so none of this is to say that there aren't going to be interrupt issues with some of the clients what and who doesn't prefer the parking lot as a place to think I'm sorry it's a beautiful beautiful day in california in january right ok so he's gonna a jackal ask well what we're gonna with you yes are all drinking at one way I really want to share the hot seat with those of you only meant to first effects on any on at IC class and observed adverse effect on on AC clan certain nineties so we didn't we didn't test naughty see clients that again at this point we're trying to keep the variables under test very small right or we're looking at just very good specific things exactly a service we haven't done the mix testing yeah vishal just thanks for having us alright so you know are here martin wants to follow that yes oh like leave a from extreme why I didn't so Mike leap from extreme networks is gonna join us for a moment me up I so please if you'd be so kind she's my god hey
