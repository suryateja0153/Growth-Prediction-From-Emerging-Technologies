 hello everyone it will be a presentation about the future of wireless network we will start from today technology and we will move forward to feature and 50 layer years later maybe if you need a connection to the Mars so what will be the solution so it's will be my presentation let's move ahead first of all we start from today's technology and we have to understand where is the data rates come from that's the place that the most people think the data rates come from from That Bird some engineers and that bird and data rates is pop up to your face but we want to open the technology for you then it can understand the basis of the technology and very very data it's come from it's a simple formula but we have to understand the part of it that's that then the radio sells you the data rate is 54 megabits per second these parts involved to that name to that number so let's open it up and see what are they first of all let's start with carrier what is the carrier if you want to ship something to other country maybe you need a carrier something like a container 20-foot 40-foot if you use a bigger container you can send more accessories more good it's exactly the same here if you use a bigger subcarrier be your carrier you you can transmit more data what is the carrier you choose that when you selecting a channel you choose for example this channel 5 180 that you are going to choose a channel but when you choose a channel you choose the lower and higher frequency that you are using here we are using to an image a channel to nema Gertz channels if it double the channel width we will have make double the true put when we have a closer look to that carrier when we open it up and make a closer look with a spectrum analyzer you'll see it's not flat it's bouncing here what is that why it's not flat but why it's bouncing they are speaking with that bounces in OFDM technology it is please the carrier into sub carriers small carriers just like small boxes inside a container and each box contains our data so the subcarriers can deliver our data and use the small small channels for example in a and G a standard we are using 52 subcarriers four of them is pilot carriers is just for sinking and the rest of the sub carriers can carry us data to improve the efficiency to improve to make it better to make your higher speed what the engineers did is giving you some more sub carriers to make it more efficient for example here for a and G standard we are using 52 sub carriers but for in a standard we start using 56 subcarriers we have few more sub carriers when we merge channels then we use bigger channels what happened we can use even more sub carriers here is 56 sub carriers but here we can use 57 sub carriers and merge them together so we can have better performance we can have better efficiency and then they switch to 80 megahertz instead of 114 sub carriers in for tea makers channel we can use 121 subcarriers in 80 megahertz channel ok in each 40 megahertz we can use 121 so we can use more frequency and more sub carriers so we can improve the efficiency we have a bigger channel bigger container and we have more boxes inside the container what we have is better efficiency so we can have a higher tripit ok inside that container we we are going to use something cold modulation it's not hard as it looks it's easier how it works i'm i'm going to start modulating some signals for you the purpose of model a Shin is sending 0 & 1 I want to say 0 & 1 but 0 & 1 as you know is digital so we are using the analog signals to send you 0 & 1 it just going to make it very simple simple example I want to use my voice as a frequency modulation to transmit hero and one we can agree to put zero on this voice okay and put one on that voice oh okay bye I'm start transmitting 0 and 10 it's very simple you can change it to 0 and 1 and V I did the modulation and you did the demodulating okay you did the demodulation and you can write down 0 0 1 that's how it works and that's this much simple in today words technology the engineers using different type of methods for this sort of modulation they use frequencies they use faz they use amplitude the emerging them together to giving you a higher tripit ok let's make example for amplitude modulation I'm going to transmitting 0 and 1 again but what I'm going to do is change the agreement to this one if I say with a minimum volume it means 0 and with a higher volume oh the same frequency it means 1 i'm transmitting a modulating and transmitting oh I'd say 001 but I'm only use the amplitude I'm using my voice volume to transmitting signal today they mix the fast and the amplitude together to giving us the qualms modulation it's very useful because we can have 16 clam up to 1024 1024 clam or even higher so it giving us more to put that's 16 clam that's what you're familiar 64 km and what we are using at AC standard 256 clam if we use 16 clam we can transmit four beats in one transmission but if we use 256 square in one transmission I can transfer a bite so i can double my speed if instead of 16 qualms i can use 256 clam ok that's the modulation let's go to the next part when you are watching satellite TV if some error happen inside the transmission you cannot ask the provider company to retransmit the signal to you because you are the only user on the broadcast channel that they'll have some problem to receiving that part of the movie okay for make it usable what they did they sending you back up instead of 10 or 1 some of them sending you one back up for each beats so you have a parity beat to make sure that you receiving a good quality okay it decrease your speed but it's give you reliability how it works let's make a very simple question here for forward error correction instead of 10 here we transmit three zeros the system look at the zeros if it received one error for example 0 0 and one error it changed the 0 to 1 the system can understand 0 because there is more zeros so we are transmitting back up so if any error happened during the transmission you can fix it on the move so that's forward error correction with higher forward error correction we can use higher speeds so that's why in the latest technology they use 5 / 6 it means 5 data and one parity 5+1 it goes to 6 I messed up okay and one parity so instead of 1 / 2 you're using 5 is like six so we can have a higher data rate okay what what's next they improved all they can do in AC standard and the 433 point tree come up from that calculation they improve the efficiency of the carrier by using more sub carriers and make it work better they extend the channel 280 megahertz they use 256 qualms instead of 64 km and they use 5 slide 6 f ec the result was 433 point 3 megabits per second okay what we can do next what we can do more the use MIMO or my mo depends on who asked to double the speed so it's so familiar when you go to a 3d movie when you're watching a treaty movie the cinema needs to transmit two images one image for your left eye and one image for your right eye we are doing the same by using different polarities inside our antennas in a mimo technology especially in outdoor applications to transmit two different images to different data into one receiver or multiple receivers by using different chains so it can make W speed instead of 1 433 point tree you can make it double and it can have 866 any more applications what's happened to you we don't have always a direct signal especially in five gigahertz applications the signals is always bouncing around and the time of flights of signal is going straight ahead is not a call to a signal that bouncing to the vol and receive by the user or client you have so in this case we can use something we call diversity special multiplexing to double the speed one signals coming from this way transmit half of the data and one signals coming from here transmitting the other half so that's why the tree by tree MIMO works in more and the very close very not so far outdoor radio applications but we are moving to point to point long range applications the tree by tree MIMO is not working anymore that's because of that this special multiplexing ok for indoor applications the boat antennas is in the same direction and it works not not so bad but for outdoor application you need a very good cross polarization between two chains to giving you a high tripit so that's the first generation that we already know and we already worked with what is the next generation we are waiting for the wave to AC standard and we hope that my critics release it soon as the others or even sooner that's the MU MIMO what is it before understanding the mu-mimo we are going to learn about being forming what is the beamforming if we use an o neon sauna uh for here for example everyone in this conference room will have the same signal because it's an omni antenna and it spread signal all the way echo Lee but if you if you use to on Turner's at the same time just if you play that game in the swimming pool you can see that if you put your finger into the water you'll have a wave if you put two fingers at the water at the same time the waves splash to each other clash to each other and what they make is some constructive combination just like two waves just crash to each other and amplify each other and some waves make it deconstructive waves and what is it look like if they clashed each other in a constructive wave that boat waves can amplify each other and you will have a more powerful signal if they have it lunda to 100 degrees different fast they eat each other we have to raves one just like that and one just like that and then the add them together they eat each other and you will have zero signal we call that deconstructive the engineers use that fact to make different patterns okay by using the constructive we can make a direction we can redirect the wave to that lay that we have audience and just don't send any signal to hear because we don't have any audience and we don't want to make interference for the next room if we can do that by computer by computer by chip we can make different patterns like that if he hears to 110 is we will have these patterns we can use it for provide internet to hear and at the next time we can use another beam to send internet to that room if you use tree antennas we can use that technology to make more patterns and we can have more clients one client direct the head and one client in one bay it's not new they already use that but what is new here inside mu-mimo they made some modifications I want to make it dynamic I want to make it automatically change the pattern one transmission here one transmission there okay how I can understand where is my client okay I cannot see the classroom I cannot see the conference room how I can understand I have a client here and i have a client there then I want to transmit some signal here I can use this beam then I want to transmit a signal there I can use a another beam like that we have two modes one of them is implicit mode I can listen I can hear my client voice from that part so when I want to transmit a signal I can transmit the signal to there and another feedback another a signal from there so it can repeat that signal to there so that's how the implicit mode but there is a problem here sometimes when the client from this side sits sending me a signal it bouncing there and I will receive the signal from my back but when I'm sending the signal to there it's not bouncing very well so I make a mistake to finding my clients they improve that by explicit mode so when I'm sending a signal I'm waiting for my client feedback then I'm sending a signal here the clients send me good job it's a good signal okay so by explicit mode it's more expire but the problem is my client if don't support the explicit mode I cannot use that for them please sit mode I don't need any special client but for thick explicit mode I need some client can understand the fit back and send me the feedbacks so maybe it's not working very well it also gives us more gain because we are using antenna arrays so we can combine some waves and it gives us more powerful beam so instead of simple Omni to DB I then we are using this much code we can reach higher gains up to 12 DB I if we are using four by four me mo ok so it can even improve our gain and it can give us the high range because we can have it higher gain antenna what is happen in mu-mimo by using the beamforming at the same time using splitting channel instead of having a hub just like hops hop inside our network we are using a switch when we are using a hobby inside our network what's happened we can only have one speaker at the same time because we will have a collision inside the violence that for today's we can only transmit or receive signal if some of our users start watching a movie the other clients having the lower speed and they should wait for the packet going to that client but in mu-mimo what is happening the access point can split the channel also the beams and at the same time I can transmit a video here and I can transmit data here and I can transmit voice over IP there so by using that technology instead of one access point it looked like I'm using for access points ok at the same time it's really nice we are waiting for the new products is coming that's how it works it's believed the channel and also use different beams for each user one beam for here and one beam for here so we can even reuse the frequency it's a good idea how it boom how it can it be forming how it make beamforming it use something called staring matrix verum transmit a signal at the same time from these two antennas what's happening I'm sending a signal to that direction but if first I'm transmit a signal and with a short delay I'm sent another signal from here I can have these staring matrix first of all I'm transmit a signal from here and Vida no no second difference I'm start a signal from here instead of sending a signal into the front I can sending a signal to the left because first times I start making avail here and I start making a very after that here they shift the beam to this side so inside the mu-mimo the system will use the stirring matrix for learn the clients and sings send the signal to another direction by using that you can use for clients or tree clients at the same time to channel for one client one channel 4 11 channel 41 so it makes us happy ok is there any more improvements possible here it is not because if we for example change the 256 clam to 100 1024 clam we can have 24 person or speed but the problem is the chance of error will rise to four hundred percent so it's not good at all we don't want it what will be next the next technology is coming up is 8.2 a d11 ad they change the frequency at all and we shift to 58 gigahertz channel so we can have a very big channel 2 point 16 you hurts channel it's not like this for AC we have 80 megahertz and 160 megahertz but here we have two point 16 gigahertz it's so big so you can have very good sure puts here for example with a very simple configuration we can have 6756 point seventy five megabits per second it's more than we need with me and if they use my mo in the future it can goes up to 13.6 gigabit per second so it's more more more than enough so it's enough for us let's say what about the interference and for long-range application there is something very special for this frequency it is have the same resonance with the error so if we have a loss for other frequencies like this we have a very big rise up here for for 58 years so the error will eat our signal so we will have very less interference but short-range communications because the air don't let us the or signal trouble so far the resonance of the error will eat our signal and change it to temperature higher temperature so just like what the microwave ovens do with 2.4 gigahertz but water it's happened to fit 58 years for error so if we cannot have a very long range communication 5058 he reach but the good news we will have less interference so let's see what is happening 50 years I'm just going to tell you the future punchline find some something's very weird in quantum mechanics they found something called spooky action at the distance what is that if you have in tangles particle it can be photons it can be electrons if I keep one particle here in one particle in somewhere else if I rotate this particle the other particle with with the same time with no delay we would cite to 100 degrees another direction it's too weird even though Einstein don't understand how it's happened and we don't have an explanation today but it's happened the every particle have something called quantum state and if we can measure the quantum spey contemn state of the particles and if they entangled if we rotate one of them the other particle we rotate at the same same time exactly same time there's no matter how they for but they can rotate is it tested yes it's tested in China with two fiber optic lines they make the entangled photons with a laser machine they send one particle in one direction and one particle in another direction and they use that some random filters and they start to hunt the number of the particles that they really match together the result is one hundred percent of the particles is matched and the speed of that system is amazing ten thousand times faster than light ah or even more faster what we can say for now we test ten thousand times faster and these action is take place in the no time it's very fast so what we will have in 50 years we will have the new mikrotik routing the planets and that much per second with zero midi second delay between Earth and Mars so thanks for your time time for questions if there is any questions now okay
