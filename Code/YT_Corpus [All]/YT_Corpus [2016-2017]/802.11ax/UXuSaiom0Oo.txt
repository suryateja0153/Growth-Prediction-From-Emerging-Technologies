 so for my project I decided to research 802 point 11 standards I chose this topic because I think wireless networking is pretty interesting I think it's easy to understand that data is being transmitted between devices when there's a physical cable connecting them but with wireless networking you don't have that so I just think it's neat to have data being transmitted through the air basically between devices and then showing up in one piece on the receiving device so I wanted to kind of research that I also didn't completely understand the differences between the standards in the book for some reason so I thought it would be good to further my knowledge on this subject and through my research I discovered that there are a bunch of 802 point 11 standards so like the book i'm only going to touch on the ones that i think are major and then also go into some future technologies that are scheduled to come out soon and that i think are just neat and wanted to talk about them so i'm going to go into that a little bit at the end as well so to begin the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers created that first tubulin standard in 1997 it's at the basis for all the standards after it and they all kind of find some similar things including media access control and physical layer specifications so your Ethernet MAC addresses are defined in these and then also your csma/ca rules which is that carrier sense multiple access collision avoidance so to kind of reoch splain what that is only one device can send data at a time in a wireless network so a device will send its data and if it doesn't get a response back it will set a random wait time and then try the data again that's that csma stuff and that's defined in these standards as well the this original standards max bandwidth was 2 megabits per second and it ran in the unlicensed 2.4 gigahertz is M fancy band which we talked about these back in chapter 6 but unlicensed frequency bands just means that anybody can use it without paying a fee so lots of devices use the is M band industrial scientific and medical devices so lots of wireless phones microwaves different equipment like that uses this band which can cause some issues with interference because this band is not very wide so a lot of the channels overlap so that could be an issue the standards all kind of build on each other and attempt to make some modifications to improve the wireless networking world so 802 point 11 became out in July of 1999 and it up that max speed to about 11 megabits per second and it's still used that 2.4 gigahertz frequency band meaning that it was still getting some interference from microwaves wireless phones and other household devices however most Wi-Fi still runs on a 22 point 11 be today mostly because it has a decent speed and you get a pretty good range so it's basically just your basic Wi-Fi if you have a concept of that so pros of this standard or that it's low cost and it has a decent size range cons that it's it's not the fastest it it's an okay speed but it's definitely not the fastest if the standards that we're going to look at and you're getting interference from home appliances on this frequency band 802 point 11 a was created around the same time as be some people seem to think that a came out after be because it didn't really gain as much popularity as beaded but they were actually made around the same time it was a little bit more for business environments and it was a little bit more costly and that's part of the reason why it didn't really gain as much popularity as beaded its max speed was 54 megabits per second and it actually operated in the 5 gigahertz frequency band so this band is stolen license so anybody can use it without paying a fee however it's a little bit larger and so not as many frequency channels are overlapping which means you're gonna get some less interference and not as many devices use this channel on as the 2.4 gigahertz channel so again you're going to be getting less interference so pros are that you got a faster speed and less interference cons or that higher costs like I said and because you're at a higher frequency you're going to get a shorter range and it's also going to be a little bit more easily obstructed meaning it's going to have a harder time getting through walls and other physical objects which could be a problem when it comes to transmitting data the next major standard was 80 to point 11g which came out in 2002 it kind of attempted to combine the pros of both a and B because the two weren't compatible since they were on different frequency bands you couldn't use one device that used be and one that used a so g kind of attempted to get the best of both worlds it's max feed was 54 mega bits per second like a but it operated on that 2.4 gigahertz frequency band like be so you're getting faster speed with a decent range it was also backwards compatible with be so when this standard came out you didn't have to buy all new appliances you could have some that ran on being some that ran on G so pro so that it's fast it's got a good range and it's not easily obstructed because it's on that lower frequency however it's more expensive and you're still getting interference on that 2.4 frequency band the next major standard was 80 to point 11 in there were few in between G and n that provided some smaller specifications but the next major one was this one and it's also the last one that the book talks about so it came out in 2009 and it's also known as wireless-n it can operate in e to the 2.4 or the 5 gigahertz frequency band and it also provides an optional feature of two concurrent wireless channels so in comparison with the past standards that we've looked at this has a max speed of 72 megabits per second that's with one single channel like the others use but this standard has the option of using a wider frequency range which can allow for two concurrent wireless channels to be used which ups that max speed to 100 and 50 megabits per second it also uses multiple input multiple output and streams which basically means that your Nick or AP can have up to four antennas and can theoretically send up four times the speed of one with only one antenna that ups at max speed to 600 megabits per second and we get that number from four streams of two wireless channels if that makes sense also the standard is backwards compatible with g and b so you can use devices that run on either one of these together in the same network and again you're not having to buy all new devices for this standard and there's a picture there of a router that uses that multiple-input multiple-output set up with the four antennas these next few standards are not mentioned in the book but I just think they're interesting and I wanted to look into them a little bit and show that information so in 2013 we got a 22 point 11 AC which is known as gigabit Wi-Fi because it's the first wireless standard that had a max speed of about one gigabit per second which is about 20 times faster than 80 to point 11 in that we just looked at it operates in that five figure Hertz frequency band but because you're in a higher frequency and you're got a higher modulation you're going to have shorter range than the other standards that we've looked at and you're also going to be a little bit more easily obstructed like we talked about earlier next eight 111 ad which is why gig is a future technology that isn't technically out yet it's a we're starting to see some products with it now but we talked about this a little bit in a discussion board in class it runs on the 60 gigahertz frequency band which is a whole lot higher than the other standards that we've looked at and it's max speed is theoretically about seven gigabits per second like seven to eight or the coordinates orses I looked at and it makes claims such as being able to download an HD movie in three minutes which standard Wi-Fi that takes about an hour so that's a huge difference however that higher frequency means you get a shorter wavelength which means you get a shorter range this standard only has arrangement about 30 feet which is not a lot so you're not going to want to use this for your entire home or office however they're saying that this could be useful for wireless television and things like that there is a possibility of devices that can maybe switch between Wi-Fi my gig which would be nice because if you're within that 30-foot range you can get that really high speed internet and wireless access but then if you're outside of that 30-foot range you're still getting network access just at a typical Wi-Fi speed which would be nice and then lastly 802 point 11 aah or Wi-Fi halo I think it's pronounced a low is another future technology it actually has a frequency range of 900 megahertz which is the first standard below 1 gigahertz which is really interesting so it's got a really low wavelength but because of that its range as nearly twice the size of typical Wi-Fi and it also more easily penetrates obstacles like walls and furniture so they're hoping that this could be a really big step in the technological world in terms of like medical and smart car and smart home things where walls and different stuff it's really important to get through in long distance however it's not very fast because of this really low modulation it's you're not going to get very high seeds so that's the only downside to Wi-Fi halo and lastly I found this neat image that I thought was a pretty good representation of the different standards I talked about this red line that you're seeing on the outside is a 02 point 11 AF which I didn't talk about it's another future standard that operates on an even lower frequency range than Wi-Fi halo it's in that fifty four to seven ninety megahertz as you can see so you're getting a very long range and it's again not out yet but it'll be interesting to see how that looks and then this blue line you're seeing that's Wi-Fi halo and the green is a BG and n which is in that 2.4 gigahertz range ANC you can see in there on that orange line with the five gigahertz which again is a shorter range and then in there inside the house 802 point 11 ad or Y gate which that 30-foot range is in there at the 16 gigahertz so that's all I have here are my references and thanks for your time
