 hi in this video we will talk about Silicon Labs latest Wi-Fi module The Wizard gecko double G m110 and how you can use it to unlock the power of Internet connectivity on any small and resource-constrained embedded system application first we will talk about Wi-Fi technology and how it compares with other wireless technologies such as Bluetooth and ZigBee then we will talk about some of the domains in use cases where Wi-Fi is the most suitable wireless technology and what benefits are brought to those applications by the wizard gecko GG m110 Wi-Fi module Wi-Fi technology has been around for over a decade and it's commonly associated with large and power-hungry devices such as laptops for transferring data at very high rates for those reasons it is not necessarily associated with small energy-efficient devices which are typically used for IOT applications however using Wi-Fi fair next i UT application makes a lot of sense when you think about the benefits that it brings compared to alternative wireless protocols with Wi-Fi you can leverage an existing infrastructure of Internet connected access points which offers high data throughput on highly secure connections such as double PA 2 security protocol as well as direct connectivity with your phone tablet or PC to the Wi-Fi modules hosted access point there are of course some challenges as well such as the fact that Wi-Fi is a lot more energy demanding when compared to other wireless standards in addition there is also perceived design and complexity which is typically related with the antenna design obtaining certifications and integrating the stack into your device and this applies to any wireless radio solution if we think about some specific carriers and applications where Wi-Fi would be a good fit the list would be very extensive but we can narrow it down for the purpose of this video looking at the industrial in m2m applications Wi-Fi is a perfect choice for a cable replacement with its robustness and range it can ensure that device is placed a couple hundred metres apart can establish a link and exchange secure data at high rates this allows cost savings on long and expensive cable networks across factory floors our other type of industrial environments typically sensor nodes are not equipped with a Wi-Fi link that troll is more commonly taken by low-power protocols such as Bluetooth or ZigBee however those protocols cannot be used for sending data directly to a cloud server in this type of scenario a bridge or hub must be used which can receive the data from those sensors and send it over the internet using Wi-Fi Wi-Fi can also be used for remote control applications one such example is the currently expanding drone market smaller drones are typically controlled over Bluetooth from your smartphone but that gives a range of only a couple dozen meters for extending that range to a few hundred meters then Wi-Fi is your technology of choice in addition to the range extension you will also benefit from high data throughput which can for instance be used to stream video from a drones onboard camera lastly we can look at the smart home environment particularly energy metering there are a number of products for energy metering which you can even put directly into your power sockets and many of those can have built-in Wi-Fi for direct internet connectivity through your homes access point this allows data to be seamlessly sent to the cloud where all the metrics can be visualized with the goal of having a more energy friendly home without the need for extra IOT hubs or Gateway solutions making a chipset base design is always an option but which comes with the design and challenges of antenna design and certifications modules are therefore a perfect choice to go around those challenges and have a seamless designing process of an inherently complex technology like Wi-Fi by selecting a module you don't have to worry about antenna design as they come with onboard antenna which has been tuned for the highest efficiency in addition some modules provide all the required certifications so you don't have to worry about regulatory matters for deploying your application worldwide finally you don't need to integrate the stack into your system as that comes with the modules as well you can focus on building your application and leave the Wi-Fi to Silicon Labs The Wizard gecko GG m110 is the newest Wi-Fi module from Silicon Labs it is the fastest and easiest way to add Wi-Fi connectivity to your applications by offering an all-inclusive package solution of ready to use hardware and software it is a very small module with an exceptional RF performance giving it a range of up to 450 meters the onboard stack supports both client and access point modes making it flexible for different use cases it supports that it transfer over TCP or UDP as well as end-to-end security with TLS and double pa2 protocols it couldn't be easier to integrate GG m110 into your design using the free SDK with BG script you can develop your application on the module itself reducing the complexity and BOM cost alternatively the module can be controlled by an external host via UART SPI or USB using the BG API protocol in addition these two modes can be used simultaneously meaning that you can develop certain common routines in BG script such as establishing a connection to a predefined access point relieving the host from these tasks and simplifying the application development the free SDK contains all you need to start developing with GG m110 it comes with a compiler to build your BG script application and flash them into the GG m110 as well as several examples using both BG script and BG lib in addition it also has the BG tool which allows you to control the module from a graphical interface for evaluation and debugging purposes the GG m110 supports device firmware update over the host interface so that you can update the modules firmware on the field let's now go through a brief example of how easy it is to establish a Wi-Fi link using GG m110 in this example we have one GG m110 configured in access point mode with SSID LED master and - GG m110 configure - stations the stations will connect to this known SSID and open a connection to TCP server running on the access point when a user presses pb0 button on the access point wireless starterkit' it will send a known data payload to station 1 which will turn on the LEDs and a similar known data payload will be sent when the user releases the button to turn off the LEDs pressing PB 1 will have the same effect but on station 2 as TCP connection is bi-directional it is also possible to turn on and off two LEDs on the access point wireless target by pressing PB 0 on each of the stations wireless target boards for this example it was sufficient to use a BG script based application due to its simplicity and ease of use with BG script it is extremely quick to prototype and develop Wi-Fi based applications on GG m110 the access point module is running on the highest power saving state as it needs to be constantly advertising its presence however the stations have been configured to enter the lower power saving states which are automatically handled by the modules onboard stack as you can see in this real-time current trace on energy profiler when know that it has exchanged the stations will go to one of the lower power saving states in this state they remain associated with the access point but in an idle condition and the current consumption is only about 2.2 million when a button is pressed whether on the access point or on the station's wireless target then they will wake up to act accordingly and go back into a lower power saving state it is possible to go further down and the energy savings by unassociated from the access point and powering off the Wi-Fi chip which will lead to about 22 micro amps of current consumption but we'll cover that in a future video this example shows that Wi-Fi based designs using the wizard gecko GG m110 Wi-Fi module are not only easy to develop but they can also be very energy efficient this ends our video on the wizard gecko gg m110 Wi-Fi module we hope you have enjoyed learning more about the GG m110 and how you can use it to add Wi-Fi to your next IOT
