 Hi. I'm Raj Sodhi, an engineer with Keysight Technologies. The UXA signal analyzer now delivers its flagship performance with 1 GHz of bandwidth. This is an integrated signal analysis solution that will significantly simplify the current typically highly complicated test systems that are being used today to research and test bandwidth-demanding technologies, like 5G and pulsed radar. These technologies enable microwave, backhaul, and aerospace links to connect to people in remote areas, radar technician of small objects or unmanned aircraft from an extended range, and commercial radar systems for applications, like vehicle collision avoidance. These technologies are currently being researched and developed with wide-band test systems composed of multiple instruments. Unfortunately, these test systems are difficult to calibrate and performance corrections are cumbersome and difficult to implement. Dynamic range is limited, and the expense can be significant. Today, we have the UXA, which alleviates all these pain points. As an integrated wide-band analysis solution, you get measurement confidence you expect from Keysight Technologies. When used with Keysight's 89600 VSA software, you get the most comprehensive set of tools for wide-band signal demodulation and vector signal analysis. As frequencies increase to e-band, we have a new wideband smart mixer that works seamlessly with the UXA to measure up to 2 GHz of bandwidth all the way to 90 GHz. With the UXA, you have the highest performance, widest bandwidth analyzer on the market today that lets you see the real performance of your device without the cost and hassle of the large, complicated test system you might be using today.
