 today's Wi-Fi networks are under pressure to perform why interference but not from microwave ovens cordless phones or Bluetooth signals it's Wi-Fi itself traditional Wi-Fi access points flood transmissions in all directions signal that goes anywhere except to the intended receiver is just interference complete control of your Wi-Fi signal is the solution if you can focus Wi-Fi signals only where and when they're needed interference decreases and signal strength increases this means larger coverage areas faster data rates and more devices connecting at the same time this focus and control solves one of the biggest challenges in Wi-Fi today capacity Wi-Fi uses a shared medium just like a group of people trying to get on an escalator at the same time instead of a wire that carries data to each device Wi-Fi channels are shared among all devices devices have become smaller and increased in number of creating performance problems for everyone it all comes down to physics enter ruckus beam flex beam flex is the only adaptive Wi-Fi antenna technology that focuses and controls Wi-Fi signals by increasing signal and decreasing interference Wi-Fi performance is improved dramatically this means more efficient connections and more room for more users giving them a better Wi-Fi experience it also means fewer access points to buy and deploy fewer wired drops and fewer switch ports needed all while improving performance to each individual user here's how it works through patented technology beam flex automatically creates a directional Wi-Fi signal on the fly for every client it does this by activating combinations of individual antenna elements each working in concert to create the best possible signal path that yields the highest data rate however good communication isn't just how well a Wi-Fi access point can talk it's about how well they listen today's mobile devices are smaller than ever with antennas that diminish upstream performance to make an Access Point listen better the internal noise from electronic components must be controlled and reduced if you've ever turned up the volume on your stereo without playing music that's static noise in Wi-Fi this system noise results in self interference reducing this interference is essential it's also essential to be able to listen at different angles traditional access points were designed with vertical antennas for devices like laptops that stay in a fixed position but today's mobile devices are constantly used in any number of different orientations creating a signal mismatch between the access points and clients beam flex solves this with antennas that transmit and receive in both horizontal and vertical orientations to improve the reception of traffic from weaker mobile devices one of the greatest benefits of beam flex is that it's inherently compatible with all Wi-Fi technologies on the other hand transmit beamforming only provides mild gains in very specific situations it's only supported by a limited subset of clients and it does very little to reduce Wi-Fi noise in addition the ability to use throughput enhancing techniques such as spatial multiplexing and multi-user MIMO are in direct conflict with the use of transmit beamforming having complete control over communication between the access point and devices has additional technical benefits to achieve the highest possible throughput Wi-Fi standards make use of complex techniques like spatial multiplexing and multi-user MIMO maximizing these capabilities requires complete control of the signal instead of just blasting Wi-Fi energy in all directions and hoping for the best beam flex and other ruckus optimization technologies deliver above all else fast reliable Wi-Fi service with fewer access points less networking equipment and lower ongoing costs that's simply better you
