 good afternoon and welcome to Cisco's 802 11 AC wave 2 made easy this afternoon we'll be talking a little bit about the trends in wireless technology will be talking specifically about the wave to technology itself and of course we'll be reviewing the cisco portfolio of products so let's go ahead and begin this year marks the 20th anniversary of wireless and our everyday lives and what started out as a novelty has really grown into a powerful business tool with a bandwidth speeds exceeding gigabytes of them throughput so what's really been driving at this bandwidth has been new client devices new wireless handheld devices new applications that are eating up bandwidth and just the demand for on-time anywhere bandwidth available for both business and educational use so cisco has been the market leader in wireless for the past decade plus and it's the innovations in wireless and in switching and when that really has helped us to build the foundation for digital as your primary access so let's talk a little bit about the specific technology in wave 2 in wave 2 there are a number of brand new features that are that really help to improve the network performance first the bandwidth is gone all the way up from two from two point three four to three point four seven gigabytes and standard deployments also in in the new wave 2 is multi-user MIMO which we'll talk about in a moment and also it uses a hundred and 60 megahertz wide channels as well all of which is an improvement over previous amendments and giving you better capacity in your network as well so let's talk a little bit about multi-user mimo now the previous amendments had single-user MIMO my mo is multiple in multiple out and previously an access point would kick a data pack and divide it up and send it out over multiple antenna radio waves but it can only do this at one client at a time so that was single-user MIMO well the new Amendment allows for multiple data packs to be sent to multiple clients at the same time so therefore if you can see it really improves the efficiency and overall bandwidth of the networks by being able to service more than one client at a time additionally pretty straightforward is the 160 mega mega Hertz wide channels obviously the wider the channel of the more traffic it can handle the more speed that it can go at and it's comparable to say driving on a two-lane or four lane highway compared to a 6-line or an eight-lane highway so we're going from 80 megahertz to 160 doubling of the channel with cisco has built their new wave to portfolio of products on previous versions leadership in the industry first-in-class best in class and in some cases of only in class so let's talk a little bit about the portfolio of products this is the wave to access points from entry-level to enterprise we have the 1830 and 1850 which are entry level access points and then we move up to our enterprise our mission critical investment class the 2800 series and 3800 series now the 1830 and 1850 have a brand new feature that we're offering for the first time and that is a virtual controller that is built into each of the access points the 18 13 18 and we refer to this as our mobility Express solution and the virtual controller can manage a small network of up to 25 access points either way to or first-generation Cisco access points as well but of course it's scalable so if you do go above 25 to access points you can rotate those over to a controller based and have have management of them through the controller as well it's very easy to set up in just a few minutes using any wireless device in it you can access the dashboard through the interface GUI again on any smartphone iPad laptop and we've really built a very hearty dashboard based on our best practices so that you have complete monitoring and management of AP performance as well as client performance as well you'll have guest access clean air technology so it is a very it's a very hearty and very thorough dashboard very easy to get to and it is licensed free up to 25 access points of course so let's talk about these access points the 1830 and 1850 the 1830 this is our entry level it's a three by three so it is three radios and three receivers it has one gigabyte up to one gigabyte of throughput gigabyte of Internet as well as a USB port this is available only with the internal antenna but it is the most cost-effective access point that's currently available in the wave to market next step up is our 1850 access point in entry-level this is a 4 by 4 for radios and four receivers of course able to do multi-user mimo as well as single-user MIMO two gigabytes of of other net as well as USB available with an internal and external antennas as well these two access points entry level access points are built on the broadcom chip which is course used by all manufacturers of access points but we have what makes the difference and the power of our access points and the power of our network is a computing power that we put in each and every one of our access points and as we can see here that compared to any of the competition our access points have almost twice to see a cpu power have twice the memory and almost eight times the flash flash storage which obviously improves the the performance of an access point anyone who's had a laptop and moved into a newer one with a better processor understands how a more effective that is and so we put that computing power behind our access points which really helps with the data packet processing and improvement in the actual performance of that access point so this is a key difference between Cisco and the competition so let's talk about the enterprise the mission-critical invest in class this is the 2800 series 4 by 4 for radios for receivers can be a maximum of five point two gigabytes of throughput and I'll talk about that in just a moment it has two gigabyte Ethernet connection to USB to internal external antennas it has a smart antenna connection which I'll review also in a moment but what we have first in class and the only in the industry is a flexible radio assignment so that two point four gigabytes radio is configurable and can be converted to a five gigahertz radio as well which gives you twice the power in each and every one of those access points so this is the 3800 series which is the best in class again similar to the 2800 four-by-four it has the USB to it has the smarts connectors it has the not only the gigabyte Ethernet but it also has the multi gig Ethernet up to up to five gigs of throughput as well and of course it has that flexible radio assignment that configurable 2.4 gigahertz radio that can be converted to five what makes the big difference also from the 28th to the 38 is the modular port and I'll show you that in just a moment but let's talk about that configurable radio by switching the 2.4 to a 5 gigahertz basically what you're doing is you're providing two times the batting with two times the capacity and two times the coverage with one access point and with potential throughput of 5.2 gigabytes so it is really really a first-in-class and the only access point on the market that has that configurable feature here you can see the 3800 with the smart antenna port as well as the modular port now the modular port is used for expandability and scalability down the line with your network for such things as video surveillance or future wife I standards that will come out through future amendments Bluetooth beaconing as well as other custom applications that you'll be able to use through that through that port but let's talk a little bit about the smart antenna connector which is a side port that is very sleek and design that allows you to add additional antennas for either logistics for location analytics for additional coverage for stadium and those type of deployments and because it's on the side it's very easy to attach new in tennis without having to remove the access point so the 28-30 800 as I mentioned are built on custom chip technology the entry levels are the optus shelves but we have custom design of the CPU the the chips inside the CPU for the 28 and 38 hundred and we put such features as our clean air technology which is a program that runs interference and mitigation in the two point four and five gigahertz through the entire 160 megahertz wide channels to ensure that you're not getting any interference with your network we have the client length which was our implicit beamforming that ensures that the link between the client and the access point is secure we also have the new course radio role flexibility of being able to configure that 2.4 gigahertz radio we also have the flexible dynamic frequency selection which is the self-healing network so the access points listen to each other they will change channels to change power to avoid any holes or any other interference and of course optimize roaming and all of this is done through our customized chip which again you know we work closely with the manufacturer to develop for Soyuz and Cisco access points of course you might be thinking gigabyte it is all well and good but what about my existing network as you well know most of the networks today are running the cat5 with older switches which are bottlenecked at about 1 gigabytes well well when working with the NT based technology what we have developed our new line of switches that will allow you to get up to 5 gigabytes of throughput on standard cat5e cable and some of these new switches are the 4500 series the 3850 switch or the 3560 context switch as well and it gives you POA POA plus upo e as well so it can really solve the problem of cabling and reducing time and cost of having to replace all those cabling by using these new line switches as well and of course in support of the wave 2 we have new controllers that are on the market are 5520 and are 8540 so we have the largest plethora of controllers on the market today so regardless if you're a small branch office and only need 75 to 100 access points or your large enterprise group and eating up to control up to 6,000 access points we can help you to scale with a variety of controllers that are available today also of course don't forget that we do have the new mobility express the virtual controller for the small branch offices if you have 25 or less access points as well and of course I'd be remiss if I didn't mention our mouraki cloud solution as well which allows you to have unlimited access to a cloud dashboard for the management monitoring of your network as well and with a new line of switching as well as access points including the new wave to mr 42 access point three by three access point with a dedicated radio for the Air Marshal Service as well so this was a very quick overview of the state of the technology the trends in the industry and a brief discussion on the portfolio of Cisco products we thank you for watching us today we appreciate your sport and if you have further questions or if we can be assistance please feel free to reach out for us and we
