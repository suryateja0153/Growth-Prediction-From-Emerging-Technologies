 so daﬂ technology has changed significantly in the last 5 to 10 years most of its followed with at least followed along with integration in silicon the the increase in fiber data rate transport as well as the the products necessary to interface those so the thirties components that do that and that's at least for the transport side for the remote amplification side increases in efficiency have yielded smaller remote radio cabinets so we've been able to produce you know much more efficient designs with things like digital pre-distortion which is has significantly reduced the amplifier size through gains and efficiency
