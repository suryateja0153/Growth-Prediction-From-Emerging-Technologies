 hey guys is tiny some Logan back another video for it today don't panic I've not lost my brains we're going to be talking and reviewing some routers now you may think to yourself Tom times aren't that hard you don't need to be wasting your time on routers well Alex when you I think at the end when I go through the conclusion you'll explain why I've set some time aside to be able to review these but essentially we have got the and I have to get them the round the right way which so I've got them on their boxes but this is the asus AC 5300 and it's not what you would genuinely think a router would look like although they do seem to be versions kind of that looking a lot more aggressive starts come out but that's definitely the most bonkers mental and have to watch my my my language because I could have said some other stuff but bonkers mental router I've ever seen and like I said it is incredibly aggressive and then you've got what I would say is a more kind of generic looking router bit still looks pretty meaty and it's the RT AC 88 you know I'm actually running this 66 you in the office at the moment so I've got some experience with Asus routers but what I want to do is I want to give you a good up-close look at the the different the difference between the two before we move on to talking about specifications and me boring you about the actual review side of it so let's go and have an up-close look and then when we come back I will explain to you about everything that's going on inside of these little beasties okay so we're going to start with the AC 5300 and I'm going to show you around and about the aesthetics and the actual router itself before we start talking about what's really going on inside so at the top this is surely I'm not sure with the camera or showers but it they are vents when you look at it straight on it doesn't like it but there are air vents down the side so this is your I don't cover it up this is so that the hot air can get out of the router itself and while I remember you can see all the routers here I've kind of got them on like a 45 degree with the aerials so I've got them at 45 degrees and they do actually have like a stop now this is the optimal setup for the antennas you can Bob them all up if you want and have them up that way but to have them stuck slightly out is the best way through your coverage with the antennas which obviously takes up a fair bit of room because it's a big square unit there are no wall mounts or anything on the back so that's the way you kind of need to have it this is I'm kind of showing you around this is the front side what I'm going to call the front side of the router and what we can see here is some little LED slot and you've got the power LED 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi that shows you're connected to the Internet this shows that you've got our networked the networks being used and then this is your WPS light if we come round and we're going to go our anti-clockwise that is a plain side going round clockwise what we can see here is we've got a USB 2 port you've got an LED button and this is this is so that in turn all of the LEDs off on the front of the router so if you find that your you've got it in your bedroom or you're watching a film and the lights flash and you're driving your crackers you can just flick the button and it will turn all the lights off then you've got your WPS button and a Wi-Fi switch you can easily just totally disable the Wi-Fi should you need to we come right the way round to the back we have the power switch nice and simple it does actually go in to show it's on and then fully out so it's off and then we have the I see in and you do get a little adapter that comes with this you then got your USB 3 connection you've got your one connection because this is a router so you'd need to have a modem to send your internet signal in I talked to you about this more depth all right and then you've got your four Gigabit Ethernet ports moving on to the AC 88u and this looks more like a what I would call a conventional router rather than you know something from a sci-fi or like a weird spider II thing like the 53 does so with this one top you have all of your LEDs that we were talking about before power 2.4 gigahertz 5 gigahertz internet Network USB 3 USB 2 lights you actually have on this one as well and then you WPS light on the front and I'm going to call it the front you have an LED switch here so you can easily turn the LEDs on and off and your Wi-Fi switch they're quite big switches as well thing you're going to know you've pressed them and then there is a little pool down here where your USB 3 is hidden again we'll talk about all the USB 3s and all that type of stuff later you can see you've got your four antennas now this vent here does have a little red like cover because it's hiding the switch and I I can honestly say I actually think this should light up and it's one of those weird ones where I've got a router in front of me and I'm like oh could mod it there are a little air vents down here as well that kind of follow up almost like in a car style as well and yeah I'm it's wrong but it's making me want to take it apart and put LEDs in when we go right the way round to the back what we find I mean the first thing you're going to notice is there are eight gig in a bit ah Ethernet port at the back and these will act like a switch as well but if we stick to this side we've got a reset switch WPS switch and then USB - you've got your eight gigabit connections at the back then you've got your Wan here so this is again where your internet would come in from your modem then you've got your power connector there and your on and off switch we come around the side you can see it's just kind of a normal angular designing see some air vents on the bottom again we've got the rubber feet but there isn't and you've got a rubber strip along there as well there isn't any way to hang it on a wall which might sound daft but a lot of routers you can mount and this one hasn't gotten the option for it but you can see that there's a large open area here so the air can radiate through and get out there get out the top but it does look like a good bit of kit these are big chunky aerials again you've got the 45 degree option with the antennas I mean you can get kind of like all funky Munky when you start setting them up to make it all look pretty but look you get what I'm trying to say there's a lot of fiddling around that you can do and it does look you have to make sure that you keep them down up tight it does look the part definitely doesn't look like your average run-of-the-mill cheap EDP router now you would think that reviewing a wireless router would actually be really simple but I've actually had to write a note because I'm not a script monkey I actually like to try and learn as much as I possibly can about these products or any of the products and then kind of almost ad lib to you to give you my best possible um you know kind of thoughts on it without it being too overthought I like it to come across natural like it's to mates chatting in a pub there's also why my videos end up being horrific ly long so I do apologize but we have to mental looking routers and then when you actually take the hood off and look at the specs underneath there's a lot going on as well which is why I have my notes but essentially they both have a 1.4 gigahertz dual-core Broadcom processor inside them and that helps with speeding up all of the wireless transfers the the USB because you can use the USB for cloud software and stuff out which we will talk about and then you've got there network switch side of it as well so they've both got a Broadcom 1.4 gigahertz dual-core processor to take care of the main processing of the units themselves now the AC 53 has its tribe and you've got a 2.4 gigahertz Wireless then you've got 2 5 gigahertz wireless that you that will run independently as well so if you have three wireless and you've got one connected to the 2.4 and you've got to individual Wireless items connected to 5 gigahertz they will all have their own network eat also with this one you've got the 1.4 gigahertz dual core then it actually has some wireless offload processes and the 2.4 and the two 5s each have their own wireless offload processors the 88 only has dual band it's only got one 2.4 and one 5 gigahertz so that has to offload processors in it as well now I probably should have written down the fact that they've got a 512 I think it's make a bit of RAM in each of them as well and there is also some other memory that's going on in it but while I do remember because I always should say this at the beginning I always forget if you're interested in the in-depth specs and everything else that's going on probably some of the stuff that I've forgotten please click the link underneath and the card to go and have a look at the overclocked 3d website where I've got some proper pictures of them and we've got a lot more information like I've said I'm ad-libbing this as normal so I may forget to minor details I'm going to try my best so we've got all those processes now the the 88 here does have four extra Ethernet ports compared to the 53 and this does have an essentially the dual core will take care of 4 of the Ethernet ports like this but it has an add-on real texture to take care of the other four now that when I first read it made me worried that you're going to get some delays and between using different ports on the switch I didn't really notice any difference whatsoever no the speed nor latency or anything I have none in the real word kind of me looking at it type scenario now when it does come to wireless testing it does get quite difficult because you have to set so many variables so perfectly and also you have to have something to compare to now I do have the AC sorry the AE 66 in the office which is my personal router but the problem with the building that I live in is that it's made from reinforced concrete now this is both a pain in the rear end for wireless routers because loads of the signal gets sucked out but it's also a really good indication of stressing a router like these because um if I can't get a signal like with the AE 66 if I go to the end of my front room near the balcony don't go thinking it's posh it's just a big window with a bit outside up and go and stand outside off I've got a bit of a throat today sorry but if I use because I have just purchased a Dell XPS 15 and it's the new one the skylight one and if I go and sit at my desk with the a 66 at my desk at my dinner table with the a 66 by the balcony I sometimes can't get a signal at all best case scenario is one bar a bit and that's because of the walls of the building no crazy thing is when you bring the AC 53 in to tow the worst signal I've experienced was one below you know you get the little lines on your wireless was one below maximum and when I was just testing on the Internet just because I've got a 120 down package and a 20 Meg app this was absolutely Bulls raping that you know completely I was having no problem with that tool now with the older router I would not have been able to have got that without moving to a different position in the front room so although that's an incredibly basic way of me testing it it does go to show that just something so simple has made a large difference just in my home so we've gone from me having flaky signal to now on perfect signal this are one as well was pretty much the same it never went below that dar but one thing I will say is it was down that not that more often than this one was now the 53 one of the reasons why the wireless on this is so much stronger as it does have eight antennas but it has four antennas to transmit and four to receive whereas this shares them across all of it and in fact when you look in the paperwork for the 88 there isn't any specific mention of how they split the antennas whether you have two independent to transmit and two to receive have asked nobody seems to know it's just so one of those ones so this is a big selling point of it it's got four dedicated antennas to transmit and forward dedicated antennas to receive and it does show as well obviously I mean when it comes to five gigahertz devices at home I'm pretty much limited to my laptop and my phone and whereas before as I've said I would notice the the signals really start to plummet with this they really it was just a night and day difference it was like a massive upgrade straightaway now one of the things that they both can do is link aggregation and if you've got a home server or a now's where you can the ethernet comes out you can quite often team them so with a normal earth in it you would have our best-case scenario around a hundred and twenty megabytes so the big be trying to get them right megabytes a second across your Ethernet network by teaming the two you can effectively although it's never quite doubled you can double the availability if you do it properly as well so you're not using one for up and one for down you can actually double the speed so that you can transfer across your network effect over 200 megabytes a second now these both have teaming available so you could take a two cables from your nas or your router and then plug them into the the Bowser and then you can team them up and this will take the signal from both and use them as you know a doubled up line and then effectively what you can do is then you could have two PC's then wired into the modem that you would be able to transfer both maximun ethernet speeds so rather than them sharing 120 mega pipeline you can then get both of them running as a hundred and twenty megabyte now one of the things I did think with the link aggregation is it would have been nice if the link aggregation wasn't just on two lines so fragments a clock in my personal circumstances I could have had my server coming in with your lines and then my main rig coming in on dual lines as well and that's something that you would have to deal with with an external network switch but you could still feed this with a lot more signal now one of the things that you can one of the bonuses have been able to get a lot more data in from your server to the the router is the fact that you could have like I said you'll rig transferring files at for argument's sake 120 megabytes a second and then you could also have someone taking data remotely from another source front so like with Plex my personal circumstance would be my girlfriend watching Plex and then my sister could be on the wireless also watching Plex and it wouldn't affect my status in the office I'm personally going to be adding in a network switch so that my rig can absolutely rate through this as well but anyway so that was the only little niggle that I had was the fact that you've only got two network aggregation ports and that's probably the only niggles that i've got with them . so when we were talking about the wireless before you had the 2.4 gigahertz which because of all the extra mumbo-jumbo that's going on inside that will be - a thousand megabits a second the five gigahertz is up to 2,000 megabits a second now one of the things that I do want to say about the five megabit what five gigahertz and the link aggregation is the fact that are because of the absolutely ridiculous throughput it does mean that I'm going to be able to with my laptop have much much faster connections to my server now I do run remote desktop on my server and transfer files in and out of it quite a bit so the fact that I'm going to be able to now pretty much get gigabit speeds over the wireless plus a bit on top is absolutely brilliant and that's again it's another trait to the fact that these are now getting so advanced that the wireless isn't now it's not you know so much of a big drawback now looking at my list I know that I've talked to you about a lot of bits and bobs one of the things is while we're on wireless is the beamforming it's called a I radar and essentially if you go and read up on it on the overclocked 3d website essentially if someone's not got much signal over one area it almost transforms the way the wireless has been and focuses it and so that you all get an amazing service it doesn't excuse me it does that automatically and the other thing that I really liked was what they're calling a eye protection and it's they've got some Trend Micro I don't want to say software Trend Micro stuff on both of these so essentially now I don't want to say this is an an end to antivirus but they essentially do a lot of that outside of your PC for you so from say if you had a PC trying to connect on your network say fronts at your brother's laptop he's been watching some dodgy stuff on a certain hub and he's picked up some viruses these can actually pick that up and email you to let you know that they found some dodgy stuff on a ohno ohno system and it you know the system might not be entirely safe and it you can actually let them block that system from being used on until it been rectified what you can also do is you can the eye eye protection can stop are you going on dodgy websites period so one of the good things here and this is something that we do need to talk about with the parental control is you can set it up so any xxx sites literally can't be accessed at all so if you've got young kids and stuff like that you can turn that on now don't worry calm down boys we know you want access to that as well especially when your missus isn't looking so you can actually have that parental control stuff just linked to certain devices so you can set it to mobiles and desktops and you can actually set a lot of that stuff up with time restrictions as well which we will talk about again in a minute so you've got a lot of antivirus stuff that's going on in this and you can turn it on and off as work it you know if you don't want it but it's just another layer of protection that can also stop you from DDoS attacks and brute force attacks they've essentially just kind of got almost like when Popeye eats his spinach that's kind of what the Trend Micro stuff has brought to the table with this it's almost like an enterprise level another layer of protection that they've now brought in with the wireless routers as well now we were talking about QRS before quality of service and the parental controls on these are actually really really good you can turn specific devices wireless on and off as and when you want so for argument's sake if you've got a young child that goes to bed with a huddle or an iPad or something like that you can deny the access to Wi-Fi for that device for argument sake from nine o'clock onwards that's the time that they're meant to go to bed you can actually you can take control of that now it may seem a bit like Big Brother and you're taking control of stuff too much but how many of you out there had trouble getting them to go to sleep when because you have to actively go in and turn stuff off or if you do like your voters and stuff you then have to manually go in on the nine 192.168 and go in and deny it manually one you can do it all automatically and you don't have to have anything to do with it and you can just tell him when it goes off that's when it goes off for everyone um but anyway let's leave the parenting out of it you get the idea and if that's made you smile and go oh my god then that little section was for you so again with the parental controls you can completely deny access to certain devices not just all of them to adult instant message and communications peer to peer and file transfer and streaming and entertainment yes I am reading from my notes but with that you can also do it again around a schedule so for I can say got a teenager there up till 3 o'clock in the morning talking them to their mates on skype or whatsapp which is a really important one you can set the instant message and comms to turn off for argument's sake at 11 o'clock so with those type of things in mind I think you're starting to understand why a I've kept notes and B why I was actually quite impressed with these because I've now got because of parents passing I've now got at my young sister I living with me and trying to get them to go to bed is ridiculous so these type of things going to make me really annoying really annoying the other thing is with the that protection that we put in don't forget that then kind of gives you as a parent some really nice peace of mind in the fact that you know that they can't stumble on the wrong things and then you can also kind of set cut-offs and you don't have to have anything to do with it and these just kind of dropped on and get on and do their work and like I said when stuff goes off stuff goes off so it's brilliant I love the fact that you can set it and you can do it literally it's set for times and days of the week as well so don't go thinking that now on Saturdays and Sundays they're still going to be getting turned off no you can leave it tightly open so there's loads of stuff for that that art is really really good the other thing is aces have actually brought a mobile app that you can use once you're in your home work that you can go in and do all of the stuff that you would normally do through the browser app with the browser out you pretty much do 192.168.1.1 and then you are signed in to the router and then dot 1.0 I can't remember now anything at dot one dot one I'm pretty sure is no it is dot one dot one I'm being silly sitting sign in and then you that's how you configure everything that a and keep a look at anything but now they've got this mobile app as well so you don't even necessarily need all the time because sometimes you do need to get on to be able to you know get active properly but with a lot of it you can keep an eye on what's going on who's signing in who's not signing in who's using what via the app one of the other things that I didn't talk about with the QoS is you can actually and this is something again that may be really really handy now this is probably for those of you out there that got the router in your room because you're the computer boss in the house mom and dad don't really know a great deal or you know if you are dad and the kids don't really know a great deal you can set up bandwidth limitations war bah now you may think to so we want to do that for well let's face it a lot of you out there have probably been doing stuff and the kids are absolutely just gobbling up all of the bandwidth there either on YouTube downloads and if you're not one of those people that's lucky enough to have like a cable package where you're running ie ninety one hundred and sixty two hundred mega second you're one of the people that are still out in the sticks and you'd ban what's a bit limited you can actually tell what their device is allowed so if you've got eight megabits a second and you effectively need five for your gaming you can then limit everybody else to that three so you can go in and say for argument's sake the that phone is only allowed discs because let's face it if she wants to watch YouTube she can get on a laptop and then the laptops allowed this much you can literally throttle that down and again you can do that bandwidth limitations and you can set that all up with time schedules as well which is brilliant the fact that we've got so much control over everything absolutely amazing now one of the things I do want to say is I think this is like kind of a big office style router because you've got all the connections for the switch on the back um and you've only got the dual networking so you look 2.4 and then you've got 5 gigahertz this one is the hard core wireless router we've only got the 4 ports on the back but one of the things I can say is I think this is for like a hard core if you've got maybe like a big house but a lot of devices going on so you've got your TV set up on wireless four-plex and everyone's doing the you know like the streaming for the on-demand stuff and you've got games phones iPad this is the hardcore Wireless and box that yeah you might have a PC attached to it somewhere along the lines as well but pretty much everyone's like running off of the wireless this is going to be that you one that you want this is the Big Daddy one that extra five gigahertz networks going to make a big difference you can also if you want use this as an access point as well so if you had both of them for argument's sake which is something that's really been tickling me you can set it up so this is just an access point and this does all their router e stuff and this is just like a giant wireless router that's stuck off in the distance this one I think is for someone that's got more wired devices maybe someone like me that you've got a couple of systems in the room and then a limited kind of wireless connection so don't normal you know a few phones maybe a laptop TV for argument sake but this one is more based on that wired because of all the connections of the switch now with the connections with the switch that could be a home server could be an as I've got a network printer this is going to stop you and maybe the possibility of not needing to buy the extra external switch with both of them the only time that you would need an external switch is if you were really interested in that link aggregation coming from in ads or your server and you've got two lines going into that you may need an external switch with full manual control so that you can get that link aggregation going on to your main rig as well I know that the the newer Asus x99 and Dead 170 motherboards that do have the dual in dual Intel Ethernet they can be teamed up so that you can team them up with this like I was talking about before so if you're if you're really interested in big big Network stuff across the big big speeds across your network then that's any time that you may need to think about a separate managed switch if you're not and you just wants them to be able to get as much data into this as possible and then everybody else either on normal Ethernet running at max capacity and Wireless running at max capacity then the link aggregation on this I will be absolutely fine for your nest and your home server right so I think now you may have started to understand why that I gave some time to review some routers I ended up deciding to give them because the 88 comes in at 299 and the AC 5300 comes in at 399 now this one the extra cost is because of all those extra antennas the fact that you've got the extra and Wireless 5 gigahertz so that's where the extra price comes from with this one so I decided I was going to give them both the performance award now they are I personally think this is as close as you're going to get 2 rogg routers because they they look absolutely mental I've actually used both of these as well and testing and spent time with these with the mobile app testing the Wireless and like I said I'm totally sold even the one with the four antennas made a huge difference to my home use but the difference between this was crazy I you know you could see the difference so if you've got massive houses or you're unlucky like me and I've got really thick walls and struggling going even into the next room with wireless signal drop this will make a pretty large difference to your use and then that's why I've not given you too much about speeds in the light because the speeds that I get home will be drastically different to the type of speeds that you may get depending on the way everything's laid out so OSI 3d Performance Award for both of them totally aggressive looks this one you're going to need to get yourself some we're dedicated to put it so that you can get the antennas and everything set up this one is more kind of generic not going to take up too much room I could easily be mounted down the back of your your desk or on a windowsill or something like that and you won't have too many issues but this is the one more than like any of them that's mainly want to think about lighting them up and when a router got me excited and I was like oh I could start playing with that that is the moment that it made me realize I was totally sold and I actually really like them yes there I water in but I think the amount that they deliver kind of backs it up so you've got the two different ones you can decide which one would be best for you do you have the room for them and all that type of stuff are you hardcore Wireless I do need a few more Network ports that type of thing and then you can work out when you need to spend that extra hundred pounds or not but I can wholeheartedly recommend them because even I want them so ot 3d Performance Award I've taken enough of your time thank you for tuning in hope I covered everything if I didn't don't forget click the link underneath and go to the OC 3d forums like I have said in a couple of the other videos recently if you're having troubles getting your email there your verification email through from the forums if you're trying to join some email providers at the moment are blocking our emails getting through so if you do get any problems either tweet us or hit the contact us link and I can manually add you and then you'll get your access because sometimes it looked like you remember but you can't post or anything like that that's just because you've not fully authorized your email yet so if you get any problems hits up I will get you on we would love to have you but for now at least this is tiny Tom Logan reviewing routers I never thought I'd review routers but these are Horton so out in I was a bit delayed the Illinois mmm yeah just give up the today tom
