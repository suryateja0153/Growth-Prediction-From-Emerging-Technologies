 good morning welcome everybody to our how webinars just going to focus on high capacity Wi-Fi planning my name's Craig Charles on the sales manager from reality the lines are on mute or if anyone's got any questions during the presentation please feel free to use the chat box and we're going to have a Q&A over the end of the session yeah so in terms of the agenda for today it's on to do a quick instruction for open reality for you guys who don't know us and then we're going to pass it over to the guys account we're going to be covering the high capacity planning a presentation and then we're going to do a bit on the end covering the latest features in version 9 and like step we're then going to do the Q&A so as morality I think we've got a mix of customers and our customers that don't but views don't we are the sole distributor in the UK's breakout and actually myself and ask how sharing something in common moment so we're both celebrating our 10 year anniversary with open reality so I've sinned over the sort of 10 years you know how much the Cork's products and the brand is sorry sorry sorry guys you're keeping your enemy yeah we were just clapping for the anniversary sorry all right I couldn't quite make out so yeah BSA 2016 for us has been an has been a really really good year I think sales of the software we're looking at year-on-year growth of in excess of 60 percent and like I said yeah over 10 years there's a sort of developers content to the product and the brand has been excellent well I think that's been really really popular the last couple years to see the crazy training courses and I think we've got a few people on there here today they've been on them probably the end of the presentation Carlos is going to cover up some of the dates that we've got for 2017 but yeah we're looking at kind of in excess of a hundred people we've trained up on accredited courses this year and then sort of testament to the products popularity is this webinar actually and these slides have put together a couple of days ago Inc as of this morning we have close to 700 people registered for this event which is an amazing number so all in all things are going really really well so you guys don't know that this is our echo team and so existing customers you'll probably know Steve and that really well Jax of any new addition to our team and Carlos is our Technical Specialist so you guys have had one-to-one demos you'll probably be familiar with Carlos so this seems kind of focusing mainly on our color IT system integrator reseller business there are other account managers which you guys might know who focus on some of the end user accounts so yeah if you guys will include some contact information at the end some even on the web demos for you'll probably know her from UC amico before but these the guys are doing the presentation today so that's pretty much covered why I want to so if there's any any questions go on to the equity website or you know please contact your relevant account managers and I will now pass over to UC to do the presentation varieties go going good going good okay so yeah thanks everybody for joining much much appreciated thanks open reality guys for the intro and for sitting the whole thing off no I stated previously we'd very much like working with the Opera reality check chefs they've done a fantastic work across the board tons of echo expertise in-house there as well and you know we love we are based in Helsinki Finland but we love coming down to London as well right Miko so on and so so uh you know if any of the customers needed us on site that's definitely impossible yes give us an excuse to come over there alright anyway so today we're gonna talk about Wi-Fi capacity planning and take a quick look and do site survey 9.0 while added so we're still a few months out from the release but you know why not take a look at what where we are so far anyways yeah I stated before we love working with you over reality guys and this is not just you know to get us you know we really do enjoy so you know you guys are in very good hands if you're in the UK if you're dialing in from outside of the UK we have a pretty good distribution network across Europe as well and yeah all right this is us from the echo site I'm you see that's my old title which I apparently haven't updated but yeah I do a bunch of janitorial duties here at Echo being here for for ages and with me I have mix alright guys so yeah I'm running brand management team here I like dancing celebratory anyways that's me from a from our party ten years ago this time actually our marketing lady those internet you you've lost some weight seems sure that yes I've been exercising quite a lot you also must stop your muscles though but yes that's yeah you've got to stop at endurance training anyways if you're not on Twitter already and if you're interested in Wi-Fi go on Twitter follow us and you know or or see what we follow you know all the latest and greatest Wi-Fi information is there the white papers videos conferences you know all the discussions there okay quickly about how we believe we are these days the market leader in Wi-Fi network design tools so we do start service was planning to spectrum analyzer stuff like that we're a small company with R&B in Helsinki Finland distribution network hopefully or fun stuff and then we do different kinds of products won't take too much of your time but I'll say this so our flagship product is the sides are a pro and 3d planner which runs on no Windows notebooks tablets desktops what have you and it also these days runs on Mac that's still in beta but it's air available from our website as well as the Windows versions we also carry a spectrum analyzer that nicely integrates with the site survey pro tool as well so during your survey you'll be also gathering spectrum data and then we have an Android app for you know spot checking problematic sports or seeming quickly you know does my net worth work overall or not and if not what fails these kind of things so so that's the toolkit what's happened with us recently in the last year or so we released a few products we brought in 8.0 which has the automatic wall wizard or watering wizard Wow or organic wizard and we released 8.1 with different kinds of improvements including importing PDF drawing suite we released 8.5 where most notably we brought in spectrum analyzer integration and what we call real-time frequency meter or RTS in bunch of other features there as well and not right now we are eight point six eight point six point two actually so that's very useful really is in case for example you're using Windows always with the most modern laptops now user interface of the tool actually automatically scales so that you know if you have a high-resolution display doesn't look tiny the text is scaled automatically stuff like that alright and that's in the last two and a half years I just counted this we've done something like six hundred improvements to the product so it pays off to keep your support up to date and if you're in the UK pays off to you know conduct your own reality chats our exclusive distributor there and get your support contract valid all right then there's a you know in terms of customers our partners hung roughly one hundred out of the fortune 500 music how are you you're not alone there's some here in terms of for example the biggest systems integrators globally on in the US use us as owners things like that and then we work very closely with the Cisco's a robust ruckuses all the Wi-Fi infrastructure vendors all right couple of words before we go to the actual subject is our education and training options which we open really you guys touched earlier real quick with not do the same so if you go to take a lot of contrast training there's a ton of free stuff there for you to use like you know training videos how to use best practices webinar recordings this one will be there as well also definitely material words worth checking then we do one-to-one webinars for example especially if you're in the pre-sales face and kind of debating whether to you know use competing products or us just hit up Nick or Jerry let's meet at a common Jerry at a code calm and you know ask them to give you a one hour show and and then we have our eco certified survey engineer or the ECSC certification done by the absolute greatest Wi-Fi minds the brightest Wi-Fi minds in the industry including teeth Parsons CW and a number three founder of wireless LAN professionals and getting a team CW me number one we also like to call the godfather of Wi-Fi there's also you know we have tons of other great trainers like Blake crony firm in Munoz Renee freedom and so you know the best of the best in terms of Wi-Fi give our classroom group trainings it's a four day training the open reality guys host piece for us in the UK and that they be hugely successful more information on our website or on the open real English and then there's the a Mahal master certification so this is a very small group of people chosen annually if you're very heavy you saw Rebecca Howe and your Wi-Fi expert then you might want to apply for a gun on master so this is a group of people that we discuss with you know very closely in terms of upcoming products of upcoming versions things like that and we also just a couple of months ago we took this group to Iceland in the middle of nowhere into a luxury hotel in Iceland so you know discussed future direction of Wi-Fi is the future direction of a car how things like that okay so uh we already have the poll of our who was here a lot of time we have the results - no maybe because we have associates oh that's lost at now so we've got one called have you attended the account webinar before so really just to get an idea of our audience and who's the first-time viewer and who's joining us again so guys if you could answer the poll questions has come up you'd really be helping us because it just allows us to focus on the information that we get you after today so let's just let that run for a couple of seconds and fantastic I can see that things are almost there so we let's stop that one in us have a look at so fifty-nine percent of people are saying that they've attended before 41 percent haven't so guys thank you very much that make will make sure we get the relevant information across to you after today and you see back to you thank you for should we watch another fall about you know what our tools people use as well yes cause we can so again guys just to allow us to see what you guys are using so we've got at just another poll just to see who's using actor Howard and who's not and again it just allows us to see what information we need to send to you after today so don't worry if you're using a mixture of solutions to still put yes you're using eka help and so fantastic looks as though about 74 percent of people are using active house so about a quarter of our audience today are either new or I haven't used the solution before so towards that poll thank you maybe one more related to this one know about that that's all I've got for the time being apart from the the one for ECSE is a bit later so I if you don't that suppose that one for now that's cool okay can you still see my screen you we can yep so on this is what it's about today's one option when you'd be signing Wi-Fi is this so you know you spend minimal amount of time gathering through the requirements of the network and planning and validation but then you waste maximum amount of time troubleshooting the Wi-Fi network I'm sure this rings the bell for many of you and we want to avoid that and this is rather what we like you know you you're gonna have to do it you know spend a lot of or spend spent some time defining the network requirements properly and designing the network so that you know we can take it easy in the long term because if a lot of Wi-Fi administrators say that if I if I have dibs on the network and I know I've made a sound design it's usually a client problem if the network has a so it just makes troubleshooting so much easier and so much the list anyways these have agreed previously on a co-host site survey baby number this happened like six months ago something like that when we had at our previous webinar we talked about how sitting on a Wi-Fi network is kind of like setting up a bar where you know you know in a bar you have bartender and customers and wine with Wi-Fi networks you have a knack access points and then you have client devices and while the the goal of the bartender is to get wine from the bottoms that glass our goal is to get data from the API to the client devices so kind of kind of similar things and then we talk about what's high-capacity and what's not this definitely is high capacity you know the typical high capacity telltale signs are there tons of clients hi day the demand oxalate peeps and then we talk about why these guys unhappy remember that it's kind of summarized many of the Wi-Fi issues because these folks here are getting high data rate so they have direct access to the bartender while these two chaps here are increasing the noise level and that's why this guy here has low signal strength and very low s and then we talked about capacity calculations you know involving you need to understand the number of client devices the distribution of clients where they are drinking wine or shots or beer meaning what our applications are they running over Wi-Fi and then of course client type is of importance as well is it a single stream client multi-stream client a dogeleven in or AC things like that and we summarized last last week's presentations in a few things first of all we need to maximize airtime in the network by minimizing the number of a society is preferring v we get things like that then we need related to that we need to ensure high data rate and there's you know certain rules of thumb to ensure that and then we need to calculate the need for capacity and this certain methods you can do do it there as well and that leads us to today's topic already 25 minutes past the hour but we're getting there so the problems with current capacity planners and all the planners to some extent including hours to be honest this is the first of all whatever makeup you are using to increase capacity in their network or to high capacity over a population of ApS is a common problem and adding ApS often doesn't help it actually hurts the network so don't do that do what bellman does don't do what Robin does don't do the apprentice mistake of adding more a piece adding more appears after one another you're running to CCI or hotel in the first and another problem that you know capacity planning you run into is what's called hallway Phi so placing a piece in hallways only causing massive amounts of CGI or cultural immigrants so try to avoid always put try to avoid this kind of the science where all babies are in the hallways and put them in rooms instead then one thing is you need to be disabling but to some of the 2.4 gigahertz radios if you're doing high capacity given that in in a typical high capacity network the 80s are so close to one another that there just isn't enough available channel from 2.4 unless you start disabling them if you don't then your one again into massive amounts of co-channel interference but now the capacity planners out there do that automatically no no no the capacity planners or auto planners out there automatically disable 2.4 gigahertz radios none of them really know how to in a smart way avoid overpopulation of APs and then of course these days some of the access points out there support doin five demerits for example the z score 38 hundreds and I believe era high also has as a duo fiber capable ap right me correct them yeah so so you want to take advantage of that if possible as well so this is just to underline that statement some of the ApS can be in two four five Oh some of them can be two or five what have you it's called a flexible radio assignment which sister and then what our current capacity planner for example does not support is some areas in a building are higher capacity than others so so in our current version you need to plan for for you know evenly distributed capacity across the building and we wanted to overcome that so just to summarize those are some of the challenges with current or Dubliners capacity planners out there and what are we doing about it then what are we bringing in nine one zero first of all we allow the user to define normal areas versus high capacity areas separately so you can punch in how many client devices will there be different areas the areas to overlap things like that and that's actually an actual sketch by our UI designers or so those are from our intranet that's a spec for the developer then we have a completely rewritten ap placement algorithm and we've been doing this for more than a year now we have two two of the brightest Wi-Fi Minds at the office just doing this so we wanted to first of all avoid eighty overpopulation so that we actually maximize the air time and stop adding ApS unless it's necessary and our rewritten ap placement algorithm the Forex hallway placement it avoids placing a Vision Quest or elevator shafts without even marking restrooms and an elevator shaft separately on the map so it has built-in intelligence about the building structure and we have completely agree within our channel allocation algorithm which now automatically can disable those unnecessary - for numerous ratios and it supports dual 5b cards as well we also made our capacity planner more accurate so we'll be bringing in settings for minimum data rate band steering number of SSI bees things like that and RTS CTS as well so to summarize what we call our auto planner version 2.0 which will mean ESS 9.0 will be a lot better in a lot of ways so how does it work what do you say we take a look at where we are today Miko any any common questions for now so forth gum gum question has been about yesterday yes yes yes I hope anyways yeah yeah so so something's definitely coming next year for iOS well anyways where were we we were in the demo so let me screen-sharing for one open up a cross-eyed servant thank you can you guys still see my screen car literally carry excellent are we still on the air I guess we are yeah all right and you can see ESS groaning correct super good what we're gonna do is we're gonna make a really simple plan just to demonstrate the the auto planner in e-commerce I serve a 9.0 so this is a development copy so you know something goes south it's not a real product so on you know and anything can go south as we know from past experience anyway for those of you that haven't been there or haven't recently used our tool I'm gonna hold in a random cat floorplan so in cat form a DWG I guess this was so this was something I just a public map that I was able to grab from the internet and usually the cat Maps looks would look like this this is the preview of the cat file on the right hand side we have the map preview and what we actually want to do is make this a little cleaner I want to get rid of that you know the margins the text things like that so up here in the top right hand side corner I don't know if you know many of you have known this piece but there's the layout selector for the camp drawing so clicking that allows you to see what kind of views different layouts have been stored this cat file by the architect so this is the one we are using right now but what I want to do is I actually want to take the cleaner layout this one to use so that you know it's just want to work with with the cleaner plan so I'm gonna select that and the tool is going to reload the upper layers of that and that looks much better and bottom right a corner you can see that we are automatically detecting the scale and on the left hand side we have the layers of the drawing this is already in yes eight points starting eight point five at least eight zero brought the categories are already what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna choose the main layers such as doors which T is automatic it closes and I'm going to select an attenuated material for the doors like our wood door there then I'm going to take glass which means glass obviously gonna put in interior window for that material and then done don't worry you can edit these materials after the fact if you you know happen to choose the wrong one or whatever then I'm gonna take drywall or they are or the main walls yeah that looks already pretty good so the areas highlighted with either black dark black color or dark blue have already been assigned a material so that would actually decent what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna it important and instead of us drawing all of the walls on the building the wall outlining wizard automatically detects the walls takes a while to calculate as it simplifies the building structure as well automatically so here we go that's that's decent looks pretty good we have all all the walls all the doors everything in place and then we could start planning of course manually just like before so take take an AP and just start dropping those on the math that's certainly possible I'm gonna go to Cisco 3800 cuz I just love those near a piece so you can see obviously our coverage is calculated for the API place manually if that's pretty standard stuff and you can see and this is exactly why you should avoid hallway five for them for the most part is if you place all the eighties in the corridor they will travel you know the signals will go very very far and then eventually you will run out of channels for scotch on in reference so that's many of planning and that's all you know we all know how that works so let's actually get to the auto planner and the same area tool is still there but it now just works a bit differently when you click the area tool first of all you can select what kind of coverage you want for this area so we want to do Boyd coverage which is pretty standard thing so let's just do that and I'm gonna go an area let's say everywhere in the building we need Boyd coverage so let's just let's just say there's no high-capacity requirement for the entire building when chest for some of the areas but in the entire building we want Boyd Boyd great coverage which you know makes 60 seven PVC in a string things like that okay so there we have that let me clean up the a piece alright so there we have that and now what we are gonna do is we're gonna do another area we have these three conference rooms or our lecture halls in this building so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna mark all of those three with just one shot there we go and in total in those three lecture halls we are expecting 1,000 devices actually so gonna hit hit that and we're expecting by default the tool calculates a 50/50 split between black box and and smartphones and that's a pretty typical for example in a lecture hall environment so we're just gonna leave it at that but of course I make all the noise I'm gonna break it but correctly capacity to show the advanced capacity dialog let's go ahead let's do it to it you know blue screen so so there you can see that of course I put 1,000 so it could automatically 500 laptops 500 smartphones and these of course can then be edited you know you can change the device types and distribution of devices and things like that let's just to show that's how it works alright and and then it's time to pass the order of banner to calculate the actual plan so again we wanted to use a z-score a piece here so we're gonna put Cisco 3800 operating in two point four and five in the Hertz mode would have optimized the coverage for fire the gig maybe we could drop the tube for traffic power as well but in this case we don't necessarily need to and let's free up all the channels for the for the order of an RAM and just to say this is not the finalized our channel planner dialog for example so we can look at the sketch how it's going to look like for example we will be enabling you know choosing to find your Hertz channels each one separately and things like that so so we'll take a look at the sketch of the actual how this dialog will look like in 9.0 later it just hasn't been implemented yet so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hit create plan and see what happens takes a while to calculate dialog and there we go so what happens here is the plan has been made and observe let me take out the walls so we can see the areas better this area number two here that we could clearly remember that has significantly more a piece than the areas without capacity requirement yet still it has ideal coverage everywhere for five gig it just has more AP is assigned on the arm on the small area and as you can tell some many of the 2.4 gigahertz radios have been disabled you can see off here on there on the radios and also the tool has for the most part avoided all Wi-Fi as well so so the APS are rather placed in in the rooms for the most part and not so much in the hallways so that's kind of how how the new planner works more a keys where more capacity is needed disabled 2.4 gigahertz radios even utilized two or five gigahertz that that will be an optional later as well so that's it's just one of the things and we really put a lot of effort in the usability part as well you saw that it's now much easier to make the plan compared to the previous capacity planning user interface and we will be bringing out improvements also to the capacity analysis heat maps and things like that too but more about that later maybe if we take a quick look on the snapshots from our from our development board here's what the order planner dialog will roughly look like this is again a direct a snapshot from our development intranet so you define the areas what's what's new and relevant about this is really the very ability to individually select channels on five your Hertz and also define the minimum data rate define bank steering percentage between two four and five the number of exercises things like that just so that we can more easily more quickly calculate those things and this dialogue you already saw and what else should be a promise 49.0 in publishers besides the new order planner company the planner should really have you been telling so far it's like any discussion I have with you sorry I didn't pay any attention have you seen the movie Big Lebowski yes the police officer this is a really good question it that's being repeated quite a lot that might be worth bringing in at this point it's all to do around Mac Apple Mac and the the mid 300s so obviously other plans to add provide drivers to the NIC 300s for Apple Mac this day I was reading our minds that's exactly what we were coming to as well so yeah yeah it's public webinar yes no anyway so all we can say is yes Mac will come out of beta or is planned to come out of beta in 9.0 as well so so that also means that we will have an adapter that will be working really good with Mac is that fair to say that is fair to say yes how about any 300 out there no more comments what we're saying guys just watch this space in the new year ah what's this based on February 21st I can't give you anything it's very first yes and be there at the WLAN pros US Conference on February 21st because that's where is his plan to happen unless stuff hits the fan and we delay it and then we've come up with a lame excuse speakers lots there on some other topic such as nickel sumo wrestling and my bunnyears fantastic so I think you're gonna webcast that aren't you so what we'll do is we'll make sure that we we republish that for anybody that wants to attend exactly yeah yeah that's what we should do but really I know we have only just 45 minutes but really that's all we have to say about 9:20 right now we could take a couple of couple of question and actually this just in from our sales director we will also be at the arrows this is a European webinar we will also be launching this at Cisco live Berlin so system at Berlin is also happening on February 21st and from there or out so if you happen to be around comes to quietly a github booth and we will be hosting on some kind of a launch party there as well so in case you're around our sales director know anyways yeah that's that's most we have for now or any any common question still that should be answered any any words from Oprah reality yeah absolutely so to guys anybody that of the hasn't seen a cow before but obviously would like a more detailed one two one I know you see mentioned that I'll see there are a couple of guys with a neck house that can do that it's it's one of the things that I do day in and day out so do please put it in the chat box in the questions if you would like to see a one-to-one if you haven't seen a cow before if you've got a much older version and haven't seen the latest features I'd be very happy to run something that's much more interactive and only we can tailor something that allows you to see exactly what you want to see in terms of questions that there's lots are around the high capacity and but maker is is there anything that you specifically want to reiterate because I realize you're going through the questions and a lot more detail than we are yeah just going through the list there's actually quite a lot of them nothing for now I could come up bring this up separately hold on so let me reset through all right just to reiterate what Carlos said person Carlos demo King demo King definitely if you're in the UK there's no better person than Carlos to give you a demo and if you're outside of outside the UK just you know hit us up or our distributors and we'll take care of it for sure we say so it looks like at the hospital a 9.0 might finish 50 min eternal well anything that the in terms of questions we will take offline and they'll see we'll get answers to you lots of individual questions which is why I think Miko's struggling to come up with with common questions I mean for instance you see there's lots of things like when setting the high-density settings for lecture theaters you still have boyd selected even though it was for laptops and smartphones was this correct so probably a little bit more detail on how we assign different applications would probably be good to reiterate at this stage that's a good question there's two two things that they cost I survey takes into account when doing the plan first one is what we call coverage requirement so that's that's for example point requires a certain level of coverage and that's why you see boy there even regardless of your application and that's kind of the primary step in capacity planning or in anyway my planning is ensure that you have decent coverage and decent amount of AP overlap and then after that we start looking at what kind of applications are running how many devices things like that and that's where the number of devices and the applications coming again and that's where it you might you know run into void two times first when we're doing the coverage planning and secondly when we're doing the capacity plan but it's it's in a sense that we could actually make it more intuitive user interface wise as well because his computer Miko had something to back no I like to the point is bring out one question from Greg Martin about the stadium deployments whether they have this what is called this or are we going to be supporting this we'll see we'll see it's a dvd/cd difficult thing is push 4040 algorithm itself and it's specific for the UI but it's being asked more and more so of course we probably need to do something about it so I'll take for now - yeah keeping in touch or requesting this exactly exactly so for now there's no perfect solution for for that in our total intake inclined floor so you have to work your way around it yeah yeah we decided to keep right I remember you is finding me from from your you were doing a meeting with the development guys regarding the UI and you spied me do we still need SCA or simply in five seconds it's car yeah exactly did I yeah so yeah we will keep single channel architecture still there good question excellent question and kudos to Mitch Mickey maro Mitch I know he still asleep but does this person work with me there Stan it's your loss yeah yeah we do Windows 10 64 bit we even do Mackey beta hey good question the second support be a lady sign for location-tracking do we support ble design for location tracking I know people have worked around it right go on Twitter to find out how but we don't officially support it yet but let us know how exactly it should work let's actually have a conference call with this guy who was asking for it if you're up for it email you see at economic calm that still USSR that covered calm or tweet me and we'll set up a call and ask what exactly it is that you would mean yeah so Robert believes send us an email yeah cool great question anything else well one week is looking for another question it's probably worth reiterating the address where if somebody has an idea for a function within a cool new ApS and the address of where to request obviously that function because I know you guys always welcome anything that supports our our customers in the field yeah exactly not that we ever implement anything that's asked but of course our Director of Product Management Nico would be happy to receive those xiaomi mi kk o powdered calm that's em i kk o at economic comp and what was the I'm supposed to be expecting and then apparent requests feature requesting yeah you put me under the bus in the last presentation so it was okay well one has to be the focus on being removed when exporting every port we didn't expect anyone to actually use it so we do it off our we got quite a lot of feedback that you guys were idiots so we brought it back so fondly so we thought this Tuesday we released a new year such person age of 62 and it's bang again so PDF is bad good question though just open your ESS and check for updates it automatically check for updates update your tool and Mark Peter is asking about it's possible to be fun areas where it is cannot be placed yes it is possible by defining exclusive areas yeah exactly so I draw another coverage area on top of coverage area on the current on the current release yeah enjoy it while it no I swear we will bring it bring the two back maybe all right any other greatest American oh I'm absolutely sure because they keep on being more and more a piece and then finish all the time it's big difficult follow-up yeah as soon as we get the products we sue em to DSS yeah but the goal is to Cisco Meraki I will buy our era value name it they are all there and if something's not there let us know at mi ke ke o and we'll be sure when you see it says no no being released February 21st we're planning on releasing it when I get the end give us oh you're sick man any profiles for ubiquitous who would you have something before you begin and maybe not often there's a specific vikre t that obviously you'd like to see that isn't in the list again please do let us know either listed in in the chat line and we'll help you respond to that or do feel free to email me co directly with any model number specifically that you'd like to see Dave progress asking for it is possible to try the current capacity or the current version we have for the high capacity planning right now it's not available for beta but I believe yes it's gonna be available for beta but I can't promise when hopefully our late December we could actually give it out for beta we'll see I can't promise that cool Royko I think the problem in we're going to have is the fact that the questions are coming
