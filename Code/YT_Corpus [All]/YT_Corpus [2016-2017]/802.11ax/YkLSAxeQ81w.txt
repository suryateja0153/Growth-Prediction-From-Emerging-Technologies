 for RCR TV i'm sean kinney and welcome to head net happenings where we take a look at all things dass small cell Wi-Fi and much more welcome back to head net happenings we've got a Qualcomm theme show for you this week earlier in the month I took a quick trip out to Qualcomm's headquarters in La Jolla just up the road from San Diego got to take a look at some of their emerging technologies I think the folks in the audience who are headed to Barcelona for Mobile World Congress can see these demos in person at the Qualcomm booth but for those of you who are not making a trip I'm glad I get to share these clips because this is some really high tech stuff now Qualcomm cuts a pretty wide swath through the wireless and mobile industries they supply chips to Samsung for their devices as well as lots of other companies chances are your handset has some Qualcomm technology in it they also play in Wi-Fi which is what we're going to take a look at first in this clip we're going to see what Qualcomm is doing around the 802 11 ady spy standard adopted by the I Triple E what this does is it expands Wi-Fi from the two point four and five gigahertz bands up into the 60 gigahertz band this has a lot of implications for consumers particularly around next generation video so think like 4k streaming and that sort of thing so let's hear from Qualcomm on 802 11 ad 60 degrees we've been working on for since about 2007-2008 I think you saw at CES and I know a number of you wrote about those demos that we had there any announcements basically we're taking 16 egrets and just bringing it to to be the third band of Wi-Fi so everything you can do in two point four and five you'll be doing in 60 and obviously there are some unique characteristics that provide tremendous value in 60 acres right so you're going to go up to 4.6 gigabits per second rather than the couple hundred megabits per second that you're getting in the 2.4 five band extremely low latency allowing for you no good basically lag free video and we when we were at CES we announced pretty much all the categories that that if we're going to be shipping into the access points we talked PP link NEC elecom the pc acer and asus and the first lfeb phone here so before we do this demo there's also the announcement that we made with intel so now again all of the products that in Fallon's is putting out from the pc side will be interoperable with the access points that we are providing so they've been talking about how they're going to open up their IP stack so in addition to their docking they'll be doing just traditional Wi-Fi as well we've been working very closely to ensure that all of the products that we're doing and they're doing or working well together so obviously to build the ecosystem there so the two demos that we've got here is first we've got the foam and we basically made like a little media hub this is just a reference design that these guys will be bringing to market for all intents and purposes that that is a full access point and video distribution so if you look in the back of that you can connect to it multiple devices can connect to it you've got USB and you can add storage in the back of it as well so you can move pictures and content so it actually is a full multimedia hub rather than just a video streamer but we can do video streaming and then here we just have a speed test which is which has got the dial so we get to it so basically this is yeah so we just hit start here and we're going upwards of 2.4 2.7 gigabits per second it's bouncing around a little bit but you know you can see a maintain throughput of over two gigabits per second into the phone you guys think of clothes yeah far and away the fastest link that you're going to get in in each of the phone and then the question is again now that you've got this beat what do you do with it right obviously it changes the way you can kind of handle your own personal data you can do full phone syncs sink and go a type of application instantaneously point-of-sale type of applications like kiosks you can actually buy content and have it you know you get off the train station we go you buy content it's on your phone by the time of the next train comes and then the streaming and gaming and low latency applications that's pretty much what we're driving here so we're trying to hit all the different pieces from end to end from the access point to the client side and then just were you other than raw speed overall bandwidth does he have any latency reducing features / and or a senior I think well it's basically because of the Ross P there's a it is it is optimized for latency because you know it was built with you know some certain applications that have very low latency requirements like it initially doing some PCI Express you're doing wireless Pizza Express why is USB type of applications so it does optimize but you know again once you've got the raw speed then you can reduce the compression ratios and the latency just goes down so it gets more than a physical nature yeah and here we just again we're streaming video once again the Snapdragon 820 platform at it's on cans 44 a video encoding from capture so basically you could take pictures you can take video and then you can just put it right up on the screen or take the files which get pretty large when you're when you're capturing 4k video and immediately offload them so once you're part of the 60 Gators network as soon as you have this big files that you're creating you can immediately offload them onto your home network and as we add capacity and complexity to Wi-Fi networks it's important from a user perspective to provide the intelligence to manage and optimize that complexity you've heard the buzz words on self-organizing networks in this next clip we're going to see a great demo of Qualcomm's Wi-Fi sond solution they've got a Wi-Fi access point and a Wi-Fi range extender with multiple devices connected so let's take a look to see how this technology dynamically manages the network self managing is basically when you have a network they have access point and an extender a range extender a repeater how the devices have to be distributed between them so that there is good load balancing going on a good example would be if you're if you're in a home you the coverage in your bedroom is not good but you have a TV they're working on Wi-Fi so how you can improve the county's you put a range extender a repeater in the bedroom so if you carry your phone TV works fine with the Wi-Fi there but in the night you would carry your phone over to the vegetables and then it it basically connects the range extender it's fine the very morning we will come down on its own phone may not the phone may still be connected to the repeater your query or you're on your first floor now very close to the access point but it might still be connected to the range extender which means the performance on that phone is pretty bad it'd be better served if it is connected to the access point so that's a very simplistic example of how you know these complications might creep in so Wi-Fi so on and with itself configuring and self managing capabilities can switch that connection to the right right length what wire is the stunner so this is so it is done at the application layer as well as driver so what any good enough so we get we get the phones actually to do measurements and send back reports so like you know from when they are up to like the managing part and I'll guard amends on the user space yeah so the Wi-Fi Sun algorithms are part of a software package that point along with our chips apps so is a run to the fermentation sunday on the access point why not do it is a lower level what was that like a IP wobble already didn't know that why i forgiven if you know I key in the back Ania ok so so yeah I mean like you know we have parts of it in yeah so what we have here is the main access point are we like which is depicted here on the others and we have a range extender outside interested and right now you know and then both of these access points have two bands the 25 gigahertz band that is depicted here and the 2.4 gigahertz band that's typical up there and right now we have these five devices here that are all associated with the 5 gigahertz band to the main router since there will cross the onion router ok what we also have is our traffic going on there's a skype call on on this one we just have a sideline point here and so the beauty of this algorithm is that while ends are in traffic or BTM capable devices that supports and I can't go to lot in the 10k and it worked out 11 these standards these devices can be moved seamlessly from one AP to the other without like dropping the call without any impact in the performance and actually you know the AP will make a decision as to what will serve the device best so once when we move these phones closer to the range extender and they will be steered to the range extender if left on their own they need the RSS side the signal strength to drop really low before they will move on their own but we don't want then the call will suffer and so we don't want that to happen so you know we have certain thresholds and we move it over if it will be so better by per injection we also do load balancing between the channels if you know if we see that there is more load on one of the channels and we will move devices to the other channel so that the performance is optimal and so we can show you yeah so next i will move this form two phones out too close to the range extender you will see they will move it to the end so here I mean the access points work with the phones and like I mentioned before they ask the phones to do measurements and then they will send a request to steer it to the other access point but if the device is caring and refused to move so most of them yeah so we did see he took two tones we did see that they moved to the range extender next what I do is start traffic on one of these wholesome and so as to over look like I'm gonna start traffic on this one so as to overload the five gigahertz pan and there we should see phones move moved up to 2.4 gigahertz and then you will also see that the backhaul link gets shifted shifted their as the traffic starts and in because we have adaptive path selection and so it selects the best as possible so the main AAP and the repeater are like link between them is also Wi-Fi so you don't need to run any keep a low key tonight now I'd like to move away from Wi-Fi and take a look at two other demonstrations I saw out at Qualcomm first up we've all heard about how important millimeter waves are likely to be to an ultimate 5g standard now millimeter wave operates in largely untapped high band spectrum and the waves have some challenging propagation characteristics that lots of people are working hard to figure out in this clip we're going to see a video link up between San Diego and New Jersey where some Qualcomm engineers are going to conduct a live demo of millimeter wave baby forming and steering veil as a part of 5g these are your large number of antennas beam steering and beam switching s key technologies in millimeter wave so the desperate that we have running and andrea's are going to go through the entire test weight and then they will be streaming this live from New Jersey so this is being done in our New Jersey office call from there and we'll be showcasing how things work but this is the demo that will be shown live in Barcelona as well and this is our first live 5g demo that will be done so honey as much of a coin know what you've done with the place it's very deserted yeah so yeah yeah view video so this is my colleague in New Jersey he's going to actually talk to you know most of the demo what you see here is like a sweet different monitors on the left side we basically like to see this three-dimensional like sphere and then on the right side you see more like the antenna configuration on the mobile side so you have different antenna elements and he's going to talk about you know once we see in speech and what they kind of mean this is actually happening in a New Jersey that's the empty floor in the building so we're using this as our testbed you can see here is the this is the base station set up and here's the mobile setup and basically we're going to move that around and you will see like kind of impact on that it's a 28 gigahertz link and in this case it's a pointer pointing but the base station could support multiple users as well and it's at 28 gigahertz frequency so one of the other things we talked about in the morning was that to validate the technology I mean you got to make sure that it works with different kinds of impairments including non line-of-sight communication as in it's not just that you can see the device in front of you but even bending around the corners etc and how do you beam steer accordingly how sensitive is 28 gigahertz for line-of-sight compared to 60 cuz SiC I'm fairly familiar with 60 is is there a significant difference for from the user perspective 228 there is a difference over there obviously just because of the propagation characteristics it becomes far more stringent non line of sight is a little more doable with 28 yards but it's not like there's a huge difference over there but I think the key part is some of the extensive amount of beam steering that is done in 28 acres you don't usually see that in products yet but 6428 leaders it's something that we believe that it's not only essential because that's the only way we can bring millimeter wave technology into the mobile world it's also a place of research for us how many antennas the mini admit we talked about two to four receive antennas in the morning not four millimeter wave that's not yet gonna cut it you need a larger number of antenna elements and so I was get it going to quickly also a six-degree goes also with our 11th ed products right there will be demonstrated access and using 11 ed and even there we say if you have a closed space you can still get yeah yeah I'm familiar I know it's not trying to get the how different 28 is to my vacation for a 60 and the focus of this demo is not so much on data rates it's more about I mean we already do mighty gigabit per second 1118 rock it surely as program on Draya said well beam steering technologies to bring it out in the move space control pause it go ahead okay so right now what you're seeing is the base station on the year the right size the screen and the you young collapse so book the bees actually I have a phased array system so for be tracking and beam scanning on the base station we have 128 elements there 16 of columns only is terrible natomas so there's no elevation steering and on the ue we have for supper raise of four antennas each and each of those sub arrays is a phased array so they also check the base station also will have a demo of first- line of sight operation and then show how the ue tracks the base station by turning the ue and then we'll move it back we show the base station which are the ue in both line of sight and then slightly non- sight in one scenario in the back the line of sight if you look at the GUI right now we can see that the base station and here we are facing each other so on the on the run right side where it's this movie TV station the antenna is essentially the theme is actually pointing straight to the left of your video screen so it's just right in the middle because this case in the ue right now the URI orientation essentially the ue is about a 30 degree and go facing out of the screen so where you see the red patches is where the energy is and then dust in that orientation of the video is that that you're pointing to that base station so right now base station you are pointing at each other and then reflected in the beam pattern of the base station and the red keep that each map of the tue so right now well first start by rotating the ue and will show that the left part of your screen will track the base station as the ue rotates and first you'll see that we're on the same sub array but you just saw that there's a beam pattern change so we're on the same sub array we sub arrays located four different thoughts on the form factor type of antenna module to really show what what we gettin over your handset and as we rotate another it's a different sub array so the accelerates combined kagura Omnitech that those type of space but they come to the whole sphere so as we turn the ue different stuff already taken and then the each other sub facebook track the ue the base station now we're moving back and at some point there's a column of mine in the middle of your screen and that's actually create an online aside typo link it's a talked on the video but that's actually right in between the ue and the base station and you can see now that the base station is also chatting you eat before we are pointing almost directly at 0 degrees and now we're at minus 20 little bit eerie is moving we're continually tracking it and the same thing with the tue theories also continue changing the base station so now we're again back into a minus site type of environment and the U is now facing the base station but now the vacation is share minus 30 degrees and this am I haven't actually in even though it is open space like this inside shape if a rich involves the hard environment it working because all these the windows that you see are very reflective other reflective is a lot of metal in this environment that are highly reflective um so it's somewhat proper environment the form of the incoming track the link then this outdoors in anyways so now we're moving to you mean further back and as you move further back well again position ourselves behind a few columns and they eventually get behind that partition wall so that the wall actually has a stairwell and elevator shaft behind it which is you can't penetrate because of a cinder box and so now we'll start getting to a mode of operation of through either reflections from the windows or give action along that edge of the ledge or wall so we're moving back I think we're still Bobby blindside so at this point we've brought you gone to the fracture because you see that the base station is now minus n so it's kind of shift it back that was pointing towards the edge of that drywall and the ue stop tracking as you move further back when the faction is not as as strong its reflection you might see the big fish now move change and go and go for reflective that throughout this all the churning and moving go to line my side the minus side we've always making a link there's the variability but we making the leg yet through background scanning of the optimal thinking okay so now we're in an online site position and we're still maintaining a link and we're at our eyes FCS level is business ok that's the concludes our demo in this final clip I wanted to show you what's called multi fire which is all about running LTE in unlicensed spectrum which is called LTE you now one flavor of LTE you is laa or license assisted access laa requires an anchor tenant operating LTE and licensed spectrum which is then boosted with the unlicensed spectrum with multi fire you see LTE in unlicensed spectrum but without the requirement of an anchor tenant let's learn more from rahul patel who's the SVP and GM of Qualcomm's connectivity business unit the gist of it the gist of it is exactly the same in terms of prototype equipment and it's running in a PO channel deployment etc but there are mentioned in the morning as to where multi fire is useful why it's beneficial in extremely dense deployments when we have a large number of nodes and what we can do with it so this is a graphical representation of what exactly is a dense deployment you have a large number of users and you take a look at how much is the c2 I or the interference over thermal I think that's the one over there interference over thermal or 40 DB so this indicates that it is a heavily interference limited system here so the blue colors over here is where you don't have that many users really its thermal noise only but here there is a large amount of interference it's kind of a way of indicating that switch to just disable that all right take any minutes please take this one all right okay it's exactly the same picture as before it's a different mall paced environment and it's a slightly different configuration but the key point since you mentioned is there is no licensed spectrum here at all it's purely unlicensed bactrim at this point there was a question on what is the piece l and SL there is no piece of there's only one there is no primary carrier there's only one carrier here and we start off by just looking at bi-directional traffic and as always we are going to start with every user using Wi-Fi so in this case instead of five there are four sets of nodes so it's a total of eight nodes for access points and four devices are they are using Wi-Fi at this point similar KPI is again channel utilization stepwise what's the two throughput etc but at this point everyone is using Wi-Fi and the sum rate just like previously we saw that before was about forty megabytes per se it's exactly the same thing now we are going to are there you see it okay so we got to switch one of the nodes to Malta fur and that's this one over here so before we take a look at what happens to that node let's take a look at the other nodes all the other notes there are three more three times to six of them they're not using Wi-Fi and you can see that their throughput is either the same or slightly better than before so coexistence is still preserved and on the other hand the user who switched from Wi-Fi to Malta fire now has a higher data rate this is both for Dominic nothing but each of these bar charts there's like a slightly more solid and a darker region over here that's the downlink and uplink split no change in terms of channel utilization characteristics and it's a fair share of the medium so what really is the difference by the way between this and ela and why is it that important that there is no license carrier so in the previous demo when we were doing it was licensed assistant so if I'm a user who's getting served ever ok ok good everything alright okay we're all good so what's the difference between our in this so it's only the data that's being transmitted in unlicensed spectrum and in the previous length but before you do that is there's a scheduling assignment you're being told to transmit or receive there's act knack and cqi grants and uplink and downlink all of those are sent in licensed spectrum that's why it was licensed assisted in this case is good it's not just the data but all the channels are going to unlicensed victim there is nothing left on licensed spectrum here at all so in fact there's a little bit more load in the system but in spite of that we still see a pretty healthy gain of multi fire even for that single node of course this is for this scenario but we see a healthy gain for dr. user to switch while maintaining kuwait system of course this was one user who switched out of four and now we can do the same thing with the second user also switching to modify so both these users are now on multi fired and they get a fair share of the pie again nothing unfair about this part it turns out that in this case of these two users are on Wi-Fi these two users are unmodified these two users get this one who is getting 16.5 and now is getting about 16 megabytes per second this user is go doing slightly better and these users are doing slightly better as well so the overall network capacity again which used to be about 40 megabits per second has gone up to 60 megabits visitor that is a fifty percent increase in the overall capacity at this point in time of course this is like a small scenario where and we have eight nodes in the same channel as you intensify and add more and more nodes into the into the network the relative games start to creep up that's just a sample of the time I spin out in la jolla I've got a playlist up on the RCR wireless news YouTube account that has some really great presentations from rahul and other high-level qualcomm guys putting this technology into context for us so I'd encourage you to take a look at some of those clips and I mentioned Mobile World Congress at the top of the show that's februari 22nd to 25th in Barcelona and RCR will be there in force so I'd encourage you to follow the show at RCR wireless comm as well as on our RCR TV website and our YouTube channel in the meantime i'm sean kinney and thanks for watching head net happenings hetnet happenings as a production of
