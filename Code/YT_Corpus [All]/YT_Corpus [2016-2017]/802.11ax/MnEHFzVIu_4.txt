 how do you measure current waveforms now most likely use a current probe or shunt resistor for these types of measurements however the current waveforms you see with these methods tend to be noisy and they cannot capture transients due to limited bandwidth obviously the desired solution should clearly display the current and also possess enough bandwidth to capture transients keysight's no CX 3300 series of device current waveform analyzers can measure low-level currents over a broad dynamic range and with wide bandwidth the 630 300 series consists of a compact mainframe with a 14.1 inch display and dedicated accessories including current sensors and a passive probe adapter that enables voltage measurement for power calculation the CX 3400 series possesses 14 to 16 bits of dynamic range current measurement from 10 amps down 200 people amps up to 200 megahertz of bandwidth and it supports a variety of analysis capabilities for example you can measure current waveforms at the one my cramp level with 100 megahertz a band with something that was previously not possible the cx-3 head provides three types of current sensors you can select from based on your measurement requirements the two basic currents u6 interchangeable sensor heads providing support for a variety of connections for example you can use the coaxial sensor heads for wideband with measurements and the twisted pair sensor head when you need to make a quick connection to your debt this example shows the duct board has integrated current measurement monitor pins in this case the test lead sensor head provides an easy way to measure the current waveform we will now demonstrate the 630 hundreds intuitive user interface and it's powerful analysis capabilities with 14 or 16 bits of dynamic range you can see clean traces on both the x-axis time scale and y-axis Carter voltage as you zoom lower and lower we will now demonstrate the anywhere zoom function you can define an arbitrary area of the original waveform and zoom in and it just like using a magnifying glass this capability is another benefit of the sixth year hundreds wide dynamic range the 6300 series also has fast fourier transform analysis functions you can instantly see an empty analysis by simply dragging and dropping the fft icon from the left palette menu you can also easily measure the power consumption using the 630 hundreds voltage measurement capability using this wizard you can display power consumption waveforms without the need to perform any tedious post measurement processing finally we'll take a look at the automatic power and current profiler tool you can manually calculate the average power consumption for each state after measuring the current waveform using this profiler makes most of these procedures automatic and enables you to save data and report the results easily has just explained the cx-3 300 series is a new measurement solution that allows you to measure low-level current waveforms that were previously unmeasurable it also pivot possesses a broad wide dynamic range and wide bandwidth for more information please go to www.qik.com / fine slice ex300
