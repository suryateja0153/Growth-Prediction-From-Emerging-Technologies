saying that what is this anyone I have a [ __ ] will of my art but um yeah like I on your treason terrible last Wednesday at school I uh was in my English class and halfway through we were doing this group project and nose bleed I'm like well here it starts about about six since then Lord nosebleed I had nosebleeds like three times it literally this is the time where within a two-week span I'll have about 400 then it will be fine for the resonator happen i did my eyes just gets super itchy and my nose he is super clogged up and I just want to roll over and die just slight symptoms so that was that was pretty much my nutshell for the past two weeks and i watched it crap ton in if I got caught up on everything I wanted to watch on netflix between doing work and being sick I cut off so much I gotta uh I actually started a being down there more and more I started watching more of always sunny III need to like I caught up right where I'm like I'm one midway through season three weeks I remember that's like back when i first started watching that's right that's where they had that's all they had netflix back when i started watching him back come on back in my time but yeah i did that and so I caught back up right where i was and i saw i caught a couple like mash episodes like i've seen these go watch beginning cuz it that good so I'm catching up on always sunny and that's really like the only thing I'm watching on TV truthfully but uh I did some netflix and i finished jessica jones i don't know that that's a Marvel series after that Marvel series and no one cares and then it's such a pretty good and then i watch daredevil season one and two haven't touched video and since who's not as good as season one hello jon bernthal has Punishers pretty goddamn good casting that's spot-on [ __ ] it doesn't like like two or three episodes now he was in probably half the season and then there's a certain other person jumps in and [ __ ] his story line up that's all i am also over the time we were over off time i saw batman vs superman shitty movie okay you say is the shitty I actually really enjoyed it true I like the characters in that the writing that they're given enough characters was god-awful never were that he's a go back and rethink I I've talked to multiple people about this and I want that on who did Zack Snyder excited he did spend more time to share this when you do your best thinking it's clearly he wasn't in spend like six hours legit or not got my package do it over like a course of a week you'll never [ __ ] Golden's I feel that movie is way too long I feel like there's no like it it's literally i feel like it was a it was about 30 25 20 30 minutes too long for me and also i didn't like how the first 20 minutes were just an epilogue to man of steel and I cuz I never seen me in this deal so I cuz I'm like yeah it's Superman I don't care and then I did see it there's Superman abeg it's so [ __ ] tired of watching I've seen their origin stories 800 times I know you could just skip that you skip that and just say my parents died Barney Varenne set it off of the podcast fabula you cannot eject like show the pearls and you can't show me that your version anyway that won't absolute I'm just origin stories in general I don't care I here just Wikipedia how they got their powers and I'll be done sure me him using his powers it's way more fun they showed two different types of flashes they showed flashpoint flash and then they showed actual flash an actual flash is nothing like flash point flash but they supposed to be there supposed to be the exact same person I have no idea what that means I don't I should read the comics I just watch the movies and enjoy the moves I feel like if somebody just takes that movie and just someone just cut [ __ ] out of that movie and condense it it's gonna be really it's like the Ghostbusters trailer if you chop it down to let the fans do their thing it'll be as such a big sponsors I'm not gonna watch because that's something does not need to be revives just leave it as it was a bill murray classic little bill burr that just don't even touch it don't worry katish ex next we were making out there making everything it literally i get i'm calling it now than three years Titanic's gonna get remade titanic to what have you sequel that another book laughs and the exact spot I glad the first time a damn icebergs pretty yanking it just casually float in the right but it's half the size did it the right way with the EAC you're looking finding email is he so yeah I watched daredevil sit the season 2 finale was just like wow I'm disappointed by this because Wilson Fisk meet such a better film than the feelings in season two I was Wilson Fisk anyway he's a kingpin that's a kingpin the name sounded familiar he was like my guys my guys did the guy didn't bit F like five that's the only their mm to my coop oh yeah that's the worst Anna I I 1 episode 9 out of 10 on better call Saul that's pretty good serious I didn't watch breaking bad so I wasn't gonna smite I'm a better crystal yeah probably not you would definitely watch breaking bad first yeah like I feel like that's how it would go but I'm just like it's on the list of long list of things we watch it eventually and I want to start watching the ranch what is the rent it's like a netflix original it's got a calzone hide from that 70 show okay I forget well I forgot highs name is real life name is but I'm who's DJ mom jeans that was mom I'm not lying look this up the guy who played hide in that 70 show you don't talk about yeah oh yeah he was a DJ for a while it is deep DJ was DJ mom jeans I lost my mind when I figured that out oh dude like um speaking of netflix originals though um this year they they said what it was at 68 or 72 something on that ballpark but they're gonna have like that many originals this year he'll why are you most of their originals aren't crawl my favorite is still their very first one is lillehammer lillehammer is my favorite I never washed it was to season there's only two seasons but it was fantastic like it was it had it was set in lillehammer uh somewhere in scandinavia's Norway or Sweden or up where the Vikings live up in that Scandinavia area where it's all cold nicey man gets put in witness protection from New York he's like a mobster cupcakes head I could do I really look at he had to like how they got a test to like a crime or something that he was in so they put him the way this protection to our program and it's two seasons like him adjusting to life over there and then sometimes life's great like coming back over and it's it's a very very very good season it's it's it's slow at first but like it takes up half way through um but that was probably that's robably my favorite netflix original when it comes to their originals like yeah I haven't seen I've only seen a handful like I said but I haven't seen like daredevil or anything like that to like comparable dad knows a really good Jessica Jen just kind of in cuz the characters are annoying as [ __ ] sometimes um I don't what else i mean i have i'm not touching fuller house there's

listen to it they had a giant basketball game as a Braves going on they put a hoop at the end of the parade and hoop at the start of the frayed and they sent out there in terms of like basketball on the court and there's like a two mile run just ask or basket then they had to go back to the middle and tip it off again Jesus that's terrible as she was hilarious oh my god they tell the interns like just lay down is like run me over here hey wouldn't just caught a ride from the cops like that cuz they just had police everywhere and the cop was ridin and they snuck up behind people with a ball and reach out the window grabbed the ball and the police comes are driven to the hoop I got it out put the ball in intro back solid effort that's what i call it that's the [ __ ] them like I don't like like you saw some tomfoolery at this [ __ ] you up yeah I'd be surfacing would you lean out the window knock the ball out of my hand it's uh we have a besides that like I think that's been my epitome of like TV and movies like what I don't think so video oh that's all I went on a date um listen it was it two days ago I know day two years ago yes I another date Thank You tinder I'll keep my remarks missoni let's go let's hear about um so I'm like let's go to the movies you know this classic just like I don't have to try did you do the old ah return actually no I didn't kill I didn't care no or did she try to be like hold on [ __ ] wait are you watching a movie i paid twenty-six dollars in tickets we're watching this movie GSR let her choose being eyes guy that I am what happened you're nothing there's nothing there's nothing that I want to watch anyway we wouldn't saw Allegiant never seen any of the divergent movies so that's not the worst it's not okay something like [ __ ] it's not the worst like she gonna pick something also you know it has a cute girl shailene woodley or whatever the name is and then so like in the nutshell it's still a teen book so oh my god boyfriend he thinks me but he loves me die situation I'm trying to save the world there's I that was in there but there is a really cool action like it's like look at the guy number floor like I don't know I think that's his name they just a label a number no seriously that's his name like I think I'm telling you the whole movie come for you like for FN 239 no her name was triste trysts prior and then there was Caitlin prior which is his brother that was a traitor or something I guess and then there is Peter and the nervous for the got the car behind wasn't number for a letter of F oh you are so but if it's just like the writer just forgot to fill my mommy why they wrote it look let's just go in happy okay nobody's good so it starts out civil war in Chicago so they break out kayla is called a gang war and I'm happy Jake trust me in the future doesn't change so but they break out Caleb who's on trial for war crimes from I guess the prior movies are something at her is literally starts with the opening sequence and since I Slifer getting shot is like gears one it's you're gonna need this oh [ __ ] Liz everywhere but literally it's like it literally the the the the first big solution to anything in the in the first part of the movie is mekhi phifer apparently was with this other ladies regime or whatever and he was on trial and and the way they do it is they put it the five liters minus her because she was Elena but cheated with anything to do with it they said they had three or four of them they had for them the three people and then they had four cuz he was apparently a leader her like the son of the is so like I don't worry I was jovial time but ok back the mekhi phifer so they're like what should we do we need to resolve this literally bullet in the back of his head but ok what's the problem with the bullet the back of head look I fight for Chicago style [ __ ] No ok so they shoot like high-five from the back of head he collapses but the angle they have is straight down Oh dance what's execution you know my problem it's not a bad it's not an explicit movie so I say you get shot in the back of the head then collapses there is no blood there's no blood spider there's no bullet angle from shooting the seven [ __ ] audience members any years not like there's none of that so you know what it's it's a girls movie it's a little it's teenage [ __ ] movie there's a now and then there was a vampire grown in her belly that's okay we're gonna mix Sofia after they kill mekhi phifer they had like this drawn-out plan to save Caleb and like leave Chicago so long story short they get out chicago so i may get shot in the back of the head I know another [ __ ] shot in the back in the head no blood so then they get over it they get over the wall at cisterns in the desert so like nuclear like explosion big desert like it's just waste lat us wiser nuclear desert okay contain then they run to this invisible shield that it opens up ok ok so I'm Hunger Games stuff now okay so after nuffins up there's these people the Bureau of genetic something or other um they're like oh you're safe now or as we say and their dollars all the guy chasing him but he doesn't die he did his his AP is eight a pc literally blows up who flips like seven times but he only has the right side of his body like two-faced Albert dizzy Anakin Skywalker in a no he comes up late on the movie part really fine walk around true people died not love me the place Peter Bailey I don't even I don't their mind I've made a mistake I'm trying to I'm trying we're only late we're only 20 minutes in the movie and I'm [ __ ] as usual it is so this is so bad this is super so this was a two-and-a-half-hour movie there could have been an hour if we really wanted to do so ok so tell me they say save them they save them they get them through the shield she'll closes after they blow up the guy doesn't mean the guys the people in Chicago can't get to them this isn't shield blocks nanos [ __ ] hides it all that cloaking let me guess what happens next somebody else feel guilty then I have to go back out that happens later it late way my way later you're skipping like the heart of the movie here like 20 minutes and then there's that 20 minutes there's like an hour and a half nidal they learn about so they get to this base that's O'Hare Airport but it's like futuristic 0 here 0 here part are two military it's now my military but days we just want seal move is there what kind of see like with the singers what flower can you go okay okay but we're at or that the futuristic O'Hare Airport that's been conditioned into the Bureau of well-being [ __ ] and it's a military base underneath so everybody gets their jobs Caleb and Peter good surveillance so they get like these orbs 360-degree computer basically that are cameras that you can't see but they go anywhere so they're in Chicago watching surveillance making sure they're like no one like tries to break out or everyone dies or anything like that so they're constantly giving information so they know i'm so lost tryst is like oh my god it's tryst so everyone in this base knows this [ __ ] so she's the only pure one from chicago and that means she oh she has a DNA what ya know women have sex in these movies you know that they kissed the boys and they don't ever have a fornication but it look on camera okay so she has like this like they all have these tattoos where it's like 555 it's like 15 like little dashes right here and first vertical hers has all 15 so that's pr4 has one missing like it's like 55 for on the left side and then like they're all different that like because the ones I don't have all 15 are damaged and that's why they put in Chicago since there's a because later on the movie you learn out there's a pure city where everyone has all 15 so like there's all perfect people but again later on what we're going pull so Tris meets this guy named David hold on what look at it more perfect what makes him an something in their genetic coding like like Sir [ __ ] are they're not they're not rectangles you seen one you've seen them all like wow like 44 like she like she was taught I remember that conversation should they like he was talking to Dave and tris was like what about number four he's because she mentioned the divergence like they don't have fear or some [ __ ] what like who the diverges what that was the first movie that I learned but I learned about the crash course in all of four minutes like they're the ones that were in Chicago that didn't have fear and they were like resistance basically that were like better like they didn't want to fall saloon x-wings the Rebel Alliance oh sorry get my music stuff again so proud i run a behaviors one inside a hedge of his flight side yeah but um ok so the she references dead virgins I'm not gonna get the back that's another half an hour that I want to spend up but ok but he's like what about number four he's divergent to he's like he's damaged too but not as dead like everyone's damage except you but he's not a damaged everyone else cuz you leave like one little dash miss dad so he's almost pure so they spent like a week and a half like simulated week a half trying to a fix like what's going on like they're like analyzing her brain her neural scans and all that [ __ ] to see if she's like still one hundred percent pure and seeing if they like David can recreate it to make a pure world because that's what David is trying to do like fiction condo payment what is this he's a guy that runs through your hair report thing you didn't mention that oh you're so confused okay so we have Caleb and computer on surveillance Peter doesn't want that job so the whole movie he's just like give me another job Caleb's gala got put to like um Caleb and this other girl that I don't even remember names that don't care as number three um they got put on like like patrol duty and and they steal kids they literally go to these little outpost in the wasteland with them and so to save these kids they state they brainwashed they're like they're like they kill their parents then put this gas that wipes their memory it sounds a lot like the Holocaust okay Kentucky but like this up your brain washing these kids and stealing different their families and he's like we're doing a job you know it's like a whole like nazi germany's everything and so they see you steal these kids to bring them back to o'hare and try to raise them to be happy have a better life so Nazis okay let's go to track so this is really closer to the Nazis so dies after this number four it's a case of the ass so this is right bro they're stealing these kids man I'm gonna go back to Chicago a zombie apocalypse happens and that guy [ __ ] up just shoot that guy immediately cuz it's just gonna cause problems down the road well here's where it causes problem happened he knows it's a problem so he's like I want to make Chicago so but there's only one ship they can get you like that camel was talking about and David ship and they were already on the way to pure city I'll talk to the council about how we can reproduce being pure have sex then she but on that trip she's like she is she literally they were left on that and right after that he was like I would watch chicago like number four is like he like broke into the [ __ ] tower like I'm going on Chicago's like and I'm like the army leader like patrol guy that he like was his sanction office or something you like you want to go we'll go back home okay that's nice enough and then so I have something went easy for also like like his like David's assistant is always in the tower so he's like I'll come with you guys there's a lot sweetie like I'll come with you got what so it was David's assistant number for the army guy and like to Patrol guys and then the two so they're going back to Chicago and he's in the assessing guy who was president before he's like the only ship didn't get through is David she and they left like 20 minutes before with Tris together pure city so he's like yeah he's like so we're not going about you God he's like what do that mean Chicago so this guy goes on like the most epic of rampages in this back of this [ __ ] like patrol like it looks like a pelican from doesn't give a low-rent mode he literally smash it like he automatically he like grabs the gun that the army guy was gonna pull from his like his pants shoots next guy shoots off in the dick oh my god he's like and then like everything goes bad and then like there's two the two guys in the back started like attacking liked him and the assistant assistant shoots the army guy in the head um because of course there's no blood but they're like a knife somewhere like is a knife I one of the pilots and he starts like like in the [ __ ] hallway between the pilot and the in the bag it's like doing look two-handed like stab you [ __ ] like a little like kabuki thing and then then it's like we're going down cuz there's no pilot obviously looking better his overall hit me it's just to look and they hit the ground they crawl out all beaten and [ __ ] he's like I'm going back to Chicago and it's justins like you'll need this he pulled out this card he's like it's the only way to get to the wall and use it to him he's like just tell triste that I left you behind she'll know that I didn't do that so she like waddles back like half broken back to the hair like that assistant guy this is taking way too long let's get this fun man we're like two thirds away from the movie now I had to finish now already too invested so he's like your work number forward left without he's like and that you think they came back from care sees it he wouldn't do that and she's like I know that's what he said so he is but while this is happening to Jimmy wall he was like cami wall and he's just in the car into cars like oh okay my wall opens up he walks to back Chicago um so after that happens um Tris is like you were lying to me bleed blue blue and then so Wallace is also well is it happening right after that Peter like comes up to the office when no one's there with David he's like I'm her dude like I heard you would you job any Peters like ye I don't want that job and he's like what if I tames like I what if i told you if you do this job to meet you can any job you one he starts to get a [ __ ] smile but I'm so he he has to go Chicago and basically help what wipe everyone out there's apparently this vault with that gas that whitelace people's brains in Chicago that has ventilation systems all across the city and they can just brainwash the entire [ __ ] City so he has to trick everyone he has to trick the leader the leader of that vault area to like you do this so end up doing it but that later [ __ ] was number four the befores mom [ __ ] geez I don't understand so ok ok ok so to wrap it up tryst the [ __ ] that no one knows her name and Caleb take David ship somehow gets get out of the way like never get chased by like three ships back to Chicago they get through the barrier their own already Chicago pulled the old Millennium Falcon moves I did it they did they did she like she's like I'm going manual and then she like she like dougie Brown like you stupid woman and she likes luda leaving but up so they came at Chicago they like oh and then before like in like a jail cell cuz he really would say like Oh get him I'll come up and then so they had to say number four and it's a the city right so then some obviously some [ __ ] heroics where everyone helps like some like thumbs up it's like it's like that weird animated weekend but no but uh so long story short long story short a longer story short way too long story orange cloud orange cloud of brainwashing gets released but it's too late done but then why the will of love and creation or some [ __ ] they get into the vault they shut it off they they save the day Tris becomes the leader they put explosives into David's thing they send it back to the [ __ ] O'Hare Airport to blow it up David's a douche bag there's a big-ass hole in the camel wall and I'm still [ __ ] his losses would have opted into the fear that is a legion I don't walk now anybody listen that is butchered that [ __ ] down so everybody give me energy oh my god is launching a spirit bomb this kid watching a spirit ha everybody hands up that was the bats t its guide to Allegiant 50 holy [ __ ] i was 20 minutes of my life gosh I'm back now alright so but that was that was basically my date they've listened lost the girl just watered off you still I wasn't there like trying to calculate everything she's like Shh thing I've hair schirmer since oh [ __ ] uh okay so let's see why do game now that now we're done you don't like me I thought about when we played the Fisk is that one nobody looked almost 20 minutes of his meat straight we can just stay quiet for this whole time nobody would be here because everybody shut the damn thing off at it tim is his story like our this is going away um share in that so I played um before I left for to watch my dad's house I bought a game called lethal league i showed you before we started the podcast the game is first things first go on to youtube and google lethal league would G 1 million volts 1 million ball speed and listen to this kid he at the very end the very top like the very top like search result would be the one you're looking for it's two guys playing against each other it's very shitty game all deals are very good but ball got so fast it could even form words and anymore they're just like that like when you're playing the game you lose off function the talk like is I'm like I can relate to this guy cuz like me you can play it without the four friends either local or wirelessly and the ball speed goes from 11 where it starts it starts 10 and go all the way up to a million it peaks at a million and that isn't like a linear know anything it's like exton every couple hits of might go up 100 maybe 300 maybe a thousand and then you get to like it 2,500 it just spikes it starts going like five thousand twelve thousand one hundred thousand like it's exponentially gets higher and higher and then you can never see the ball you're just lacking the sky hoping to God a hit the Dalton feeling in your like grunting screaming literally it's probably the most fun you'll never talk about because I know we're the only game i think i play lately that i couldn't form words anymore we are plotting that warthog custom game on halo does it reach for your planning on we had to like push each other out of the ring oh and those the Warthog bush yeah you start pushing herself oh like we like grundig and duty honey feel like you're looking to push them off but also not a pusher behind on that whole off yourself I caught myself grabbing my controller so tight like my hands started to sweat out like oh this is gruesome oh [ __ ] think the control I remember I bought two copper yeah you bought the conference out I've been taking it out of the box yet so you bought this start of last podcast we had

like to get to get into the ultimate fighter I kick the guy it was the only kick knockout I ever had I kicked him in the jaw fell over and the rest were just like straight knockouts this time I was like I was why I get the second round came around this wailing on this guy's chin and he does fold it like a lawn chair and like I'm like the guy started wailing on a minute in the game and like the notch ended and I had won the ultimate fighter the open finder give you little [ __ ] glass trophy of gayness and uh what I'm covered in blood I'm like I didn't bleed it's I'm covering his guys blood
