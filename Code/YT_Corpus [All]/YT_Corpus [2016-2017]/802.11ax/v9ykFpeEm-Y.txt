 hey guys this is Zack with next tech news and today's episode 3 of my new series called tech questions today's question is what is the difference between wireless n and wireless AC 802 11 in came out in 2007 at that time the iPhone 1 was just being released and Netflix had just started its video streaming service plus households at that time only averaged one Wi-Fi device 802 11 n wasn't able to account for what we do today it wasn't built with what our needs are today today we do streaming we have multiple devices we have all sorts of new connected devices throughout your house not just cell phones and laptops and stuff like that but even now connected fridges and connected speakers and connected switches and connected light bulbs we literally have everything in it all connects to the Wi-Fi n was never created with that in mind and doesn't hit handle well when you're using multiple devices 802 11 AC on the other hand came out in 2013 and was created with all of our day-to-day usage in mind it's built so that it works best with streaming best with multiple devices best for range all that kind of thing Wireless AEC has similar range to Wireless in however at the same distances you get much better speed with wireless AC this is because wireless AC has a technology called beamforming beamforming is a new technology that allows the router to know where a device is in correlation with itself and aim the signals in that direction wireless and on the other hand just sitting the signals out in every direction just like a rock dropping into a pond here's a real-world test proving the benefits of beamforming with an N 300 made by Netgear and in AC 1750 made by Netgear so as you can see at the router the AC 1750 was the closest to the 50 megabits per second that I get through costs as I got further and further away the AC 1750 stayed relatively close to that 50 megabits per second all the way to the point where I got to 200 yards away and then it finally dropped down a little bit more the end 300 on the other hand the second I stepped even 15 feet away dropped by half the speed and kept dropping more and more as I got further away to the point where I was still connected to the router because the range is pretty decent however I wasn't getting even speed at that range Wireless aiming is the technology called me mu-mimo stands for multiple-input and multiple-output emu allows for multiple antenna to send information back and forth between devices to increase coverage and speed however if multiple people are on at once the router can only send information to one device at a time wireless AC introduced a new version of Nemeth called multiple user me move or moomeemaa move me move fix that issue by allowing the router to send information to multiple users at once I hope you guys learned something about wireless AC and wireless in I hope you like this video as well this channel is really starting to grow and I'm glad to see where it's going if you like this video please click that like button down below and if you're new to my channel please subscribe this is Zack with next tech news see ya
