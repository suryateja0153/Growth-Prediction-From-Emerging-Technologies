 well attitude 11ac is the current network standard for wireless Wi-Fi networks and it's been in market for about two years 802 11 n is the previous technology and it's still being sold although the number of devices that have come into the environment the support AC has grown and the number of applications that have been written to take advantage of that new speed have increased so the demand on the network is even more prevalent than it was when a tattooed on 11 and networks came out and so what we're seeing is a lot of customers are looking for AC and it is the the prevalent standard right moment I would definitely recommend 802 11 AC for several reasons one is that typical life span of a product an access point product and market is about five years a sales cycle after which it goes end of life and has about five years support cycle the 802 dad 11n products have been out for quite some time now and not that they are on the end of life cycle right now but they sue will be as new Act Adel to dot 11ac access points into the market so for our newer products the AC products they're brand new or they are much newer into their unto their lifespan and so the longevity of the selling cycle in the market is much lot longer and it's more beneficial to the customer also a tour to dot 11ac products are priced at a very similar price point as what you would have the or what you saw with the 802 dot11 n products and with zebra the software is the same from the partners perspective there's no configuration differences the software platform is the same from the controllers to the access points so the experience is the same there's really no uptick in learning and so you're really getting the benefit of a more robust faster product than at the same price point you
