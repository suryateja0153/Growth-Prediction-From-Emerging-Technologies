 A network protocol defines the rules and conventions for communications between two parties. A security protocol defines the rules and conventions for secure work communications between two parties. So what are these rules and conventions for secure communications? That is, suppose Alice and Bob want to communicate securely over the internet. What should they do? They need to authenticate each other so that Alice knows that she's communicating with Bob and Bob knows that he's communicating with Alice. Further, if they want to communicate securely, most likely they want to encrypt their messages. Therefore, they need to establish and exchange keys, and agree on what cryptographic operations and algorithms to use. The basic tools, or the building blocks of these security protocols, are the public-key and secret-key algorithms and hash functions that we have discussed.
