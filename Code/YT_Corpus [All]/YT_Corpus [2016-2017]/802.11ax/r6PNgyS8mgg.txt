 Now let's take a look at 802.11i. 802.11i enforces access control and the access control protocol is based on another standard called 802.1x. 802.1x is flexible, because it is based on the Extensible Authentication Protocol or EAP. EAP is designed as a carrier protocol and it's purpose is the transport the messages of the real authentication protocols such as TLS. In other words, you can implement a host of different authentication methods on top of EAP. In other words, 802.1x can accommodate a host of different authentication methods. The more and advanced EAP methods such as TLS provide mutual authentication. This means that it will limit man in the middle attacks. Because it authenticate both the server and the client to each other. Furthermore, this EAP method results in key material, which can be used to generate dynamic encryption keys. That means the encryption keys will change dynamically over time. In addition, 802.11i supports good or strong security practices. For example, it uses different keys for encryption versus integrity protection. And it also uses stronger encryption methods. In particular, it uses AES.
