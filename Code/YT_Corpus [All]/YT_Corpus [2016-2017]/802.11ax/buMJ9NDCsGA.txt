 There are few important differences between Native and Monitor capture modes To start a native capture, monitor mode selector must be switched off When performing a Native capture, the wireless card operates as any standard Wi-Fi device So Acrylic won't show any information about Wi-Fi devices looking for networks nor client devices connected to access points Only access points will be displayed in the 'STATIONS' section To change the capture mode, switch on the monitor mode interface selection And select a compatible device. This will inmediately stop the current scan Using this capture mode, client devices such as mobile phones, and requested networks are displayed If those devices are actually connected to an access point they will appear linked to it The 'STATIONS' section, will contain more information such as: devices requesting networks, clients connected to access points, etc
