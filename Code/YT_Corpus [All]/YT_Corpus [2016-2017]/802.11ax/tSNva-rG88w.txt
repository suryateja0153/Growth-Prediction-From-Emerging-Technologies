 this is Kelly Hill technology reporter with RCR wireless news so here today with Jeff Adkins at Wi-Fi now in DC Jeff tell us about what's byron's talking about here at the show okay well we're talking about two solutions one hour epidural product line is aimed at ensuring Indian quality of experience so focused on service providers and enterprises you know for whom it's critical to make sure that Wi-Fi services are delivering a good user experience and then we're also showcasing our flex product which is this back here back here right here which is a mm-hmm and essentially that's aimed at cable providers and MSOs who have these complex home networks they've got potentially mocha many of them are looking at wireless Wi-Fi technology moving forward and they've got technician workforces that need to be able to troubleshoot and verify the performance of these complex networks this is basically a handheld system that will take them step-by-step through the process of verifying the networks working properly and then troubleshooting any issues that come on and so so two different products you know one for the home basically in one for a venue can you talk about how things are getting more complex in the home in terms of Wi-Fi needs I think that's something that's come up with several times here today where we might be starting to deal with a multiple access point environment or at the very least you know really trying to be able to maximize the positioning and the installation of you know a single access point in a home so talk a little bit about how you guys are helping with that sure yeah there were some very interesting presentations today from Google and others about how critical it is to get a placement of the access point right so one of the issues is that Wi-Fi of course is a shared medium and we know that it's vulnerable to interference and coverage issues and you know so one sort of architectural path that we're hearing a lot about is the idea that there will be a mocha backbone within and mocha has become quite popular with the rollout of DVR and you know home DVR services and things like that and you know so that's creating another level of complexity in the home where potentially we're going to see a backbone to deliver to multiple access points so that we can then ensure that the Wi-Fi service is delivered well and in various parts of the home and then there are other providers that are just looking at Wi-Fi alone and that as we're just mentioning now has its own range of complexities so so yeah it's definitely more complex but also potentially more flexible for customers all right well thanks so much for your time Jeff my place
