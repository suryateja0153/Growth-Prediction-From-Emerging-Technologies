 in 2015 the number of global devices connected to the internet hit 15 billion by 2020 this count is projected to exceed thirty three billion devices these devices include your phones tablets computers wearables and the fastest-growing segment the Internet of Things in the not-too-distant future homes with over 50 wireless devices will be common these include the obvious such as computers and mobile phones and as wireless continues its expansion to every application remote controls thermostats smoke alarms security systems light bulb ceiling fans appliances and many more which will be added to the list to address the explosive growth in devices two significant developments are taking place in the wireless industry first more sharing of unlicensed spectrum called coexistence and second access points with the ability to serve multiple devices simultaneously further increasing air link efficiency this new feature is called multi-user MIMO or mu-mimo for short while Wi-Fi dominates use of the is M and uni unlicensed bands today emerging a new wireless access technologies are increasingly being employed into these bands unfortunately the available radio spectrum isn't growing anywhere near as fast as the demand generated by the growth and devices for example in the 2.4 gigahertz is M band we already have spectrum sharing by Wi-Fi with Bluetooth and ZigBee and newcomers like thread but the 5 gigahertz uni band is more complicated highlighting the spectrum shortage we look at the 5 gigahertz uni band in blue there is 515 megahertz of spectrum already allocated for unlicensed use the grey bands show an additional two hundred and forty megahertz targeted for availability by the FCC the five gigahertz band is heavily used by Wi-Fi for the most advanced 802 11 features now it is also targeted for use by cellular offload technologies such as LTE unlicensed and le.a these technologies must coexist by fairly sharing the available spectrum the sharing of the available radio spectrum used by these devices with needs ranging from the occasional transfer of a few bytes to real-time streaming of high-definition video is called coexistence while Wi-Fi networks are proven to coexist with themselves the coexistence of new tech now such as LTE unlicensed in LA is unproven these new technologies use different physical layer access mechanisms with proprietary adaptation mechanisms and unproven cross technology coexistence that is accepted by the entire technology community this problem is complicated by the industry having a large number of chipset implementations and device vendors all racing to deliver the next generation of fast wireless access if untested millions of new products will be delivered that potentially interfere with the over 1 billion deployed Wi-Fi devices unfortunately the complexity of testing and free space and inability to set up valid meaningful and repeatable comparative test demand solutions that to this point have been impossible Octus copes Wireless testbed suite of products is designed to address exactly this challenge through the complete isolation or repeatability of the octo box family of products precise control over the wireless environment enables the careful evaluation of coexistence behavior in an isolated instrumented and repeatable environment the octoscope coexistence testbed shown here allows different networks to be brought into proximity to each other in varying ways to explore the behaviors of coexistence and/or competition between networks networks overlapping and hidden node scenarios can all be emulated coexistence elements such as channel selection contention load balancing and rate adaptation are easy to evaluate aiding the engineering and evaluation process around coexistence the peculiarities of coexistence which are many can now be evaluated in a repeatable completely isolated environment an additional mechanism for exploring coexistence behavior is ijen ijen generates Wi-Fi traffic and common interference waveforms present in the 2.4 and 5 gigahertz bands ijen can be used for inserting Wi-Fi traffic or for generating interference commonly found in the is M and uni bands here we see I Jen's user interface for Wi-Fi traffic generation the Wi-Fi mode the channel bandwidth the guard interval all the settings of the Wi-Fi traffic can be selected a pcap file can be used as a data source for traffic playback when the test is started Wi-Fi traffic will be inserted onto the program channel and a Android's compliant matter this means that the Wi-Fi traffic generation uses the appropriate listen before talk and back off mechanism present in Wi-Fi this effectively loads the Wi-Fi channel in a compliant manner ijen can also disable the compliant mode of traffic insertion by disabling all contention mechanisms in this mode ijen will insert traffic on to the selected Wi-Fi channels in a non compliant manner causing collisions this can be used to simulate hidden nodes and misbehaving clients also present in a jen is waveform interference mode IgAN can generate waveform interference of various types that would be encountered in the Wi-Fi environment Bluetooth or baby monitors microwave ovens and ZigBee can all be generated radar pulses from airport weather radars present in the five gigahertz uni bands can also be generated this is useful for testing dynamic frequency selection capability of Wi-Fi access points that operate in the bands shared with radar finally a Jen can also take in a CSV file to define how interference is generated this is useful for customizing the interference environment with air link efficiency critical to prata success the careful evaluation of new advanced product capabilities is essential achieving the higher data rates of 802 11 AC and the under development 802 11 ax depend upon ever more efficient techniques to optimize air link capacity multi-user MIMO home or mu-mimo is a big step forward in achieving this goal via simultaneous transmissions to multiple clients in the same space a paradigm shift for Wi-Fi that dramatically increases the access points aggregate throughput it is important to note that mu mimal benefits every client connected to an Access Point even non mu-mimo clients as mu-mimo enables greater airtime efficiency leading to increased overall access point capacity and throughput octoscope stools enable precise exploration into the behavior of mu-mimo octave scopes multi-user mimo testbed consists of two chambers one for the access point under test and the second for the mu-mimo Poole in the top chamber we have an access point surrounded by antennas to provide four different angles of arrival these different antennas enable the very high spatial diversity that is key to mu-mimo gains in the bottom chamber is a pool of MU mimal clients in this case we are showing three laptops each containing a multi-user mimo Wi-Fi connection these devices are connected through RF cabling to the antennas in the chamber above as mu-mimo is a downlink technology we are using a traffic generator octa scopes multi perf in this case to generate traffic to the three mu-mimo client laptops we are metering the aggregate traffic to the clients as shown here we see the results of mu-mimo under non mu mode about 311 megabits per second aggregate data rate is achieved with mu enabled the aggregate access point traffic to the clients using mu-mimo mode is near theoretical 2.3 times what is achieved when mu my MOU is switched off this simple setup clearly shows that gains that are possible with mu my mo this repeatable test is only possible in an environment that is completely isolated and one which provides spatial diversity to the clients to allow beamforming to occur the octa box more complex scenarios in the octoscope mu my mo testbed allow for the exploration of behavior with many devices and a mixture of over-the-air spatial correlation properties stressing the ability of the access point to optimally schedule transmissions all this is highly repeatable and fully automated as the unlicensed bands become more crowded with Wi-Fi Bluetooth cellular offload and many other wireless technologies serving every application including the Internet of Things coexistence behavior and faster access technologies will define product success given the complexities inherent in understanding all aspects of product behavior and performance only octoscope provides powerful robust and easy to use solutions that help to understand and optimize the next generation of wireless products you
