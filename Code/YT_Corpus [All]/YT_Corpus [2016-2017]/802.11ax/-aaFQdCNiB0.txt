 Hi, my name is Cherisa. I am an engineer at Keysight Technologies. This is the first in a series of videos featuring the new UXA signal analyzer. Today, we will be using gesturing on our multi-touch display, and this will really help you set up your measurements faster, so that you can get to the real performance of your device. So let's take a look at how this works. Right now, we have the UXA in the real-time spectrum analyzer mode. You can see that there is quite a bit of activity in the spectrum. We have an 8 carrier GSM signal. We have a WiMAX signal, but what I am really interested in is what is happening here at the center of the screen. I see some pulses and what looks like a W-CDMA signal. By using gesturing, I can pinch and zoom in on this area. I can also drag to find my W-CDMA signal. There it is. I can then drag it further, center it on the screen. I can also move the signal up or move it down. So if you are familiar with operating a tablet or a smartphone, the UXA's new user interface should be something that you will be able to operate quickly and easily. Look for additional videos on tips and tricks on the new UXA, and if you would like more information on the UXA, please visit the URL shown on the screen. Thanks for watching.
