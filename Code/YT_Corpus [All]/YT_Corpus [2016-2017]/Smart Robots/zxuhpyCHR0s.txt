 hannover messe 2016 once again i'm standing with dominic musa our technology wizard i guess for lack of a better term but behind us we have what we're calling our matrix production and really cool thing is you can put on these oculus rift headsets and step into the virtual world as with many things in this booth this CooCoo booth you down have a fair this year there's a hidden message below that Dominic could you tell me what matrix production is yeah matrix production actually is the future of production car manufacturing because as everything is getting more and more flexible we need new production concept so cuca is also looking ahead there 20-30 years to in order to find out for our customers how will this flexible production really look like there are some research projects around that like the forums public so the research factory driven by one car manufacturer in listen and arena 20:36 to another car manufacturer in stuttgart all together with universities we're heavily inclined there and so yeah we actually look at the future of production and so what benefits to something like matrix production provide are we talking benefits for small and medium enterprises low batch sized companies what are we talking about I think those concepts could be applied throughout the whole whole value chain right now it's mostly targeting large enterprises because even their individualization gets bigger and bigger so maybe you have to skip one working station and and move to the next one or the of cars that run through all the manufacturing stations but this can be also used in smallest on smaller scale well thanks Dominic it sounds like the future of production with this matrix production technique is of personalization an increasing customization of all products whether it's for small batches or large batches high-volume producers so for all you guys out there matrix production is the smart factory in the future order intelligence you
