 man is on a quest to build robot warriors real terminators that are stronger than people faster able to make their own decisions your military has already tested prototypes but how do we get from this to this the future of robots in my mind is to completely revamp the way we think about battle they should be able to pick up two hundred pound weights hundreds of times and not even be able to notice it this series investigates how the impossible is becoming possible and what it might mean in the future at what point do we give the ability to make a kill decision to a machine self-replicating robots could lead to the end of the human race Iraq 2007 with an unrelenting campaign of bombings and hit-and-run attacks insurgents have plunged the country into chaos and foiled the world's most powerful military at this dark hour in the war the US Army launches a top-secret mission to deploy a new type of soldier never before seen in battle killer droids known as swords robots when swords was deployed in 2007 it was a revolutionary attempt to use unmanned ground systems with lethal force I'm Bob Quinn vice president of military robotics kinetic North America 60% of casualties to American forces during the first five years of operations in Iraq had to do with first contact with the enemy the robots can help fix the enemy's location allowing the soldiers to finish the enemy without being exposed themselves the sword's robot program is named after the special weapons observation remote direct action system it was commissioned by the US government and Pentagon's high-tech planning division known as DARPA the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA smishing keep US military technology ahead of our enemies they have been the force behind such previous military advances as the m16 assault rifle the stealth fighter jet and the Internet DARPA role is to be visionary to look at the way things are currently done and to think outside of their box just what is required to perfect real terminators that's impossible has assembled it to do it to be combat-ready they would have to mimic the human body see walk up stairs even climb like a person and be able to think at least enough to distinguish enemy from friend and make decisions another key they would be expendable swords is DARPA spher step in that bold somewhat frightening future it cannot think or climb yet but at casi in a way swords has video cameras for eyes which transmit real-time images of its surroundings to a human operator it's radio controlled using two joysticks one for movement the other for firing weapons all an operator has to do is pick their target lock the weapons system in and shoot in the classified Iraq operation the three swords robots were trucked in by an armored vehicle as part of the Army's 3rd Infantry Division each robot was armed with an m249 light machine gun they were positioned in strategic locations outside Baghdad taking cover a few hundred yards away the soldier assigned to operate each robot using a joystick waited for the command to open fire reportedly that's when something went wrong recently a story emerged suggesting that a swords combat robot had swiveled its guns towards friendly troops prompting it to be withdrawn from Iraq I'm Nick Pope I worked for 21 years of the British Ministry of Defence and there is huge controversy about this there are different stories being bandied around all sorts of rumors and denials there were comments that were taken from certain Pentagon spokesman and they're testing circumstances these robots actually started to turn their guns on some of the soldiers there I'm John Rennie editor in chief of scientific America everybody involved is saying that that is not at all what did happen kinetic the manufacturer of swords opened its headquarters and provided exclusive access to its latest battle bot called Mars it's similar to swords and a window into how both work Mars is more heavily armed than swords hacking an m240 machine gun 50 caliber m82 sniper rifle and a 40-millimeter grenade launcher a terminator on treads like swords it's sent into battle by wireless remote control lead designer dan big wire has agreed to demonstrate it for the first time on television it's basically a teleoperated system we're proportional joysticks move the joystick proportional command and it commands the robot and sends it on its way right now facing us is a backup camera and you can see it in this corner screen and then any one of these can be pulled up to full view we have a drive camera going forward we have a weapon sighting camera and then we have a pan tilt camera for situational awareness in all locations we know that signal strength how well is the communications and we know where it is in Latin long so we have GPS on that robot and it's reporting back its position on top of it it has a rotating turret that will rotate 360 degrees independent of the chassis the turret rotates at up to 150 degrees per second it has an elevation capability of minus 20 to plus 60 degrees this is the very beginning of a revolution in how future systems in future wars may be for it's one thing to let machines be attacking people when we're controlling them it's another one to put machines onto a battlefield and let them exercise their own judgement about who they should be shooting it at first they're sort of an optimistic hope that you know maybe humans don't have to die in conflict the issue can be resolved but by something mechanical and I think you know as as time wore on and that fantasy evolved you saw his vision of first optimism that robots could be something better than people and then I'm turning to pessimism almost fear that robots could be our destruction today our robot fantasies are filled with haunting visions of a robot race turning on mankind but it wasn't always that way man's obsession with robots dates back 500 years to the Renaissance and one of the greatest minds to ever live Leonardo da Vinci had a wonderful apparatus that was mechanically programmable and it was used in demonstrations that would roll out on a stage and turn so this idea that you could have automatons that you could program that they would do some task has been around for a long time the term robot found its way into popular culture in 1921 in the wake of World War one and it's mechanized Horrors it was a play in 1921 called a Rossum's Universal robots by a Czech playwright Karel Capek he coined the phrase robot which comes from the Czech word for a forced labor it in a way was the template for a lot of the robot uprising stories that have occurred since then in his story the robots eventually actually destroy everybody the entire human race except for one man so tells pretty bleak even with this bleak outlook man continued on his quest to develop robot warriors the first to see battle was a suicide robot that could crawl tethered to the end of a remote controlled leash the world's first robotic soldier was the German Goliath a sort of mini tank developed in the Second World War an operator controlled him with through a cable and then aimed it at targets such as pill boxes and buildings and it then carried an explosive charge which was detonated the Goliath was basically a bomb on treads four feet long two feet wide and one foot tall it was designed as a single-use weapon to attack 130 pounds of explosives were packed inside the robot then the gasoline engine was turned on and Goliath was steered remotely toward this target using a joystick control box attached to the robot by a triple strand telephone cable the Goliath was effectively a sort of remote-controlled mine I had a little motor the operator used a cable the thing was pointed aimed and then detonated the first Goliath saw action in the spring of 1942 and by the time the Second World War ended more than 7,500 of them rolled off the assembly line the face of battle had been changed forever all subsequent robotic devices of this sort have their roots in the Goliath program everything since then has effectively evolved from Goliath sixty years later another robot saw battle and it too was remotely controlled only this robot had wings and could fly like Goliath it was expendable a key to developing real terminators it bore the ominous name predator UAV unmanned aerial vehicle about the size of a school bus the predator is a very complex remote-controlled plane it's linked by military satellite to a ground-based command center miles away from the battlefield from here a pilot using a joystick and a high-powered video camera maneuvers this half-ton flying robot the predator was first put into service back in 1995 in the Balkan conflicts in Bosnia and Kosovo at that point it was used purely for reconnaissance and it would survey the battlefields and give US military an idea of what was happening there by 2000 the Air Force was exploring ways to use the UAV in a more aggressive sprinkle the predator really came to prominence in the Afghan war in the hunt for Osama bin Laden the plan was developed to try to outfit it with new Hellfire missiles it could launch those from altitude and attack bin Laden without ever being seen there was a growing concern within the CIA about the threat he posed dubbed Afghan eyes the goal of this secret mission was to use a UAV to find bin Laden and take him out dr. Bruce Borup is a retired US Army Airborne Ranger and former battalion Air Operations Officer he is also one of DARPA sleeting developers of robot warriors in September 2000 the CIA conducted a number of tests with the predator using it as a reconnaissance vehicle to try and locate Osama bin Laden in fact the first two videos did take pictures of a tall man in white robes surrounded by a guard detail which analysts later described as probably bin Laden in October 2000 the test predator crashes the program will stay grounded for a year if circumstances were slightly different the world's most wanted criminal might have been killed by a robot warrior there were delays in arming the predator there's a lot of issues involved who controls the predator as a weapons platform what are the rules of engagement there were also some issues about whether or not those countries would allow the predator to fly with with missiles the predator would not fly again until after 9/11 but when it finally returned to the air the UAV was armed with Hellfire missiles a first look at robotic warfare of the future the predator flying at 10,000 feet is very silent the Hellfire is supersonic you combine those two and there's almost no warning of an attack this video shows the deadly accuracy of one of these flying robots taking out about in a typical attack a predator is soaring at an altitude of 5,000 feet firing at an enemy target one mile away would annihilate its target in four seconds this would prove decisive in Iraq in the troubled enclave of Sadr City in 2008 Sadr City had become a safe haven for moqtada al-sadr as militia it was using this location to rein rocket attacks down on the Green Zone where the US Embassy and the fledgling Iraqi government were located the military called in the predator and another UAV the shadow the shadow helped get to reconnaissance and identify the locations where some of the militia members were located that information was then fed to the predator which then used that to target where it should send its missiles death in the blink of an eye and the predator is not yet a thinking Terminator it doesn't make its own decision but that is coming as the impossible becomes possible in our time the lethal precision of unmanned aerial vehicles to destroy enemy targets as proof that robots can fight our Wars but military leaders agree that to be victorious it will take the boots on the ground combat droid that can see think and even react like a human in almost any warfare situation you'd rather send machines out there to be destroyed rather than flesh-and-blood people one of the real frontiers for robot development these days is in trying to create humanoid robots ones that have a shape that is a lot more like the human body you're sending a robot soldier into some sort of City it needs to be able to walk through doorways it needs to be able to climb stairs it basically needs to have all the kinds of agility that you would associate with a human soldier but of course none of the actual flesh-and-blood vulnerabilities it's one of the visions being pursued by the Pentagon's dream Department DARPA and many of DARPA dreams are coming true DARPA absolutely has been looking into the feasibility of creating a humanoid robot actually for a long time now one of the big challenges DARPA scientists face is how to get the first generation of battle droids out of the air and onto the ground walking on legs DARPA enlisted the help of a company called Boston Dynamics in building a robot called Big Dawg the motivation behind Big Dawg is to get some of the mobility and agility that we see in animals I'm mark raybert head of the big done project animals with legs can go almost anywhere on earth but wields vehicles and tracked vehicles are pretty limited even newborn mountain goats and newborn almost any kind of quadruped it can walk immediately can climb can follow their parents as they go up and down very steep inclines on rough terrain but stable and sure-footed anatomy of four-legged creatures has inspired the amazing design a big dog big dogs traveled on a 35 degree slope it's traveled up muddy Hill and through the mud it's traveled in snow both up and down we've had it carrying over 300 pounds DARPA envisions the robotic soldier carrying 400 pounds over all types of terrain four times the capacity of a human soldier the ability to tote heavier payloads into remote areas will fundamentally change the way ground troops fight guerilla insurgencies suddenly we have the ability to take into battle things we would not have taken before because they were just too heavy suddenly we can take large letters heavy artillery heavy weapons that we wouldn't otherwise have taken big dogs powerful muscles are hydraulic actuators which contain sensors to measure joint angles and how hard the actuators are pushing for balance the robot has a gyroscope that mimics the sensory receptions in our interview a computer monitors all of the sensors to figure out how to give the robot its footing on rough terrain when the robots climbing in the mud it has abilities to sense that it is slipping on the terrain and then it adjusts how much load it puts on each leg in order to keep its traction and its balance and its forward motion the big dog is really cool or slightly creepy sort of robot and I think a lot of people have seen it move and are astonished by it perhaps most astonishing are the frenzied autonomous movements the robot makes when it loses its footing it has some really fascinating capacity to recover from slipping or being struck and the way it scrambles its legs around the way it recovers from being knocked almost completely over is spookily biological the behavior of big dog over the last few years has come a long way but there's no sign that we're really at the limit as big dogs ground capabilities continue to expand DARPA started another project in 2004 to explore the next skill for a real terminator the ability to climb one of the scientists they've tapped to bring this vision to life is market Koski DARPA has a program to try to develop climbing robots for various applications surveillance inspection and so on I'm professor market Koski at Stanford University and my goal is to build robots that can go anywhere one of the advantages of climbing robots is surveillance spying or monitoring areas because they can climb a building or a tree or another structure ability that we required was for the ability for a robot to walk up a vertical surface and achieve a position high up in a tree or a patella phone pole up a wall to achieve this daunting goal cacao Ski worked closely with biologists to unlock the mysteries of nature's best climbers we've been collaborating with Professor Robert fol at UC Berkeley for a number of years dr. full shot slow-mo videos and microscopic photos of insects to find out how they used tiny spines on their feet to climb vertical walls applying falls discoveries could Coski set out to develop the feet for a climbing robot named rise here you can see how the spines are grabbing little bumps and pits on the surface and we have lots of these tiny spines so they share the load the real hard problem came down to how do you achieve the attachment forces between the foot and the vertical surface that's great enough to support the weight of the vehicle itself if you want a robot that climbs vertical surfaces smooth rough dirty clean then the Gecko really is the premiere example of a climbing animal the Gecko can cling to glass by a single toe and walk upside down ceiling it sticks to the surface through a phenomenon called Van der Waals forces Van der Waals forces are a basic molecular attraction that always exists between any two molecules if they get close enough and it has to do with the kind of momentary arrangement of the electron and you can take advantage of it if you can get really intimate contact between two different services millions of tiny hairs on the geckos toes create the intimate contact with a climbing surface that generates Vander Waals forces Kakashi and his team have built a droid called sticky bot that harnesses that same power it is basically our attempt to take the the principles that we've learned from how geckos climb and apply those to a robot that also uses Vander Waals force to climb vertical surfaces the secret to stinky bot is in the adhesive pads that are on its toes could cause skis team fabricated pads that have hundreds of nano scale stalks as with the Gecko the stalks are sharply angled so the toes stick when going in one direction but easily peel off when pulled the other way when you load it with gravity the way the robot loads it it sticks and to make it detach you just have to pull it a little bit in the opposite direction and it pops right off now imagine troops of real terminators climbing up the side of a building spying on the enemy and waiting for that moment to attack once the robot climbs up there it can hang that doesn't have to expend any power so it can cling there for hours or even days unobtrusively that's quite different from something like a small helicopter which always has to expend a lot of power and make a lot of noise what's even more scary is not what these robots can do physically but what they will be able to do mentally trusting robots with lethal decision-making will require a leap in technology for now the military is focused on making human soldiers stronger like a kind of cyborg they would be deadly but unlike terminators in the iconic films wouldn't decide mankind's fate in a nanosecond I first saw the original Terminator movie in back in 1984 I was completely taken with it as I think most people were I'm Michael Ferris a screenwriter on Terminator 3 and 4 it's the whole idea of a unstoppable killing machine is so riveting I think the The Terminator movie has really spoken to innate fear that we have of technology run amok in general DARPA has recruited scientists at the robotics firm Berkeley bionics to re-engineer the foot soldier and give it superhuman strength the revolutionary result is the Hulk a robotic exoskeleton for the human body the Hulk or human Universal load carrier is what it stands for it's essentially a wearable robot it takes a load from a person that would be carried in a backpack or in a vest and it brings that load down to the ground through the exoskeleton structure and to the exoskeleton feet without pulling through the person the exoskeleton can help a soldier carry more and new equipment into the field so things that they haven't been able to do in the past like for instance a single soldier mortar team a single soldier machine gun crew these weapons now are carried by multiple soldiers they could essentially be carried by a single soldier with a device like this since the wearer barely feels the load he doesn't burn a lot of energy so he can hike great distances with minimal effort here he's carrying a hundred pounds and barely breaking a sweat sometimes it's considered a force multiplier in a sense because exoskeletons can make each soldier be able to carry more and carry it further so you could actually fight the same conflict with less soldiers potentially if you add the devices an onboard microcomputer enables the exoskeleton to mirror the wearer's movements just how the Hulk senses a person's intended movements is secret but lead mechanical designer Russ and gold can reveal where the Hulk gets its muscle the Hulk has a computer system on board this is the GUI right here I can feed it some information about how much I weigh the payload I'm carrying and through that I put those inputs in the machine has sensors in the feet that sense what I'm doing and then their sensors throughout the machine so when I do moves it reacts to those moves so I don't have to do any other inputs once I've put in those initial settings this is a totally reactive control scheme so whatever I do it reacts instantly to that move I just do what I want to do in the EXO react memory test show we can reduce oxygen consumption up to 15% the more we can reduce oxygen consumption while wearing the device less tire the users gonna get the farther they'll be able to go and the fresher they'll be when they get to where they're going the plan is that they should be able to for example pick up two hundred pound weights hundreds of times and not even be able to notice it they would be able to march all day and get exercise very little of their their own muscle power to do it another project funded by DARPA builds on that technology and takes it to the next level a robot with a skeletal structure of a human only with bones made of titanium and steel this robotic exoskeleton works by monitoring the movements of the person who's wearing it force sensors read the onset of movement and these readings are fed into a computer several thousand times a second before the pilot exerts any significant force the computer calculates what each hydraulic muscle needs to do then it commands the muscles to mirror the pilots movements I will wearing this I would only just have to start to to move my arm and it would be interpreting which muscles in its robotic skeleton it should be flexing and how hard it should be flexing them this is actual footage of the sarcos exoskeleton in action the suit will enable a soldier to hike for days without tiring operate weapons too heavy or powerful for one person and repeatedly have to staggering amounts of weight while unloading supplies if you could combine a brain machine interface with a robotic exoskeleton you could go some way to creating a super soldier better than us stronger faster absolutely lethal now when we were researching the scripts for Terminator 3 in the fourth Terminator movie we we spent some time with DARPA researchers and it was fascinating to find out that no matter how far-fetched the stuff we were thinking about was it was in fact something that they were already working on in some capacity or another and everything from weaponized insects to brain implants that would control of military hardware but the ultimate goal of scientists is full autonomy robots that make decisions on their own and it may not be far off consider that man heavier-than-air flight was once considered impossible then came the Wright brothers less than 70 years later we were on the moon we call this the Alpha barrier That moment when one innovation radically speeds up the tech revolution I think you can see the robotic revolution as really kind of an extension of well the Industrial Revolution but also the information revolution and the automation revolution it shows the kind of tension that we have in our society and that we love what technology can do for us but we are also suspicious about the ways that it could turn around and hurt us in which it could be used against us the terrifying reality of fully autonomous robots is closer than we think until scientists can create free-thinking robots robots with brains these mechanized warriors will remain under our control but the day of independent killing machines may be approaching but robbers point of view the development of artificial intelligence is a key enabling factor in robotics in warfare humans rely on brain power to survive the line between life and death depends on how fast we identify the enemy how quickly we size up the situation how rapidly we react if future wars are to be fought by machines they too will have to make split-second judgments and lightning-fast decisions all on their own it's impractical to have remote-controlled armies who would be at a disadvantage given the fast moving pace of battle in modern combat situation changes every second and an autonomous robot would be able to respond instantly to those changes and as you add autonomy to military robots as they get used in combat operations the question arises at what point do we give the ability to make a kill decision to a machine it's a question we may have to answer sooner rather than later there was a study prepared by the US Joint Forces Command which suggested that as soon as 2025 we might have the technology to build autonomous battlefield robots the barriers despawning autonomous terminators are quickly disintegrating we may not be far off from developing the technology for an autonomous robot deciding whether to kill or not to kill it's very difficult in the field of Robotics to know exactly how advanced we are because of course the technology is highly classified but advances in some Japanese non military droids give us a glimpse into how robots are quickly acquiring the brain power needed for autonomous combat the Japanese computer firm Fujitsu has developed a series of robots called hope which are able to learn movements the same way humans do hope is a tool for assisting researchers in studying artificial intelligence and software for future robots hopes control system is run by a neural network Fujitsu hope robot is one that is controlled by what's called a dynamically reconfigurable neural network basically what this means is that they're using computers to simulate the kinds of activity that go on inside our brain when humans learn their brain cells make connections organizing themselves into neural networks which are like circuit boards each neural network performs a specific function or holds a specific memory in a similar way the hope robots computer has artificial neurons which self-organized into neural networks this ability allows the robot to learn as a human baby would human babies take years many many years to learn how to use their legs how to use their hands how to interact with other humans it's all based on learning so a huge section of artificial intelligence is the field of learning in experiments conducted by Swiss scientist Sylvain Callen Oh a hope robot is seen learning a variety of physical activities from human teachers it watches how for example researchers will execute certain kinds of jobs how they will pick things up how they will open a door how they may be stirring a spoon inside a bowl and then the robot starts to mimic those kinds of activities the scientists can then make small adjustments to the robots limbs to try to fine tune those movements and through repetition the robot gradually learns how to do certain kinds of activities a much the same way people would as artificial neural networks become more sophisticated they will empower robots to do more and more things on their own the human will no longer have to tell a robot very explicitly in very very small baby steps how to perform a task we will only teach or educate the robot humans won't need to program it anymore let's see DSM but in war it's not just what you have learned but your intuition if for example the robot is in a situation where the tension is escalating would it be able to pick up on the subtle clues like a human soldier for robots to be autonomous they need to have a lot of real-world smarts built into them in many cases they need to also be able to understand that people have intentions that they have plans that they are doing things so there are situations in which they may need to try to get inside the head of a human being and understand what's going on turns out they're working on that too what's really amazing is that these days you now actually have robots that are starting to be programmed to understand that what people want may not really be always what they're expressing that in fact people may be thinking one thing and actually acting another way one of the more uncanny examples of these socially intelligent robots as robust ookay born in the Kobayashi lab at Japan's Waseda University robe Asuka can versus naturally with humans using both verbal and nonverbal communication it is miserable the robot needs several levels of Technology to have a conversation with us my name is Fuji I'm an associate professor at Waseda University I invented a conversation robot robe Asuka oh gosh topic I also determine one of the basic level functions as you can see on screen is that the robot detects a human and recognizes whom it's talking to we call the function personal recognition is a difficulty at all even more remarkable the robot can recognize head gestures to interpret the attitude of the person it's talking to whenever human beings are communicating no matter what they're saying there's also an undercurrent of emotion and it's also being expressed whether we realize it or not roba suka interprets a nod as a positive attitude and a tilt or shake of the head as negative attitude more amazing still the robot can also read a person's state of mind by their tone of voice the aerobic suka robot is programmed to be able to listen to tones of voice that people are using and to be able to interpret those in such a way to know whether or not there's some kind of deception of whether or not they are saying one thing but really want something else bye-bye Robo Suki is a tool for non-military research but such human-like powers of perception would be useful in military robots they would be able to read potentially hostile body language or someone who is lying and react and the possibilities could veer even further into the realm of the fantastic what we won't know is the extent to which a robot when it becomes sufficiently sophisticated in autonomous actually crosses the lion becomes self-aware and alive mankind is rapidly developing robots that can make the decision to apply lethal force and when that moment comes when robots can decide who and when to kill it will bring about a power shift in which autonomous terminators will be fighting our Wars they'll never make ethical decisions make us their share of mistakes whether based upon faulty data sets or our bad programming and they'll kill by mistake sometimes or they feel the wrong person and unlike a human being they'll never regret it which raises the question what happens when robots become smarter than us if it's true as some scientists are saying that they may develop robots as smart as humans by 2040 and even smarter thereafter it seems almost inevitable that the military is going to want to co-opt them for the wrong use that's that's what the military does it really is intelligence that enables you to win in a conflict like warfare the only thing that can defend you from it artificial intelligence that has it in for you is to have artificial intelligence that's even smarter that's on your side the first organization to use robotic soldiers may will endure being the last if robots are smarter than us stronger quicker then what if in that great science-fiction nightmare they really do decide that they deserve to be ruling the world and not us autonomous robots rising up is only one fear another concern is that these same killer droids will be able to reproduce as impossible as it seems it's already happening if the fanuc robot factory in japan the robots are now actually building other robots some people would see that as a kind of scary prospect but I think the important thing is that these days they're at least still building robots for us and not for themselves but robot reproduction is moving far beyond the assembly line and into the realm of the incredible to create self-replicating droids scientists are investigating the idea of making robots out of thousands of identical nano scale robots if you go out say 25 years or so you could have a nanobot a blood cell size device is not biological but it could actually self replicate just the way biological systems to gather materials in the wild and assemble a copy of itself and that could be very destructive because it could then multiply the same way disease elements to these micro machines would be the equivalent of the biomolecules that are building blocks of all living creatures in the same way that our bodies are made up of different organs that are in turn made up of different cells and those are made up of smaller sub cellular units there are ideas that maybe we could someday have robots that assemble themselves out of lots of different specialized components we are very quickly moving into a world where the capacity for sophisticated machines to make duplicates of themselves that's probably within a generation and that will more fundamentally reshape Society and how we relate to each other than nearly any development in the past century being able to regenerate your troops in the in the midst of battle is obviously an appealing notion but it also seems like a scenario that has a lot of potential for running amok all of the Sorcerer's Apprentice self-replicating robots particularly if they're armed do perhaps represent a threat which ultimately speaking could lead to the end of the human race robots with superhuman strength speed intelligence and the ability to think and kill on their own once real terminators charge onto the battlefield the consequences of that revolution are impossible to predict the gradual encroachment high-tech weaponry that distances us from the realities of warfare could theoretically eventually take the planet to a scenario that's not unlike that in the in the Terminator film
