 my battery lasts 13 hours excuse me please move out of the way there's a dual-channel control that goes from the safety laser on the robot all the way to the motor amplifiers so if you jump in front of one of these robots it's gonna stop stop for two seconds according to the safety regulation then it's gonna drive around you so yeah they absolutely have to be safe you know we wouldn't deploy something that wouldn't be able to work safely alongside people unless we were confident that it was going to be able to do that out of it so they're fully autonomous robots that don't require any modifications of an environment what that means is that you don't have to add any lines on the floor any magnets or beacons or anything they use what's called natural feature navigation to figure out where they are move around in facility so they can move around dynamic environment so you see here they're safely moving around people they pass all the safety standards we can sell these worldwide and they're collaborative robots in the same way that you have robotic arms that are collaborative that people can work around this is an example of a mobile robot that's able to do that few ones in the marketplace it's able to do that so some of our common markets are warehousing small manual small flexible manufacturing semiconductor industry really loves them because they're cleanroom random so they're good up to a class 100 clean room one of our largest fleets it has a series of these robots with robotic they actually picked up sleighs pieces poop pots in and out of semiconductor tooling do we see these in the future going to a whole entertainment consumer usage yeah I see your son will be consumer-facing I think you'll see applications with like robotic waiters you know you'll use a point-of-sale system to say you know I want a hamburger or something somebody will make it in the back and then they'll put it into one of these robots and it will bring it out to you so in a lot of applications like that you know and in the coming years you know five or ten years people are going to be interacting a lot more with autonomous robots and you know that's a lot of the things we do with these we've got these wheel lights on the side of them we want people to feel like they're safe that they know what the robots are going to be doing so a lot of that is making people comfortable to work with these robots and that's one of the things we work with on a day to day basis is getting people to work with these feel like they're safe working around them and make them so that they're a good part of their job so that they don't have to push carts around facilities all day they can stay doing good value-add tasks which are effective and then leave the mundane material transport to the robots
