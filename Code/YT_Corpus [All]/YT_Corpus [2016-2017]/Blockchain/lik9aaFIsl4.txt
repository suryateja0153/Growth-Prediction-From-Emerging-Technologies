 a hash is a one-way function that has multiple uses in blockchain and decentralized systems all digital media like documents movies or music and just strings of binary digits ones and zeros a hash function takes any digital media and runs an algorithm on it to produce a fixed length and unique digital output known as a hash this fixed length output is normally much smaller than the original input every time the same digital media is put through the hash function it produces the exact same digital output or hash when even just a single bit of data in the digital media is changed and then put through the hash function the digital output the hash is completely different to the original one the mathematics behind the hash function ensures that there is no way to derive the original digital media content from its generated hash thus making the hash function one way in a blockchain the notion of mining requires miners to solve a problem with a known partial input derive from the latest state of the blockchain to create a hash target the miners must try to guess the digital input that can create the hash target thus solving the problem as a hash is one way the miners must try many combinations of input to create the hash target and solve the problem which uses up a computer's resources like CPU and memory the first miner to answer the problem wins Merkle trees are an essential part of a blockchain for data integrity each block in the blockchain can contain multiple transactions which each contain data in this example there are four transactions TX one two three and four each of the four transactions data is passed through a hash function generating full unique hashes one for each transaction pairs of hashes are then combined and passed through the hash function again this process generates two separate and unique hashes which are each based upon the combination of two hashes relating to two transactions the two hashes are then combined and passed through the hash function again this results in a single root hash forming a complete Merkle tree the Merkle tree allows for the detection of any changes to any data within the transactions of a block by simply re running through the process for each transaction and comparing the results to the original root hash get in touch to find out about our blockchain based solutions and services
