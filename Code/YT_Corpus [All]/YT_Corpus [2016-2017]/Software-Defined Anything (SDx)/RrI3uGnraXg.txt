 and we're back it is is the Monday and it's calm 392 and it's the winter 2016 semester at week to week three sorry less than three part 1 and I want to talk about a couple of administrative issues first thing off and then get right into right into actually using some of this stuff we've been talking about for the last couple weeks so let's let me pull up some a couple of things to note 3gs has been updated I don't know if you guys have figured that out but if I go to 3j sr4 github but if I go get up 3gs and I think it's mr. Dube 3j s is what it is right that's his that's his kind of us site this is where you get all the builds and everything else for a 3gs the actual github repository haven't actually been here we've talked about it we've got it through Bauer but what if you give wanna get it by hand right so this is where you get it from and if you actually look at 3gs the actual under build so I went to again github com for / mr. Dube Mr D 0 a deal will be 3 j s 3gs and then it says 34 / master for / build if I go through it if I take a look at the three jay s library and i'll go back in a second to show you where how I got there and for those people who can't get there one day when this is it's still cycling notice how the revision number is 73 right 73 our last revision was 71 the one I did like when I first made the template 71 so its revised twice and that means what's happened is if you download any just FYI if you download this thing and start it again right like if you were to start a new template from scratch right now what could possibly happen there might be some breaking changes is the answer right so be careful and especially with you know with JavaScript this happens a lot you know you download a JavaScript library and it's a version let's say like we did before 71 and now its version 7 3 and then also the typescript files have also updated right so the latest version our believe are also 73 or 74 something like that so if you're using an old-time script file it may not be able to detect some of the new features that are in 73 okay just FYI and that's what happens with like I said this one create j/s if you're doing angularjs if you're looking at jquery i'm betting matter what kind of libraries as out there they they read the kind of update fairly frequently and we're kind of living on the bleeding edge here because we're doing 3d stuff so expect that things are going to change okay just FYI all right so that's what's kind of happening with this right so how do I make a correction well I've been starting to make corrections and the last lesson which we haven't got to yet but if i go to my github just as a and this is where i'm going to start with today i'm going to start with this as a template and we'll talk about it afterwards if you go to github com 4 / centennial college and you look at not for 4 i'm still working on for to present to you for next next day but but lesson 2 part 3 right lesson 2 part 3 if if we can look at that one i have updated both the the scripts file right and and what I'm going to do with this one is I'm going to take it'll take away the contingencies I'm just go to core for a second you know the kind of the dependencies that I have for under duck Thank get ignore file so that it doesn't put up the the latest version and I'll just put up the latest version for you so in other words instead of you having to go and download and go to power and get the latest one I've got it done for you so how do you get it if you're going to update your version how do you update the version of the library that you're using well there's a couple ways one through Bauer that's the first way I would do it so if I was going to look at a version that i already had up I would do kind of a bower install whatever the library is 3gs right and then minus minus safe again and what's going to happen is it's going to go up there get the latest version and slap it in and it'll also ask you sometimes which version do you want same thing with t is d if you go TSD install and then you know 33 jas as an example it will go up the latest version and put it in now remember these if you keep keep stepping through the latest versions guys and girls there's a lot of experiments that this guy does right like things that are experimental like you might have a function or something and it might break your built so if you don't want that to happen safest thing is if it's working keep it where it was right me maintain the latest version of what it is but if you want to get to laze build you can certainly start with calm 392 lesson 2 part 3 as our template and this is what I'm going to start with today so we have we all have the latest build I have to do a couple things for us to get there though so how am I going to do that I'm going to go into I'll show you this I have of course my own files right that I keep track of everything and you should too if you're a developer you should keep track of the way things go for you so I've got them under mostly going to part three here's part 3 or part 4 r 4 and under part 4 now that i'm open up my visual studio code for a second and close down this version here just a second bear with me while I show you what I'm talking about and then you'll get right into you'll understand when I get in there so I'm launching my comp 392 and i'm looking at let's say part 4 for the example i'm going to pass it into Visual Studio code and so this is part 4 and talk about this one and it's significantly different than the book and the reason for that is because some of the functions in the book no longer exist in 3gs example would be there is a compute centroids function that's gone they've taken it out actually revision 67 we're revision 74-73 or whatever was so it's been several revisions that it's gone why but the book just came out in 2015 you might ask and the answer is yeah it did come on 2015 but in 2015 they removed those things right so that's what happens we have a book the book and it's not just for this course for 3gs it's the same for create chance that Stanford for angularjs think the same thing for all these things the book maybe be a little bit behind because it was published it took time to publish it by the time I was published you know you're several revision behind if you downloaded the book examples though it would work because it's using the previous version of the of the library right but that library doesn't exist why would we talk about it it's been removed why would I take what we're going to talk about a function that's being gone it's been it's been taken out so I'm not going to talk about computing centroids if you see compute centroids as one of the problems we have in a function there might be some other things that's asking you to do it won't work properly so I've had to rework the code and that's why it's taking me so long to come up with lesson 2 part 1 2 3 because it had to go through it check it to make sure it works for all you guys and it does apply tap script to it because you know I've had to pass through with typescript so I can show you the typescript version of your code and then show you the working version so this version is the one we're going to use and I'm going to update it here on get up in a second the way so the way i would put everything up online and again this is in the performers and if i actually was sharing this these files with somebody else right as an example in a development like environment like production i would never include my typing's on github nor would I ever include my scripts because that means you're getting I'm getting you to download the library again every single time is almost like a self-contained project I've never get you to do that I would obviously always get you to use Bower and all this other stuff this front-end dependency manager to download only the libraries that you need because they're there why would I get you to you know to get all that stuff again and again but in our case because things are moving so quickly with 3gs it seems makes sense right so I'm going to take these two things out of my get ignore file remember my get ignore file what it does is it says to get don't upload anything to do with node modules scripts lib typing's bower components ignore all those things I don't want you I don't want to ignore these two things I'm going to take that out and when I do that and save when is it happening is now I have 99 updates right 29 plus updates because there's a lot of little files to come with the libraries and that's what I wanted to avoid I don't want you I don't want you to download like you know 100-plus files every time you had a repository I wanted you to download if only the files you need but unfortunately things are as they are I have to do what I have to do so let's go into here I'm going to notice all these changes I'm going to stage everything here they all art and then I'm going to say updated get a girl file right so that way everything is included and then so these are mortars so there's more more of my files are being tracked now up on github than they were before so push so now when I do this just to show you how this is done I was waiting for me to do this today like to myself so that way when you when I saw you guys you would see the change if i refresh you're going to say did I refers to write one I need part for art for part 4 part 4 which did I do the right one did I want to do the right word that I want to do part 4 that's the question what watch I messed up right oh yeah yeah part 4 is the one so if i go to part 4 notice how it says you know updated my get ignore file why because that sick typing's and scripts came in there see typing's and scripts weren't even up there before right and now they are under my Lib folder you'll see all the scripts you need for 3gs and the other libraries so so please download comp 392 lesson to part 4 so we're on the same page and then what I'm going to wipe out everything for something to show you what it looks like I'm gonna wipe out any of everything and then also to show you how to start a new a new file way if you were to fork me or clone me on the desktop right so and even if you if you want to start your own file let's say for example this is you not me this is not Centennial College not Tom it's you and you have a project you want to you want to use that as your springboard to get to the next almost like a template to start your project you're fine your assignment number one how would I do that right well I would download this project right and let's say for example I wanted this to be my boiler plate now because my boiler plate is old remember the boilerplate I had up what's my boiler plate let's take a look so if I was going to go to stereo college remember i had that three i told you that this was going to be a moving target this 3 j's boilerplate let's see if i can find the substrate comp 392 and if I look through there you'll see that there's several different lessons I have up there but one of the ones we want to kind of put up here is kind of a 3gs boilerplate and if i do like 3gs boilerplate there's two I have one for visual studio but I'm that we made right and there's a demo for visual studio and there's also a 3gs boilerplate on its own 14 days ago I'm going to make a new one that I'm going to call comp 3923 JS bullet plate just so that way you guys have the read most recent one and we'll be using that eventually I'll get rid of some of geeks right the new one I'm going to make yet and that's why I'm making it with you guys today we'll start we'll bounce from there all right so let's let's do this thing let's see so I'll explain to you what I'm doing okay so how do i do it first of all let's go back to what I was looking for so i was looking at this repository this calm 392 lesson to par 4 so you can create it with me i would recommend you download this one and I'm going to do it too just as if like I didn't have it alright so here i am i'm going to click download zip so i'm at centennial college comp 392 less than 25 for and i'm going to download the zip file and when I do do that I want to put it on my desktop okay there it is that's on my desktop and I want to unzip it right away okay cool so let's take a look at my desktop now and see what I've got so it's over here and I got a messy desktop but don't worry ok so then here's my comp 3 on to lesson 2 part 4 and notice that the the actual folder itself says con 392 whatever the thing is right my recommendation is you rename this thing completely into comp 392 3gs boiler plate right now if you're using visual studio what you need to do is you need to launch visual studio and drag and drop the contents of this inner folder into your new project you can't just launched this project it won't work properly you have to make a new menu almost a container project and you want to me want to call it what I'm telling you to call it which is going to be comp 392 will say 3gs boilerplate that's what I'm going to name it Vijay has boilerplate there it is so you probably want to call your project this and then drag this stuff into your project so if you actually go into the into the folders grab all this content here scripts the typing is everything and grab well drag all this stuff into your into your visual studio 2013 or 2015 project it'll work just like this and that's my recommendation now you may there's other ways to do it too but that's probably the easiest way to do it okay so I've got this this project it's called 3gs boilerplate but I may have a may or may not have a git repository associated with it so just as a recap how to do this I'm going to put this now into Visual Studio code to make it easy someone's going to put it up here launch phase your studio code make sure I'm on the file section take my new folder that i just downloaded drag it into this piece here for here over here and now i have the latest files notice that if i click on this get icon it says initialize git repository because there isn't a git repository there anymore when you download from get up it doesn't include a git repository link right you have to make your own again which is good otherwise you'd be linking to me which is that right ok so let's do this now I know some people have been having some trouble here at school with using the initialize button so if you click initialize some people have a problem when they click on to it it goes doesn't do anything and the reason why it doesn't do anything for a couple reasons one its using HTTPS right and it does use is get in a weird way right and the school for whatever reason blocks any HTTPS through get that's why we did that whole work around with get so my recommendation is don't do it through here for now when you initialize or push for the first time do it through command line but we want to kind of link our command line which is pointing in the wrong position to this project and a way to do that here with Visual Studio code is to right-click and go open in terminal which is going to bring up the my terminal in the right folder ok cool so now that I've got my terminal what's the command to initialize get a git repository you need to know these things because it's probably something I might ask you right so get in it right is that is the first the command I'm a console to initialize a git repository get in it right and what it does it says take the get program the application in my console and initialize it get in it okay cool now I could do things like add everything get ad but there's a couple of changes I want to make first before I add for the first time for example my readme file it says listen to part 4 that's not right it should be we should rename it right we should kind of talk about what this really this readme file is for so it's com 392 and it's going to be the 3gs boilerplate 3gs boilerplate right so that's gonna have to change before we add this in to our changes let's let's change this stuff right so it's is done and will do this advanced graphics at Stan your call ok cool so we've changed our boiler plate that's one so i'll save that one now there's some other ones well go into the next piece powered up Jason also has the wrong name so let's make sure that that is the right name so keep it lower case and my recommendation is in in the bower Jason there's a couple things you can do here I could rename it here in Bauer doc Jason or probably a better idea because we're going to set up a git repository later on is do this after right while we setting up the giver posture but for now because we want to change this to look at my git repository points to the wrong place that points to meet which is wrong right you want your homepage to point to the git repository at the very minimum right so let's movie name it up here right so we'll call this comp 392 and we'll say dash and all in lowercase 3j s right a boilerplate right and save and now in here what we want to do is Wes you want to copy paste right so we want to say in the end because it's just a description for advanced graphics so that's the second thing we change we changed our bow or Jason file I'm changing these because they've got a reflects this is our boiler plate they've got to reflect all of our changes can't say lesson two right it's got to say the right thing save them with index that HTML and XHTML it says less than two code for part four right so we're going to change this to what it's supposed to be which is conferring in 23 days politically alright so those three places index I changed my my power and I changed my readme file and I'm going to say first stage so now I've got extra changes that I haven't added in to get yet and that's why I did at first I changed them first and now i'm going to add everything in to get as one big commit for the first time my initial commit and there's probably other stuff in here that we have to change but for now this is ok so we're going to go back to command line here just to show you how this works and i'm going to go get ad duck remember that dot represents all the files in the project folder and all the recursive folders underneath that so i'm adding everything to my repository that that i haven't specified to ignore in my getting or file if I've told get ignored to ignore some stuff it'll ignore it but the rest will all be tracked and what I what I want to track is pretty much everything here remember i'm using this is a boilerplate for you guys and I'm gonna press Enter so two seconds it adds everything in and then once we've got our everything staged what's the next step we've so we've initialized a repository we've done the git add dot which which kind of stages everything what's next step part 2 or part three number three I'll commit right so we need to maintain our commit source I can get commit- em the solemn on the command line M stands for message and we're going to put a friendly message to tell github and github users what we're doing here what's our commit mean it's going to be our initial commit for this repository and we're going to press ENTER and you're going to see a bunch of these it'll look different for you guys on Windows users even when you put get add dot probably added all kinds of other stuff there well what this basically says is these are all the things we're adding it these 99 plus changes ok cool so we've added it into github done this all kinds of practice last week so you guys have seen this more than one time that's why I'm moving a little faster today I've added this all and to get up our to get I mean but we haven't we haven't connected to get up yet and the weight of course to do that is to actually create a remote right so I'm going to go github and I'm going to go into i'm going to go plus new repository and i'm going to create a new one for Centennial College called that name that we just made 92 and we'll say 3j s boilerplate okay so that's what it's going to be called so you can always look here and this is the one that I want you guys to base all of your assignments on for now right then we'll update it as we go hopefully ok cool so this is it and I'm going to click create repository when I do that it gives me a container where am I get my local git repo is going to be pushed to and I need to get this other line here this get remote add line now you can type it by yourself or you can just do what I'm doing the lazy way which is copy and paste or you can use the online tool that these are the app that comes with github or there's also an app that comes you can download from bitbucket that also works as a bunch of different apps you can download stuff from the app store if you're a linux user you can download stuff from from their stores and so on there's tons of stuff to do that kind of can actually get ok I want to one more command I want to push right so get push minus you for unconditional and then origin master and then what this is going to do is take my local files and I've already pointed it to get up with my git remote add I'm going to throw my files up on github and now now that I'm successful and you might have to login to do this and put your password unless you set that up you can fix that with by googling it how do i add in so how do i add a thing to not have my username password come up all the time kind of thing I've got this boilerplate up now that is the version that i'll be working with so if you were just watching this whole time maybe you're even smarter right because you can always just download this now it's ready to go but you're still gonna have to do something if you want to add this into your new file so forever i start a new file with with us together i'll be starting with this right because this is kind of works you know and everything else and i'll explain what I've been doing here because of some stuff I've been doing behind the scenes for some of these examples that I've already kind of gone ahead and created some additional folders in the background an example of that if I click in my scripts folder here up on github you'll notice that scripts has or which is I've kind of put compartmentalised my game TS in a core folder I have lib where all my lib libraries are right and i also have objects and under objects i have a couple of them that I've kind of put together one of them is this control object that I keep changing every every example this little control object that I made and I have another one called game object which that means i can i can kind of add in any regular geometry like for example a cuba sphere or whatever really quickly I've done that one and then I've also kind of get this new one called point so the point class that i have just for illustration purposes not really necessary but I kind of put it together so that way you can see how to put together a little class and typescript as an example and what this does is a container it actually is a little point class that has x y&z its points by the way 3gs has something like that let's see more advanced called vector3 right but we're not going to use vector 3 in this example we're going to use point ok so let's take a look how this relates to we're doing on here in Visual Studio code alright so I've got my my boiler plate can I start working from this one or am I going to call it something else like for example you know my lesson example that I was going to work with like I wouldn't start with this one this is my boiler plate if I start changing this one and updating github that means my boiler plates going to change and then you're going to start with that one next time right so that doesn't mean that doesn't make any sense I want to make a copy of this one I want to make a copy of my boiler plate so I can use that and rename that afterwards because I just did this already I'll do it one more time so you can see it and then I'll set up another repository for today which we're going to call comp 392 lesson 3 demo right which we're going to use for our demo in class it'll be based off this boilerplate right but it won't be this boilerplate so you can see all this stuff again let's see how it goes and again this is all set up stuff right so how do I do that so again I'm just going to minimize everything and close this one off and now that I have my my boiler plate in the exact position that I want it which is this right and I can i can download it from from online but i wanted to use the 1i have lets up that will the other way around now let's suppose you've already done this and you created it with me just now how do I use this to create another one how do i create another another project from this one well I can't copy and Mike it on the mac you can duplicate right you can also copy and paste and rename it to something else so the mac is just simple is just duplicating and when i duplicate it creates another one that says copy on the end and and windows has a very similar function when you can duplicate or copy or fox ok cool both of them point to the exact same repository online I got to fix that because this one is going to be a new one i'm going to call this one you know calm 392 you know it's gonna be less than less than three demo right that's the one I want to do it's the demo we're going to be using for today and maybe for next day so that way we can we can learn a little bit more about 3GS and be more hands-on right so okay how do I do that so ok I go back to Visual Studio code bring that up is your Visual Studio code and I'm gonna drag and drop this one over here now and if you notice now it says comprehension listen free demo good ok now what I need to do is go back in here it's inside my my tias config that Jason sorry my-my readme file and change this lesson look how I'm getting some stuff down listen and it's less than 3 demo and we'll do the same thing here so just go ahead and if you follow me you can watch in this particular case or you can do what I'm doing if you're if you did if you already kind of did so once I've done that notice how I've got a my github pops up and says hey you got to change well no there isn't a change this will be my initial commit for this project so I need to kill github in a second or kill get for a second and i'll show you how to do that like man line in windows the easiest way to kill get is to remove the hidden directory so if you go to the hidden folder in windows and you remove or delete the dot git folder that means you've killed all your changes and now you can reinitialize get that's the easiest way in windows on the mac on linux you have to remove the folders a little bit differently okay so we've done this I've got to change this comp 392 demo I'm going to go back to my index that HTML and we name this index.html piece right there go on the bower side just in case i'm going to rename it definitely over here and retype it over here because I want to all in lowercase right so lesson lesson 3 demo one lower case there we go so I've done this and I again I can open update my home page later so I've gotten these done these changes right but now I want to kill get so how do I do that first I want to kind of reveal my project in terminal let's try that again I want to reveal my project in terminal and it'll bring up terminal so now it's looking at comm 392 lesson 3 demo that's the one I want you guys to follow for today and I want to go in there and say remove this on the Mac minus RF very dangerous don't do this on the linux or mac systems if you do minus RF star you'll kill everything right i mean that the entire system is gone please don't do that RM minus RF and you have didn't mention that let's start mention that don't put star in like this okay and then I then put in the name of your of your folder which is doc yet right so what this is gonna do is going to go up here and say what wiped out don't get notice on the left-hand side here it's gone right like you know you notice that there's no there's no get right okay now I get to reinitialize and I'll do it again the same way so get in it we've made our changes so get at dot will say commit get commit- em and we'll say initial commit right good and now we want to connect it to a repository it doesn't exist but which will make right now up on github so I'll go parent click plus the repository and you guys have seen this a ton of times but hey what the hell do it again comp 392 and we'll call this lesson 3 demo because that's the demo we're going to use this one you should download afterwards because this is 1 i'm going to be using if you want to be with me you'll be using this one to do our new stuff with okay cool I'm going to go here and paste and get push minus you or jen master and clickety click Barbra tricky all right and we got that's from the old Barbra papas real back in the day okay no one knows what that is because you guys wave a younger than I am okay so let's let's take a look at this we can see that these are getting our file and this is for our lesson 3 demo and this is the one that I'm going to be using because I won't corrupt or change this I don't want to corrupt this this is I want to keep this pristine right I want to make sure this is your this is what you can use you can download this you can fork this if you want right to use this in your own whatever right but we don't want to change this one because this is our boiler plate if we change our boiler plate is because we've recognized something needs to change we need to go there and you know mess around with it and change it up and yes I could have gone in and removed a bunch of stuff that's already there and then kind of made some very generic changes and maybe in the future we will together but for now I'm just going to leave it as is I'm going to go back here to our lesson 3 demo and this is where I want you to look and see from now on again if you wanted to create one for visual studio you could certainly just download this zip file and drag and drop all these files into an empty project that you'd create through visual studio 2013 or 2015 then you'd be fine everything would work ok so let's get to it so we've got our new project now we've got this this test project and just to make it more more unique what I'm going to do here on the on the command line of unclear on the windows machines is CLS and if i clear I'm going what I want to do is I want to run that Bauer in it at one more time I'll show you why so if i say Bauer in it and press enter it's going to run through adamant so I'm kind of accepting stuff and I want to see if it's going to change anything let's see notice how it says our our lesson is comp 392 lesson 1 part 2 that's not right right so that I mean I type it in my by myself or let's just x out of this so i'll say ctrl-c to stop the little wizard what if and this is you know just putting it out there for you what if you know we want to get the link for this ourselves what do i do right well I go up we get up and this is our lesson 3 demo notice how this is the link for our lesson 3 demo I'll copy this link I'm going to go back into our home page and then I'll just just paste it in there right so there it is that's the actual link that we're using for this project so that's the first changing made we've updated our homepage line and if I wanted to be really a real stickler and if I was going to be doing with stuff with github all the time by the way this is not a github class I swear I go over here to changes click on this thing and say updated Bauer Jason right because that's what we just did click the click the check box check mark and go to here and push here inside the tool and then it would push up together and then if I go to github now with our 390 lesson free demo and refresh you'll see that that updated borrowed out Jason fellows up right here right so that's pretty cool alright cool so we've done everything to set us up let's get to it finally right so so one thing that to note is this I'm going to be working in a file called under the core folder in scripts i'm working with a file called game TS now again the books examples don't show game yes or apt yes they do it all in like an index.html file me embed their javascript for their examples right and someone asked last time do I really need to do all these imports the answer is no you have to do any of these imports I'm using these imports because I don't want to go three dot scene I just want to say C right so it's a little bit cleaner right but which means I got to do these aliases the top right so I want it so that way I don't have to say you know three color I just want to say color i want to say three dot vector I want to see just factor 3 and I'm good right so that's what I've done these four you don't have to okay these global variables these are the global variables here in our inner you and notice I have a render a camera some stuff that we always have in our scene right ambient light a spotlight controls all kinds of stuff one thing that I'm always changing I'm always changing the control if you ever look at my examples my control the ones that appear in the top right corner of the screen those controls with that gooey they change right okay so let's look at our our actual objects so I have something called an init function here's our init function and inner an it function we have I set up a couple things I create a new scene that's the first thing you need right without a scene the scene is a container hint hint i'm asking this question the scene is a container that contains everything else write it remember we talked about this as they just almost like a display list that acts almost like a an array and every time i add stuff to the scene by the way this is exactly the same as it would in Crupi and create us ever taking comp 397 for those people who have done it before and for those people who are taking it now then it's kind of the same thing it's an array of display objects that i'm loading into the scene okay in order so the scene is a container object that contains everything my camera it contains my my axes helper it'll contain all my game objects everything else I want I've called them game objects because eventually we're going to make a game even though we're we're doing 3gs you don't have to call them game objects they can just be called meshes for now because we're not playing any games yet but we will okay so um and that's why I set it up that way guess we need us we need to set up the renderer which is the way we we can render the scene the type of renderer we're going to use we're going to talk about that and I always put that kind of at the bottom so if I scroll all the way to the bottom of my of my file here your see if there's a section called set up renderer a couple things to note is I'm creating a new an instance of a new renderer object that's what i'm doing and renderer if i hover over it is it's part of the 3gs framework and there's different options you can render in WebGL you can render and you can have create a canvas renderer here we haven't specified the kind of renderer and we'll talk about what the default is another day alright so here I'm sending the clear back background color to a specific color as an example and then I'm setting the size of the window and I'm also I've changed some stuff notice that in the old version of our code remember I told you the 3gs updated it says renderer dark shadow map and able and this is instead of one shadow map enabled now they're asking us to do renderer shadow map enabled is equal to true that's the new way of doing it it's still backwards compatible with the old version actually the old version would work it wouldn't break but this is the new way we returned up you want turn on shadow maps okay so without this true would render any shadows number one okay cool first second thing is we have this camera set up at the bottom here and typically what we want to do there's a couple of changes we can make one is the viewing angle so this is a like i said before kind of the field of view that's what this first piece represents if i hover over it right our field of view is a number and it's an optional number right and the other one is our aspect like we talked about before and if we wanted to make 640 by 480 or whatever this is going to take the camera the window width of our browser right and this is kind of art are near you know the culling mask for how when we do not render stuff how close has to be like point one units away and more than a thousand units away we're not going to render anything that far out because we won't be able to see it anyway it's gonna be too small so anything beyond a thousand units we're not going to render it a lot of times we cut that down the higher the number the more cycles it takes from our CPU to render those things so more details way back in the way we units away lots of cycles to render and we don't have a lot of stuff to render so we can literally cut this down a lot if we wanted to we'll leave it say for now but i'll show it with the differences when we change this camera position is the actual position of our camera and three-dimensional space around the origin so the origin being the 0 0 0 point in the middle of your screen ok and then camera look at this a couple of options here we can use I've created a new vector vector 3 with a specific position for the camera which is pretty close 500 that's 5 units on in the x-coordinate but 0 and 0 on the that's where it's actually looking at in and your origin so the camera is positioned up as an example of minus 20 on the x-axis remember that we're why up in 3gs just like we are in unity and in Maya and in 3d studio max we're why up not set up right that's a different way of doing a blender has set up so it's kind of a it's kind of tricky that way if you ever looked at it right so because we're why up that means 25 units up right along the y axis and then 20 units across the z-axis that's what i mean so x and z is that is the plane that we actually see that's of the XZ plane and the y goes up and down so when you actually look at x and y we r 3gs its X and then y to go up the screen right which is kind of weird some people have problems with that orientation but I'm just mentioning it so you know what it is so that's where the cameras positioned right so and then what it looks like this is what it looks at you can make it point to the origin if you want right 0 0 0 but this is what the camera looks at in this particular case and then I use a little console command for each of these things to say hey by the way just as a check these things are set up so if something doesn't go beyond these ones i know there's might have been a problem here somewhere chances are with these two functions nothing ever happens ok cool like they always render ok so that's one so the camera render and the surrender and the end the camera and the scene notice I didn't put in anything like Seanad render scene dad camera I don't have to do that they're already added in the background they're not those are the two things there are two objects if you will that we don't add to the scene and see inside the scene hierarchy it's not there right there there but we don't actually see them as part of the scene ok cool let's take a look at our axis helper we're using our axis helper which is the axis and if I was to run this thing just to see what it is in our current form i want to go to just down here so let's take a look at what we got so far so right click and then i'm gonna reveal in finder or in Explorer on Windows systems and then under here here's my demo I'm going to double click my index that HTML file that's the easiest way to do it for now eventually it will fail because that's why I've told you to use HTTP server but if I double click you can see that this is what you get so this is the access helper this thing here this access helper is the thing that you're seeing it's actually the access to help us with where it is so this is the y-axis going up this yet this green line here this red line is the x-axis on this blue line and by the way the red blue and green they seem to be the same across all programs they don't change that I think that's the one thing I think that's consistent across all it's like standard for those colors right it's so far right so if you see green chances are it's y-axis even if it's another program even if it's oriented differently right so there's the x-axis and the z-axis so notice how we have our little object here but that's the access help or this thing here we have our plane which is kind of big right right now it kind of is this big and we have our little control object on the right hand side that we're using with the debt GUI library which is not a 3gs lab where it's a google library actually okay let's go back so that's what this access helper is we're creating an access helper and in order for us to get the access helper how did I get this it's actually included in the 3gs library so if I go you know access helper is an alias here's our somewhere in here I've got an access helper object right that if aliased here it is I've used the import statement to make an alias of this 3-axis helper class as opposed to saying three dot access helper I know it sounds like you're only getting rid of five characters why do you bother right and you added all this right but trust me in the end you want to do this for things like nodejs if you're doing anything with node angular anything like that you want to do your your these kind of aliases because it presents a little cleaner when you're coding okay so so I've got my axis helper and now because this is an object I'm actually adding it to the scene right and it's going to add notice how there's a natural hover over it says what's the size of my access hopper and I've made it 20 units right so that's what it is 20 units you can make this smaller you know or however small you want and typically it's not that big it's usually hot the size like 10 units let's let's show you that so if I say 10 and then if I transpile so command shift be ctrl shift key on Windows machines or if you're using visual studio just save and it sounds easier but actually better to do what I'm doing ok cool and then if i was to reveal it and find her again or explore go back to that folder and double-click you'll see that it's shorter now see the access helpers doesn't go their whole length of the plane it's a lot smaller than it was before right so the axis helpers just there so we can know where axis axes are right and by the way this orientation of this plane here not happy but not happy with this orientation I mean how would would I typically like it number i talked about this with blender remember anyone remember how i like looking at my axis not like this right here's the y and his debt why would I what would I want to look at it like this from the same typically I wouldn't want to look at the camera from this angle right and if I was to pull a blender for a second your foe blender then please forgive me when I do this because don't be confuse remember blender is a setup right here's my lookit here's my little manipulator and they're the same colors right z Y X now remember that that's just the way blender is I I wouldn't want to look at it like this this is kind of how we're looking at it right now right I'd want to look at it like this right so that way i have my x axis this way and the other axis and the particular case r z axis up and down so i have to rotate my camera to be over here where I'm looking at it I'm the easiest way for me to do that in the scene right if I if I have a proper orientation if I want it to be like dead on like this how would I I want to move my camera over here in blender and remember really quick way to do which one I could do naam cat num pad there's a special way to do it but if you go to view and if I go to line view and if I a line active camera to view right its control alt numpad zero right I click on to that it shows me this this is ok I want to press the M button in blender and I want to lock my camera to view because this is obviously what I want to see I want to kind of pan out a little bit and when I Pam blender now my camera this panning the exact way I'm going to see my scene then I'm gonna unclip my lock camera to view and zoom in so this is what my scene is going to look like it's not quite perfect and you just very good it's a little better we go alright so that's how I've oriented my scene so how do i how do I get my camera from that war if i click on my camera you can notice how it has a location right and a rotation here it is right here and a scale right well my location is 5 blender units 5.6 Finnegan's let's make it six so point six just to make it even so 0.6 and then my why the sim blender is minus let's say minus 20.5 right it's my camera and here's my my Z which is you know 15 let's say 16 minutes 16 minutes even so you see how my camera shift it around a little bit my rotation is 52 degrees murder that's kind of a weird you know rotation on the x axis so that means across across this red line that's what my camera that's what if you were going to visualize let's make it like an even 55 and press ENTER notice how it shifts everything down a little bit right and now this one this on the y-axis it's point six five six something this make exist 0.6 nice and even numbers where I'm saying instead of like all these extra digits right and then on the set it let's make it like approximately 1 point 1 and point I so almost exactly if I want to make it exact I could I can make you one whatever so those are my value so how do I take these values and apply them to act yes because I set up my camera where I want it right I've got it at a certain distance right here's my position my location which is positioned so on the Y number one why up I have to replace the water sorry am i why is the Z which means i have to interpret can a transpose the Y and the Z values so I have to change my ex 20.6 let's do that you go back here and on my camera and see if they can get this done it's a little bit of some trickiness but you're gonna have to use one time to do so notice how I it's right now it's minus-20 i'm going to change this to 0.6 and see if it will take it to a point six okay and my Y position on my Y position here is minus 20.5 that wouldn't be the Y that we set so because number its minus 20.5 for the Zed there we go and my why is my Z is actually my wife so it's 16 this year so that's what I have for my 16 so point 6 16-20 point 5 and what I'm looking at that's a different thing altogether that's my angle that's my angle but I'm actually looking at instead of 500 what am I looking at my scene right my scene like 9000 I gotta change that 2000 if I wanted to that's my 000 point trying to look at the middle of my screen seven right that's my angle I don't have to really think of an angle too much which is kind of cold here so I just aim it at a certain place and I get my angle automatically okay cool with these changes I have to transpile and let's see what I see now if I see what I want to see and compare it to blender let me have to make some adjustments alright so go back here and refresh right and seed why do I see that the same thing as I saw before and why did its sweet time it should not hmm cookies yet might be just why you're probably better off doing something like in incognito window right so I can eat a window up again and I'll go back into that is you double click okay that's not exactly I want it but that's not bad that's not bad for what I want take a look notice how here's the X and here's the Y so I'm right I'm get on that's Rick right now why does my plane look so big cuz its massive that's why my plane is huge right let's make a plane I'm blender to compare so look at here's my scene notice how dead on I don't see the other side on so you decided I don't see this side so I'm trying to match up what I see here if I was going to do this right so I go back to this and again this might not be desirable to you also my light is coming from this side right we have to change that around so how do i we have to change that to match what I see in blender right ok cool so and i'm using blenders in example here's the x and if you notice use the green line which is the the y and you can't see the Z because it's behind here that is way back here it's in the same line as that was the sdx as he as a lot they're just nice on top of each other from this view in this angle ok so how do i modify this this this thing to be the same size let's go back so i'm going to go back to blender and my plane is is much smaller here it's like I thought was gonna make it this size first let's add a plane how do i add an object in blended shift a right now again my i have to add it at the origins have to make sure that my cursor is at the origin if i want to be accurate and notice how my three-dimensional Purser's right here by the way to get this little panel i press the M key right so I press shift a and I want to put out a plane here it is and I want to kind of translate this plane or make this plain as big as I can impress the S key to scale this point out a little bit so it's going to look like this box yuen to some part of its going to be off screen right but the other part is going to be over here so how do I do this well notice that my scale is 8 times that's one way of doing it could scale up eight times right and my dimensions are 16 x 16 x 0 like that's my that's my dimensions that might be the easiest way to do it so i won't i won't touch the scale but i'll change my dimensions to 16 16 0 and see if i can do that so back to go back here and do I have a plane first of all right so I've got my bunch of stuff here when you get rid of in a second but I've got my ambient light got my camera I got my axes help her and here's my plane right so pretty huge right 6040 11 what does that mean so it says it's a wig my height and the number of segments with segments right so one width segments which is what I want I don't want multiple wit settings I can cut my plane up a little bit more if I wanted to and height segments and those are optional so I don't have to even put them in right so width and height so remember we said going back my plane is 16 by 16 width and height source change that's why it's much smaller so 16 by 16 let's leave those the same I must leave the material the same for now now here's something that's bad my ex rotation of my plane is it's rotated by half up an angle multiply my math dot pie what does that mean what's that map that pie give us radians right that means it's slightly rotated slightly off-center let's just comment this out for now right so you can see that it's dead-on right ok cool so we comment this out and i'm going to transpile and when i do that and i go back to my scene let's see if it's affecting my plane and yeah we're going to pick this British gonna take this thing and for now on we're just gonna put it inside of incognito window did you have it up there anymore no so this helped draw / clear differed that's ok I won't complain let's just do this now it's you know what ok well what happened to our plane how come I when disappeared and it's gone right like we said 16 units by 16 units and it's like this big what 16 by 16 years in natural brow is it right and the reason for that is because it's eight times I've scaled it up eight times normal size and a normal size for our plane is a two-by-two plane right that's why it's 16 by 16 right but reality 16 by 16 for us is quite small in our cube and this in this reality is is quite it's quite much much larger than our plane right because our cube is big right yes let's see let's go back to the rotation I want it i want you i wanted to go back that's why that's why I took it off so let's go back and put this rotation back for a second and so I've added this plan this is on the x-axis minus point five okay let's see if that's the if I was going to transpile hopefully on copy this now find the late right and go back to incognito mode fixed it in yeah right there's that point five I put the point five bucks right that's more accurate by isn't this is more of us in the same size hey let me take that point five again I just want to make sure that that's not the issue right because it somehow we looked at it and it was okay and now it's kind of weird nice let's go back I'm doing this so that way you build in blender as an example you kind of visualizing your in some other program but your code here right because you want to code by hand this just helped you out a little bit visualization box right by the way there's another piece of code other piece another program you can use to there's actually an editor for 3gs I don't recommend you know tell you that I'm talk about that another two so let's take a look at this again one back so I'm going back here and 1661 you stick that thing off again it's why is that exit minus point 5 radians does that do like remember i'm i am looking at that thing properly so you know this shouldn't be an issue my plane should have to rotate across the excesses at all right so save it and then nope transpile so that's always do the transfer then go back here and refresh again how come it's gone darn it huh what side am I looking at how come I'm looking at the back side of it why why am I looking at the back side not the front side and why do I have to rotate by minus point five what's that why is that number the number right because if you take half of half a percent half a right now I'm looking at like this the planes up like this you can't see it but if on the plane if it was if this is the grid right my plane by default we're thinking that the plane is going to be flat like it isn't blender but not so in blender when we make our plane it becomes like this that's the default but what's the why and the ex it's going to go across the x and y x and y is y up which means it's in front of us we can see it when it's on the other side right and that's why we split flip it around we put it on the x axis because when we rotate minus point 5 x math pi radians is 90 degrees right so actually rotating it down flat and that's what we have to do that right it's just math for us just just FYI so you guys know so I'm going to put it back okay cool and with transpile I want to get my cube back in there and I want to kill some of this other stuff they don't care about modifying my cube and cloning my cube by the way if I was to run it the way it is enough trans piled just refresh there it is notice how i have a clone feature where I can clone an option clone a you know kind of our face here and i have my actual ID click on my vertices that set up my thing so i can stretch my vertices around and play around with this stuff just for your viewing pleasure and actually redoes the you know the everything from the shadows there something i think i can look at different vertices to do that right so this is what this code does we're going to look at how to do that but i don't need it right now like this so let's get rid of all that stuff and clean it up so all we have a little cube like so I want to make I want to try and help you make your assignment one that's why I'm doing right so kind of our ask for new stuff right so let's get with it so let's go back to code so we'll go back to code and we'll take a short break in a second well I don't need this initialize custom match let's get rid of this is underneath spotlight so I'm I'm 89 I'm not here if you're following along with me I'm so much actually clean this up for one second take away some spaces so around line 89 I'm going to get rid of this call the custom mesh function usually to kill this get rid of this and I'm also going to get rid of on the controls here's my controls I'm going to get rid of me my ad control points just get rid of that for a second poor boat and I'm gonna leave my stats object there and my loop my game loop my windows my add event listener for my resizing but I'm going to get rid of this function initialized custom a I don't need it for my for my example for x we get rid of all this I control points I'm gonna get all get rid of all this stuff and my create custom a treat well so I've just gotten rid of a bunch of code and your snake press the week so I go right from the end of my init function right in to resize there is no more that function I do have an ad control function that I'm going to mess around with i'm going to change this up but for now I'm just gonna wipe it out so you're going to do one of these actually i'll leave my control logic loan you one of these ok and that's that's one change the other change i'm going to make is in my scripts under my objects remember how we did a module in touch script i talked about modules with that you in touch script if i look at my control that TS file it's actually a module and i've created a new name space called objects right so this how you would make a module you you kind of surround it with you know I name with curly braces so I I've named my module objects right so step one you do this and here's my this is the containing braces and then I use the export keyword to export anything I want class a function a variable constants whatever I want to export has to be either use the xbox you would but don't use it for keyword will not be exposed outside of my main space so if i made my name's Chris calls objects and I want my control plastic to be exposed I need to use the export fever okay cool so I want to keep my control class but I want to wipe it out I wanted to kind of make an empty so we can use you can put whatever we wanted it so for now just kill all this stuff inside my control class it's not going to do anything if you instantiate the control class are getting it nothing and I'll kill my clone method you're going to need that core nothing anymore and that's what it should look like now and I'll transpire so my control class is empty I'm always going to mess with my control class so that my controls will reflect what I'm doing here it's the one class that I messed with a lot ok I also added some other ones game object can point nutkin touch those they're similar to this one so for example points is also in the objects namespace and I'm exporting the point class if I need to use it but I'm not going to mess with just an example of our of a met of a module this is how you would write a market and by the way this is only one piece so this is piece one and the second piece is on my index HTML I have to include the module here in my scripts because remember my index that hTML is a manifest that ties everything together if I don't tie it into my index.html file doesn't matter how much I reference it it won't work this is the way we reference all the modules in 3gs great Jess angularjs name it j/s whatever it is your name is right that's how we reference it all through the index.html file well other than nodejs no chance can really do this way okay but that's that's how we would do so first I include my my library section is on my library's my 3gs my dakkili my stats object and then my custom scripts these are my custom scripts I'm I've written so a point script to control script the game object and now of course my game TS my main game back to yesterday right so that's I need all those pieces part to your right a module in a separate file creates a namespace with the module keyword and export keyword to expose we have to include it in our index HTML that second piece third piece in our Taipings under the under the sorry in under the core module I have something called a reference to file notice that I included a reference path to these custom objects that I created game object control point I've added them in there so they're referenced so that when I reference my reference file I got a reference to almost modules inside my game guide TS file so here's my game that ES File and at the very top I have my reference path to the reference ES file if I don't do these steps one of them right module won't fork so it's like there's three ways to link a module you make a module then link it to your index.html and then you reference it here somewhere in your code right those are the three steps and by the way if you look at tight script languor it tells you that you guys right so that's I'm just following the methodologies right from the website okay cool too yeah so 330 thank you very much there so the triple forward slash instead of the double forward slash they're still ignored by that by the compiler but in terms of code but the triple forward slash is using the reference that links the compile when we build and compile everything it links everything together to know how the whole one because at the end of the day it's one big document right when everything links together in index dot HTML it becomes one big feud dr. right for the browser for us it's a bunch of little documents so we can manage them before the browser's one big document so the reference paths helps the the browser piece everything together that's what it does so we can be modular eyes so when we make a larger scale application we can manage it right and we can scale it up I can create my objects right and then we compile everything together later on for it for it to work no okay so this is what we've done here with our reference path right and notice how I have my new control but it's my old control ask for a custom s object which we're going to get rid of we can't that's not necessary for that and we don't need to see all these custom s objects on on lines 48 49 and 50 we can get rid of all that is we're not making those or faces or vertices you have all those so basically we're left with a more slimmer version of our code I want to add a cube I want to add a cube to the scene and I want to make it the same size as blender so if we look at blender blender my cube is buried inside my scene and the position of the cube in the seat is seeing the cube the cube in the scene sorry is at one it's 111 but the position is at exactly the zero zero zero point now remember for blender all sizes of the cubes when you start off our two by two by two units right so if I want to move my cube so it sits on the plane right the way I have to do it is I have to raise it up by one unit so I'm going to go across up on the z-axis my location by one unit cycle one let's enter it faces up so it sits on top of the plane Z and Y reversed which means my cube is going to be 0 0 for position and then and this will be the set and they and the wild be reversed okay other than that everything remain the same by dimensions are 2 x 2 to x 2 x 2 if i want same picture just give them look up here right so let's take a look so how do I make that if I may use the cube Jang mi can use my own my game my own and game object for a second somebody go here I've got my spotlight in Miami we're gonna fix my spotlight by the way if you don't have a spotlight in my scene I'll put that up with that back in so before my UI controls which I have I don't have any use for right now they're just there as a placeholder for me right don't do anything for am i'm going to i'm going to add in a cube just below or just around the place where i've added in my plane so I've got my plane and then underneath I'm gonna try and I kind of put all my all my game objects on my scene together so I can see that so let's just make some room and underneath my plane i'm going to say add let's try this together guys add a cube should see okay so i want to have Mike you remember it's 2 x 2 to x 2 x 2 actually and that's one and the second thing is it's one up from the from the point all right that's what I got to do so how do I do that first of all what are the two things I need for all for all primitives right I want to ask you this question I want it what are the two things i need that the make up a mesh right for all primitive metrics there's two components but I geometry and material those two things right so I'm going to need those two things for my for my my cube mesh right so notice I'm up here I want to make this kind of fernet for our purposes a global object and I do I have a cube stand in a variable that I've kind of created as a stand-in object called cube which is the match right i also have up here I've kind of created some aliases for cube geometry and and Lambert material which is what i'm going to use but i need to create some material variables and geometry variable so i'm going to call I'm gonna do a VAR i'm going to say i'm going to make a cube geometry lower case which is of type cube geometry upper case because it's just a it's just an alias right so I'm kind of typing this out right like typing means like them I'm creating a type for the cube John can we use and I'm also making a variable a container on the global namespace okay same thing with my cube material it's going to be a Lambert mesh right so Lambert material is what I'm going to use for my cube material it is so those two things have added now that I've added those two variables I can I can use them right so the first thing is matter which one you choose geometry or material let's just do one so i'm going to say cube material right cuba terial is equal to a new Lambert material Lambert is this one tapped in cairo and notice from a parameters perspective it's true it's listening for what an object right and the object has to be put in curly braces like this I all I need to do right now is make a color I don't need to have any other material so or any other aspect of my material or property so let's make it whoops a color and let's make the color green like how do I make green well it's found right RGB so red 00 green right FF II 00 right and that's how it would be right so RGB but instead of the pound we wouldn't do that we put the 0 X 0 X is the hexadecimal way we doing things in 3gs right and that's how we look not notice here's an example of that up here right so 0 X so telling the compiler that is hexadecimal and then 0 0 FF 0 0 so RG very green be right that's a cube material now let's talk about our cube teamo to this is where we do our geometry which is again a new object new capital c tube geometry and if i open it up ask for at the minimum a width height and a depth which is too that's why we decided to do so two by two by two that's what we said or key geometry okay cool now we want to make a new cube mesh to when I say cube is equal to a new mesh object when we're going to pass in the geometry Sookie geometry and the material Cuba true okay we've added doles in right but it doesn't mean that it actually will show anything and the reason why is because I have to do one more step I have to add it to the scene right so i have to do down here at least put something like this seen ad and then q I don't do this then it's not going to be shown right the other thing I want to do it has to receive and cap shadows right I wanted to receive shadows and I want to cash out right so i have to say Q dot you know cast shadow right notice that it's a property so i just say is equal to true and tube got receive shadow I can spell everything properly that's also equal the truth so I wanted to kind of she even cast shadows otherwise it will not cast shadows we see shadows if I don't want to receive a cash shadows I can turn that off right if I want to make some other kind of drawing whatever okay cool and then I'm gonna use a simple console command this is just me you don't have a DS console command that says added you know cube you know primitive you see okay we go so I've done everything correctly my cube should be in the right position oh man I forgot one thing it's got to be up one right because otherwise it's going to be halfway into the plane if it's like blended right so i can say well cubed opposition and what is it if i want to go up one why right is equal to one right think i want to go one up on the on the Y plane which is up and down in our scene right number one why up ok so those are the things i want to do and let's transpile and we're still going to have issues and we have some six errors it says let's take a look where it says where our six errors come from here's our six errors it says cannot find named vertices on game TS and it's looking for it under here right in our game roof that's a big problem right so let's clean up our game loops I don't have any of these vertices stuff this is underlined around line 134 in my in my program yet well save I've got rid of all that nah no errors and then trans file and then i'll upload it to get up so you guys can see what i have and you can have what I have ok so here it is let's take a look and see what I've got now in my coat so this should disappear should be various much simpler I should have a cube that's two by two one up it should be green and as we saw it let's see if I did everything correctly I may have not right and you can see how you know even with incognito mode it's just locked up okay so let's just try the I'm just that's how it works guys so I'm sorry to say oh yeah would be a great place to stop yeah does it do any error checking for me when I do type scripts I look it from command line no well I would if you have if you have the right version of Ted strip yeah so it looks like I'm locked up this is a great place to stop and take a stroke rate so let's go and let's take a five or 10 min a break when I come back I'll continue with this example what day is saved over but I'm like I'm locked like lock locked please I reading main even need a reboot whoo right let's try and so so for those people if I'm still recording then I'm gonna stop recording now and I'll come back when I come back I'll have everything going oh that was good rats WebGL had a snag okay so it killed me let's see if I'm still recording yes let's stop broadcasting
