 in this demo I'll show how the netscaler a CI migration tool can be used to convert a part of the netscaler config into an equivalent XML format that can be posted or imported directly into a pic for creating and migrating applications from net scale into an AC environment first what is the tool so it takes a part of the netscaler config function run it through the tool and out comes an XML and that XML can be posted directly into a pic so keep in mind this migration tool only helps in translating the functions from NetScaler command line into the xml file format it does not do the complete automation in that it does not completely activate the application in a pic although you will not need to configure your specific parameters the it's expected that the apec administrator will link the service function parameters that are created by this tool into an existing service graph template and device policy so whos is really for interesting oddly enough we're focusing on DevOps customers these are the people that write the scripts and code for automated networks any consultancy group would make extensive use of this tool and of course any sales engineers or anyone in the field looking to show how to migrate some of the existing netscaler configs into a CI all right so how's the tool work so this is an example of the the front-end web interface of the tool you'll start by filling in basic fields to match your ACI environment in this case you would plug in the tenant named provider or EPG places that these parameters need to be programmed under the ACI environment once those are all filled in you want to select the function of the config that you're converting such as load balancing gslv content switching then go ahead and paste in the snippet of the netscaler config press convert once you do that out comes the xml equivalent with the functions defined and the parameters having unique values you'll copy the output here and paste it into an xml file which you can and post into a pic just to recap here what supported is specific small functions like load balancing kind of switching SSL gsl be all of our device functions are supported with this tool but keep in mind that when you do the conversion you'll need to convert one function at a time all right let's take a look at how this works within a pic so to kick things off I'm going to take a piece of my config and I'm going to convert it over to ACI so to start I'm going to plug in my tenant name to match the existing environment that I have just fill out each of the parameters all of these are required values now my config will just be migrating one function of the bouncing function take the xml that's converted and put that into a text file to post into a pic all right so how does this look to post so you go ahead and right click on servers or anywhere within the left-hand tree click post let's go ahead and select the xml that we just created and send that in to the GUI with that sent an we'll go back to the el 47 service parameters and see what was created and notice now we have many more graphs here contracts and graphs for the application that we just created called migrated web graph these values were imported from the NS config directly now to make these go live the ACI administrator is going to need to take a couple extra steps here the reason that that's necessary is this tool is really just taking what we can see from NetScaler and create an equivalent version of the config for a CI there's still some pieces needed within the AC environment to fully deploy these parameters specifically the administrator will need to create a service graph template to match this function templates consist of things like whether this is going to be one arm mode which device is going to use which interface the device will use and so forth once the templates created the last step is for the administrator to create a device selection policy and this connects the service graph template with the actual device that will receive the config that's the ACI managed netscaler that i receive the config once those two pieces are in and linked to the name of the web contract ACI would then connect that with the el 47 service parameters that we just uploaded and push the config out to netscaler and that's it that's how easy it is to migrate your existing netscaler config into an ACI environment thanks for watching
