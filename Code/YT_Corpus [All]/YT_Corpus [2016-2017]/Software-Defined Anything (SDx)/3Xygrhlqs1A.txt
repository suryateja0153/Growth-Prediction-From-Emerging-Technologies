 all right hello everyone it's five o'clock in Las Vegas so thank you for coming to the last session of the first full day of citrix synergy we are in the tricks workspace suite in my organization thanks for coming I'm penny girl s key from the Citrix integrated product marketing group where I'm responsible for citrix workspace sweet and very happy to have a panel of three experts here who have great experience with Citrix workspace sweet and you were part of the conversation as well whether you're on the live stream or here in the room we want to hear your questions also will have some time at the end for you to use the microphones and ask questions or if you're on the livestream feel free to put them on the chat so we'll go through both the business scenarios but also some technical scenarios so you'll get a great insight on what you can do with Citrix workspace sweet and hopefully get some ideas for you in your organization but first let's level set so what is a mobile workspace the industry is having a challenge right now with what we actually call it whether it's a mobile workspace a digital workspace unified workspace the idea is what Forrester is illustrated here workers need freedom and flexibility to be mobile get their work done however and whenever they want to get it done IT needs that security and control to make sure that everything is going to work and work well and follow the guidelines of the organization so digital workspace really bridges this challenge and it covers all of the big issues that are coming up in your organization today BYOD security all the things that you're trying to accomplish at citrix we call the Citrix workspace sweet so this brings together our lead offerings in one comprehensive solution so Citrix works with suite includes Zen apon xendesktop Platinum Edition which includes app DNA if you're in the last session you saw a lot about DNA great advantages there the den mobile enterprise edition including the business productivity apps share file for on-premise file sync and sharing and also networking with Kyle bridge which is now SD win and also some netscaler user licenses so it's a complete integrated solution and people are choosing this for many different reasons but when we survey our Citrix workspace sweet customers last month we asked you know what are the benefits that you're seeing in your organization from workspace sweet oops we turned off here there we go so the top reason is security that's something that comes up all the time here at the conference and also it's improving vibrational efficiency for users making the business more productive by making your workers more productive and more mobile and we talked about aligning with sea level goals how are the CEO CEO and CFO goals being met by workspace sweet and again it's improving that security and that privacy of the organization and making the business more productive so we have a great panel today I'm going to ask them to introduce themselves so that you understand more about what they're doing in their organization and what their organization is and then we'll get into some questions Josh don't go ahead I'm Josh Judd I work for one oak we're a midstream natural gas company based out of Tulsa Oklahoma I'm a systems analyst and one of my responsibilities is basically the entire Citrix product stack in in our organization great hey Craig Carmel from WPS health insurance out of addison wisconsin we're trying to grow our Citrix environment were typically a brick-and-mortar physical pc in my job is to help leverage citrix to make us more efficient great in Timothy Timothy Tuttle senior architect with corals and Brady we're in a moi 200 law firm with multiple locations throughout the u.s. we work in a number of areas of law so our client base is multinational conglomerates all the way down to traditional manufacturers nonprofit organizations high-net-worth people so we cover a wide gamut in our customer population great so we have a lot of different verticals a lot of different sized organizations and a lot of different backgrounds here so let's get into the moment that started the workspace sweet discussion so Josh when did you know that you need to go beyond virtualization so we had a business unit director that walked into senior management nit s office and said I have a mobile app that i had developed outside of the company i need you to get it to all of our devices and that's really what launched us we we had mobility on our radar but at that point in time we had a directive to go make it work then so that's why you know started us on on this road excellent excellent and Craig for you how did this start well we were running out of xendesktop licences we needed to add more and we were also looking at other ways to use other products so we wanted to build up Zen app and we also want to replace good so it just made sense for us to roll in a workspace sweet and bring everything into citrix great what were some of the challenges that you were hearing with good that you were looking to replace it they had issues getting attachments and other just quirkiness it was slow and sometimes it didn't work they couldn't have more than one device per license so that end user productivity that we saw in the survey was the complaint that was causing the headache okay okay and timothy part of our value proposition is when we work with the client we hear a lot about partnerships in a lot of cases were an actual direct extension of that client so we can't work eight to five and expect our attorneys to be at their desk we have to be flexible work on the the client's business needs and we as I team that need to provide our attorneys and associates and staff with the platform so that they truly can become an extension of our clients and it also probably makes them more competitive as well absolutely it's one of our differentiators is that we get to know the business and become part of that organization and operate and absolutely their best interest awesome great so we had seen in the survey and in some of the analysts data that someone outside of the organization is driving this and c-level priorities are to make the business more efficient make the users more efficient how are sea level priorities driving what you're doing with a mobile workspace approach it's really just the our direction is to to make our users mobile and mobile is not just be able to work from a phone or a tablet mobile is really allowing that user to work from any device whether it's a pc with all the specs that we get you know have had for the last 20 years or if they you know grab a tablet you know I out of best buy that we need to empower them to be able to get to the apps get to the data get to their user settings so that they have a similar experience and be able to be productive in any of those environments great i think when we talked earlier you're talking about a partner and how you work with a lot of partners and you had a partner that needed to tie into some of your data and it took days originally to resolve and now be more flexible saving the company more time yeah we actually had a business unit we have pipelines for natural gas and whenever we have some of our external customers they they will tie in from their facilities into our pipeline the group that actually works on that to give that customer an estimate they would have to talk to several different groups throughout our organization who would then go collect data do some calculations and then give them a quote for what that would cost to to say run 100 miles of pipeline to connect to our environment now after one of our developers built a mobile app that integrated all these systems and now within a few minutes they can plot locations on a map and get an estimate right there based on the mileage I think that's a great example for everyone in the audience to think about what are you doing today that takes a lot of process whether it's someone driving back to an office or filling out a form or being connected to do something and how could you reinvent that that user experience with something like a mobile app it's a great example Craig so your sea level and the sea level priorities that drove your mobile work space our priorities were to cut costs and be more innovative so one of the areas we looked at was the reducing our PC footprint getting thin clients using leveraging Citrix published at packaged apps everything that way and start eliminating the cost of the physical pcs and also allowing users to maybe work remote set them up with a home office that would start to be requirement for some of our users and remind the audience you're in Madison Wisconsin which is a fun place to be but kind of more expensive if you don't to live in town or if you've got other priorities so a lot of people are working remote there's a handful it's a maybe just a few hundred right now but two years ago was three okay so definitely that's become a trend of the mobile working great and Timothy your you don't have a sale we have a little bit more of a unique structure than a typical corporation we have partners so we have associates me of partners and essentially every partner is a sea level every partners our boss in the business we have 477 attorneys in the organization and they're spread out across the all ten of our locations so they drive it through their expectations as we all know we we go home we have our personal devices that we use to communicate with friends and family and it just works we have our computers at home and we turn them on and get on the internet everything just works and we have that choice of what are we using at home being that we have so many bosses across the organization they expect that same experience at work they want to use whatever device they feel comfortable with in a manner that feels comfortable to them and they want that same experience of it works the way i want it to work additionally we we have a value proposition that we provide to our clients as well you know we've been there we've done that thymus is essentially how we build so we like to leverage a lot of work that's already been done and in order to do that our staff needs access to that information so that they can reuse it instead of recreating the route the wheel and be more efficient and deliver more value to our clients so we had to be both of those let's surprise the audience how many BYOD devices can a person have at your organization we had a big shift we we had used other systems previous Lee up as good when we went sin mobile we changed it where we used to have restrictions we last one being good one device and if you wanted to add a second you had to pay the license being could add just a second with xenmobile we lifted all restrictions we have no limits and we have a number of people on our staff that take full advantage of that and I know myself I mean we're an IT probably a little bit different but I I have multiple devices as well and we make that same offer across the board or staff that's amazing and you know that's an important thing about the Citrix workspace sweet licensing is that it is not limited by devices unlike some of the competitive offerings out there that limits you to three devices I have three devices on me today I usually have force so it's that's great to have that policy for people who want to use whatever device works best for them it's just not realistic to think that a smart device is always the right device a smartphone some of them obviously we have some screen size options but there are certain times when you do need a larger screen and you need the tablet instead of a smartphone in to be able to provide that option again giving them the tools that meet their needs to perform their job and that's that's our goal awesome I think you surprised a lot of people here ok so let's shift and talk about security security has come up in a lot of sessions today and it is something that is really a big priority obviously for all organizations you are all in very secure organizations that have a lot of priorities and compliance needs Josh how are you addressing security with the mobile workspace today our security team we like to refer to them as the most paranoid yet reasonable group that we work with they're obviously concerned with with having a secure connectivity experience I work on a client technology team that is focused on making me and user experience great and the those are competing priorities we we have settled on a method whenever you enroll a mobile device there's a four-digit pin but during the enrollment process there's a username a password exchanged and we're sending user certificates down to the device all that you know meets the expectations of our security team and the user gets a good experience because they go through a short enrollment process but after that they only have to enter a four digit PIN whenever they login great great entregue have both government and health care requirements that your meeting with security security is a big challenge for us we we have some of the most stringent security I've ever seen it's what really slows down our implementation some I resent mobile implementation took four or five months just to get through all security jumping hoops is getting me with this team are you meeting these compliance requirements are you meeting these are these interpreted right so there was a lot of challenge they're getting through it and then other devices secure how do we prove it where the certs is at fips 140-2 and there was a lot of back and forth until we finally figured out okay where it looks like we're all good and then we started rolling it out and everyone started like it but security security so is the first question anytime we look at an app it's not how is it used how can we make it better we have to ask about security then we got trying to balance on user experience as always our biggest challenge excellent excellent and Timothy so you mentioned some of your corporate clients if someone went to your website they would see their names and go wow yes these are people that I don't want to mess around with so I think you said security is paramount it really explains it all absolutely that really does sum it up for us and as I as I mentioned and as you just alluded to we have such a wide client base it's not just our internal security that we have to consider it's our client security as well and because we do spend so many different areas of laws with such a wide variety of customers we also have to consider and meet their security requirements as well so security is part of every conversation we have great great and you know everything that's been in the news or you know leaks around law firm the Panama papers was a big buzz so I'm sure that there was a lot more scrutiny after into that kind of media coverage absolutely as I mentioned we we are a partner we're an extension of our clients so when they have security requirements and a lot of them do as some of my colleagues here in their industries you know there's government restrictions government security so we in turn have to meet those client requirements as well great so today in the keynote we had a story from Bella's insurance who is a citrus works based sweet customer they're up for the innovation award and one of the things that they say is that it was unusual for an employee to come up and shake CIOs hand and say thank you for enabling us to work this flexibly and work from anywhere and that doesn't happen in every organization i'm not sure how many people actually had that it's a unique experience but how have end-users reacted to this complete approach to virtualization mobility the file sharing and networking we've had a really good experience in that in that aspect while we don't have people coming up shaking our hand thanking us we do have different people who are really telling others about the the capabilities and and sharing the you know what they're doing day to day we've had several managers who who will invite us into their team meetings to go over the offering we've been using Zen app for as long as the company's been alive I think but we've expanded that into the mobility in to share file and and as teams are using that more they're using it they're telling others about it and we're hearing about that as other teams hear about it and they asked us to come explain it a little more and and they're seeing some really good benefits with it that way excellent and I'm going to tell you I've heard a lot of people at citrix talk about your end-user rollout process and how you educated the employees on what they need to do with this new approach can you explain a little bit about what you did with the rollout so we actually worked with our internal marketing team and we got brochures made up we we took all the Citrix documentation for for the person mobile we had kind of a highlight of how to enroll iOS and Android devices a short overview of the each individual app we did videos and little tutorials that would post it on our internal site and then we had these brochures on everybody's desk the day that we rolled it out so we spent a lot of time and effort doing that and we did get a real good response to that we had about a twenty percent of our of our workforce that enrolled on the first day or a executed on Thursday during the first couple weeks and but and then we really did you know start to slow down but we found that now after that initial push then it's as we meet with each team individually will have chunks of 20 or 50 people that start to use the service most fantastic and congratulations people have been complimenting your roll out here definitely so Craig I know that you have heard directly from your team but also from the employees that are working from home and how they're appreciating this new experience yeah the work from home initiative is where we find the most feedback most of time good sometimes bad when they have their own the woods I have a bad internet connection it drops they call us up 56 lat work but most of time it's good it's a lot of people were lined up waiting like when can I go home when can I go home like what we don't have all the apps ready yet just just hang on we're getting there but so since I've been going home they like the flexibility they have all day to work there they're ours and they don't have to be in for a certain time so it gives them a lot of flexibility and they appreciate that well excellent yeah I know there's a statistic and I can't remember the number but there's a statistic that says people who work remotely are x percent more productive than people that work in an office and I believe that I work at home quite a bit and I'm really feel like I'm more productive so I'm glad they're they're appreciative of that some of things so you've got a unique Syria how are people thanking you well we had one user who actually made me kind of take a step back and think about the solution that xenmobile provides we're so used to traditional core office products all right you log on your PC you have outlook you have word you have excel and it's kind of your core piece of your daily work life we had a user who actually asked if we could replicate the zen mobile experience with works mail and quick edit and the ability to edit on their laptop because the experience was so quick and so convenient on zen mobile they would they would rather have that replace their office suite clinic laptop that's a great testament for the the business productivity apps and the flexibility and usability of them and we really do take user feedback into the development of those apps and that's a great example of it so that's the general employee population but how about your IT team directly how it has the this new approach with citrix workspace sweet helped your IT team to accomplish new things I think it comes back to that that overall directive to enable mobility we're able to you know work from anywhere we've always been able to connect the VPN rdp to our servers to manage the environment but to be able to open receiver now on any device and connect into a virtual desktop that's that's published through xendesktop I mean you're taking it that process down to a matter of seconds to get logged in to manage and that and that goes across the board for our IT team okay I have two more questions for you we were able to replace that VPN with netscaler or what were you doing with that we're not currently okay and you had mentioned how you're using sheriff I haven't talked a lot about the the file sake of chair and you were undergoing a merger and acquisition and your team was able to use to share file yeah we we acquired an asset be about a year and a half ago and during that time we had to transfer data and there was an application that that that was used to maintain that section of pipeline and from the company that we that we purchased that asset from we were able to set up a share file folder and and begin to transfer that data back and forth where in the past we would have relied on something like secure ftp you know all these ancient protocols that you know take a lot of work and you have to have a mind to understand those things now I was able to go create a folder and assign an owner and then let that team hand out permissions to whoever they needed to whether it was on our internal team or the external people that we were working with and it definitely made a big impact there okay that's a wonderful example Craig you had some feedback on your IT team and i think it was around what you're doing all your call centers right well with I team specifically that's not an area we've targeted well Citrix out to yet so a lot of them are we're using VPN at least for certain group so they VPN n then launch a citrix rdp session and rdp to their physical work station and then they do when the VPN would connect they'd get their laptop will get quarantined and they couldn't get on the network so they'd have to drive into work up to in the morning so I after talking to them like well that's just a bad idea let's throw a remote PC on your desktop now you're in so they've really like that that's blown up I think we have 300 people for remote pc right now and for the call centers and the thin clients that's really taking a lot of the pushing the apps out to all the desktop because every seven days or seven days after our security patch of release we have to implement it across the board 30 days for every other patch so instead of pushing all these patches out to 3,000 pcs now works 2000 pcs and just a few citrix images silver-gray it's waving man power saving you yes saving a man power reducing the time and probably the headache as well so great and jumping here as we're talking about works based suite which covers a number of Citrix products I think we've touched just about every one of those products and in roughly the last year ooh upgrading is a nap we have some legacy but now running the latest version of zen app pv as xendesktop we obviously are utilizing nets killers in the mix as well but one of the big driving factors is we had a Windows 10 deployment project and that's what allowed us to kind of take a step back and look at all the technologies and position it for Windows 10 deployment in that project included a hardware refresh as well so we were able to to really leverage Citrix technologies in that that overarching what we call Windows 10 project and it was pivotal as soon as windows 10 was released we began the project and we were able through some of the technology previews that citrix offered we're able to get started almost immediately upon release PVS had a technical review that citrix deployed are made made available pretty quickly so we were able to kind of go through our process and not have to pause as citric continued to release their product cycle from tech preview into production and we were able to really leverage that and it was it was critical we have hundreds of apps we have a number that our integration points into office for addins so we were constantly revising the windows 10 deployment and to do that or to even consider doing that on a piece of hardware and to send that out and go collect them and and then reimage them and send them back again would have been way too time-consuming so we were able to utilize virtual disks pdfs have gold copies of them make our changes utilize versioning and kind of go through our cycle of beta extended kind of IT use and then to get it out into the field for real normal daily use and continuously revise that to make all of the amazing amount of moving pieces work so that was absolutely critical you're kind of bleeding edge there we definitely want bleeding edge as a fantastic experience though using all the new toys in IT i think is something that we all enjoy so to have that opportunity to to put everything new in place it was a really good experience I think you've inspired people to go out and try Windows 10 that's not everyone's there yet so it's great um you know one of the questions that comes up is what kinds of devices can I support can you just kind of run through what kinds of devices are being supported in the organization whether they're all over the map yeah they really are in the in the in the Zin mobile environment we've chosen to support iOS and Android and there's you know some minimum requirements i think iOS 7 maybe 8 I think we have a few seven left in the environment and Android before not something but we but we have just a myriad of devices there on the Android side it's their Nexus there you know a samsung I mean at just about every brand even some asus Isis but we're I mean and with receiver we're able to get get users into ours then abs in desktop environment on really any device and from anywhere and you think about where these pipelines are running they're pretty remote and you're letting people access via mobile device that's that's awesome prank what kinds of devices you support for us on his then mobile side it's it's everything iOS phones tablets Android we're starting to look at Windows 10 we don't have anything on it yet but it's our next and then on the other side it's thin clients of PCs is laptops it's whatever someone bought at best buy that day and they want to run Citrix on it it's a we've seen everything eep Chromebooks are big that's awesome anything that anyone wants to use they can come in and use that's good and somebody what kind of the things you're supporting similar response when it comes to zen mobile where we're supporting all three platforms windows android/ios we we don't really limit it there are some I think recommended minimal OS versions that are out there so we we do keep those in place but we really haven't had a problem with people falling below the minimum when it comes our VDI offering same situation terminals desktops personal equipment it's essentially just about anything can connect back up to the VDI infrastructure so it might be quicker to say what aren't we supporting okay I think I'm that's interesting because one of the questions that we hear when we talk about bring your own device people get scared and say I think that my people would buy the cheapest device ever and that's really not the case people really aren't doing that are they no I don't think so ok so there's minimum requirements but we actually have that has been one of the challenges a yeah I know we're talking about a lot of positive things in here but that was one of the challenges in our xenmobile deployment again because we didn't really put any restrictions out there we were allowing people to work in a way that's comfortable to them and we we had a few users that had purchased devices that I personally would not have considered purchasing and and miraculously I mean it's been a very low percentage I can think of a couple that turned out to be just too low spec to where they really couldn't be supported out of the hundreds of devices that we have out there so it's actually been pretty amazing that we were able to support such a wide wide variety good can Craig anybody that went and bought the cheapest possible thing and tried to support it no we haven't seen that what a lot of hours our corporate devices that we have a lot of requirements around what kind of devices you can use most of our corporate but every once in a while you'll get a sea level that says I bought this last night well thank you for dispelling this because this is one of the big myths about BYOD and we hear this literally in every BYD BYOD conversation is my people would buy something that wouldn't work they buy the cheapest possible thing and thank you you've just all dispelled this myth of BYOD so one more question that actually have to give Josh the credit because so often in these kinds of conversations and he said himself wouldn't necessarily come to hear the business concerns we talked a lot this morning in the keynote about the business concerns that the customers were seeing and this is a session where we want to make sure we cover the technology as well we know a lot of people here a more technical level than you know driving business requirements although those things go hand in hand so I wanted to make sure we asked what is the geekiest most out of the box cool innovation you've been able to accomplish with Citrix workspace sweet and Josh this is your question so go for it and I'm a little embarrassed because it's not all that geeky it's really this one of the simpler tech you know technical things that we did but we've actually begun piloting and we're starting to roll this out and it's actually using ShareFile which has somehow been one of the bigger impacting product so that we've been using over the past year so we're actually pushing out policy let me back up and say we're using the share file sync client on our windows computers and we've got policy set up so that they automatically configure the first time a user logs in so what we're doing is we're actually using just standard window folder redirection and redirecting the desktop and the documents folders into the user share file folder so then in the background it's syncing those files back into our localized datastore so the what the impact of that is is that when that user walks up to me and says hey what's wrong with my laptop and the hard drive has died I don't have to be the one to give them the bad news that I can't do anything about it I hand them the new iPad I hand them a new desktop we set up the ShareFile client and then all their data comes right back right away so that makes I team or the hero it's awesome that's great i would love to have that i've had that problem the hard drive died so Greg what's something really cool that you're doing with citrus or space week oh one thing was unexpected we had a c-level person that had an iPad pro and he wanted use as a desktop and I had an X 1 mile so I took it over we set it up he thought this is great I thought starting rollout ShareFile I'm what have you by my pilot user so i gave him sheriff I'll we set up some connectors we could get to his drives and he few weeks later I ran into me is like i've been using workspace suite of it our works i've been using sheriff I'll might be using that works mail and I haven't even logged into a desktop like the only thing I can't do is I can't print googly had it turned off across the board so he was on the approved list of prints I'm like well I think I can fix that set it up emailed in a few days later he's like I us I'm working great so he's I think Jesse's than the ipad pro and works male and ensure file we see that a lot people that just want to work with the ipad it's easier to travel with is this a traveling executive so that that may feel a lot i think also you're doing something that not a lot of people are doing yet you're using skype for business right and it can talk about that how that's what ya part of the homework initiative was a how do we get them to be able to have face-to-face conversations with their manager and the thin clients were rolling out have a built-in webcam and the mic was a little cheaper good my headset but they're able to do skype for business video chat back and forth with their managers and that's been going well and that really does drive that connection for people who are remote they're not in the office having that video and having that opportunity to skype for business and having it within sampson desktop is so important because it's not leaving any data on the device and that's something that we that is kind of an afterthought when we're talking about Skype for business and what we're doing with it Timothy what do your we already talked about your bleeding edge with the cool thing that you're doing well like most organizations out there we have restrictions on our desktop internet browsers I think that's pretty common right have to lock things down to protect again going back to our security question however in our industry that doesn't always work again our client basis is vast it's a number of industries and we have to go to legal research sites we you know where it's really anything and everything is a legitimate business purpose for us and nit that's where used to what's your business justification if you want this exception we have a lot of them that are legitimate business justifications depending on our client needs and what research has to be done and where where our internal users need to go we can't it wasn't a good solution just keep punching holes inside to our local browser so we actually utilized PDFs and zen app and created a secondary offering for those people who qualified and had a business need we offered a less restricted browser to allow them to meet their business needs while still providing a level security that that we expect and you know something just to point out here all of you are listening to your users you're listening to a scenario that's happening in the environment and thinking about how to improve it and there are a couple workshops that are going on at synergy talking about how to listen to your end users and how to map their experience and actually the technical counterpart to this session which is thursday at two thirty talks about how to wipe more doubt your user experience think about what they're doing today how they're using virtualization how they're using different mobility programs how they're using file-sharing whether it's with dropbox or box or if they're actually using sheriff i'll think about their user experience and what is working and not working especially when they're going in and out of different systems with Citrix it's nice that things are integrated so we've got the integration between Zen apps and desktops share file share files and mobile we've got things kind of all talking to each other and it's a different user experience point out how everyone's saying I listen to my users but users want to do this this is the scenario this is a group of people that really understand what's happening in their organization so kudos on all of that so at this time I want to turn it over to any questions in the audience and also check for questions in the live stream so if you have a question feel free to use our microphones and we've got them on either side and I'll check the live stream but I know that one that comes up all the time is about mobility and what mobility means in today's workforce and we always talk we are blaming on the Millennials but I'm someone who likes to be mobile and I'm certainly not a millennial so maybe you could talk about that while I check the live stream for many questions mobility and how that's changing the people in your organization yeah for us it's really it's been like and I think I mentioned this before it's not so much that I'm going to use a mobile device it's it's being able to be productive no matter where I matter what I'm using and and it's become more of a but I think where we've taken the approach to to allow the user to connect with a new device of whatever type they choose and they they can connect and get connected to their apps or their data and be able to be productive in just a matter of seconds really is our goal I think for us and the mobility part is a lot of our upper management and sea level as they dig dis expecting to instant access to everything from a matter where they are and that's where we try and help and I think we're finally at a place that we'd predicted many years ago I started my career with a major telecom company I won't say any names but they have a white and blue logo and worked for the mobility division and when we kind of mapped out and this was you know early mid 90s we've mapped out the evolution and started down that that trail of you know 3 watt analog to the various digital technologies to 3g2 what we have now with long-term evolution and in the digital spectrum and it was always to get to that point to to realize the mobile workforce to make that happen and there there were lesser-known projects even back then with like Wireless meter reading you know text messaging when that first came out was an overly popular took a few years and and so the progression i think is natural and we're actually finally starting to realize some of that work that was mapped out years ago and and i think just about every organization can not only benefit from it but i think the employees now just an expectation absolutely one of the feel free to ask questions of the room and then we have kind of shy crowd here and is five o'clock one of the questions from the live stream is about NetScaler and it is important to note there's a whole networking track at synergy this year which is great but we haven't talked a lot about NetScaler can you address how netscaler is affecting your overall workspace approach yeah we use netscaler really for everything anything that comes in from the outside to access any of our citrix resources goes through the netscaler and that was a learning curve for me I'm I'm traditionally a systems admin so so learning the networking side of that was you know a little bit you know a lot of hands-on I ended up you know doing the training after I had had gone through some deployment and then but really it's having it all there you know it definitely allows you some visibility into the connections that are being made and you know in the built-in security this air is definitely helpful okay we have 16 net scalars a lot of physical separation for a government contract is the big requirement but doesn't the main production one will be the sdx and everything we do runs to the event scale or even our internal thin clients run through the netscaler but they have a requirement up to factor for everything and that was just the easiest way to make that happen so internally externally you're going through the netscaler although balancing its kind of the backbone of everything NetScaler is an integral part of our infrastructures well too for security and also just for the citrix infrastructure when i first thought was exposed to citrix it was strictly through zen app and and kind of progressed through there through the virtual desktop mobility netscaler and nets killer is definitely an important part of that stack and it was refreshing kind of during the keynote this morning where that was mentioned absolutely Sen app stood on its own and and delivered great business value but when you look at the entire stack combined it becomes even that much more powerful excellent excellent okay and one last question again from the live stream what is the next thing that you want to do you've implemented fully you're working with a lot of pieces what's the next thing on your list was such a sweet sweet our next thing is is doing virtual desktops with XenDesktop we currently have that in in a we're beginning to pilot that and that that's that's what we're working on right now just virtualizing all of our apps condensing our image count down into the app discs or at V or whatever else we can come up with at the time I think we're in a natural progression for the expansion of share file when when file sharing kind of first started cropping up I think a lot of companies were behind and started seeing the drop boxes and kind of the unsanctioned solutions out there share file has absolutely taken care of those issues for us and now it's a preferred method so we're looking at additional integration pieces like the client look like wine so you can kind of map drives and some solutions that Josh was referring to earlier in addition like most organizations while we we do have the 78 Zen apps and desktop combined environment out there we still are running an older than app environment too so one of the goals are probably to collapse that environment no shortage of projects here not great I'm any less call any questions in the room all right we've got a quiet crowd here today and so I just want you to keep talking about this conversation and there's a lot of information on our website we have Citrix blogs about workspace sweet we are very active on social if you haven't been using the citrix synergy hashtag yet please start and we're on most the social media that you use twitter facebook linkedin instagram and highly encourage you to check out our youtube channel it is an unsung resource we have a lot of videos very short videos longer videos in-depth master classes where you can learn in-depth how do I learn about netscaler how do I learn about ShareFile how do I learn about zen mobile so for Zen apps and desktop customers who are looking to expand that workspace watch the videos see the demos it's a really great resource and then here you can learn a lot as well and I really do want to highlight the 203 on Thursday afternoon and it's designed for existing xand appens and desktop customers who are trying to figure out how do I deal with mobility how do i replace what i have today that's not working or not supported or just not giving the right user experience how do i integrate file-sharing how do i expand to this workspace idea but there are a fantastic amount of sessions that talk about the work place in the workspace and encourage you to check them all out so with that I want to thank my panel we've had a really great conversation today and thank you to everyone in the audience and on the live stream you
