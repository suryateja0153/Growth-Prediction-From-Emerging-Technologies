 I heard the keynote just finished so it's a little I was told to talk for a little bit until more people come but but it's alright we can get started my name is Marissa Schmidt product manager in the netscaler team thank you so much for being here right after the keynote I know you had there's a lot of sessions that you guys want to go through but thank you for taking the time with us today I've been within a scalar team for about seven and a half years prior to that I was also a DC product manager for all T on and engineering before that making sure these features work so might so I have been in the ADC space for a long time so to get started we will go through and fulfill it tweet us into 45 citrix energy lots of activities there if you saw the I've Abhishek Xiao Han netscaler mass that was a big thing at this morning so feel free to use the Citrix and synergy hashtag so we'll go through what as based on the description and agenda we will go through the sdx update was new and 11 dot 14 s DX so very specific to s DX i did the one yesterday what's new with netscaler overall now I'm going to go through in detail the update for 11 dot 14 s DX then I'm going to have my two colleagues over here and legacy health who's going to join me to go through the their customer use cases for from legacy health and there s DX and tips as well as their migration project from f5 to the netscaler so they will come up didn't want to be standing here the whole time so that's why we're here so then let's get started the STX piece as you know I did have the new platform come out with 115 instances now for the highest platform the 25,000 series so it is for those that are new to the sdx it is a multi-tenant box the K can have multiple instances all-in-one and ability to to divide each of the instances like a pizza and really narrow it down to what that use case is for that for that application for that department for all the different needs from CPU memory to the neck level right so those are always been there and full isolation all the way to the SR IOV technology with Intel that we partnered with and we actually have a video if you haven't seen it with Intel showing their capabilities and features that's what make a software the software first using some of those cpus and and Intel technologies and as you know our third-party workloads can also work on on our current appliances Palo Alto websense blue cat CA are just some of the few that are our workloads that can work as a vm on the sdx current appliances today the new models the one that will go up to 115 instances is the 25,000 series then I also have the 14,000 series that goes to 25 instances so a little more than my previous 1 11 5 x.x model that went to 20 instances so a lot more that you can do in the new platforms we also have the 40s version with more SSL so that means that you can divide each of the different vm were close with and dedicate some of the core so i actually have 112 cores in the current ssl but in this model you multiply that by 4 ok so that's how you able to get to 275,000 transaction per second for 2k keys and 32,500 for ECC so what's new in terms of features features there's a lot actually in terms of features again I will be here a long time if I go through all of them but I'm going to highlight the 3m three buckets the new features in terms of will enhancements and the enhancement with security in mind so that's really what we're going to go through new features enhance security for that product as well as usability based on our customers feedback what we should add and so forth what we look into and make sure that it happens in this release so I'll go through a little bit more in detail for each of these so feel free to ask questions even when you we have legacy health up here Iraq rather that we be interactive we will have Q&A at the end with Mike so feel free to ask your questions than to enhance security the configurable ciphers actually in it before 11 that one we had static ciphers to connect with the management service so in this 11 that one release now you can have the list of cipher group cipher suites are all day already there so it now can be configurable ciphers for for this and then you can create even all that bilbo ciphers are now listed for you as well as the settings that you can set in the configuration menu and bind it with all the different ciphers a switch that you created okay so that is new in 11 that one tighter security with NS recover account the NS recover authentication is it cannot be controlled with the external server so it's always a problem for some of our customers that really want that control so then what we've done is we have you have the ability to now disable the in its recover login it is there by default enabled but now you can have it disabled and and gives you more ability to authenticate when you need to with with that log in the other one is the encrypted backup files they previously our backup files was not encrypted and some customers really want that security in mind so we have a 256-bit encryption done on the backup files now and you can set it up and you can even set the password is is is there and it will ask for that password when you want to create that back up and then restore okay so that is part of that enhancement then we'll go through on the new features for new features as part of our for some admin partition that we've done for for the rest of the modules now we also have the shared VLAN for admin partition in sdx previously on the shared VLAN admin partitions on the VPX require the vmax right and then you have to then create that on the sdx management's service so now at this you still do it have to do the v-max but for the vp x you can then create that s vm that generates that and configures that vMac okay then through Zen store as vm makes these v-max available on the vp x so then you can create and provision using these be max for admin partition okay so this just gives you a capture of the instance the partition max that you can do once you create that V Max and how to do that creation of the partition max static routes for the management network before the 11 that one release once the vp x is provision in most cases the user deletes the default gateway okay so then what happens when when they're you need to do the backup there's no gate way that they can connect to for that VPX so in this case using a next-hop user provides that static route on to the SVM ok so then then the as the SVM configures this route on that VPX and and and you can check that periodically and in terms of configuration you can do the Gateway as well as the next hop in that configuration as well so you can do one or the other or both so that is there and how to configure that is here the the net the network configuration for the biggest one that we've done with this release is really the ipv6 ipv6 for the sdx it so it's been there for all in terms of the ipv6 for the whole stack with the netscaler OS since i don't know six seven years ago I know that there's always requested I have to do ipv6 even know not everybody is implementing it still but it we did give that capability now on the management service you can have the ipv6 ipv4 or both they can actually do checks so you can check boxes they're available for you to do both then you do it for their VPX instance ok so the VP accented instance you can do the same can modify the IP addresses you can have one big one be ipv4 ipv6 or both as well but the caveat here is that once you create that VPX with that network type then has to stay in that in that scenario ok so once you created as both it will stay as both otherwise you don't have to create a new instance with that network type so that's how you do the provisioning here and then also the store our address IP addresses are now also supportive for the following the triple-a server smtp is an SNMP trap all those things are now also ipv6 support external storage for backup today before this release of 11 dot one you can only do manually and last three files right and you need to do it from shell so in this release now we're doing out of transfer if you want or you can still manually do it but you can do f ftp SFTP and SCP okay and here's the how you do that it gives you I know my captors not as clear but you can get the slides after so you have it or in the release notes have the details as well so how do you configure your backup policy and and set the backup files you want ok authentication today before the 11 that one release authentication is to a single external server so so then there's really no fallback win so a lot of the cases that customers want to be able to do so now in this release we can do up to 32 out servers that that that you can use for very various external servers and you Kaskade meaning it's it's one after the other you prioritize based on that that list but you know it's the next one in that list that it would take ok it's like Lester ban is not so authentication details are here in terms of configuration and then how you choose the various external servers ok lastly so we can get to the actual customer scenarios we are going to go through the usability quickly in terms of usability we have the option to set CLI prom I know it's more like customizable CLI so you'll see that you can either equal it to whatever string that you want or you can even do it with special characters like present you for a username % h for a hostname and so forth okay though that is there now then another one that was requested is notification for authentication failure so this one is when the svm connect it displays the vp x as yellow on the on the dashboard so most of the time the reason why is really for authentication failures that they are they change the password for that so for this you can now put your mouse on that that VPX dashboard and you'll see that authentication failure details and what's happening there and you can even do it for the xen server authentication issues that may come up there too so little things that will help in a lot of our IT admins feedback on this so it's really cool thing then HTTP or HTTPS protocol for each of the instance level before you do everything you know either you go HTTP or HTTPS in terms of your connection to that VPX but now you can actually do it in the VPX level you can set it up that you want that that fuel VPX to be HTTPS or a few of them to be HTTP ok so that is the there now for this release and you can even set the management port so the right after the configuration of the netscaler at the bottom part is where you can put the the selection of HTTPS or HTTP configurable system notification I know it's like one of those when you have your phone and you have all these apps and not notifying you for everything that you're getting or your email or your your your your phone messages so same thing for the the system notifications for sdx you can now configure which one you want and a disable some of that the alerts are events you can even set up email SMS whatever you feel like you need for configuration of the system and you can select all the ones that you want to do okay so that is really some of the fun and good things that customers are looking for and that is part of this release to 11 that one that's coming out in June okay okay with that we are going to go through our customer a case study and I want to thank you so much lower thank you tony has today thank you thank you okay so good morning everybody my name is Jeff Wilson I man is manager at legacy health in portland oregon and this is joe and i got jelly entities so i'm joe shidler I work with legacy I am the netscaler resource the primary contact point for anything to do with netscaler at the organization so quick background about legacy health we're locally based in portland oregon we have around over 10,000 employees six hospitals a lot of clinics citrix wise joe i think what we concurrent usage tops out around 6,000 but 6,000 years to give you an idea for i guess at design outside but that's legacy health so for advocate application delivery though a background kind of portfolio that we had was microsoft ice of course we had a cisco ace in the data centers for load balancing and then we had a citrix netscaler and primarily i believe it was used just for citrix products than a products yeah it does a little bit of load balancing these we're talking to older MPX tiles we actually have three pairs couple of dmz a couple internal and then one that we kind of use for what we call one-off services so as I sub was being migrated out we made the decision to go with f5 that's why we're here today at the Citrix conference oh sorry um no that was a joke we went we decided to go with f5 in 2013 however this past fall we kind of re-evaluate our current portfolio we started migrating items to load balancing and outpatient delivery to f5 but we really didn't have a good internal support structure so I it was an internal thing we were I'm sure others have experiences does the engineering department on it or does networking on it who's working on the project so our CTO kind of said let's take a pause let's look at our current portfolio we now have basically four or five applications in production hakama consolidate and reduce vendors so with that we decided to move to the citrix standard a nuts killer and internally we decided to let's move all Citrix whether it's zen app or NetScaler to one team and that's how I kind of got to be a part of Citrix i'm curious to at the end if anybody else wants to talk about how their orders organizationally based in the holds then app versus NetScaler i'm curious how other people have had success with that or not had success with that so finally moving on to our conversion project in 2015 the gear arrived at our data centers we got it installed and our first goal I've was in March and that was a new a brand new SharePoint point portal for physician portals and so it's for our physicians to collaborate and then access their applications for those leaving healthcare epics a big one that we run epic and to provide some simplified sign-on into epic through that we now have a big list like 50 applications ranging from a simple load balance these two windows servers to employee self service online accessible anywhere so they're all over the place as far as the scale of complexity and Virgil can get into that a little bit more but we have a big backlog that we want to get through by the end of this calendar year with that Joe is going to cover some more technical details morning so we talked about well Jeff talked about you know the complexity of our environment what we ran into what we're faced with it's not different than most of what I'm sure you've run into and that is when we have multiple you know distinct services f5 Cisco ace aissa anything that is essentially providing services on our network we get into that whole management nightmare of who's responsible for each one of these services in legacy is absolute case in point you know hey I need to load balance something is that a network resource is that an application resource who's really responsible so when we looked at this as an overall issue we started taking Citrix in to kind of focus and said what concentrix do since we already use you know five thousand users of it every day what can Citrix do to help us and really the answer becomes sdx an SD X in the platform itself consolidates all of these services into one manageable interface one manageable group that group happens to be you know yours truly standing here on stage with a couple of other guys so when we say f5 ice Cisco ace bring it all down into NetScaler STX platform manage it provide services and ultimately provide better health care by utilizing those services we come out with a big success what you see on screen here is really what we've moved from or moved to and that is for STX 11 5 15 s sitting across two data centers with multiple VPX is sitting on top those VP X's provides distinct services so on the DMZ side right now legacy is transitioning into multiple internet access points right now they only have one so you'll see there's kind of a discrepancy between all of our services on the Left versus on loan right so we have a DMZ netscaler it sits on top of the sdx obviously like the rest of them do we have an internal system that provides all of our clinics to connect up internally now we don't trust our clinic devices but they are on our network of the coming in through a VPN and so they all hit this internal vp x device that ultimately provides as a gay way come back concentric circles of security will continue to expand those circles as we move farther and farther into the BYOD environment or as we move into more clinics or more external access points we have an app's instance and this is kind of the big boy of all of them the apps instance provides all of our internal services so I'm sure you've seen in some of the other presentations SharePoint you you know you name it independent applications that is our apps instance and it ultimately provides our internal intranet provides a doctor access to specific sites and it provides some independent applications we'll talk about that a little bit more of you know what is the true benefit of an application instance and really what is the true benefit of the netscaler you'll see in this presentation that we bounced around from technical to what we've run into and how we overcame some of our issues the last couple here are the s 0 dev instance so those dev instances are ultimately important to the technical folks to the guys that have to manage the system to the team that I run and that is when we want to validate or try a new system we want to try new configuration it goes to that instance we never impact our users we never impact our caregivers it always goes that new instance and we really utilize that instance in a kind of a more advanced feature set that if we want to get down and start to modify the netscaler we want to get to the file system in changing things that are unavailable in the GUI that's the boy that we do it on test everything out there once it's good then we can start to roll to production and then obviously with the sdx and the ability to scale or to add new instances we have this future the future installs are the future capabilities we can bring up more implementations of VP X's on those at will outside of being able to spin up new VPX instances what really is the big benefit to legacy and probably the most of you and that is for us its ownership and control in a historic environment when you went to implement a new network type device or any type of a device that crossed boundaries right we all know about those little islands those little groups of hey i am the network resource island hey i'm the applications island and boy if you come over here you know you better have your ship in order because we're going to you know kind of put you through the wringer if you want a new IP address if you want a new cable run why do you need that fiber what is this when we start to look at the sdx we merge the lines of responsibilities and it's something that citrix has done in the past and they're doing it again it's actually a really powerful feature that people don't recognize so when we said hey we're going to bring in an STX platform what does it really mean to our to to our group itself independently and ultimately to providing services ownership and control if we need a new vp x we can spin it up when we pull in an lacp channel into the vp x or to sue me into the sdx we now have the capability to provision networks on demand so previously hey I need a new internet DMZ I need to you know pull in a cable or I need a new network drop coming in from a new clinic or new network or a new land whatever it may be we can now provision those at the sdx so we pull it up the lacp channel into the sdx we now have all of those networks available and then we can sub provision those into each of the VP exes so the capabilities to kind of bypass groups or engage groups as needed is huge well we're able to actually get our job done more efficiently and with less stress on all of the team's ease of administration are if you've ever had to deal with you know I think mercy you're mentioned backing up the sdx or backing up the vp x is having a console to do that how nice is that or if you're like most of us and be like well how do i get to the you know the login screen of the vp x well now if you just go to the sdx click on the link takes you right to it I mean easy of administration I mean that's kind of bread and butter so it's there the capabilities to centralize the upgrades so if you've used STX in the past you realize that only a few revisions ago did they do this consolidated upgrade capability and that is the ability to take one code base from Citrix download it to the v2 the sdx and it will upgrade the entire system so we're talking xenserver upgrade VPX upgrades or the capability to just selectively upgrade the devices or the the instances themselves so that that centralized upgrade capability how nice is that no more do I have to log into one netscaler and upgrade it and log into another one upgrade it it's an intelligent lead driven upgrade process it's a wonderful feature and with ours for our debit vibrants we just like hey don't upgrade that one leave that one alone reduce network complexity I think we touched on that a little bit you know when we said hey we can pull an LA CD channel now we can sub provide those sub provision those networks down to each of the instances that's that really reduces the complexity from our networking team of having to pull cables and having to run a cable for every VPX or excuse me every MPX that's out there it makes it much easier for us and then the performance dashboard if you really want to know what those instances are doing for its dashboard is the way to go take a look see if they're overloaded if they're getting hammered or if they're really not being used much at all so all in all the sx platform in itself is just a huge benefit for consolidation for administration and for less stress and for everyone involved organizational value so when I look at this you know and I look at the sdx error or the netscaler in general I kind of think you know good old doctor who you know everyone looked at doctor who and goes on you know what the heck does I have to do with VPX and in a sonic screwdriver well really when I look at it I see two things to see one in order to resolve issues guy has to use one intelligence and to his tools and that's exactly what we do in the netscaler world the big big misconception of netscaler right it's a load balancer that's what I hear when we move from a f5 world or you know an ace world oh just put it on that load bouncer that netscaler that's really not the case you know netscaler functionality and then it's not for you to try to read the tiniest text the Nets care of functionality is a mint in the problem that you get into is that people don't realize their capabilities that are there and when they do oh are you going to be busy and that's exactly we've run into here I can't tell you that every day I get the question of hey canna netscaler do X so when I said on the slightest sao Citrix does it again remember is in app so if you remember back to the xenapp world where you have a Windows Server and you had a guy who would administer it and then all of a sudden you put an application on it that person becomes responsible for well sadly to say becomes results for the app responsible for the ls responsible for the upgrades troubleshooting application troubleshooting the network he blurs the line or she blurs the line of what's involved in supporting this system and it crosses those islands of boundaries once again of hey why are you looking at the network you know what's going on netscaler does the exact same thing that blurs the lines of responsibilities within an organization and ultimately it builds a more consolidated team in order to understand what the netscaler is doing you have to understand what's the application require you have to understand what does my end user expect or what does the backend server do all of those combined obviously require that you understand the environment as a whole now the good and the bad of that and it's kind of a good bad and ugly is two things one you have to have a team that is capable of understanding and troubleshooting those back to our doctor who you got to have that logic that capability that made the the brainpower to figure it out you have to have the tools do it in this case the netscaler but you also have to have kind of the understanding that all of these things combined requires a consolidated team or it requires that cross boundaries team and that's kind of the soft ass aspect of it the nice thing about netscaler is that when you get in there in order to do some of these features right point-and-click it's nice and easy to go you're able to you know see everything that's available in the GUI or what you believe is able available in the GUI and that's what we talked about for our junior engineers and at legacy we certainly ran into some of that that hey our junior engineers haven't really used that scalar whole lot get them into the GUI Citrix has done a great capably a great process of everything that's available to you here it is in the GUI you're good to go but for the advanced features you need to get under the hoods and get under the hood and start to actually get into the file system so this is I apologize here once again you know net so does again the floodgates open we'll get back to what legacy expects here so we migrated 50 applications unfortunately every time we go to migrate an application people learn what else is capable of the netscaler and we get more requests more more more more things hey can it do x y&z think last week it was canna netscaler do a scalar change my password case in point here was we have our epic system in our current environment people log in they could log in from outside and they want to change their password but the password synchronization and ad that is most of you know hits a particular domain controller and then it has to replicate and that's a big issue for us so if you go change your password on our external interface and then you go to log into our EMR you get blocked you can't get in for patients and healthcare that's really not a good thing if you need a doctor to find out what's wrong with you and he can't get it in the EMR you know probably a little more concerning than not so they came to us and said hey can the netscaler change passwords we said well we can present a password change pages and really what are you asking can the net can the netscaler communicate specifically to a domain controller that our EMR set to communicate with sure create a bit set the backends to the to the domain controllers we want where you go case in point it's solved this took months this was on the table back and forth I think when I talking the security analyst it was you know they've been fighting with it for over a year like with netscaler it's easy you simply create a bit but this is not a big deal what seems to be a problem second one is content switching and SharePoint so I know there are a bunch of young the audience that have to use SharePoint or Microsoft applications netscaler works directly with Microsoft to support those apps we're going we've gone through a huge huge SharePoint initiative putting it all behind netscaler putting in SSO and then ultimately coming out of that people said hey I see you got SharePoint what about some of my other you know non Microsoft applications more of our EMR applications the big one that way we just ran into last week was we need to have it's like a my pay site you know you find out in for loss and stuff we need to be able to pass through credentials and we fought with this for three years how can we pass through depeche through the credentials course it comes back hey Kim netscaler pass through credentials I mean we were looking at a third-party done like so Joe my joke now is if your team's having it your project teams having an issue please make it a nuts Claire is a nap problem and escalate it yeah if your team says hey we can't do it go ask the netscaler guys is really what happens down 2 so 4 hours it was hey can we do pass through authentication you bet 401 based forms authentication we go through figure out what needs to be put into those forums in a way we go get back to what you guys are interested in is well how do you figure out what goes in those forms so probably one of the best things that I've taken away from synergy was just that and I'm going to share it with you in order to provide netscaler support in order to provide application support you really need to learn a couple of different things we've said kind of like with the xenapp gosh you have no windows you got them to the network you gotta know the application NetScaler izle no different you need to know the netscaler environment not too bad to do right like to the GUI through the documentation whatever it may be but you need to have that logic that doctor who thought of the capabilities to troubleshoot and figure things out so we talked any type of a web app you know do you use fiddler and a lot when I looked at my team they're like what's fiddler and fiddler crabs or what's there no fiddler you need to be able to look at HTTP headers do you look at Firebug being able to see what communications going on through firefox back to the web servers do you need to do live HD HTTP headers through chrome so all of these small little add-ons all of these little things are what gives you the capabilities to actually support and a user NetScaler to the to the fullest of its capabilities so for us you bet we had some issues with this the single sign-on application pull up live HTTP headers pull up fiddler see what it's doing post and gets to this to those pages right there copy and paste well don't copy and paste type it in yeah word to the wise don't ever copy and paste in the netscaler type it in even if you can't type like me type it in copy and paste is going to get your extra characters things won't work so for single sign-on put in the post put in the get and like that three years is what I was told it was taking our environment to get the single sign on with NetScaler the tools were there the capability was there the intelligence was there all it needed to be is follow through so this is a cool little Vizio drawing if one of the issues that we ran into so when we started talking about sharepoint and we started talking about how we want to authenticate i'm going to give you you know the precursor here this did get resolved we had to provide kind of a gooey look and feel to our to our sharepoint team in order to understand what the netscaler was going to do so we drew up this happy little dizzy 0 diagram up here's what we're going to do but we also started to design our implementation based on the diagram and there's one problem is that in the current version of the netscaler code in order to do a triple AAA authentication with content switching and then to pass that authentication back down into unified gateway and then ultimately pass that unified gateway when someone clicks on an icon to launch an application that process wasn't capable than the current code that we were using I understand that it is now but it wasn't capable of the current code base we were using so again with NetScaler the tool is so flexible that even overcoming and issued that in itself had generated it could be done so what we ended up doing is we dropped in a triple AAA authentication view server we dropped and content switch and you were able to go and get to your unified gateway but if you wanted to click on an application and have a launch you would know that that credential needs to still flow through the unified gateway into your storefront serve and away you go if you were to do this the traditional means of taking storefront identifying your citrix netscaler gateway you would have to have that unified gateway authentication method in that and that wouldn't work with a triple AAA authentication vserver and constant switching on the front end but what you can do is you can bypass and tell storefront no gateway use optimum network routing up the optimal gateway on storefront go into your NetScaler do a 401 based forms authentication into storefront no traffic from outside ever seems to be hitting the storefront servin storefront server has no gateway to find and yet you are still able to hitch a triple-a vserver hit your content switch go down to storefront click on an icon and have it launched so through the flexibility of the tool itself you're able to overcome an issue that itself generated so i can't tell you what's more powerful than that then the capabilities of overcoming an issue that you generated on your own we talked slightly about advanced versus basic administration or basic configuration so as many of you know gateway unified gateway gives you the cool capability of modifying your logon page and it's cool it's great but if you've got caregivers or users like we do that are ultimately very picky and I it could be compliance it could be marketing whatever it is that says hey we really need an environment we really need a logon page that is more advanced were pristine looking than what unified gateway will give us so basic administration point click change what you want advanced administration is really where it comes into play and this is getting down to the base file management or base files of the netscaler and being able to modify them so and we're gonna talk about triple-a authentication page here in a second as well but for unified gateway it was a matter of going in getting down on to the net scalars file system and start to modify those files directly so you can see on the on your guys's right Milo right left here is what we had previously from unified gateway and what we were able to create honestly once we identified the files that need to be modified it wasn't that hard I had to go learn some CSS and once again use firefox and put in some code but we had we created a new logon page this is what our caregivers now see you know it's all branded it's all header and footer it's really what our environment required I'm going to have the document available I'm will post up online it was a conglomeration of a few of different Google searches and a few other folks that had put in some work but ultimately we put it together now we come back to triple-a current version of netscaler for triple-a doesn't allow you to do independent log on pages right you get the black logo put in your username and password there's really not much you can do to it and unfortunately be it that Triple A is such a big component of netscaler I know that you guys have gotten feedback in word is that the next version the next code release does have triple-a themes and that's really what we're talking about here its triple-a themes are based in there I think I saw a preview of the code it was based down into the command line interface but you're able to do the same thing we went through and prior to the themes being released we have created the exact same page by once again going down and modifying the CSS code and modifying the the JavaScript you can do it it's not supported there are some gotchas to it things like make sure you backup your system prior to all your file system when you go to do an upgrade of your netscaler make sure that revert back I've heard horror stories of bricking a box if you do not and then ultimately upgrade your netscaler and put your coat back in place again that's type of advanced administration at advanced task you can do with the netscaler that with an f5 or with an ace really not going to be doing that type of work I think that's it cool thank you so much thank you just have to stay for QA so we're just going to go through some the some logistics here and then we'll go through Q&A to give you some question time for these guys so it's been great that they were here to really provide the details for their customer environment scenarios and and tips so thank you so again we discussed it yesterday the community is important for us as C ugc is here I think they're right next door if you want to sign up and be part of that community then we also have the the so this the URL to join and this and there's a networking group just for for that C ugc and then the developer resources and so forth are here and the deployment guides all the things that he was also referring to in terms your point deployment and all those things all the docs are here as well so before you leave we do have a super security session and that is with a with the actual guy that saved the DNS or you know so he is that from the packet pushers organization so it's a good one to go to at 1pm today I think and sin 237 features and then 240 is another one ok and then again your feedback is important for us so definitely provide feedback if this is something you want to see more like this with case studies and updates on the product let us know and with that we're going to open it up for Q&A for two minutes I really enjoyed your presentation I can relate a lot to your variance in terms of you know people approaching you to come up with a you know innovative solutions but I am interested in your story about your organizational challenges that's something that we continue to struggle with is you know forever since we started using the technology how do we fit it into our organization and we still haven't resolved that I was wondering if you could expand a little bit more on on your what your experience has been some more about like where the team's live and how they interact with networking and that is that what you're asking yeah so we're learning with we're learning like I said it was only this fall when the teens got consolidate basically the Zen app and the next NetScaler in the new netscaler team so we do a lot of work with our networking team still and we're working on kind of a racy like a roles and responsibilities document has to like in the future who what is networking going to do traditional networking and what is our team going to do I don't have the full answer right now I do know that this project is basically ninety percent run by Joe and his teammates and then we kind of just reach out to networking when we need DMZ I mean yeah I'm gonna kind of yeah it really that's really what it comes down to is you end up becoming the best friends of your networking team of your security team and you almost become a level was it a little higher but your overall layered level you you interact with each one of them and you build that trust in that relationship it doesn't you never segment the group's completely and say hey you're going netscaler team you're gonna be on the network team you'll never get there it's always I've got to interact with others so you kind of become that floating layer right above you interact with each one and then as requirements come down of I need to talk to networking and security you pull the teams together and meet with them so you kind of kind of the glue over the whole fabric yeah we've helped it's helped to be a focus being like we're doing that scalar this is our project you know and then and then when we when I need help from the firm the engineering team or the network team then it's like we're coming as the big project this is a big legacy project we need that your help versus when we did the f5 project it was a little more spread and there wasn't so much of a this team owns it this manager owns this product and so we're finding a lot more success i believe by saying this manager own citrix whether it's nuts killer is an up and i have a key for it the only thing i would add is having executive level support your directors and above have to support you and have to drive that whole group group think if you will it is and we need we need we need help so if anybody needs a job no sorry thank you uh i'm not sure if it this is a scope of this discussion but you guys said the key word ace I work with online banking retail online business online we're in the process of migrating from the ACE 4710 to the netscaler my question is did you guys run any issues with that migration as far as we ran into a couple issues as far as things we've had the aces for four or five years so you put settings in modifications on the CLI and stuff you take for granted you forget about it makes the application work yep went the netscaler netscaler is a dream right I'm so used to the ace or I'm a cisco guy over where CLI type everything in when I got that gooey it's like I'm a little concerned about hitting that done button right but and we haven't run the major issues but just things that we didn't think about when we migrated over and we're still in the process we have multiple business units where we didn't think about before we went the netscaler which the netscaler can do but it's a different way of doing it yes so my major question is did you guys run any issues with going from Cisco to netscaler so we didn't run into any issues specifically now your yolo is run into issues as we all know with the project but Citrix provides tools that should do exactly what you're asking for that is to extract the ace configuration and then to import them into the netscaler cool part about it is if you're customed to the command line everything that's going to be generated send a text file you go through you can review each one you do have to understand that they're the difference in the way that each of the two technologies are implemented different terminology and once you do then you can review line for line oh hey here was my group and ace here's my group and net scalars here's what I'm doing and then you can import them in you can do it we know one at a time if required before we list at least in the session here but this is through the QA online here so we can take the rest of the folks that may not want and no but thank you in terms of I want to say thank you off to you guys I actually have a gifts for you and for joining me on stage today thank you and have a great day and rest of the afternoon Joe and I will hang out up here if you want to catch up now we can get your question okay
