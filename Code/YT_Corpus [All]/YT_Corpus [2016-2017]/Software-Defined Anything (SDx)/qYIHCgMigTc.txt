 okay a ton good to be here rad is very well known for having pioneered the whole notion of distributed nfe and I'm seeing here today that you're bringing that technology into play with virtual CPU which you've been doing but now SD when two very hot trends bringing together what how did you get to this point well first we could we brought together the distributed NFV the idea there is to be able to virtualize certain functions of the customer Prem what we've seen is that the service providers add a lot of value in providing qas enabled when connections okay however they also want to be able to compete with you over the top and so the SD when solution allows them to steer traffic to prioritize certain traffic over the cure is enabled when okay and then have traffic that does not require the same curious the same low latency to run over the internet and then also provide the ability that if you have a loss on a link the traffic can be redirected over the remaining link with priority going to the more real-time traffic okay and that puts them in a better position to compete the folks are running their own networks that is where the guys were just delivering this over the top right correct okay correct and gather customers more control correct and then what what Brad's doing is we're we not only have the infrastructure that works with existing networks both layer three I PvP ends and also Carrier Ethernet but also being able to monitor the SLA being able to see what sort of delay you have bug on the Carrier Ethernet network end to end on the IP VPN using T wamp but also across to the public internet so that you've got a good understanding when you have a fault which link has had a folks okay and then obviously the versa will do the redirecting of traffic accordingly okay and then what happens is the underlying fabric does a lot of other things that can do for example in grey shaping so if you've got a multi-tenant application and multiple at traffic sources coming from customers we could control it send different traffic according to different traffic profiles across the different links and do that all in a single platform so there's a lot of additional capabilities that way one other thing that's worth noting here is not only would we be doing the performance monitoring end-to-end across the link even but also of the NFB I then if the infrastructure that the verse is running on so we would be able to understand if they're if there's any kind of issue latency drop packets okay along the way okay excellent you've got a demonstration here correct yes so what we're showing over here is firstly this is a simple diagram part of the topology of our Reggie management it shows they're the two means two links one link going over the IP VPN and one link going over the public internet and then if we go and have a look at the faults we would see in this case that the network is good no no critical faults or any kind of folds so this gives you the dashboard of what's going on okay okay now if we go back to the topology for example what you basically have have going on here is that we saw the topology with the two end links right we then see that there's no fault okay now if we go over and look at the performance monitoring what's going on in these links we would see over here that we have two links okay T wamp link 1 and T web link to and if we zoom into one of them for example into the performance we would see packet loss delay maximum delay and and if we switch between the two we'll see how the cure is enabled links have got much lower latency okay and much lower left loss and then we see that care for example this is now the internet connection much higher delay okay which makes sense right and then if we then switch over to the to the versatile component of this solution okay and we look at the applications running so here for example we have between the two locations both video running video we can assume here is real time and then we'll save a file transfer so what the versa we'll be doing is it will be doing steering of traffic the real-time traffic going over the QA has enabled link okay and then the best epic traffic which is their ftp file transfer is going over the public internet so we would see that and then what will happen is that when you then disconnect a link you would see that firstly the video would continue for a while because it's an buffering and then it would go over the IP VPN link but you would see a dramatic drop in the performance of a ftp so the picture when wouldn't be as game okay so the picture wouldn't be as good because you do have higher loss friend and and and jitter and delay over the Internet okay but it would continue to show the picture because that would get priority over the over the ftp ftp would slow down dramatically okay and then what will happen so here we are seeing it the video going and the link if you look we see there that the ftp has stopped the video continues to run it's now running over the public internet okay and then when we reconnected we would suddenly see that the st when application now understands that the second link is back up okay and starts to redirect real-time traffic back over that connection freeing up bandwidth on the internet for the ftp application to stop running so I temptation the demonstration very interesting stuff with the talk to you thanks Carol or is pleasure you
