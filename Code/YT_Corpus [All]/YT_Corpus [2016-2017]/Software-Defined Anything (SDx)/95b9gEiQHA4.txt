 I deliberately didn't post the average because 90.7 which is very high because they don't want people to feel bad if they have an 89 or an 88 the things they're below average those are that still a great score and I wanted to explain partially water sports are so high in arm and it's because we grade with continued error meaning we give you tons of partial credit so first of all did our first one everybody pick up their exam if you didn't you should come and get yours right away so you can make sure it was great it correctly your get up front if anybody needs to get one all right so look on the front and these are the points that you missed so if you have all zeros here you have a hundred percent that's great so those are the message and make sure it was total correctly so we're getting rid of your exams if you haven't already done so now uh basically on this page there was no partial credit I just want to make sure that um yours was created correctly if it wasn't great correctly then see me after class i'll let you out five minutes early so that you can see me after class but just check these numbers and people did really well not going to blow I'm disregard most everybody got this and again this key is on compass and here's some people got these wrong so maybe it would help to just go over a little bit all right so it says which of the following will increase the power of the test increasing the probability of a type 1 error so if you look this way increasing type one would be moving it like this and clearly definite the power bigger increasing increasing d the effect size well the d the effects us is the difference between sin all right there and the alternative as null and alternative and clearly we made this a bigger difference this whole grab your move app is a power would increase a bigger difference is easier to detect so you have more power and detect again increasing the sample size and increasing the sample size what does that do that meets our I would serve the same effects doing this in other word visualizing is at least when you have a bigger sample size you less sampling error more precision so basically the this curve the error around both of them is going to decrease so the area is the same error decreased you have the same area imagine if we just really drastically did it see how just about you could make it small enough errors that are completely separating two curves does that make sense okay and increasing the standard deviation that increases the standard error if there's more variation you're going to have more more standard deviations to be bigger error bars right and so it's going to be the opposite spread out and it would decrease your power and it's easy to remember because the pout you know less error you have the more power your test test you to detect a difference that's really there the more precision it has does that make sense to everybody all right let's move on now in this page there was something called continued error what does that mean you can see that your answers depend on what you know for example your answers below depend on what you calculate here so if you get this wrong or you give this one then or this wrong etc you're going to it's going to follow you throughout the exam so basically we you Cee Cee something called continued error on your exam that means that you made a mistake at the beginning but your logic was correct after that so you got the wrong answers but we still give you credit the point is that we don't want to deduct more from the same type of mistake just because depending on where it occurred in the problem if you don't break this way then an error to make a careless error and get a conceptual air at the beginning of the question it's going to cost you everything where as opposed to the same type of error at the end won't cost you will only be deducted a little bit and I didn't think that was fair I used to hate it when I was great it that way so throughout if there's any type of continued problem like there is you know on the fifth page there's a there's a lot of it um we grade together and that's part of the reason why the scores are inflated for example I went through a number of times not this semester but past semesters where I graded people the way you're often graded as much easier grid that which is right or wrong on every part and generally speaking people scored about ten points on the average score 10 points less so instead of having an average of 90.7 and probably have an average of the low 80s about 80 and so part of the reason my averages are very high on the exams are because I really pay attention to the type of mistakes you make and don't just say blank hey it's wrong I'm marketing wrong that's the whole point of why we greatly hand grade because we don't want to certain types of errors aren't as bad as other types of merit so we want to give differentiate more so um that's part of the reason the exam scores are so hot warning final exam is all scantron and the averages are lower just because it's not possibility of not being able to give you can Jr understand Oh so let's just look through and make sure you've got all these most people did pretty well here it was this was a very hard one to map through was it continued errors because people if they made errors they got really illogical it was very difficult to great but we tried to do a good job so if your papers all mark up but to spare a few points missing that's why this one I was surprised that people made mistakes cuz you forgiven the formula and it's the most common mistake was ninety-five percent power remember that's 95% all the way to the right and just five percent error so people mistook it for manufacture sent confidence interval and gave up put two here or 1.96 no they should be the same we look five percent type 1 5 percent type 2 errors what it means and so that was the biggest mistake and this some people got this messed up but the answer certain 39 questions on that 38 weeks second all right let's move on next one um was all multiple choice so there was no continued error on this page and people did really well here I was pleased and people do really well on this one and I was really happy about that in fact on that on design of experiments questions or two people did phenomenally by and I know some of you aren't native speakers so that was even more impressive to me and this was one of my favorites races are real study about to test the beer goggles effect we all know what that is right the beer goggles erect it happens when you let me know you wake up the next morning next to somebody's a what was I thinking that's the bear box right you go to a bar in this happens to me all that used to happen to me all the time like your book yeah I'm 64 years old I hope it doesn't still happen to me but um you can go to some place and everybody's you go to a board everybody is so friendly so nice they all seem really intelligent if you're drunk right but if you're sober and you go to that same you'll get so bored i highly recommend not getting into conversations with drawing people when you're sober so it's the same effect you think everybody's attractive and all those your friend ensing enough rating them very attractive and this is beautiful experiment that shows that effect a randomized experiment and i love this i thought was great experiment and neither's it you know and um it was a very clear beer beer goggles effect so because the groups were balanced to begin with there were no confounders understand alright the next one was really you did phenomenal on and i was really happy this was this mean a question was pretty difficult um it was an observational study that saw that there was a positive correlation between how much antibiotics were prescribed over 17 year period two women and how many um breast cancer diagnosis they got they got twice as many if they had um woman who filed 25 or more prescriptions for antivirus / 17 year period received breast cancer diagnosis at twice the rate so this was all over the news a few years back and of course people were investigating a causal link and one possible cause could have been that um those antibiotics kill not only bad bacteria but healthy vangelia and healthy bacteria that could prevent cancers cancer so that's one possibility um they didn't investigate at least in the studies I saw certainly not in the popular press they really didn't think about any contractors so I thought too obvious ones and everybody picture not everybody the vast majority people got involved and I was shocked that's really good the underlying immune problem that does you have some kind of immune problem forgivable weak immune system it's certainly going to meet lead to more antibiotic use and also a weak immune system is is can lead to a higher cancer risk if your immune system is weakened you're more likely to get cancer so um that's the confounder and this wasn't up in previous exams but I've given this question almost there people really miss this one and you guys got it so it's pretty amazing so it says women regularly go to the doctor right are both more likely to be prescribed antibiotics and they're also more likely to get mammograms and breast exams and um more likely to get diagnosis of breast cancer alright so that's the confounder so super happy about you doing some loneliness and you understood well helped you um break into subgroups block how to stratify okay if we thought income was also working on let's move on all right so here on this page there were lots of continued errors people a lot of mistakes so you'll have to look at your own paper one thing um people most people got this I'm SI eres another I was writing continued Eric everywhere um okay so this was rounded if you didn't round it you get 333 you know and so that was um so if you have a confidence interval books like that because you're adding and subtracting point one all right now uh when you computer the Z statistic here if you used this rounded answering would get eight but if you've computed it with the non rounded answer you get 7.5 or if you did it this way look at 7.5 because that's like the not rounded so either why we accept it and um down here I didn't mean this to be a tricky question I said if you can verted all the heights from inches to centimeters then clearly the z-score the p-value are going to change they're not unit dependent but the slope is so why does it not change I didn't mean to infect I thought first wrote this question I actually got the wrong answer and thought it would change multiplied whenever you got here by 2.54 centimeters 2 per inch but then I realized well yeah it's not going to change it does not change why does not the confidence interval foot slips does not change why because st the slow is st while depends on SDY / SDX right and that's not going to change each one of those will change but by 2.54 but then the ratio doesn't use all right so what did we do this was were two points I thought this mistake wasn't so bad multiplying by the silent took up one point if you made if whatever you have here you multiply by 2.54 later got one point if you made a worst mistake I took up both and this of course I didn't think of anyone questions underneath that all right now let's see this last one ok so here um if people some people messed up this formula and then of course and everything got messed up what we try to give you continued error here um let's see and we gave you continue error if this the relationship between even if got this room wrong if the only difference was malt you know that relationship then you should give me continue dairy there um okay there's a lot of people are a little bit confused about this difference between um a one-sided test in a two-sided since we're going to be looking at that more and especially today let's make sure everybody understands this so here if we're testing if the alternative is one-sided the know is the slogan population zero and all our alternative is on we think that it's greater than zero so we think it's directional it's out here so when we get this p-value we get the slope that translates into a 2.25 z-score we say okay what's the probability of getting this extremist slope or even more extreme in this direction only because this is the direction we know something you know something we think it's going to be greater than so we're not thinking about that direction also it's the area of that tail now suppose you knew less you just knew that okay i don't think the slopes couldn't be 0 i mean i think it's going to be different than 0 but i don't know if it's going to be way out here way out here like I didn't know what imagine with the fair with a corn coin but you thought was fate decide the quaint Vicki thought the guy was a trickster he was gonna you know he had a fake coin but you don't know if he made it fake by giving it too many heads or too many tests you don't know so then you would test a two-tail you'd say okay if I get it up but since you're not sure in either direction if you get your ear you have to count both tails you don't have as much to begin with you don't know hey I know he has a coin he always waits towards heads then if you knew that you can grow alternative is going to go this way and your p-value is the area of this tale but if you know you might as well use your knowledge ahead of time you're right but if you don't know anything well then you're saying what's the probability that I get this extreme a night in this direction or in that direction it happen to come out in this direction but you have to count that tail too so it's twice basically we need stronger evidence to reject the null when you don't know as much to begin with if you use what you know ahead of time you think it's going to be what directional then that you should just use a one channel now granted in programs most software just does the two tails it's up to you to decide what you want to cut that in half or not depending on what your initial hypothesis I got it alright so that's pretty much it and now we're on chapter 11 and we're going to start exam two material and you're going to have your exam two um when is your can't you I think it's the thursday before break for spring break that day is your exam two so this is the start okay today is alright so we're still on a simple linear regression 1x quantitative variable 51 one quantitative variable okay like exams predicted final drinks predicting GPA what's up all right now but we're going to look at a more general way to do regression estimates or a general way to do predictive models not only regressions are going to be comparing several means this way etc using something called annales this analysis of variance all right so analysis of variance provides us basic framework it can be used for all predictive models all right what idiot when your predicted Y from some function of X yes anyway that as long as certain assumptions are met which we'll talk about in a minute it checks whether adding parameters to a model by making it more complicated adding some parameters to it improves the accuracy of your predictions significantly more than would be expected by random chance under the simpler null y'all month so you get a test statistic called the F ratio to compute P values and for simple regression this fstab is just going to be the square of our t-statistic so for simple regression sis analysis analysis of variance is just another way to get the same exact p-value as we did in Chapter caddy for the slope that we get from Z and T tests if you square this for just one for simple regression in One X's where the tea you'll get the F stat and if you square this is e look at something called a chi-square statistic but I just thought it'd be a good idea to show how it works in a very simple case so you can understand how it can work and more complicated models too when we're going to only go into multiple regression and we add multiple X predictors independent predictors for our dependent y variable all right so I thought it's a good time now after first exams under a bell to start moving into a little bit more formal notation so if you want and we're doing this these hypothesis testing and we have this population population regression equation or for the simple linear model where you have Y is equal to this is your intercept beta naught this is your slope right here we just that one slope because we have one X right and this right here is your errors and the assumption is when you're doing these hypotheses tests significance test is that these errors right here are normally distributed they look like this your errors around your regression line are normally distributed with mean 0 and the same variance the same variance no matter what you're like within each vertical strip that's safe like a little the same spread shall have bigger error bars when you're predicting life and bigger X is insane it's the same throughout and so these are your errors and another way that you'll probably see this is people say I ID of course they're independent identically distributed errors 0 Sigma square that usually talk about the variance so what is so this right here is what we estimate this is estimated by our standard deviation of the errors now look at this you notice these Greek letters all this and then moved into Greek letters here that's because the way that in general the rule is that you use Greek letters for the population parameters of some ideal puck think of Greek letters is Greeks ideal the beautiful model that you have out there right and so you use these Greek letters who are the population that you're try and then your samples on message get different sampling of errors in it use Roman letters like see be you know an S here for estimating our group and Eve for errors instead of epsilon for eps for estimating our beautiful population parameters with our model out there that we don't know so that's sort of the rule of thumb internet where you put hats for our predictions little hats on top of these okay so um now all right more nitrogen so why it is an observed value of capital y which of course is all if it was uh we had 100 we had 200 100 and aight final scores because they are one scores if i was trying to predict those from your homework so this Y vector you can think of it I vector it has going to have 108 one numbers in it and here's a particular observed value okay and then here's a particular predicted value and y bar is the average or the mean of all the wise so now what analysis of variance does is it breaks down the total variation around for example your exam scores the average was 90.7 but of course there was variation some people did above average some people do below average but you know quite a lot the low score was I think 20 maybe something like that some people are really well um of course you couldn't get above 100 so ah so we want to let's say you wanted to predict that variation of the wise the variability of the lies and you can break it into I mean if everybody got the same there's no variation was I mean everybody would have gotten the same exact score there'd be nothing to predict right so let's say I want to trick your dick your exam score from your homework and so I would with a linear model and what we're doing here is we're breaking down the total variability of those exam scores into two parts one predicted by the model when predicted or explained by your exam scores and the other just left in the error to breaking that variability into two parts so this is called the sum of the squares total this is where we're going to just so this is the total variability the summer squares for the wise I'm going to break it into two Ethan one will be the very building explained by our model in this case it would just be by our slow really and this would call this this is like our signal and then what's left in the errors okay so this right here is the noise so we're trying to separate we're trying to model these lies and you know we're going to have and the variability broken into two parts okay so let's look at this so the sum from I equals 1 10-2 however many observations we have of your Y minus your average squared is the sum of squares total right so for example if the average was it was 90 and you got a 95 then you have your that maybe five you deviate by the average by five if it was you had 80 and the average was 90 your particular score deviate from the average by negative time and if we sum them all up with that square you would get zero so you square them to get rid of the sine u square all your deviations and then enter the sum of the squares and that's what this is now if it took its average / of remedy sports there were 198 that would be called the variance of wine that if you take the square root of it that's called the standard deviation of all right so this is a first step on the way to competing a standard deviation it's called the sum of the squares and that's what we're looking at when we look at to analysis of variance now here you have the sum of the squared errors so what's this this is your predict you listen um oh I 95 in from our regression equation you were to get the 92 well then it's your observed minus your expected that's your error and again sum of all the others had some 20 so we're squaring them all we're doing the same thing here these are and then that's the sum of the squares if we do that if we take its mean it's called the variance of our errors and if we take this sorry take the square root square root of the variance it's our old friend the standard deviation of the errors which we know is the square root of 1 minus R squared times the standard deviation but was now some people have asked a few people wanted me to prove this mathematically so I figured rather than do it in class I put it and some other things to people have asked me because you're going on to higher classes in you're just you're interested a lot of people in here math majors so I'm putting it in a folder called appendix on your compass so right now this is explained as proved fuel up on compass if you want a more rigorous mathematical proof I can provide you with one but i try to do Semite halfway intuitive halfway you can see what I put up there to explain this and if you want anything explained I know some of you really need to be convinced by mathematical proofs please i'd be happy to provide that it's just that most of the people probably don't want to see that worked out in class if you do do you raise your hand if you'd like me to work out mathematical proofs in class raising if you prefer them just in the appendix okay overwhelming so but if anybody wants after you read the content is dumped you don't understand it just come to me during office hours and I'd be happy to explain it all right so you can see that one now on the appendix yeah let's see what else we're doing ok so now um okay so we've got this null and alternative hypotheses it but null is just that this was just just our populations flow is equal to zero that this and you alternative hypothesis look for all of these we're going to be looking at sums of squares so there is always going to be non directional we're always going to have basically a two-tailed alternative if we use the F or the chi-square statistic okay so um that's the basic idea into an intuition behind it is like if you have an individual observation why then okay so this is the how far from the average it is to remember we're trying we're trying to see if we're doing any better than just estimating the average for everybody okay so this is how far from the average particular observation is and this right here this part is how far are predicted is from the average how how much our prediction improved upon the average and this is how far what our error is so this is like the model how far how much an improvement our model bit and this is um how far off we are from our model you can see it's a tautology here I mean you this has to be y minus y bar equals y minus y bar right that's all that says so the question is um so now what this is is just okay so can we go from this which is a total which is just the tautology right I mean that's just breaking has to be true can we go to like this says C equals a plus B well we can't go what I did here will say okay c squared equals a squared plus B squared and that's only going to be true if you have basically a right triangle right the Pythagorean theorem so in other words it's only true when our errors are basically at right angles to our prediction line and that is the shortest distance that's how you minimize the sums of squares and that's the proof that i also have up in the appendix basically the same proof same idea so it's because of the way we view our least squares estimates to minimize our errors by dropping a vector that's orthogonal it's a right angle so this to make this dream so that's why we can do that anyways you can look at that if you want to war um see appendix online this is on compass meanwhile here's how you can understand it very simply visually and against here's the texture to to be here and what we're doing here is we're just saying first of all this is our this regression equation this is what we got right here in Chapter nine right this is our same example the final this was our simple regression equations I'm just using the same data here and so for example let's look at this guy right here student d right here he actually got he got an exam score down here of 92 right down here and he got a final score of 95 okay so this is exams predicting file alright so that's what you did and so let's hear so this right here is is y value 95 is why right okay so that's i'm just showing why might you know it's just very very simple boom what do I have here sorry should be a bar there that's just your Y hat okay now so this is why right and then his so we're saying this distance we print it is out of the average of every winning the 74th right here this right here 74 and that's why bar okay so if we just predicted the average for everybody we'd be off by 95 minus 70 for this is 21 right here I'm car that's 21 and all we're doing is we're saying okay for each one of these we're looking we're breaking into two parts our prediction right here this is our regression line so this is our model this predicts what this is predicted got 74 but our model predicted 79 so that's why I had so it was an improvement of five it's right here that's due to the model we got an improvement of life but we still have this little piece we still have this piece 95 minus seventy nine that's the 16gb to the eris we just broke it into two parts well here for II it's all model another perfect prediction for e4 like this person see we would have done better using the average we got further away with our regression line so um that's basically the idea is for each one of these um you saw the squares of years okay does everybody I mean understand trim the lawn questions ok so now so one thing that I talked about before was this R squared and you've seen you've probably heard and we talked about it before as a proportion of the variability of the wise that's explained or predicted by the model and 1 minus R squared being the carcass left any errors right so the way that you can think about it now in terms of partitioning the variability of the wiser we can take okay so we have this R squared plus talked about this before like on page 34 right you know our is just a correlation coefficient squared it's positive all the time actually capital R is the absolute value of your alarm for simple regression so this is back on page 34 all right so we go so now we're really going to dive into this and looking at moorim from you r squared which is our correlation coefficient squared and that obviously is going to be the strength measure is a measure of the strength of our model we have perfect predictions this would be 1 and 1 minus R squared 30 we'd have no error and this is I'm just saying equals to 1 hour square ranges between 0 and 1 so this is the strength of our errors so another way to think of um when you do this partition of the variability of the bus we're trying to break the total variability of the wise so we'll multiply both sides by sum of squares total so if you multiply the right the sum of squares totaled and you multiply this by the summer squares total r squared times summers were still a plus 1 minus R squared times sum of the squares total this myself give you an intuitive picture of what's going on because this right here is the proportion of the total variability r squared times SSG is proportion of the total it's due to a park model explained by our model and this is the total proportion of the total variability the fraction of it explained see what I'm saying it's the same thing as that and this is the fraction explained by our members and together obviously they equal so it's very useful because our squares is given to you in all regression analysis so basically these statistics that you get are just a ratio of R squared over 1 minus r square times some factor that's dependent on your sample size and how many parameters you have in your model but that's the crux of all your power statistics are we r squared over 1 minus R and you can probably see that was true of our Z statistic too because for the slope because if you look at our back that's what our exam where was our team right here if you square the Z you get what you get r squared over 1 minus R squared and then you're just multiplying it by the sample size here or 14 you're multiplying it by adjust the sample size so i will look at this so let's do an example and it will be easier to put this together for so all we're doing here is nothing new I'm just introducing this analysis of variance early so we are you're probably saying with this problem you can already do right we can already do as a tea or a z-test you did it on the exam right so you could say for example we're going to do it right now we want it we could say whatever what first of all what are we trying to do we already did this problem we're trying to predict how whether gpas whether we can predict some of his GPA and how much we drink how much they drink and we did this we want to see we took last time we took a random sample 25 students and we got this negative correlation here but we want to see if that holds up in the hole halation that's equivalent to saying whether our slope is zero or negative of the whole population so now I said and we saw that we got a p-value like 18 17 it didn't have it wasn't significant well what do we do 64 what if we take a bigger sample size then is a significant okay so if we wanted to just proceed the way we did before what would we do the way just change exactly you just do it exactly like you're doing with Sam and you could test whether the population slope the null is whether the slope is equal to 0 and the alternative here for these is going to be direction non-directional here okay so we'll do we can do that and we could just say okay t is equal to the square root of it you can just use that statistic right here and we'd say the square root of 62 and minus 2 times what r which is negative 0.2 divided by the square root of 1 minus negative zero point is where and we get um a statistic right there and we could look at the p value etc um but i just want to show you another way of doing it by why can't we all why maybe showing you the other way because this is only going to work when you have 1x we have multiple x's you this was like the correlation coefficient minus 0 basically and when you're multiple x's how can you even think about a correlation coefficient will have to talk about that later and you have multiple slopes and so forth we're going to have to do something different we're going to have to move into looking at the whole collection of slopes if we're testing that all that all the slopes are zero but for now let's just look at this ok so now um so we could do this and what would we get let's say want to do it i get the square root of six I do what I can do it before I can do it right now so I get one approximately 1 point 6 06 all right now let's do it a different way let's try it by this analysis of variance and um so we're going to set up we're going to say this is our model you just count we're saying that GPA this is predicted GPA we have that little hat on there being predicted GPA is equal to some estimated slope intercept plus an estimated slope right times the drinks now um so we have what's called we have two parameters in this model we have swear estimating intercept and we're estimating a slope so it's two parameters there's two terms on the right-hand side so we start Pete our other parameters is equal to two okay so now let's look at this again so this is our sum of squares total right down here and here we said that r squared and this reflects 1 minus R squared these two have to add up to 1 and R squared times SST is the sum square model and r square that has to add up to SST this plus that totals that so how are we going to get any of these what are we given well here you're given what how we're going to get this you don't know if we're not going to do it from scratch that's too much work so I gave you the standard deviation of the lies so the standard deviation of the wise is right here we're going to use that or predicting GPA i'm going to use that standard deviation wise then we know it's the relationship between the standard deviation or lies in them this is the first step on getting the standard deviation of the lies so the FSK it's just going to be what it's going to be what's the it's the variance pool x n right that's the variance x n so it's going to be n times the standard deviation the wise square right that's just your sum of squares totally take the mean of it and you get the variance and then you take the square root so that's the same relationship with an event and so that's equal to 64 x 0.5 squared which is a quarter of 64 so that's 16 so that goes right here that's 16 all right in this case so now from that we said that from that we can say okay let's get where r squared in 11 r squared times 16 is going to bear some squares model and what is R squared well R squared is going to be equal to negative 0.2 squared which is 0.04 R is positive positive and 1 minus R squared is then 0.96 so we'll just take R squared times so this is going to be equal to point zero for x 16 and this has to equal 2.96 x 16 together obviously map tab so this right here is 0.6 so this obviously has to be what between minus that so it's 15 36 alright so just like these add up to these Tucson some of the degrees of freedom now the degrees of freedom total that's like when you're estimating the total variation around the mean you just subtract off mean so it's n minus 1 because n minus 1 observations would return if you knew the total they have to send zero right for deviations so all we need is n minus one of them to the last one would be determined so n minus 1 or free to bury so this to raise a freedom here at 10-1 all right so until it's right here I mean you have to do it right n minus 1 all right so yeah so n minus 1 which is this case then is 64 minus 1 63 now let's look at these two so this is okay our number of parameters here so this is P minus 1 that's the same as the number of X's in your model number of parameters basically this intercept doesn't really matter see because you can subtract that off and it's P minus 1 degrees of freedom so here it's just going to be one degree of freedom we had another X would be two degrees of freedom it's a number of X's say was a number of X's in your model and this is the statuses n minus P which was the same number of degrees of freedom that we had for the t-test we had a model like this with two parameters so plus and minus two was the number of degrees of freedom we said she points determine aligned we need we need a third point to estimate the variation testament the errors so you can see that they add up to n minus 1 so in this case we have what two parameters in our model so the tweezer print here is 1 and here we have 64 minus 2 this has to be 62 to add up to six to three so that's you're going to be seeing these charts like this on so many printouts this is where on software printouts you get this get all these statistics here so I'll just trying to show you basically how to read them all right so then to read these mean squares where these are is your mean squared is your sum of squares divided by the number of parameters I mean divided by the degrees of freedom ok so these interviews between remodel this is degrees of freedom pure error this is the so here you just say what it's a 0.6 ford 501 and here you have 15.6 / 62 all right and that is zero point okay so now what is this F ratio this is just the ratio of these two so it's 0.64 or you can do it that way 0.64 / 0.25 which is 225 8 so you can check it by just what we said the F statistic was won't I mean if you're given R squared is much easier to check that by saying F equals what what's r squared over 1 minus R squared and then you have to multiply it by not n but n minus 2 okay so what do you get when you do that that's 0.04 over 0.96 x 62 and you should get the same thing 2.58 so you can check that light and if you take the square root of this you'll get 1 point 6 06 so I know I just sort of i found these things i find this pretty tedious I mean I remember when I was taking stats classes back in the day we had to compete the standard deviation of the wise from scratch and just go through so many calculations and by the time i was done i forgot what i was doing when will do it for small sample sizes and we have small sample sizes on have to go through all the calculations but basically i don't know it simple especially if our squares given to you which is but always is it's much easier just to think of it this way okay so what you wanna alright so now to get the p-values and to use the slower next please alright so now um I'm just I just did this already right we just did this we found that and we found it to be what to play by date okay and this is how we found SST we went through all that okay now so this F ratio so this is all right so you remember how the T curves or dispute or whole family of curves depending on your sample size so now it's not only dependent on the sample size and mine is true that was the same important two curves to test the null that the slope coefficient of 0 it's not only dependent on that but it's also dependent on how many degrees of freedom are in the numerator so how many parameters you have with this case it's only one expert if we have 2x you'd have to look at a whole other set of F curves so depending on two sets of degrees of freedom to knit the numerator and the denominator okay so um so how did we get the p-value of point 1 1 2 and it's exactly twice the p value given by the one in tailed test so this is distributed that's what that means as in f with one degree of freedom numerator had 62 degrees of freedom in the denominator and we're going to get this and our t-statistic our t stat that we got on the previous page what the square root of that you just check it is this square root of two point five eight yeah and it's 1.6 06 and this is distributed as a tea with 62 degrees of freedom so what I'm saying is the degrees of freedom of these always match these are always equal and this one is just one garry of freedom and if it's more than one degree of freedom we can't use a t-test anymore a t-test is only applicable if you have one slope one you know the difference between two means you're assessing the difference between three means we're going to have to do the apt test because we're going to look at the whole collection of difference is not just one single signing them and this was even negative all right should have been forgot to put that in the negative you see this F is always going to be positive because it's squared all right so now I want to get this p-value where did this come from let's look that p-value so how do we do this one thing you can do is you're supposed to look at these scandals the apt table so but these tables are very approximate because you're going to have a different table for let me show you here's a table right here all right on here so this is how you would look at how to read the F table and I try to go through in here so for the numerator degrees of freedom all right so that's one it's going to be in this column now our denominator degrees of freedom would be right this is the closest 16 feet you see but we have six tattoos there's nothing exact here but it's about right here so what is this this is four points so this will be happy so what does that mean well that's a cut off that's the null cut off and all cut off for what for alpha equals for the five percent so we have to get a statistics bigger than that we'd have to go further out on the tail to get um further out on the table so we don't have significance because we only got 2.5 8 but what about if we just if we had our alternative was directional that we thought there was a negative correlation you're not going to think that the border to drink a higher GPA are you so we actually don't need this we actually should be looking on output equals % or a different but let's just go to our easiest way to these tables are going to be very cumbersome as you can see so what everybody obviously does is use the computer so let's look it up on the computer what the exact view that just gives you a cut off that you have to be about would want the exact p-value so what is it we know it's bigger than 5 so that's what it is oh here is 11.2 percent but let's look it up so let's go to online and let's go to our syllabus is go to our course website we have a p-value calculator up there for the f-distribution okay so remember degrees of freedom of the numerator was what one and the denominator is n minus q6 q 2 1 x so we have one there now our p-value was 2.58 not our p-value our F value is 2.58 and we want to use the pew and there's 11.33 what did I say 11.2 well this is more accurate alright so that is we have to reject the null and conclude it we can't we can't say that the slope is different from zero in our whole population in other words we can't say that there's a negative correlation among all 28,000 students between how much they drink of their GPA that's for the two tail test we have to cut this in half and if you cut that in half we get a little over five and if we cut this in half we get exactly what the t gives us for the Wonder test so let's go to RT nrt had 62 degrees of freedom and minus Q we got the square root of two point five eight and said that was 1.60 sex and now we compute our p-value and sure enough that's half of what we got before right is it happen what we just got a portable easy way to check let's do two tails and then we'll get exactly what we got with the type with the Aptos so if we didn't know some way hey maybe um drinking is going to affect your GPA but we have no idea what it's going to make it go higher wouldn't that be amazing or go lower no no so then like we're more uncertain to begin with but we have a pretty clear idea that would probably make it go lower so we would want to do a left-tailed test there is no left-tailed test but it's symmetric so we do the right tail remember we had a negative value negative T except this is the same thing as if we tested the negative kick down here so um and if we do that or very close to five percent and if we go if we got the same slope for the bigger sample size it would be significant we can't reject it we just might not have a big enough sample size to detect the difference that really exists so we just need more precision making so we have to do another I mean I wouldn't say oh you can't protect them else we got throw that out no I mean just get it do it again and certainly the bigger sample size of that difference exists you know then will detect it alright so that's the idea and now you can do the same that thing with the Z and the chi squared remember the Z with the bigger sample size let's see you can see the difference ok so here let's look at the difference here so keep let's keep this in mind I'll write it down so we can compare it to the equivalent Z test and then we'll do the chi-square so so i'm just going to write this down it's a p-value this is our p-value pd is equal to for the 0.05 668 all right 6 something like that all right and this woman we did true tales my god alright so now how would we do let's go back to the document camera and let's get it together and then we'll be done alright so let's look at this okay so we did that right you can't have that ok so now let's use the chi-square test instead of the sea so let's go back to exam remember what the Z was here our Z is that it's the same this parts the same just don't make that little adjustment so so here what just do so this is our chi squared and it's going to be disease so remember our Z is square root of n times R which is the same as the only difference between this and the capital one in this case is this can be negative that's the app's capital R is always positive and over the square root of 1 minus R squared all right so if we did this you get the square root of sixty-four times negative zero point scoop over this one minus negative 0.2 squared that's going to be what did I get when I did that um I got 1.63 approximately all right so now all right so I say that the cut let's write this down let's write down what we're doing here so the Z squared is the same thing yes though they're so for the price word equation that you have in the notebook is supposed to be a square root over the inward since you say that hi squares you can see yes i did so let's see that so the chi squared is equal to the Z squared so if I square that I get n this r is r squared which I'll just write this way over 1 minus R squared does that make sense that's the Z square right all right doodlee something out I'm not right I'm just squaring if you square that the only I'm just changing it to a cash-flow our capital R is the absolute value of this when it's squared it doesn't matter it's always going to be positive okay maybe I should do the one underneath so the f is equal to the T squared which is equal to n minus 2 r square 1 minus x squared and so this is the f with one degree of freedom and in the numerator just one x in n minus 2 and this tea has n minus 2 degrees of freedom now here he has no you know you don't make any adjustments for N and you just have but here so how many degrees of freedom do you have here you have one degree of freedom try square is it so this these two are the same for the PI squared and the tough but the chi-square has another parameter and they may be F has another parameter this one just has one parameter all right and it corresponds to just e minus 1 is it the same it's the same for chi squared it's the same as the numerator for yet you have the same model you see if the chi-squared like the Z doesn't make this tiny little adjustment printers for how many of your sample size and that's why they become when your sample size it's really big it doesn't really matter to relative to n becomes sort of insignificant that's why you can use these with example says instead of those all right so now we have this and what did we say it was ok so let's do it's all right so ours our chi squared would be one it would be 64 times 0.02 squared which is 0.0 sorry it was 0.2 squared right so this over 0.96 right this one was 62 over the same thing and so now this one's going to be a little bit less than that one here we get two point six seven and here we have two point was if I date wasn't if I date and then the square root of that was cheap and the square root of this is we can do it I just want let you out early bit 64 x 0 point 04 / point nine six that's all I'm doing and that's what I got and then i take the square root of that and I'll get my z whoa I did it correctly oh so its second square root of two point six six six six six seven and we get 1.63 alright that's good enough now I just want you the last sick how do these people i use so we already got we already got the p values for these and we said the people we have that already we have now i still get the pink values for these okay and these are going to be a little bit smaller ok so it should be a little bit smaller than this out here and go smaller than point 11.3 so let's just check it out and you're going to play around with this yourself so we'll check it out and let's do it again so if you want to give now we're going to go to our chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom and now we have two point six seven eight point six seven and we want a computer yep it's a little bit smaller it's 10.23 and look what happens when you get bigger more degrees of freedom what happens going to look like the normal curve because through nine degrees of freedom say if you get like 50 degrees of freedom hundred degrees of freedom is he it's going to be like the normal curve with 100 in the middle and now let's its end with the f with more degrees of freedom you're going to it's going to look like a normal curve but one centered on one but now it's got our normal curve ii and just now we're going to say the square root of two point six seven was 1.63 something can't remember exactly what it was and now we don't have any degrees of freedom the computer yep and we still see we are we have about five percent in the tail if you have two tails you're going to get exactly the same it's exactly this so pretty much it so I'm gonna let you out now so you can if you have a question over there you have plenty you know you can do your own right now
