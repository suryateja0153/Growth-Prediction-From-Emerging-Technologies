 alright hey everyone thanks for taking the time to come out my name is Ben ago Paul I'm a senior sales engineer here at citrix netscaler as you can see from up there they decided they wanted to spice up this prezzo we've been doing it for three years they need a little like azaz so they brought me in i'm going to be helping you know the engineers here on the ill sunjai and Rubby with a little sort of field anecdotes and sort of real-world examples about some of the things they're talking about here so without further ado it's going to pass it over straight to them to introduce themselves hello everyone thank you for coming here my name is anil shetty vp engineering responsible for an it's kelly ADC product line send you hi my name is Sanjay Gupta and I am responsible for management systems on the engineering team hello everyone this is ravi dinesh of a director of engineering for nets kind of gateway product line great so so the topic of the session today is to talk about features that are coming out next month in our 11 dot 1 release and the overall agenda looks like this I'm going to kick off with platform update on platform side talk about new features that are coming in that's going to help with dev ops and infrastructure automation and then I'm going to turn it over to Sanjay to talk about NetScaler management and analytics service and how they ties together with again theme being infrastructure automation and then we'll bring it back to me to talk about analytics and use cases around analytics and then we'll wrap things up with Ravi to talk about what's hot and exciting in the world of gateway and through this vino is going to chime in with our library a lot of color commentator on dlf customer experience all right so let's jump right in yes so before we get in do remember to tweet if you like something would like to pass some comments we're here to listen thank you all right so so before we before I get dig into netscaler CPX it's important to understand what got us to this point with netscaler ctx it's important to understand how a software architecture has evolved because that will give you you know that will help you appreciate some of the underpinnings that that form CPX so some of you may know some of the long term netscaler customers may know netscaler started out as a single core single packet engine implementation and we use all the time in NH to squeeze the maximum amount of that one packet engine get every last bit of CPU cycles we could get out of the Intel processor and then once we got that and with the advent of multi-core processor we said you know why not take this packet engine 98 across multiple cores make it completely parallel very less sharing and be very careful to not have any hardware lock in so we purposely you know this is a decision we made 18 years ago to bet on software not go with any a safer hardware lock in and once we got that figured out we said hey if you have back in engineering on multiple course it doesn't matter it could be running on a core running off a different node and that's how we got cluster which is packet engines running across multiple nodes sharing over Ethernet back pinning and then about two years back we introduced what we call as partitions which is multiple logical niche scalars packed into single pack attention to get a lot more density and then now next month we are releasing netscaler CPX now important thing to understand is it is the same code base is that the same feature sets it's the same optimization that we have been doing for last 18 years that's carried forward naturally to c PX so is the same architecture all of the secret sauce of performance that we are able to get on MPX is carried forward to c PX all of the feature set that you get so c PX is going to come with sand in addition which means all the features that you get the standard edition minus VPN because VPN doesn't apply for that deployment more so in terms of investment protection all your tools should work as this now let's look at how ctx can be used in your you know in terms of use cases maybe the container is one thing about containers is developers love containers the fire they love the fact that they can write in code spin up a new container and tested in with in madrid matter of seconds DevOps folks also love containers because it helps them automate the infrastructure now the diagram to the right is how one of a big customer is planning to use CPX essentially they're using combination of niraj Infoblox meses marathon which is open source orchestration for continual consistent framework and CPX together to bring this whole solution closer to the development environment the whole premise being fine problem closer to the source before you hit staging or even production right so so the point being when you check in a call as the Jenkin bills fire of the sea pics is automatically pull from dhaka registry and unit testified and once unit test passes then you move into staging phase in in the stating face again you could use CPX or VPX and then do run your functional test in the staging environment and then you move to production now remember is the same code base that's available that that you see in mphs of that's available in CPX as well so what are we all the testing that you do in the development environment carries forward naturally to your production environment as well so the key premise here being fine problem closer to the source and with CPX you have a tool that you can take you to the developer right in the unit testing phase itself and doesn't it when you would like to share some interesting example for those of you to who may be using MPX or VPX again same exact thing so this is something that we think is going to be advantageous because I've been in the field I went with the netscaler now for over 15 years and we see a lot of issues where there's a big separation between developers and what they're doing and what you see with production when you roll out these applications so what we think this is going to be a huge advantage because now with the advent of DevOps and the ability for developers to be so much closer to the actual load balancing you know part of the point of the application they actually test and validate especially when you look at HTTP like more often than not I've run into issues where applications or I'm working properly just because they even conform properly to http specs and it's basic stuff like for getting a hoffentlich header or not having the proper encoding or things of that nature and we believe that you know with the CPX having this closer on the dev side will help in reducing a lot of the troubleshooting and time and make the applications much easier to deploy Thank You vunna moving on to another example another use case with CPX and you guys might have seen this in sessions in 235 those of you that attended it but let me have do a quick recap now apps are moving towards microservices and there are some really distinct advantages in moving to micro service and I'm not going to get into those that here but it is a multi-year transition you still have to manage your traditional apps while the new new apps have been designed in microservices architecture so while new apps are moving to micro servers you could continue to use npx at the edge to offload computer bono operations like ssl application firewall and manager traditional application and use CPX for your newer east-west the newer apps that generate lot more east-west traffic in this setup NetScaler CPX plugged in to the open source container framework like mrs. marathon in this example we listen to all the events of Atlantis and app deletions and we automatically configure it on CPX so this is another use case that you can consider CPX for moving on up to VPX right so VPX can be deployed in you know in these three network io mode and as you go from left to right is how is where you get more performance for instance in the emulated more packet goes up and down through the hypervisor there's a lot more coffee there's a lot more hypervisor calls versus in there sir i OE mode there is no data copy it's really as official as you can get but the highlight of this slide is really that we are now going to be announcing 40 gbps VPX and that's like head and shoulders above the usual suspects that you see in the ad suspect it's huge it's really big and in fact some of our customers like the performance so much that they even thinking of moving from Hardware load balancing on two individual VPX and Ben you can share some examples there yeah so I mean it's it's interesting right when I joined the company we were very much seem like a hardware focused company but over the years especially with the advent of epx we you know quickly became apparent it's not about the hardware it's about the software it's about the code it's about the stuff these guys right spend their day slaving back in cubicles in santa clara right and you know with the vp x and the virtual appliance you know we have customers who basically have you know fleets of hardware and you know when you have a hardware box it's almost like it's a pet right you have it you may mint you log into it you take care of it but now when you're moving into you know virtualized environment like the VPX you have all these different devices and now you have to you know be able to manage all of these so we have customers who are moving into these virtual environments and it's a complete paradigm shift so that's something that we're seeing a lot more of nowadays yeah and a specific example being there is a customer that's looking at moving about thousand apps running on there the advil load balancer an incumbent hardware load band i am from that perspective right you've got all of these applications that are running on these Hardware load balancers and now you can deploy all these different individual VPX instances so like you know you kind of have this pet before the analogy as we you know saw from our CTO is now it's like the load balancers are just cattle you really don't care about any individual one you just have a multitude of these and then the question obviously becomes how do you manage that large fleet of all these devices and that's something we're going to be demonstrating shortly that's correct so you cannot manage these devices and one on one instance by instance basis you need a central controller and that's what Sanjay is going to come and talk about netscaler management and analytics service and that's where I'm Kiril so in the next few minutes we wanted to talk to you about the netscaler management analyst system so before we actually got into the design of the new new product itself what we looked at is the two or three trends which we were seeing right so the developers are actually moving at a pretty rapid pace building new capabilities in their application building new applications right but sometimes that kind of comes in the way the networking kind of comes in the way right and other thing what we also notice is the app designs are not really amiable and easily translatable into how they get deployed on the on the networks another trend like Anil can have just talked about alluded towards the CPX right so we were very used to having a big fat appliances at the edge of the network and as the application architectures are changing that a deployment model is also changing where the ADC functions are moving closer to the applications taking into account some of these trend what we came up is basically automation of the network services is a key ask right application centric application-aware configuration management and monitoring is another key ask from our customers and then analytics at scale right where you can collect lots and lots of counter information data being streamed from multiple network instances from the network instances that's what the overall netscaler management l and analytics system is basically built to deliver at the top we cannot provide a lot of choices to our customers for automation through any of the orchestration system whether it is for the traditional OpenStack kind of environment or a BM bear or a cisco as well as for the container management system and the Ares functions or the network functions could be deployed on any of the hypervisors the management system by itself could be deployed on any any hypervisors whether they are running on Prem or they could be run the instances could be running in the cloud some of the building down a little bit right we spent quite a lot of energy and thought around building application centric configurations having the netscaler mass as the central policy store and then once a certain configuration gets created distributing that configuration on multiple instances is something which masters another key aspect of the mass is basically collecting all the telemetry data being generated from multiple instances and ingesting that at scale providing analytics right anil is going to talk about that a little in a bit and also providing the reporting on how the health of the system is so without actually getting into too much of conversation about it i just want to share a small video let's take a look at how the how the product looks like do you know anything okay should we good were you Nadia and play yep and defined role based access at an application level this stash board lists all the applications and various network functions used to deliver in this application if you can see outlook web access has for load balancer virtual servers 3 content switching virtual server and a GS lb virtual server you can get the real-time transaction information connection level information on how many client-side connections are there how many server connections are there if there are search q getting built up and you can get information on what is a throughput for this application you can also view the health of application or your services are performing and for doing maintenance activities you can select yes your services and bring down the server for enable/disable operation you can also monitor all your virtual servers from the monitoring console beat load balancing virtual servers content switching cash redirection authentication gsl be our gateway you can get a snapshot view of the state of your virtual servers health protocol distribution what lb methods are being used across all your virtual servers and what persistency method are being used you can drill down on the applications on which the health is low and find out which services are actually in downstate and take actions of that we also get to view what are the applications on which there are maximum of line connections server connections maximum throughput and which are the applications which are least used this will help you with cleaning up your configuration effort if if there are some Street configurations on your instances netscaler mass provides a way to centralize the configuration for your applications it provides inbuilt templates called style books that can be used to deploy configuration for applications these templates are defined in a friendly Yammer format one can design their own template and import on to the N mass here I will show you how easy it is to create a new load balancer for let's say a service called caching that you introduced in your application you give the virtual IP give the backend server IP addresses you give your applications server ports what lb algorithm you want to use what is the persistency and then drop it on the instance on which you want to create this configuration so as you can see the configuration that is getting deployed on that netscaler this internally uses netscaler nitro to create the configuration and here you can see the actual objects that are being created as part of this deployment and this in some sense is authoritative config which means that if the configuration is changed out of band and if user comes here and opens the configuration again then you will see that there is a drift in the application configuration and it provides a way to reconcile the configuration NetScaler mass provides way to centrally monitor and manage your globally distributed infrastructure you can define the data center either by setting your own private IP blocks or by uploading a geodatabase like max mind once you define your data centers and add instances to natural a mass the instances will automatically get segregated in different geo locations on the map and you will start getting aggregated data for a data center for example here there are four data centers on a santa clara foto del kind lore and sydney we can see how many critical and major events are there on a data set level and then you should be able to take actions on those events gives you overall distribution of events by CVS UT one of the instances that are generating most number of events what is the overall health of all your instances how many of them are up down out of service and what are the different firmware versions being used what are the different models being used and what are the up time for your instances it also provides a way to highlight the certificates that are getting expired and the configurations which are drifted from the desired state and the configurations that are not saved this is very important because if there is a advert reboot you're validated configuration will be lost so one way to correct that is select the configuration which is not saved and then save all the unsaved configuration another cool feature of netscaler mass is to do ssl certificate management on the dashboard of assistance certificate management it highlights the certificates that are getting expired what are the key strains being used which are the different issuers who are issuing the certificate what are the signature algorithms being used what is the usage of those certificates if they are bound or not bound if there are any self signed certificate being used and what are the instances on which most number of certificates are available the dashboard is driven through enterprise policy so you can create your own settings for what should be the recommended trusted see a signature algorithms and key strengths and any violation will get notified either through email or SMS you can drill down or the certificate which are expired view the details of those certificates and create a CSR once you get the renewed key you can update the certificate netscaler mass provides a framework to quickly apply device settings to a group of instances there are different ways of doing it you could use inbuilt templates use record and play functionality to leverage the instance you I we could choose the configuration applied on existing instance or import from a file we will use record and play functionality here to do some basic settings on new VP X's that are on boarded I will use an existing VPX and start recording the changes on the instance you as you can see we are in the instance you I you can change basic features you can enable load balancing rewrite you could create a partition you can add as an MP manager once you are done with the setting you can close the window and stop recording as you can see for commands are extracted you can choose whether you want to continue an error execute now or she delete for later and we order execute in parallel or in sequence on other instances as you can see basic settings are being applied on other group of instances will give you a glimpse of what the management system provides and there is actually a lot more many features available so I think Anil is want to talk to a little bit about before I'm just curious how many folks here have more than just like a pair of net scalars just by a show hands so do you guys see the value in this tool I mean if you think about it it's kind of combining what we have with command center inside centre control center like all the disparate pieces we had for management you now have this centralized tool and aren't some of the job creation tools and you know the ways you can push config some messed up is going to make your life a whole lot easier so you guys should definitely be taking a look at maths as soon as it comes out sister now been in managing multiple of these net scalars and as you go from appliance base to virtual form factor base which means even more especially for the example that villages explained where the customer was thick looking at thousand apps running on Hardware load balancer moving in two thousand VPX a thousand CP X's dis imagine the scale at which you need to start managing and that's where mass comes into play now it's not only that managing is one thing but then how we're going to troubleshoot how we're going to manage as a date on a day 20 basis right once you have it deployed what about day to how we're going to troubleshoot your problem so so that's where mass also has this a feature call or this module called telemetry an advanced analytics with this we're able to source data from all of unit scalars not just netscaler from cloud-based verses from the trailer gateway devices as well into this one central location and you can give you this telemetry and rich insights on what the data is okay this is about the oral architecture it composed pretty much of a Samuraizer layer wherein will will ingest all the data and provide unite summarized reports for trending visibility and reporting and we also absorb this data and store it in a telemetry store which you can use later to build your own queries rounded or we will provide additional inside and gets into it a little bit but but this but the core innovation here is really our ability to ingest data at a really high rate and something that we feel most solution most other solutions don't have because to ingest data you really need a very highly efficient proxy and we have been in this business or being in the middle of the path looking at every request in every response as a load balancer so so we have the DNA to build highly efficient proxy and then that is the core component here which is called lock screen it's essentially a module n2 and module right from the source we're here the data source being netscaler screaming counters and panda shell records into central controller which is netscaler mass and do do it in a highly efficient way wherein we do lot of optimization at the leaf node itself lot of indexing lot of encoding and compression compressing of data and then analyze it in real time in in mass like the net scale mass so to go back now to give you an example some of if you if you look at some of the other competing solution way they address this problem is they do it by filtering and sampling and fill thing at sampling is good because it will only give you trending and averaging of data but you'll not be able to get deep insight and deep analysis of the data missing one slide here very quickly a pc what happen to this life got it and i want to very quickly powerpoint to this slide here where this is the flight that was shown in the CTO session today we're in if you look at this trending data if you just look at the average requests per second you will not be able to find out there is a problem unless you look into that red flag out there now if you're drawing sampling and filtering you will not be able to detect this because guess what as part of sampling and filtering you will lose this critical event right with netscaler mass be because we have the technology to ingest data at really high rate we can capture each and every anomalous event and when you click on this anomalous event you will will be able to tell you exactly which application which r at which data center and which server and for that server we track thousands of counters and among those counters will tell you which one of those counters had an anomalous even like in this example the average response time went up so when you look at the original graph you can figure it out but only when you click on the anomalous flag is what it tells you so that's the power of being able to ingest data very high rate and do a normally detection at literally nine rate okay and we also have way to recommend it suggestions as to you under sir turn the server off or you want to change load balancing policies just to recover from the situation now not only do we collect this data but finally geo data you can actually use it for building your own analytics around it and we're going to expose this data to AP is like for instance we we we categorize this data into an omelet into transaction into events even it's like a che event or there's a sin attack or the spike in memory and metrics which are nothing but counters and you can apply filters to these events like give me the logs only between time t1 and t2 or give me transactions between time t1 and t2 tell me what are the status code between these two times or given a counter do a sum or average so with these are all basic building block functions that you can use and you can build your own analytics around it and let me show you some examples in this example and what I'm showing here is given time period t1 and t2 from time x-force for one hour duration find out all anomalous just this simple API calls and he will get list of anomalous events here's another example if you want to find out if users are complaining about batting user experience maybe some of the objects are not being rendered correctly you can look for those errors using four or four or five minutes so busy simple API call and you can get it right here's another example if you want to adapt your traffic farm based on time of the day or based on your traffic request you could it's a bit through a very simple query you can go and get the request rate and you can add logic saying as requested a it goes up every 100 requests requests per second add one server in my farm you can do some really cool things because the data is available at your fingertips and we make it available through API here's another example if you want to use this data and free didn't feed it into your own big data tools elasticsearch cubana you could do that you can get this data will export it in JSON format and you can pipeline it into your real tlk stack and you'll get it all right you know anything you'd like to yes so I mean hopefully the advantage of this is clear I mean one of the things we deal with a lot in the field is obviously you know troubleshooting every time you put something in there's always going to be a problem whether you know you're expecting it or not that's just not only what happens and we had a large customer of ours who had a serious issue large e-commerce site in the west coast and they ended up because they couldn't figure out where the problem was they had whenever go to being sessions going and ended up having over a hundred engineers on the call trying different departments different people so they figure out pinpoint where the problem wasn't totally ran out spaces and they were on this call for like four hours until finally someone was digging through some logs and they figured out oh it's just a problem with this one server and that's what was causing like the site wide outage so hopefully the idea is with the amount of telemetry we can provide you know to you in real time and with the anomaly detection which is unique that will make that troubleshooting job you know so much easier for you something I know everybody here has gone through so that's hopefully the advantage you can see with the elantra API that said in absence of a tool like this you will end up collecting locks for different sources you're going to start looking at packet races and then trying to figure out that's like hours and hours of time that we hope this will how many guys how many people here have done that just by show hands yes and you know how painful that is and the idea here is hopefully we can make that part proactive for you alright so next up w is going to come in so we look at it from a data center and a point point of view Robbie is going to come and talk about it more from user than gateway experience point of view yeah sure thank you know hello everyone let's segue into netscaler gay pay before we get started a quick show of hands how many of you use netscaler gateway near deployment so that's good ok so look we have not a whole body of work in the last 12 months that are very impactful for our customers and I have three things to talk about simplification unification and analytics today on simplification we call it NetScaler HDX proxy we received numerous feedback from our customers and our channel partners on two things one is what is our windows secure gateway replacement strategy and roadmap and the second one is netscaler integration with storefront is complex we heard you as a first dot in the right direction of solving this this is a net new incarnation of netscaler gateway product called netscaler HDX proxy bilberry talked about it close talked about it we are launching at 11 dot 1 so what is netscaler HDX proxy it's a single function appliance for HDX only functionality it has a highly simplified workflow which integrates netscaler and storefront using the trusted api it is citrix windows secure gateway equivalent it consumes a single IP address for management and remote use case so how does this work so let's take a case where you have a storefront for lan axis and you wish to provide a secure remote access for that happens in their stock so you bootstrap a netscaler get around your DMZ it consumes an IP using a dhcp or you could manually configure one connect to the management interface enter the storefront URL now the netscaler gateway talks to the storefront using the trustor new api that we have built store and retrieve the store information from the storefront choose the store of your choice enter your gateway configurations like your SSL certificates and authentication star and you pretty much done or the netscaler gateway the next step download and export the config or to your storefront input the config validate the Gateway configuration and credentials before you commit the change and once you are happy you just go ahead and commit it so essentially no typos no miss configuration no config duplication so folks you know this is simplification for you sneak peek into how it looks like on the management console and you know a simplified workflow on the netscaler management console you have a single IP address management port is 8443 because you are going to use single IP address for 43 is primarily used for your remote use case gateway fqdn these are gateway settings gateway figure ed fqdn this is a net new setting here for the storefront to validate your gateway credentials and also to call back your gateway enter the storefront URL retrieve the stores choose your store of choice enter the star ticket and you see a plus there you could have multiple star tickets in a configured here this is primarily because your storefront is configured for a land access so you need a star ticket moving on enter the other gateway configuration like server certificate authentication you are done on your dashboard there is a download button download and export the configuration onto your storefront click on the manage NetScaler gateway import the configuration validate the Gateway configuration and the other credentials star details and so on once you are done commit it so it is that's it for now NetScaler gear netscaler gateway and storefront is all set in terms of configuration go to the netscaler HDX proxy click on the deployment to test end to end in a functionality of HDX proxy so folks this is simplification in level dot one for you so how many folks out here saying this would actually have a use case for this can see them deploying it for Gateway simplified yes your hands real quick yeah alright great moving on on to unification we call it RF web portal or netscaler gateway if you have used green bubble and x1 teams in 11 dot o our FF is a net new portal theme that we have added in 11 dot one so what is our of a portal we believe it's a true single pane of glass for virtual windows apps and desktops enterprise web and saps mobility apps supports heterogeneity of desktop like our DP no more page redirects refreshes iframes unlike your green bubble and x1 customization branding on the netscaler we provide extensive customization on net scanner now you customize it on netscaler and go import the same customization on to store friend so customization done on one place just like okay sorry guys that battery ran out of it so we fold our DP proxy links into the port it are of the portal supports in factor authentication with gateway so I bet you you guys are going to like it too maybe I'll just click through hundred this is your direct storefront axis this is your persona of RF web when you connect to the storefront and when you go to the remote use case which is secure app axis wire netscaler gateway boom you see ribbon sash apps personal bookmarks very nicely camouflage into the same person are here so there is a seamless user experience when you move from enterprise network into your remote access no iframes no redirects and so on you could add your personal bookmarks in the same photo and click on the desktop you would see that rdt proxy is also folded into the desktop heterogeneity of you know desktops that we support here so folks that is unification for you a true seamless user experience when you move from enterprise network all the way to your remedy use case moving on on to gateway insight it's about analytics so what is the value proposition of gateway inside so gateway inside provides visibility to the whole spectrum of access method that we support and the workflows like your authentication endpoint analysis single sign-on session details these are some of the workflows that we have and the access method that you would already be aware offer full tunnel axis then we call it web access which is y pointless VPN and we have your age HDX proxy this particular slide says it all on one axis we have access mode which is network access which is also called full tunnel mode web access which is your client less VPN virtual abscess and virtual apps and desktop access which is your HDX proxy on one side you have access method on the other side you have the workflows like endpoint analysis or SSO application and user session so this is basically a very compelling story for our in a customer our story is complete right now we had HDX insight now you are bringing in gateway inside the story is very complete and very company i would say sneak peek into the dashboard in netscaler mask gateway inside joins the HDX inside towards your left hi you see a time-bound summary you have different workloads of workloads captured workflows captured authentication application launch and point analysis single sign-on moving on deep insight into the remote use cases like the session modes or the access mother that customers are connecting to like client less access HDX inside full tunnel the operating systems that the remote users connect from and the browsers that they are doing so that is gateway in sight essentially you know for you guys so Robbie is it correct to say that before the HDX inside only really worked on the basic mode configuration at gateway virtual server and that when you have an advanced mode virtual server so for hopefully for those you would know who don't know this expands the use case from just doing a cool proxy to now if you have advanced mother virtual server where you doing endpoint analysis or full tunnel VPN or any and all of the above you're getting that insight reporting that we already had as a component so you're just getting full more detailed reporting for more functionality on the system that is correct okay so that's the Gateway inside and let's wrap up the session what are the key takeaways from this session Anil Sanjay talked about 12 any same code birds identical features and API consistency across all form factors centralized control using netscaler mass management analytic system OPEX reduction separating signal from noise with machine guided triaging last but not least better together one citrix initiative the netscaler team and the storefront team has worked really hard to bring in simplification unification and analytics for the end-to-end you know a use case of HDX proxy and your remote access okay before you leave We strongly recommend you attend these related breakout sessions to 33 and 228 as always we need your feedback you know for us to serve you better so please go online www citrix energy com please you know plug in your feedback and I believe there is a goodie here you know if you provide your feedback by friday may 27th you're going to get dollar twenty amazon gift card okay and dinner was awesome during the presentations perfectly acceptable feedback very okay okay so with that let's open up a Q&A so if we have about five minutes to go yeah we got five minutes so questions comments concerns thoughts anyone bueller the gray-haired gentleman in front right there any comments all right we got to play in the audience but now seriously no one has any questions are people excited for some of these features so 4 11 dot one not so I got a nod so what do you want to see what do you what are you excited about the RDP piece so you have a lot of people doing rdp and having that unified in the Gateway is of significant value cool also in the front here right next to him I saw you nodding getting rid of iframes so like our people excited about that new portal right the sort of clean interface not having all the frames having to refresh having to click okay that's good anything else yeah right there can you please use this huh oh the mic right there perfect thank you so what I like it is in watching a place you can see all your infrastructure and i can give you very good visibility in one single location so good job guys okay okay thank you awesome well i think that will let you guys get a couple minutes early so i say big round of applause for the guys here who did all the work i was just a pretty face thank you guys appreciate your time I think you have any other questions feel free to come up here for a couple minutes we gotta come
