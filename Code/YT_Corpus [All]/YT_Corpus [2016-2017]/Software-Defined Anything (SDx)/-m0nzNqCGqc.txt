 okay good morning a little little earlier in the morning for some people than others I'm going to give I'll start out by saying that amps at na we seem to have a lot going on right now we're stretched pretty thin I've got 60 slides we're going to go fast okay this is what we call a forty thousand foot view you know this is looking out the window at the hit the ground going by underneath the Fox one project I've been talking to you about Fox for a couple of years now hey we're in orbit it's it's been a real ride this started out as we wanted to build one CubeSat get it to Leo however we could with just an FM repeater and now it's grown into University experiments that are riding along with us and helping pay for the launch and the new Fox satellites one cliff and one Delta we're eating even adding l-band receive uplink capabilities on them so it's really come a long way since I guess it's been close to ten years ago when we finally decided to do a CubeSat this was an interesting graph that was published here recently almost fifty percent failure rate for cube SATs we've done really well both ham sath UK and m-sat na that we haven't had any of these problems and that should be a point of pride for all of us this is a picture of the Fox one stack you'll notice the upper four boards are all marked EXP for experiment that's all extra room in our bus that we can fly experiments and these experiments are generally with a university partner one or more and that helps us get the CubeSat launch initiative rides in the US and then as you move down you see our battery board pow our supply ihu and receiver and transmitter on the bottom this is the top board out of cliff not a whole lot in this one because it's it's not needed ooh that move by itself this is the the next one down the in the experiment board this is the Vanderbilt this is on autoplay let me back up here yeah this is what happens when you borrow somebody else's presentation and modify it at the last minute this is the Vanderbilt Ram board this is their radiation experiment where they're testing these different microchips as we move down this is the controller for that board and you'll notice and I like the comment earlier about the doing everything differently and on our own what do you guys see different in that than most CubeSat boards the connector this is the stack connector you'll see that in all the boards we're using a different connector which comes gives us a lot more real estate but it comes with other issues too like we can't go out and buy a PS at the last minute to use if something happens this is our battery board yes they are Naik ads yes they are obsolete yes they will do four times as many cycles as your batteries will so that's why we've stuck with those unfortunately the other side of that coin is that that cell is no longer available so after Fox 1e we will be redesigning the battery board this is the the PowerPoint or maximum power point conversion tracking power supply this was built by the saw me brothers as they started out as a college project and they've it's not flying in Fox 1a in 85 but cliff and Delta and Bravo and echo will all have it this is the ihu you can see some shielding their added things are so we had a lot of room on there too this is the one of the receive board this is the receiver board and you see a nice on some of the shielding there you'll see the inscription and remembrance a Tony who who started us off down this CubeSat path and there's a transmitter board underneath it so that's that's the entire stack it's all laid out side by side you'll notice the I failed to mention it earlier the notch up top and then the camera I think this it moved through it that's the camera for the VT camera there's the hardware to put it all together stacked up got to remove before flight pin and our RF connector going up to the top antenna see the bar magnet on the side there another angle so we went through environmental testing for a cliff in Delta not too long ago in Orlando back in February had some pictures for that there's 1a without the panels on here's our testing team that's Bob Davis burns Fisher Lou McFadden Dave Jordan and egg chrome in the facility you see it mounted on the vibe table there up front this is after testing Bob checking everything out and everybody happy after the functional test passed this was all done in a local hotel room this is getting ready for the thermal back there's it in the jar under testing and everybody waiting around for it to finish and once we were done packed it up and shipped it off to be integrated that was done in Cal Poly this is for the Mayo 85 launch you see Jerry there on the left we were in the bottom of the pea pod and we had a RC 1 and bison SAT going in above us they all laid out together and going in and again the RBF tag and there we are with all the other cube SATs that launched on that mission all clustered together so this this whole cluster was bolted onto the aft aft end of the upper stage so we launched on October eighth after a couple of delays this was a nro Atlas 5 out of Vandenberg nro 55 big top-secret satellite up top we were really restricted on what we could say about just about everything so please excuse if there were or a lack of details leading up to the launch including the exact launch time we ended up in a 518 by 800 10 kilometer orbit which is just at the hairy edge of a 25-year lifetime appreciate that it's a 810 kilometers is about the best that we can expect within orbital debris guidelines with the type of launches we're getting now 65 degree inclination well this is always a challenge to see if this'll work well this is the peapod deployment watch video didn't seem to work so the first first part is real time see the door open we came out pretty fast this is 18 speed so we got this I think it was the next day I mean we had already heard signals by then but it was nice to have video evidence let me see if I can get the this one work this is what happens we here we go it was a YouTube video so I had to record it with the new function and PowerPoint that I hadn't used before this from the NRO office so there's a lot of propaganda in there with it so several of us I didn't get to go but Jerry and I think burns and a couple other people including Tony's widow and daughter got to go and watch the launch lives I'm sorry we don't have any sound on it perfect launch of course as soon as it gets up to a certain altitude they stop talking publicly about anything and then we go back to the propaganda I'll stop it here you get to see the presentation again so we heard it very soon I think the first station to to send any telemetry in was in Russia and it started coming in pretty quick we were all very happy that everything worked after nine months here's what we can tell you the battery is working very well we've not had any low battery issues trips since it's been up which is surprising because being in the orbit we're in we go from full Sun to fairly long Eclipse periods and the temperatures are much warmer than we expected much much warmer like 30 degrees warmer it's not a problem although some of the ihu temperatures the internal temperatures on the IH you are a little scary because they're up 60 degrees C but that's inside the chip so the rest of the temperatures run 20 25 somewhere around there we good thing about that so we don't have to run the battery heaters we do have battery heaters on it because we were expecting to be close to 20 so we don't need those that's all the extra power for the downlink the Vanderbilt radiation experiment is working really well this is the experiment is running full time it comes down that the telemetry data comes down in the sub audible tones in the low-speed telemetry so the more the people more people use the repeater on it while somebody else is listening to copy telemetry the better for us because it's that's where we get our telemetry from Vanderbilt's very excited about it we've got several other projects on going with them so it's it's turned out to be a very good relationship from both sides of the fence the MEMS gyro data is we're still looking at it it seems reasonable there was some concern because the helium purge prior launched helium is gets in everywhere and messes things up and they were a little wonky for a while after that but it seems to went back to normal I'm sure it comes out just as fast as it goes in especially in a vacuum so usage wise I am an operations guy and not a technical guy I can tell you that this satellite is very easy to hear everybody in here tried to listen for it two meters and you don't need anything you got a wet noodle jam it in the SMA connection you'll hear it 145 98 program it in you don't have to worry about Doppler shift on the downlink because it's on two meters it's it's not much and it's very strong we have had a receive issue the flight model the antenna for the uplink broke and it was repaired in order to make our launch the repair used some epoxy and we think that maybe we determine part of the antenna circuit with that epoxy it takes a decent signal to get in if you're not careful if you optimize your method of operation you can get in with 5 watts and nht if you look down in the bottom left there Fernando MP 4 j.v works with just an arrow in an HT and he can work it down to two degrees on some passes the problem here it's not a problem the the complexity here is a lot of people are using a narrow antenna you've got your two meter elements in your 70 centimeter elements there are 90 degrees out of phase the antennas on Fox are both linear whips and there I'll opposite directions so they're in the same plane when you peek your arrow on your on the satellite for receive your 20 DB down on upland because you're 90 degrees out or some number around there so if you're using an arrow when you go to transmit just twist 90 degrees your downlink might not be as good but you'll get in better and then when you go back to receive just go back or use an elk the Elks are in in line since you're it's a log periodic so we are making contacts with it it's not as sensitive as we hoped and hopefully on the next ones we won't have that problem the footprints great too at apogee you know we're covering the entire US and a good part of Canada and Central and Central America I've noticed the apogee is drifting it used to be over the US over the northern hemisphere Apogee is drifting right now on the ascending passes effigies close to the equator and pear geez on a descending passes so it'll drift around an Australian New Zealand and South America and South Africa get their turn with a good Apogee Fox one cliff next in the series to be launched originally Fox one see when cliff k7r are passed away he left us a considerable gift and we decided to rename the satellite after him so we try to refer to it as Fox one cliff now this satellite will fly the maximum power point tracking system for the first time it will have the Penn State mems gyro which is actually built into our ihu so it'll be there we'll have another Vanderbilt radiation experiment will have virginia tech camera will fly on this one and we'll have the l-band uplink we call it the downshift or board that takes the l-band up Lincoln converts it to uhf that will be an either/or situation will be able to it'll either be the UHF uplink or the l-band uplink but both at once and right now I think we've got it set up where L ban runs for a certain amount of time it then reverts to you banned just in case we can't command it on l-band Fox 1d is a close to the same satellite as 1 see this came up as an opportunity to fly another satellite on short notice the main difference is that instead of the Vanderbilt experiment we're carrying a University of Iowa high-energy radiation cubesat instrument it was in my notes I can never remember that acronym both of these have passed environmental testing they are sitting in a pelican case in Texas waiting to be delivered and integrated into the quad pack I think everybody knows what that PE ITA acronym is we had to get a camera license for both of the cameras I had to assure Noah that my ground station was secured lockable luckily my wife is now a US citizen so that's problems been immediate fixed I have to volunteer for involuntary inspections of the ground station which is interesting since it's in my den the we we got a waiver to not have to encrypt the downlink so everybody else can see when two pictures have in it we have to only take pictures of the earth which could be difficult with a satellite with no active attitude control so we're going to take pictures but not download pictures that don't have the planet in them yeah these rules need updating ASAP of course I have a feeling a lot of other camera projects aren't actually going through this in the US launching after C and D but coming before sure now you get to see the third time don't we all love PowerPoint Oh Fox one be this is a another satellite that we're launching through the CubeSat launch initiative program again we're working with Vanderbilt it'll be another radiation experiment we've just this week been doing testing leading up to the environmental testing and that will be launched on january twentieth sun-synchronous orbit it's a delta 2 out of Vandenberg I think the second-to-last Delta two may be the last Delta two I can't tell you the orbit but it's going to be good rad a sec rad effects at to fox 1 e again with Vanderbilt we submitted the proposal in November was yeah November 2015 I was accepted in 2016 we've been offered to launch it's not final yet but probably 2018 timeframe it's going to be very similar to rat effects at but testing different chips and instead of fiying an FM repeater this time we're going to try to have a 30 kilohertz wide linear transponder this will be opposite of the fun cube satellites we're going to be going up on two meters and down on 70 centimeters we've got a 1200 baud telemetry beacon on this one it'll sound very similar to fun cube we've got some other things up or sleeve that we're not ready to talk about yet but it's going to be an interesting transponder payload same space frame same avionics obviously new radio we're also working with university washington right now on a 3u satellite that they're building they reached out to us and asks for a payload very similar to what happened with you cube basically a backup and a means to get other telemetry data down to a wider audience I think there are primary radios up in the gigahertz range I don't know where we're going with this one yet orbit wise or win but that's in the works and we've we've had several other people talk to us about doing something similar so we may see this transponder show up in a lot of different payloads or a lot of different satellites so a lot of talk about going to the moon we're actually working on the cubesat quest challenge or Cuba quest challenge with NASA sponsored contests type situation we're in partnership with ragnarok industries to build a six you CubeSat and they are competing for a slot on the sls one mission the first launch that will hopefully go to lunar orbit we're basically just supplying the communications form and this will be a five and ten gigahertz system like we've been talking about for the other projects that we're going to see and when and if the primary missions finished we'll be able to use that as potentially a phase five satellite amps at ground terminal this is the other end of that equation this is what we're working on so people will be able to use all these five and ten gigahertz satellites five-and-dime is the nickname that it's been given it's an SDR based design it since it's separated from the space segment we can work on it in the open and talk to people that aren't US citizens about it right now it may be involved in it's going to be involved in the CQC it may be involved in p3e we may involve it in another hyo project it will most definitely be involved in phase 4 be we're tardy targeting a thousand dollars or less for the complete ground station right now they've got a test set up in California where we're basically putting it up on a water tower on a high mountain and I'm calling it a ground SAT and we'll be able to test everything out with that their phase four be announced I think one year ago here we've got a an opportunity to fly along on a the wide field of view satellite this is still ongoing this is primarily a VT Virginia Tech project led by Bob McGuire and four hy it'll be a primary primarily digital but also possibly analog transponder five gig up ten down this is right out of I have to be very careful what I say on this so this is right out of Bob slides that are up on the BT website i would encourage everybody to jot that address at the bottom down w wh ume VT edu ford / geo there's a lot of stuff put up there if you're interested in the project that goes in a lot greater detail than I can the digital transponder will the goal is a hundred channels hundred channels uplink to the satellite and one shared downlink FDMA and this is primarily being pushed as emergency communications resource right now the a double RL is said that they'd like to have a hundred terminals to be able to distribute in case of an emergency that we can be first on the air to to help with communications in and out of the disaster zone this is the heart of the payload this is ranked on research who's graciously donated this particular piece of hardware this is the Astro SDR and there's lots and lots of data on it up on that cuum website we will also take what we've learned from the CQC and frumpy 4b and ground terminal and hopefully apply that towards a 3 or 6 you he oh we're looking for partners in it and this is kind of operating in the background when people don't aren't tied up with the p4 B and a p3 progress hopefully we'll put a CLI proposal in this year early next year for it we continue to get lots of opportunities to go to Leo it's gotten to the point where we can be a little picky about it you know obviously the the ISS type orbits are there's a lot of them out there right now it's not to the most attractive orbit communications wise but we're looking at that and everything above it some of the upgrades that we want to do is probably go to a 3u bus we're looking at it using sdx SDR technology instead of analog hardware transponders still looking for hosted experiments and especially anybody that's interested in helping with attitude control or propulsion so 60 slides a lot of jibber-jabber anybody got any questions I might or might not be able to ask answer them wow it's lunchtime thank
