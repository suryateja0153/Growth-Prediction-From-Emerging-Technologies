 that sound a party in my garage boombox okay so here I'm just planing the front and back panels of the speaker cabinet marking them to length this case is 18 inches long and cutting them on my cross cut sled here I'm just ripping down the reclaimed pine wood to the correct dimensions before I cross cut these to their desired lengths I ain't on my blade on my table saw to 45 degrees and use my miter sled here I'm running the pieces over my table saw to basically create a rabbet so that I can have a nice groove to inset the front and back panels on now it's time to glue glue up the cabinet pretty self-explanatory and just putting glue on the joints and spreading it out with a little paintbrush and using some inch-and-a-quarter 18 gauge brad nails to hold it all together while the glue dries okay now on to the front panel this is where the speakers are going to be mounted so I use the speed square to figure out the center line to where I'm going to draw my circles to cut out the speaker measure the whole width of the speaker or the diameter and I subtracted the half-inch for the lip and that gave me the radius of the circle that I need to draw I'm going to add these one-inch tweeters up in the corners here and use a inch and a quarter Forstner bit to cut out the hole for the tweeter and it was actually perfect size I just sanded it a little bit in the tweeter fit right in there real nice and snug and here just grab a regular drill bit to make a pilot hole for my cutout of the speaker real quick I want to talk about this Black & Decker matrix I love this thing it's got interchangeable parts so it's really like 13 tools and one I just took off my impact driver attachment here and putting on the jigsaw attachment and it's just super cool tools wanted to take a sec to talk about that Here I am using it to cut out the circle or the speaker hole by the way I'll put links in the description for where you can find all the tools I used in this video as I do with all my other video and then here I'm just sanding the back panel always got ass and there's the four sides of the speaker cabinet minister coming back panels and just getting out of good sanding make sure all edges are nice and smooth and sanded the outside which I didn't want to sand too much just because I like the character of the reclaimed wood but I did give it a nice sanding just to make it smooth and here to attach the back panel I simply just put glue all around the edges and I'm attaching it here again with 18 gauge inch and a quarter Brad nails and since there was a little gap here you can see I'm filling the hole with some regular wood glue I grabbed a handful of sawdust and I'm just going to basically rub that into the glue that I squeezed into the joints and it essentially makes some matching wood filler then you just go ahead and hit that with a sander and the front panel I added some bracing on the sides here and in the middle is where all the electronics are going to be housed I have some brass standoffs and right here is going to be where the battery is going to go and this is sort of what it looks like after I assembled it all and made sure everything fit there's the battery pack there 12 volt 6800 milliamp hour battery pack rechargeable I got this amplifier it's 100 watt hi-fi 50 by 2 with the integrated Bluetooth chip I got these gel audio component speakers and there's the tweeters there now this amplifier came with buttons you know a play button next volume buttons and I had to figure out how to be able to push those buttons even though the amplifier was inside the box so I came up with this little idea I made this bracket and I have these regular just screws basically inverted and now I'm able to basically access those buttons from the outside of the box real quick this amplifier I'm so just in love with it I mean this little thing is tiny I got it for 25 bucks on Amazon it's got like I said Bluetooth receiver built-in 10 10 meter range accepts 8 to 25 volts DC and 100 hundred watt total output and it's got the 5 buttons along the bottom play/pause button previous/next buttons and volume up and down super sweet little amp you guys 25 bucks and you could have you know a crank and little stereo alright guys so here it is the complete boombox basically the whole thing is made out of reclaimed wood this the outer part here just some pine that I got from some Craigslist ad this front and back panel is actually reclaimed Sitka spruce I believe and the speakers were just salvaged from my old car that I used to have I still have these nice jail audio component door speakers as you can see the the outer box has this nice sort of weathered look it's just pine I sanded it and it got rid of some of that dirt and grime but it still has some really nice green I think it looks really nice in the back here I have a just a power port so you could plug it in to recharge the battery I have an on/off switch here off on I have a USB port also that will allow you to charge your mobile device your phone or your iPad or whatever so that's cool I think this whole thing is completely wireless I didn't show in the video but I added this this handle this handle wasn't reclaimed but I got this from a cabinet maker here in Ventura so I came up on that on the bottom I just added some nice 1 inch rubber feet so it keeps it up off the ground makes it nice and sturdy this thing kicks I mean it's super loud as the loudest Bluetooth speaker I'm ever going to have I'm sure thanks for watching me build this project I really had a lot of fun this is a one day build all in all it took you know better part of a day to build this and like I said it was really fun so thanks for watching if you'd like to support my channel go ahead and
