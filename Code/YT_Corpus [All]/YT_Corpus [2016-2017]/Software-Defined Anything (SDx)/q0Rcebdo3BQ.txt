 [Music] welcome to Kendall works so today I'm going to show you how to utilize is citrus NetScaler VPX appliance and configure a load balancer so the first thing you're going to want to do is log into your NetScaler appliance to do that you will type in NS root for the username an NS root for the password once you've logged in you'll have a screen like this if this is the first time you have configured your netscaler you will need to set up the first three items in order to configure your NetScaler the first one is the net scaler IP address this is the address in which you want to connect to your net scaler the second one is the subnet IP address the subnet IP address is used to communicate with your back-end servers this is typically your management subnet IP here I am using 1.30 typically you would set up a separate managed network that you would utilize with your back-end servers so normally you would have a managed Network and that is a separate subnet for your NetScaler as well as a separate subnet that is used to manage your servers and you would make sure those two could communicate and then the third item is your DNS IP address the host name and the time zone and you'll just go ahead and fill those in as accordingly and the last thing here is your license and if you have a license you can enter it here otherwise you can go ahead and leave it blank if you're just doing a demo and click continue so to get started to set up a load balance pair the first thing you want to do is click on the traffic management under the traffic management there's a virtual servers and services you go ahead and click on that underneath that you'll have your virtual servers under the virtual servers this is where you're going to set up your front-end web server so this front-end is going to be in a portal that leads to your back-end web servers that are hosting multiple actually the same application but multiple servers that are load balancing that application so in order to do that you'll click the Add button will type in s it's fee C and then we'll go ahead and type in the application name which in this case will do a security camera and then the protocol which is HTTP I'll give it an IP address and then the port is 80 since it is an HTTP load balancer disregard that message that is because this is a demo the next stage that you're going to want to do is go ahead and create a load balance service group in order to do that you'll click the Add button it will type in SPG for service group again it's a security camera HTTP and here you'll probably want to type some type of description so you know who built this and what date all right and then once you've built your service group you're gonna had your service members the service members is going to be your servers that you want tied to that group in order to do that you'll go ahead and click Add and you will type in SVR in this case it's a Windows server and it's HTTP IP address of your server and again who built it on the date that they that you built this all right and then you want to select that server that you just built and you want to make sure it's communicating on port 80 I mean that's all you have to do so you've now tied your server to your service group and then the next thing you're going to want to do is add a monitor this monitor is to monitor traffic and in this particular case because this is an HTTP server we're gonna want to monitor HTTP traffic so we'll go ahead and select that keep the default weight of one and then click bind now you have a service group member which contains your servers a service group monitor which is going to monitor HTTP traffic for your service group we're gonna go ahead and click done and then the last thing you're going to want to do is click on your service group that we went ahead and created with your monitor and with your servers and then click select and then we're gonna go ahead and bind that to our load balance virtual server and then you can see that we have the one load balance virtual service service group here so everything looks good and you'll click continue and then looks good so go ahead and hit done and it does show down down and with a 1.40 address don't be alarmed by this you have to refresh that and here is the refresh button okay once you get refreshed it's showing that both are up and up now your back-end server normally is 192.168.1.2 HTTP sorry okay so that obviously works but now we want a front-end so if you're coming through a firewall as an example and you need a front-end to load balances if you had multiple servers set up you don't want to use this address here as you can tell it works just fine and we'll log in just to prove that it works and then there you go you're into your security camera system that we set up so that is all that it takes to set up a load balance virtual server now if you want to disable this service for whatever reason let's say you're doing maintenance you can simply come to your virtual server under your traffic management you can click select the virtual server that you want to take out a service and you can disable it you want to go ahead and click yes this license is going to come up just because we're in demo mode and a normal license environment you would not receive this message go ahead and click OK I always click the refresh button just to make sure as you can tell it is out of service now to test this if we were to go to 192.168.1.2 we are still able to get to this server that's because this is the back end web server but we took out the front end where users would come if they were coming from externally outside your organization and wanted to hit this front end so if we were to type in 192.168 got 1.40 that's cached information I can guarantee it cuz I'll hit f5 and refresh and it should timeout there you go so if I was to type in 40 again hit enter it's gonna poke the cached information but if I was to type it in and try and login to the server it doesn't take it so as you can tell this is just cached information on my local web browser so I'll go ahead and close that out and you can tell if this is functioning as intended now if you need to put it back in service you would simply come back to your virtual servers select the server group that you want and go ahead and click enable as you can tell it's pop-up already now if we were to go back to that website and we were going to login it would then allow us so as you can tell the service load balancer is now back in service and that is basically all there is to it to set up a virtual load balancer and the steps that you would take in order to enable or disable that load balancer hope you guys learn something and appreciate you guys for watching thank you
