are in use it more than 400,000 organizations and by over 100 million users globally my name is roger i'll be your event moderator and before introducing our presenters i have a few quick housekeeping items the first of which is to let you know that we are recording today's event all participant lines are muted if you need any assistance during the event please use the questions feature at the bottom of the control panel and I'll try to help we highly encourage everyone to also use the questions panel to submit any questions and comments you have during the presentations its submit them at any time will collect those for our speakers to address at the end of their presentations and we'll try to get to as many as we can our speakers for today are alex lewis and derek yee alex lewis runs

out of the citric Santa Clara office as part of the netscaler product marketing division and is focused on expanding the go-to-market initiatives and strategies for NetScaler and I'll now turn it over to Alex to get us started good morning everybody I'm really excited to be here with Derek and the team from Citrix and also the team here from MS exchange org we're going to talk a little bit about Skype for business and deployment as well as some of the deployment options skype for business is a little bit different than some of the previous upgrades just in the sense that from say office communications server 2007 r2 to lync 2010 it was a pretty simple side-by-side deployment move everyone over call it a day real similar for 2013 going from twenty twenty ten to twenty thirteen to skype for business it's a lot different there's a lot more complexity and a lot more to think about both from an in-place upgrade option as well as the various hybrid and cloud options that Microsoft is released so we'll focus on on those today as well as some kind of best practices from the field as well as what does that process look like and what things should you think about as you kind of go down this journey just guide for business as well if you're already using Skype for business what are some tweaks and optimizations that you might be able to do to improve that user experience as Roger mentioned there'll be some quiet time for Q&A at the end so feel free to ask any questions you want anything technical around Citrix or linked skype for business is considered in bounds for today so we always love to hear some of the more difficult stuff and I'm sure you guys have come up with it we're going to talk a bit about first of all planning so when you're understanding your architecture you have to realize that the biggest thing is there is no support for try existence so when you look at having links / 2010 and links over 2013 or OCS and one of the link versions you can't add skype for business to that environment at least not from a supportability perspective there's also a couple technical challenges as well but the short of it is not an area you really want to try to jump into so once you decide you're going to consolidate on a single version whether that linked 2010 linked server 2013 it doesn't really matter and then you decide am I going to do an in-place upgrade or am I going to do a side-by-side migration everyone's kind of familiar with the side-by-side migration that's the way that we've classically always done upgrades and migrations in the link world really really simple if you don't build up a whole new environment migrate all of yours is over shut down the old servers kind of wipe your hands go up a beer called day with Skype for business we've also got the option that in-place upgrade however there's a number of caveats to that and we'll kind of go into those in a bit more detail in a few slides we also have hybrid deployment considerations so certain number of functions like large meeting broadcast or cloud PBX are only available in the cloud so while a lot of customers are used to deploying link on premise and that kind of being the sole ecosystem to manage managing a hybrid environment can add a lot more complexities and just having the servers on Prem two different consoles two different areas to run powershell in almost like running two different environments and I'm pretty sure none of your departments are going to add any additional headcount because you're all of a sudden managing environment that's two to three times as large so how do we do that in a way that's most efficient and an accurate price the best overall experience to your users and finally we're going to talk about what's acceptable downtime most of these scenarios have at least a small amount of downtime probably not a ton but if you're going to be doing a side by side Mike pation you're going to have a short period of time if you do it an in-place upgrade if you have more than one pool you can kind of get away with momentary to zero downtime if you only have one pool you're kind of in that same same area again of a side-by-side upgrade possibly even a little worse so there's a lot of architectural discussions I've even worked with some customers that have had one pool decided to build a second pool as 2013 and then upgrades asked to skype for business and in-place upgrade some pluses and minuses to that strategy but I thought it was really interesting also like to hear from the audience kind of what you guys are doing and what challenges you've had and share your experience here with the group I think a rising tide raises all ships although the cliche certainly applies here how can we all help each other out and kind of move the industry forward so upgrades in-place upgrade process for a single pool the biggest key here is you're going to have down time there's no way to do this without downtime some people will say are we're going to have an hour maybe an hour and a half when we upgrade the pool realistically that's how long it should take but all of a sudden been an IT awhile realized how long it should take and how long it does take are usually very different Murphy's Law is in full effect so things like if your pool even ready to be upgraded something you could do an advanced but I find a lot of people don't are all the proper prerequisite updates installed that can require a lot of additional reboots a lot of additional time a lot of additional churn and test so a lot of folks will go through and say all right well you know it's Friday night let's let's kick off things and start i would say probably seventy percent of the work you can do all in advance now you may require some downtime windows and advanced to do it but i'm a firm believer in changing a few things as possible during an upgrade so run through all the prerequisites install whatever patches kb updates dotnet updates run the the tests to make sure the pool is ready for an upgrade and then on your actual upgrade night do the upgrade makes everything a lot simpler really increases the chance for success and mitigates that risk with all the moving parts there in-place upgrade process for two or more pools is actually really really simple you essentially do it like a failover if there are a pair of pool first brake repair move all the users to the secondary pool upgrade the first pool to skype for business move all the users back upgrade the second pool to skype for business if they were paired you can repair them at that point and then you can decide if you are running active activities and redistribute users between your first and secondary pools or you can leave them essentially in a active passive mode for all intents and purposes if that's your overall architecture I've seen a lot of folks that are running a true dr data center with lincoln skype for business now so a lot of different options there the biggest gotchas aren't sure the edge next hop points the secondary pool the primary pool will be down during the upgrade process so anyone that's coming in from the edge and then your federated partners are people trying to join meetings all that needs to happen to the pool that's up at the time so you'll need to repoint it a pool too and when you're done point it back at full one plan for at least a few hours / pool for the upgrade I've seen it happen in as quick as about an hour I've also seen it take for six hours for a single pool so it really kind of depends in your environment and again this is a process where you can do a lot of the work in advance and really save yourself some headaches nobody wants to be trying to fix problems at two three in the morning kind of on the end of their their outage window and being go trying to figure this out and really you could have done all that work in advance the last thing is make sure your pools are sized appropriately to support hundred percent of users I see a lot of deployments that have say an out 10,000 users and each pool is sized to support about 5,000 on a fellow if we have an environment we have a failure will just fail over and it will be in a degraded state well if your users aren't ready for that degraded state you're going to end up with the headaches of trying to fire fight tickets and people complaining while you're trying to do the upgrade and while you're trying to do that upgrade you want a few distractions as possible so you want to really want to make sure those pools are sized appropriately or that if they're not and there's no way around it that degraded performance or that expectation is set with your user environment in advance side by side migration no pretty pictures know anything else everyone here has done this a million times it's just like going from twenty ten to twenty thirteen build up a whole new environment from scratch and move all your users / shut down the old environment obviously the kind of inside out process works again just like twenty ten to twenty thirteen no magic there nothing else with the exception of if you're trying to also do a hybrid deployment so at that point you're going to run into a lot of additional complexity things like a TFS things like federating with office 365 and we'll talk about some of those a bit later but realize that adding that cloud complexity is going to take some time especially for a lot of folks who are used to managing a non-prime environment and haven't necessarily spent a lot of time in the office 365 world in a lot of ways once you get used to it it's it's an easier management process however it is very very different and florin to those of us that have been living in an on prem world for the last you know 10 plus years so make sure to familiarize yourself with the office 365 portal and the hybrid commands and approach is that something you're going to do it's not something that you want to learn mid-flight and midstream and say oh I'm a smart guy I'll figure it out on Friday night spend some time with it and it'll really pay off in the end one of the things that when you go through and take a look at doing your either cloud or hybrid deployment is a DFS being a link guy I haven't touched ad in any significant past capacity in there's at least a handful of years maybe a bit longer than that this can be a bit foreign and I found that a lot of Ag groups in in organizations aren't really super pumped to want to help the link team or the exchange team or whoever's doing this do it so having an ADF prox a DFS proxy and being able to talk to officer 65 is again something you can do in advance something i would you do in advance and one of the things to note here in the Citrix webinar is that your netscaler can actually access an ad FS proxy so if you're already having a scalar out managing your linked web services you don't need another box you don't need essentially another other server or anything else in the BMC to kind of get that figured out let your nice netscaler be that ad FS proxy just like it's another service chances are you're already familiar with configuring it for length web services so this is a really simple kind of add-on process to get cloud up and running and I'd say if most of the issues I see during hybrid deployments or kind of cloud integration with Lincoln skype for business adfs is probably the source of more problems than anything else I'd say actually a DFS and firewalls are the two two areas everyone back in the from OCS up to 2013 i think everyone used to joke that it was either firewalls DNS or certificate I think that's kind of a adapted with the times a fair bit to become firewalls and a DFS at this point so not to intimidate anyone but it's something that worthwhile to do an advanced you certainly do your research on ssl offload now i know kind of some of the folks are going to jump all over me first thing they're going to say is i so awful otis officially support it absolutely correct however there's still a lot of benefits that you can get it can help scale under sized pools I you can really take a look at from security perspective it allows you to inspect traffic a bit easier George Thomas fellow microsoft MVP of mine has a great blog post on kind of using it there and what the process and minuses are of doing that for so offload I'm not going to say if it's a fit in every environment what it's worth looking at and seeing if it's a fit in your environment some of them it's very very useful becomes useful in a lot of different ways and also it can be used for office web application server as well so that's the veteran area that I think it fits in every environment because I always see off supplicate ops web app asian servers that are well undersized but it can be pretty interesting in your in your link in a web services environment as well the other kind of key point not exactly an SSL offload but an offload of services is when you're doing maintenance on your link pool is really to use your your load balancer to go up and put up a maintenance notice or something like that so that you can tell your users hey you know what I realize you probably didn't read the email from it's-- it's been going out you know the last three or four days saying hey links going to be down this weekend because we're doing maintenance because nobody ever reads IP emails but you could take a look at it and when someone tries to join a meeting oh yeah hey yeah we're doing maintenance right now you're not going to be able to join that meeting instead of them just getting an error or not being able to reach the page and then filing a helpdesk ticket and again that's just something you don't need a distraction you don't need when you're doing maintenance this is something I'm really excited about the optimization pack which is really the VDI optimization pack so anyone that's that's kind of done VDI and Link before realized there's been a lot of challenges around DDI and voice and video or in kind of real-time media some of them everything from stability issues to kind of random gremlins in the machine link kind of forgetting devices there's been a lot of challenges something that citrix has announced now if that there's going to be a shimla experience for vdi for lincoln to skype for business really really cool that it's now in native experience it really simplifies the process a lot fewer moving parts so that when you deploy link in skype for business in a VDI environment it just works there's no pushing out of shem and hoping the shim works realizing that there's a you know a handful of limitations and it'd be honest a different user experience with that shim right now it's a native if you're already used to being a citric shop you've got kind of a see a client loaded or a web client boom it's just that experience with the the full stack with a couple caveats gallery view location services and keowee aren't available yet but that's something that's all under consideration for the roadmap but really I think this makes PDI of very serious contender and very serious discussion point for almost any Slinker skype for business deployment now really makes it an interesting talking point it's something you visited a year to three years ago and kind of pushed it away just because for various reasons to the stability or functionality it's worth taking a look at again I got to see a demo of this and was just blown away at yeah you know what it just works it actually really works now and became really really excited kind of another look at it you notice no notion here it's just a user using ICA directly into a Zen desktop experience super easy super simple also makes troubleshooting really simple if you've ever had to troubleshoot link over VDI you're pulling logs from everywhere and half the time the error doesn't actually live anywhere or just becomes really difficult to find this just makes the process dead simple so with that again really really worthwhile to explore again and take a look at if you looked at it before and dismissed it or if you haven't looked at it worth taking a look at now and saying hey you know what maybe this is fit for some of my users I think in every orchids fit for at least a handful of use cases and in some works as the standard pack duplication with ft wayne this is something that i've just started kind of digging into at a tactical perspective but i think it's really really interesting you end up with the environment of hey you know what what happens when a LAN link drops or what happens when a weanling gift to grade it or overloaded well you say you know in kind of a web world oh I just fail over to another link I've got multiple links and that's exactly why well in a real-time communications world it doesn't really work that way it's really really difficult to do that gracefully and I think sisters to this SD win solution is interesting in a sense especially for call center environment as we see skype for business kind of enter more and more business critical functions outside of just dial tone and being able to pick up the phone this sort of resiliency and this sort of redundancy really becomes a requirement is kind of a bolt on to that architecture it's something that's not just a nice to have it becomes a has to have as part of meeting the requirements and the availability requirements that business-critical applications like call center and tech support and everything else demand so something that that I think a lot of folks would say this is maybe bleeding-edge technology least cutting-edge technology it's really really exciting and it's it's something worth taking a look at it especially if you run your whole business on skype your business and you really focus on putting your business application functions as part of that Microsoft stack and with that we're actually going to have a couple questions pop up get some feedback from you guys understand kind of where you're at on your journey with Lincoln skype your business really really interested to get your feedback and with that we're going to share some of the results actually all of the results at Q&A right at the end so Rogers going to put up some questions for you guys to take a look at and kind of figure out where you guys are we'll use that to drive the conversation later and my colleague Derek is going to take over and tell you a little bit about the netscaler product what makes it unique and out can really offer some optimizations in your skype for business deployment I think so it's definitely a great content it's always interesting to see you know what folks are doing out there in the skype for business and voice over IP world we've seen a lot of traction with folks and as you guys are familiar with things that citrus is doing in the VDI space in particular some pretty neat things that we've been in collaboration with Microsoft will really help improve the experience and what I want to talk about today is sort of the the netscaler component tell in the skype for business equation and I think it's one of those things that has been downplayed ilat we've heard a lot about so that es un components things that we can do compaq a duplication and really providing a better media experience in a video I world now we want to kind of go through in netscaler we talked about sort of the back end you know you talk about load balancers and and yes that's in fact netscaler is a load balancer and I'm going to show you some more kind of like what this platform really is about how it differentiates in the market so you guys actually come away from this with a little bit more awareness around the capabilities of Citrix in this space when it comes to all netscaler and oddly enough I think this particular audience the folks at MS exchange they conduct a I think there's an annual server that they do for the community to sort of rate and determine of what are sort of the best load also save for like a microsoft exchange environment and we've been fortunate actually the last couple years which essentially has been rated Readers Choice two years in a row so we've been pretty successful so I'm very likely maybe talking to folks that are already familiar with netscaler so without further ado let's kind of kick in too there we go so what is citrix netscaler and this is again sort of the base lied to really understand what it is what are the capabilities that what it can do and really kind of show you that there's probably a lot more than you might be aware oh so netscaler it's a yo it's what's called an ADC or an application delivery controller very similar to what you would call a load balancer which sort of expanded functionalities um it's it's in the in the data center actually from in front of your servers and it really super serves as that broker or that proxy between your end users that sit outside of the network on the web that are connecting to your back-end applications that are being posted now like I said again this can actually sit in a data center and nets gailel can actually reside in the cloud as well since it can be a fashion in either a physical or virtual appliance form factor now as far as functionalities go you know if there's really some key buckets and we talked about netscaler and why why would you want to put a netscaler in front of your Effra structure i think the key reason we find number one when we talk about load balancing load balancing is about improving the availability of services and in the context of today's webinar you know we talked about Skype for business Alex went through sections about running upgrades and if you think about every time we need to take a server down netscaler serves as that proxy in front of these servers so that's essential that if you want to provide continuity as a user experience so that your users continue to connect if not to the same server that you can seamlessly route them to an available server in the interim while you're having maintenance done or if you're upgrading to a different environment again this is sort of a key ingredient in that equation when it comes to all you know making those upgrades you know seamless for your end users and then when it comes to performance so there are several functionalities built into it you know I'll just talked about ssl offload yes that is one thing that can impact application performance is your servers having to really kind of pick up a lot of the slack on having to do ssl encryption and decryption whereas if you can offload that to it dedicated appliance like netscaler where it has a lot of the resources and the processors built into it to handle high volume traffic on including encryption again this is an area that we can provide sort of those benefits and then there's also things that we do you know from a compression and caching standpoint that when particularly looking at web traffic where we can provide some benefits again on the offload side of equation SSL and TLS big factor in today's web environment and then security so this is probably one of the things that I think folks don't realize that they can also get in conjunction with this type of technology is when you're talking about trap handling web traffic you know insecurity is becoming much much more high in the mine as far as decision makers today whether we're talking about denial of service attacks or if we wanted to provide you know protection against oh you know sequel based injections cross-site scripting again these are factors that Nets kayla has a built-in web application firewall on they can provide additional levels of security on for your Basin darkness and then last but not least is you know data is everything and being able to actually inspect traffic and see what's going on as far as troubleshooting determining what any potential issues might be it's a problem with the network or problem on the endpoint device netscaler with inside centre is actually a functionality that we see more and more users begin to take advantage of so combine all these together and you really get the scope of what an ADC and provide so you know we always try to push it it's more than just a load balancer I think load balancer at its heart is what a lot of folks going to put it in place for and then they start realizing that you know there's other things that we can turn on here since we've got the investment that we can actually maximize it's capable of doing for the environment now what really differentiates NetScaler you know is as many people know Citrix so trips is a software company right when we enquired NetScaler back it will take a 2005 the challenge was how can we provide the intelligence in what we do best and that is building software we had something to start with from netscaler you know we were competing with leaders in the market that had made significant investments in providing high performance hardware with specialized chips that are built on there with custom asics to provide high levels of performance on citrix was n challenge ok what can we do that can leverage off-the-shelf hardware but yet engineer into the software to deliver comparable levels if not better and really geared towards own when you look at layer 4 through 7 traffic realizing that the web is where things are heading and that's where the bulk of traffic is going to be generated so that you know when we look at netscaler we built a hardened operating system you know into the kernel to leverage this commodity hardware so that this is actually served really well for citrix today and if you look at sort of the era where we're heading to we're looking into you know software-defined networking software-defined data centers we're finding more and more customers or wanting to have these conversations that ok I'm not ready to invest in heavy platforms anymore that it's all about hardware how fluid can my environment beak and we've made the portal over to on virtual environments and really have NetScaler or a load balancer or an ADC be completely interoperable with a lot of the automated environments that we doing whether it's open stack or being able to to switch out into you know a lot of these new stn architectures that we're seeing whether it's nsx or a CI so this is one thing that will definitely start to see a lot more in the future around how NetScaler can truly differentiate it's been in our history it's in our roots and it's something we are certainly wanting to capitalize on moving forward here I thought I just kind of give a quick snapshot so for any of you that have been following netscaler maybe have heard of in the past this is a great slide that kind of shows the evolution as far as where Citrix has taken this in the years leading up to president you know most current iteration a typical currently do have is around sort of containerized environments so if a lot of folks are looking for you know specific application projects where we want to be able to put the load balancer right in front of it in sort of that self contained environment NetScaler CPX it was actually recently announced in tech preview earlier this year and that's actually on the next slide I'll kind of show you a couple of things that we have as far as the current portfolio again quick root against as far as recognition within the community and us xchange IT brand pulse and of course Gardner has always rated netscaler as a leader in the last six to seven years okay so I'm going to do a quick snapshot around sort of the performance and platforms for netscaler i leveled you talked about you know coming back to basics the physical appliance it's called the MPX appliance where it's a single instance of lines and these can actually host up to 512 of logical partitions per appliance in other words we can carve it out in that one instance to provide admin access for different environments different use cases but again they're all sharing sort of the resources that are available to that one instance you can easily pour that over whether it's in a virtual VPX for a containerized platform which i said again it is in tech preview for now currently we have that portfolio supporting up to 3 gigabytes per second and I should planning to increase that up to i think under gigabits per second later this year so we're seeing a lot of developments on in the virtual form factor any hypervisor and again you can also find netscaler sitting in many of the the popular cloud environments either as a bring your own license or a license that you purchase based on consumption in that particular cloud environment and then last but not least netscaler sdx an STD x is sort of a it's a special creature source it's a physical appliance but it brings the best of both worlds in that we're able to have dedicated virtual instances of a full-blown netscaler so if you think about we talk about MPX being a single instance appliance we convert that into a virtual form factor that one instance can actually now sit on an STX appliance completely isolated and if we follow the logic I can take that one VPX instance carve it up into about 512 partitions um there's a lot of flexibility and scale that we can build out to it and then on some of the sdx appliances the largest ones I think they can no host up to I believe 115 instances of specific virtual instances sitting on the box and throughput wise you can find these all in the Citrix website will make sure you guys get links to these where you can see through put on the MPX is go up to about a hundred and sixty and on the ESD X is pretty much the same form factor kind of going from 15 gigs up to 150 and that's a high-level overview of sort of the port you on the platform's software edition wise standard edition in it and enterprise and platinum again I always like to look at if you just need a base layer for load balancing type of flying standard editions your go you've got multiple data centers and you wanted to provide some failover between sites then value no global server or Geographic load balancing is probably necessary with additional ways of optimization that we can provide specifically for in our apt acceleration and then lesson on lease in the Platinum Edition evo but including with that specific security measures when it comes to web application firewall capabilities so around the south with the other things that we support in addition to stuck for business you know we have deployment guns that will share netscaler being used in conjunction with sharepoint exchange single sign-on drops 365 you have direct access here on mike dunn MC RM a lot of functionality and if you think about it again load balances in general are designed around providing better availability for services things we can do to improve performance from a security standpoint we're seeing single sign-on become more and more prevalent in conversations throughout folks looking for collaborative hyper environments and so that's again things that we try to highlight in some of these guides if you take a look at them how to actually convert what you have with a netscaler sitting in front of it in those deployment as you'll find them at citrix calm / netscaler / deploy and then I've got some closing resources so if you guys are interested in getting a copy of this deck um you know please submit those questions and let the lettuce the Roger know and I think we'll actually have someone contact you to make sure that you can get those to you so I put a lot of google videos up here and if many of you kind of caught in the networking tech field a that was hosted these are all up on youtube there's some pretty great presentation to talk about NetScaler from some of the really smart people at the Citrix team both on the SE when and on netscaler you can also download a virtual appliance and general link in case them what you want someone to contact you and I believe that we probably leave into Rogers got one final question so if want to get a copy of the stack or you want to have someone to talk to you about kind of where Citrix fits into recommendations for your skype for business deployment I'm going to turn that over to Roger to throw that filled up that question it all right thank you Derek and we'll go ahead and pose this the last question that we have for everyone which is up now so please enter your responses and then we will take a quick look at the at the results of the first three polling questions that we received and we then we have we have about a half a dozen questions that have come in and we'll looks like we'll have to be able to get to most if not all those okay I'll leave this one open a few more seconds looks like we've got almost everyone okay going going gone thank you okay so let's go back to the first three survey questions that we we posed at the midpoint and we'll share those and then Derek and Alex feel frida to come and if you'd like to so here it was the survey question number one are you planning on deploying skype for business okay so a lot of the left in half are still not sure if they want to do this or not and it looks like we're evenly split on the rest as far as how quickly they want to get the set any surprise to see you in that Alex no I would have thought that yes in the next three to six months or yes in the next six to 12 would have been a lot higher I actually thought 326 would have been a bit half so I'm a little surprised and when we open things up to questions I kind of like to hear what maybe what's stopping you guys what are your concerns around d'alene your deployment maybe it's upgrade to Teague okay go ahead and share question 2 if yes how are you planning to deploy skype for business and wow so this is really interesting as well half the folks are saying a hundred percent on prem with all the kind of wife and news and Microsoft's pounding the shoe on the desk of cloud cloud cloud really kind of actually happily surprised to see on prem deployment I've been a long kind of supporter of on from and some of the benefits it brings and really interested to see that and kind of excited to see that or your Microsoft is pushing hard on lipstick bio mode from a licensing standpoint to really sort of push more and more folks to start taking advantage of sort of those hosted options right and we're still seeing a lot of those clinging to like you know hey this is what we have and this is kind of we're not ready to change it yeah really interesting to be less than ten percent are going cloud with office 365 and cloud PBX really really really interesting actually I think I think it'd be interesting again to hear from the folks kind of what what the concerns are there and why why you're sticking with on-prem and you know I'll jump in your camp and join you great now I'll remind everyone if you have any comments to those on those points please go ahead and send those through we're going to be getting to the Q&A here right after I share the final survey question that we took earlier what is your top reason for adopting skype for business Dirk Alex any comments okay this is probably the only one I'm not surprised by this is right in line with kind of what I expected maybe a touch more in terms of reduced costs but improve productivity making it easy for your workforce to work I think we're really in a time period with the consumerization of IT of how do we essentially get IT and technology out of the way that's kind of in a success of Apple over the last decade or so how do we make it easy so that you have a guy in finance or the guy in sales or the guy who doesn't have an IT job can just do a shot better without having to learn something new and complex yeah all right very good we'll go ahead and close those down thanks everyone again for participating in the in that survey and we're going to dive right into our Q&A questions so I'm just going to throw these out Derek and Alex in and either both of you can respond appropriate so the first question we have from our audience is do you need skype for business on the endpoint for HDX up pick a terracotta I'll defer to you around best practices for the optimization pack for vdi I think the question again roger was unique skype on the endpoint so I'm guessing he's asking if that's in a VDI environment um so so the way this would work is you would install the skype client in your desktop environment and yes then you will have the optimization pack that works in that context um it seems straightforward to me see if I may have missed your question on that feel free to re-ask again specifically what you're asked what you're looking for on the response of that great in this particular audience memory also shared that they've already deployed skype for business next question from another participant is C does does the location field in skype for business work within a citrix session no I think that's one of the limitations right now so in a VDI environment we recommend from a client policy perspective that's something that you turn off for use this that we'll be using that in a virtualized desktop thank you and then the next question is when will they combine the rtm in receiver together I don't know the hedges of questions that's that's a good parking lot question so we can follow up afterwards on okay well and there's there one of the things you'll see here at the end is reach out to a citrix SE and that's definitely something ineffably walk with you walk through with you with an NDA on a road map discussion very good next question we have is are there plans to support link sdn API I'm sure that's on the road map I don't have any more details around that though let's see we'll take one or two more when will citrix provide support microsoft where citrix provide support for the HDX optimization pack with sfb 2016 I think that available now in the dark I know the version that's out supports 2015 I think there are plants and we'll probably find out more at Sergey on the announcement for 2016 so I know the team is actively working on you know these revisions with Microsoft so again we can get back to them I don't have a specific go answer you want know when that's going to happen Roger I could add something real quick I just came back from Enterprise Connect last week and there was a lot of pus with some very very large fortune 50 type companies around rolling this out pretty quickly as a replacement so we all know when one of those folks kind of gets behind it everybody runs to support it pretty quickly and make sure that that they don't fall down so I think especially from a Microsoft and I don't want to speak for them or citrix but I what I've seen as the solution is really impressive and I think with the combination of kind of less problems and simplicity supports going to be not a problem just definitely we're out there be sure to get me a copy of these questions and who have asked them and I'll make sure that we get the right resource of within-subjects that can handle you know more of that answered on some of these things you absolutely we do have more questions coming in then we're going to be able to get to so we will definitely be forwarding these on for for follow-up for those of you that did not get your questions answered I think we have time for just one or two more next question is is netscaler the same as big-ip for load balancing um so good question I mean f5 big-ip solution is widely recognized in the industry and it is a load Mouser and again throwback to use cases if you're just needing you know straight on load balance if you're do you have an f5 in your environment and it's working for load balancing I mean I'm not going to be the first worse they go buy something else now where I will differentiate it if you guys are looking at sort of leverage and maximize the investments on what you're doing you know beyond just a load balancing type context on netscaler and as we talked about sort of that software first angle it really is providing you far more flexibility and we're seeing that happen in a lot of customers that are migrating or switching out those types of platforms whether it's going to be in the cloud even from just a virtual form factor from a resource requirements it's a it's a lighter platform and it's a lot more versatile so on some sense if you're just talking about load balancing exact same functionality the only thing you're looking at that might be difference is from an administrative standpoint manageability and you know using the interface and where you would go forward you know as far as expansion all right in that we have time for one final question and that is is the deployment recommendations for skype for business much different than those for Lync 2013 with a hardware load balancer the requirements are really really similar if your architecture doesn't change so if you're going on from the on-prem you can really keep a lot of the same settings I think there's one or two different tweaks that are recommended I think they're more kind of optimization best practice tweaks and they are differences you know fundamental differences between 2013 and skype for business now the real difference becomes if you're looking to change your deployment slightly with the upgrade going from on from to either cloud or on from the hybrid that's where you can really leverage some of the strengths and differences in your load balancer and really you should kind of take a look at that config take a chance to do it over from scratch and really optimize it with that we're going to have to wrap up and for those of you did not get your questions answer for the the many that shared comments we are forwarding those on to our experts who will be following up with you on those so thank you for for your participation on that and at this point on behalf of MS exchange doorguy want to thank you Alex and Derek for joining
