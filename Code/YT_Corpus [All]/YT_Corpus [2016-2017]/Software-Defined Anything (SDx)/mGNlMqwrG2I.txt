 oh I'll see collaborations are clean up this nvidia wispy GP stuff i spend my time um if you have any questions just bass y'all and ask away i'm happy to make the second group for you so I don't need to go through those flights that I know if you feel like it you can tweet about this section is any of these hashtags so I think a lot of people have made into this session that's a special service just me bein flavor for this Alex Glenn Delia's up so he actually their sense of honor is such a big found say why care about sense of why idea on small boys is anyone there so 10 desktop 7.6 latest between source and that stuff has got a technically functionality so they basically called him as soon as if the customer helps in position functionality me gaps from statistics of both hypervisors i use how the environment looks like and seen hyper got the distributions that we see forced a desktop seven-point states is pc 55 years of of all the ones on same server we also see five percent of all the plans of my belief and we see 37 person of all the plans on this view so here quite happiness these numbers sensor mcmullen billings a 12 one or two years ago um to be honest we had a bad release um we sink and all doing that again okay really happy so why is sensor for such a popular choice understand that's fun well money plays a major role if you assume you have a stem cells deep sense of deployment for 7,000 seats you will need 50 physical servers 450 physical servers um this competing hypervisor we spear you will pay about 500 song US dollars over three years on you can pay this paper that's all US dollars or you can use sensor very combination to send desktop that you get for free getting info number do you also include it is like license first this is glasses and maintenance that you pay so we sync up the TCO is a different variable depends on the environment but some management said it costs you see someone is it you spend on management of sensor will be similar to be under we say another area of our sin server is particularly popular celebrities cloud so there's two very popular crowd participation there's one is cloud platform and the other one is OpenStack so clogged up for missing six variant of the open cloud stack but these thing is no matter as you have Club platformer OpenStack um citrix se is a very very popular choice amongst big cloud providers so it's people like softlayer Rackspace we use xenserver in the other sections that are seen on several a lot of discussions about netscaler once in a scalar product increases netscaler sdx which is basically a half bear appliance or you can run multiple virtualized netscaler instances um and that's Kayla synesthetes killa STX off the ring runs on top of sensor and say manage together 120 gigabits per second since high performance um sense ever has been around a long time so we have customers across very different industries this is very different use cases in plenty of case studies in civics com its protection it's real deployments see all these customers actually people who use center for graphics um but says a lot different use cases key so I want to look back in history of it so in January 2015 in January this year we have really stands over 65 and in May this year we have released the service access of 65 as people so what was in there see one thing that is the most important for us engineers so I'm talking as an engineer was that he makes us wish to be fully 64-bit customers don't have to care but for us this will take so when you have the classic and you try to explain how the sense of a brook internally well we have a 64-bit half of what we have 64-bit server on me run a hypervisor in my design project hypervisor it is to be 64 bit for a while Subway's Sandberg's it's you have a control domain that it's a privilege me young privilege machine the main zero and you also have your workload that you for example run years and a stop sign at three years this can be 32 or 64 bit um now prior to center of 65 we use 32-bit in this village domain 0 and it sets of 65 you replaced it with 64-bit so why am I telling you this but I was personally very excited about what's it's unlocked on for customers so customers won't notice any of this be covers us I see you I at the point is we made huge improvements in performance and scalability based on this platform simple metrics that we measure every day is what's truth networks reboot can you get when you have plenty of VMs trying to put data on your network and so we have an improvement of eight times so many times faster so they are very on what we can get out of 10 gigabit network adapter so lots of customers asking for this 10 gigabit I think that's it sexy curves things that people are actually adopting but soon you will not wait for long and people have forty- networks another improvements that we have as how long does it change established network connections so that's important for example for web servers there you have plenty of connections being established for that 16 times faster um how Fox can you reach from your heart is four times faster of us can you write to your office from three times faster um people so bound up where scalability limits um one of us particularly talked about this how many version can you run a physical host so a sense of 62 needs to be 500 a sense of 65 people support up to 1,000 but there's one thing I would recommend anybody to run monster machines buzzing you run Liam's Liam's Venus Williams no matter what workload it is don't run gone solidly and some things one month on physical host so what you typically do is you run a benchmark who run something like logging these slides that determines how many virtual machines can I run on my particular environment is my hypervisor is my server is my storage which might miss my network a value whoa caps on C log in via symmetric but you typically do this you try to start a certain amount of VMs let's say 10 games and suddenly look at did see scandium is getting acceptable performance so the basis looks is on the horizontal axis we have how many bm's be started on the vertical accesses how many youngsters accepted performance so the sense of a 682 we managed to stop on a circle platform under 23 hours before they saw depredation so some virtual machines didn't get c performs as a sugar this ends over 6 165 762 to another 15 times for 65 500 another sense of 65 ft 1 it is actually in 600 600 windows me a mess admittedly on a very strong server what was a strong so what was this thing I was it was the same so okay to be very basically limited the hypervisor and now we know 600 is not to limit OC hypervisor anymore but the elusive nobody server said he can get our hands on become my server within us the keys we've also worked hard to make it cheaper for customer so customers don't need to go for the most expensive hardware so what import variable is this is storage particularly how many I operations done yet soja need to cope with so one thing that we've done is be happy to use primary base week catching point of s so the way this works is for Sam or sun desktop you typically have a template you have master image golden image or however you like um people catch this golden image and we will only get it once from your NFS storage and the distributed amongst many virtual machines so we don't put a lot less I operations on your storage array you can buy cheaper storage and also the ansibles awesome if you do you set up the amount of memory that is used for the caching or there's some in touch isn't that nothing for you so we will automatically configures in memory 70 years so we basically take some of the memory from our controller neg domain 0 um you can also modify this value but people usually do it based on how much memory it out maybe server so we have fun so steadily social technologies without any PBS or mcx cognitive vs kind of management or trading if some verses attempts at my house and level right that's what you have other level so versus particularly helps us cuz mcs yeah Leslie hypervisor understand sir storage yeah PVS does the same thing itself yeah so I can't double check okay so how do you make sure you just do is I actually would we know it would work with other stuff too if you have see golden master English so so how does it know that it's called most women so some way this works is we have typically a chain of virtual disks and one of these virtual disks is read-only but it's me tell me it is a master image and it only carries a week early disks so there's Michelle G's with an iPod yes to understand that if the image is read-only that it will utilize AV to run in depending on Wall Street it's a doctor's a reef culture yes and that is automatic how do you save up or is that although it is fully automatic it is a waste on she has an equivalent of who I catch someone reads water so it derives where do they go so some rights currently still go to the storage array um status songs you know coz i do Delta Delta this as a producing never chocolatier so this is local ramen oops yes you're not neither interest network don't forget yes read operations it's a very important thing is see market anomalies that be used for this so we will automatically stop using that we possess affinity for something else to me like a fall back yes soon as all pts so we have basically measured sis will really help you these people on Isabella's fold up your service that we're doing this just also by you don't want to turn it off can you stop that reason why not because when I'm doing PDI serve under his eyes yeah I movie that their memory and it will go to go go through storage network yours first that's problem and I will go here the airport and I stop it from choosing to give a good memory again just keep it using port or rib cage no you can't what you would want to do is you would want to make sure that you've given us memory to Z control the main event 0 and certainly wouldn't start to clean it out again how do you want to talk and you wanted excitement serious violence doubles as an on page 4 is it one page or is it is same like their generation thought you said is it on page one page for a 312 justjust long saying hey Mike it's on page my customers wouldn't need to know any of this this is all fully automated um let's see in essence using linux caching mechanism are using the same types of any legal system would use um and it does is pulling into that class so there's really a lot of intelligence in there it does this for us the interesting thing is yes very useful but it's a variable thing oh yeah so you could get into a situation where that's pretty far is alluding to the orland alone where there's lots of is also going to put on the horse so the holster is doing its best i can and it decides because it's lower learning to stop doing this and now you've got an impact on the user experience because it's now automatically they are you doing anything in you stop doing something color with memory all and now you just go straight in like in storage environments so at a point when there's a lot of demand in the service you know just going back to this so it's an understanding of where this might run out so that you can preempt it and I'm work with it so they enough it would be enough make you happy but Rob's like this is all very credible how do we monitor is well how do we turn off or turn it on so that there's a there's an expected or garden unexpectedly happening it's only using memory assigned to a dumb 0 which can't even figure well don't you just decide on how much from you well you can modify the very richest dude but two people typically recommend that you don't hear no it's anything this gives you another option to play this it should just work also voice you can cause modify the variables as we solve my very happy so in the earlier versions of sin so it was quite normal to change the size of the thumb 0 but it should be quite as many in the 65 do you recommend just you know let it let it do its own work or would you always from case to case consider maybe maybe extending the memory to the thumb 0 also to make sure that it's catching Caribbean I would make the matching as the default okay unless you find out any news for example third-party tools like that is ugh catch me for other stuff spc your feet dry environments beautifully with months zip it so tomorrow we see me so this catching don't actually be slightly more locations and points are flattened artist because I Montes are broken inside a virtual machine so this is basically shortcutting slightly by being very minded is is specifically for mcs environments yes and it's variable so you user experience my fairy or is it wouldn't interrupt the party tools and make your choices norwood curious something that I'm particularly keen about is what Peter's containers or getting a stalker so just in case if you have never heard of containers it's all of ours you see how you packaged applications containers are basically different mechanism to packaged applications compared to virtual machines so one company can basically process to the public is made it very easy to use his build community around us is doctor so that physically injured tools that allow you to easily package containers to distribute them build a community around it so it's all very very accessible see something that they've built into the sensor witness the option to manage dr. containers from visit the usual virtualization tools so we do have VMS here and we do have containers here running or certain p.m. so the way that we see customers use docker containers is missing containers and virtual machines complement each other's so excuse cases of which containers are very useful whenever you want see application packaging whenever you want see very quick start and stop time so there's Holly use cases valuable on virtual machines says particularly when you are concerned about partitioning concerned on security so it should complement each other very well and whatever packaging mechanism customer chooses as its containers or virtual machines Citrix for N equals a customer on to manage this to orchestrate system um incensed over 6 TV stands over 65 we've also heavily invested into graphics again to keep our traffic sleep so we've introduced support for cheap new pumps through two liters guests that goes particularly given the csn desktop Liam's me da it is also very popular to be used for computer after it for number crunching on some particularly in England here lots of find companies that are very interested in new number crunching on Lincoln's edge gripping yes what what is inescapable um so in this sense of it we had a lot of time to make sure our graphics offering just one thing to highlight this um this ass you can do all the graphics virtualization stuff from the UI you will not have to go to the online interface will all be nicely on the traffic perfect interface yesterday is the horizon section I fluence at VMware now support posts a video Andy well since its sense of six five year olds are supporting Intel so they're supporting the pass-through of embedded graphics chips chips that are embedded into your groceries and Intel CPUs to guess ps2 it's a boss sense over 65 fun for everyone to what's next just as motivation sucking sound even serves hot warm yes okay what's next um citrix is a publicly traded company and as such there are tight restrictions of work and saying what I can't play a part of you have a public technology from you you answer so citrix City peas and customers that have either send s doctors and Apple sent server can go to the citrix dr. own website and download see Dundee technology believe you so this is basically software that you have to put out there to get your feedback to understand what features you like or features do not like um depending on the feedback on Weibo links and features in or take them out when they actually publish this as a supported sense of events where we are now going the open source I'm sure no we have talking about features in the technical preview is it commercially supported sent service so it's just going so you can get all of this on citrix com at the shuttle if you are an existing customer and they're not guaranteeing that the algo supported um first of its storage um sin server is most of the time deployed into business environments so most of our customers are going very very heavy on business say one thing that we've done is we will be supporting SME sits as BM storage so can a commercial dis computers on there it's just another storage option although it's SN 1006 it is as Amenas right one is 60 then slide over haha our policies directory we're approaching six to see all the name of an earlier protocol version which is not to be mixed up the data me I won't move on before oh you're just no fun anymore it looks very similar to the NFS dialogue it just now also have a username a password to boys oh yes certain features promote something sweet or hoarseness on these twin pics to be possible in the first book so we we fix this stop genocide Franco from you picked a subset of seditious of SMS recess it's really a lot in there on these things which should be workable so you're really happy this is so Oh sweetie to be in the most recent development bills we have actually named it smv do not sense any more thanks because you can yeah maybe some some people really don't like but it still causes but sin it's the right thing to do is basically call it a zombie we also have support for open fcoe in there so there's two very popular cna course is happening that is approached comment entail and also HP is so that is putting to sea and ice heavily so you'll now supporting this content server this basically is software able father general internet so it is supposed to make a vagina face and it's cheaper um you should see how this works out other stuff this is a technical conference I saw that William some diagrams we've gained we've come to create lines to integrate open your city into sensors we have to change our install our Colonel Baris device drivers storage manager or multi pass back as call Tuesday for customers it looks like this so you can you get any storage option you don't have to deal with when you're fixing complexity as I suppose a beast we also have support for FS written form just to give you another alternative and justice for option C performance of NFS for leasing manifests learn for performs slightly better than NFS three you might need the latest version of your rapier to benefit from these from this performance it's really relatively new and most a rip store to raise bc set anniversary floors particularly faster for larger block sizes so that is the likely year next up is migration so sin server has had migration for a long time before so somewhere nice acidity capabilities if you can migrate in EMS it's like only have local scourge so we don't need any shares for which you don't need a storage array something that they didn't have this you couldn't migrate virtual machines on as soon as it's ever shut down its in a server offline so that's one of the things of you fix indeed are detecting me so you know you can migrate names of any stage of semi but they're running an escort events are suspended seemed so good graphics choices with very bottom you gotta fight we also make you see live migration downtown to under three seconds so it got a bit long there we began having invested into graphics so if you're not wonder is perfect just for high end users while citrix keep investing into traffic so heavily I think it's definitely not just behind users there's people like users of Photoshop or cut here Kevin any traffic stop and say there's also multimedia applications Google Earth flash silva life but also it makes office applications will be happily using a preface compass in the city stairs the telephone they'll be using one Firefox Internet Explorer windows Aero desktop and evens adobe PDF reader or make use of a crappy spot so I think Thomas propagation reaching their somewhat elevated a lot of estrogen usually I have lied about it digi news be partitioned or is this one gp41 desktop for example that I'm actually okay so fancy bear has had support for a video me give you now for two years not something access so we are leaving the Sun so next big thing that we are leading this is um see traffic ships that is embedded in new Intel CPUs so intent marketers as iris grilled graphics so this Intel graphics chip you can get some for example in a very small box so that's nice if you go to customer sites and put two previous something that is a gigabyte brix box Emily um all yours together for example in HP moonshot special preview screening alone yeah long run I also need to premiere with you so the point is um sees new Intel CPUs basically don't require you to have an add-on PCI Express can't you just get it this your CPU please yes um so we've been working this Intel to integrated functionality called IntelliJ btg which is basically the virtualization this is a very graphic ship we allow you to slice up this crappy trip across up to seven virtual machines see though you can get preference enablement 527 virtual machines without requiring pci express comp is off because of power requirements kwanzaa money freeware yes that's a long hairs grow on the scene you or someone our broker for this one on JCP ugly so we we really think such as a big thing so Intel is investing in this why do we think that well it gonna be a lot easier for customers to the boys s sometimes I have to go for a fully-fledged of vinegar HP is very keen on this here throwing the neutral platform at synergy stay market this as a dreadful news um see the phones that they're getting is really lots of that so it's a way that we see Adam if he is played on TV graphics choices that you have this you have on the one hand low cost low performance and over there you have high cost high performance from the local spot you have stand-up GPU sharing in the staffs at four years on the high end we used to have sense of a pass through four years two years ago we got a video VDP you and he say Intel's play will be towards the low end and we really sings it will be very very popular lots of people don't pick set up or it's gold engineering company they hired birkenstock women near fusions that this QB graphic stuff and there's one box if you'll get a copy to see you um I knew the old Austin are armed so we've also invested into health check so the infernal an automatic integration into tools of the service citrix inside services we don't know if you're basically upload the status report it gets analyzed in television your system is healthy so even our automated sis we can leave from the UI you can do it at intervals you can enroll your own server and will just automatically happen the fidelity of our this second he'll see um if also invested in to making maintenance easier people fix visit God reverbs to down see what fix hot fixes are downloaded directly from Citrix but fun make your life easier if we refresh the platform people is supporting you i gue tops of hosts we will also be supporting the latest CP infects a hypervisor and our control and when I'm 80 outside of 7 11 just in case you're interested the Thunderbird scalability limits marks a maximum memory / host is not to five terabytes physical CP disposal under 40 it's really hard to get handle your offer for this together one virtual block devices playlist is up to 4096 maximum memory per vm is up to one terabyte particularly for setup version both devices per vm is up to 255 they've also again investor housing the performance that is adapted secrets could cope bathtub is blue stone scenarios so we now saying it will be a lot easier virtual machines on your pool master we've also found up for his mom a home's number again aggregate internet works with that 40 persons storage ions 50 persons single stream storage I us that's particularly important for Atlantis you're right anyhow bodies awesome I we've also refresh my active directory in chico actions that we are now using pipis on that should work particularly well for large active directory active directory deployments so that it's about 100 users big companies we also hope to the bullet in various areas it's not possible to help up the booty console instead center so that should put helpful affiliates yeah it's a little thing okay if you're interested in the tech preview you can get it on citrus com not sensible but you can get it there as well um questions yes if you see me is this evening after two or three years if you have any questions just maybe another it was literally like you are the plans to be preached in maximum triple discharge so now we too terrifying yes um it is turning most in the technology pretty good but it is something that we have Korea barrels from the life and marketing point of view how do you how do you position sensor as invite you go say customer try to convince them above kind of going for the end of this year what are your kind of king or the pre-fire setting places and server the course of the season sounds like the plain one so so ways a VC center of kingdoms or simply you go to a customer site its media department sent us home sauna yeah we tell them who get sensible for free once you have this once the customers he said Berkut he will not wait to also see the submitted server virtualization what other kinds of business lunches video yeah um so that's and the other selling kwanzaa some sense of her husband around a long time hypervisors are kind of commodity something really sink customers can't go wrong with a sense of offering yeah so and we are markedly premise still what about man's ability because i am a lot of customers moving away from percent server goin two iron IV or v amerike because of many because if he ever platform is usually our customers and that i'd like to make the sphere very efficient very little use to that they have contact departure to g sensor room that's all different and they can't get you to that don't come to manage it so he and also that i took me here this icing sensor is a lot of easier to manage than some of the other hypervisors however i can't do anything about it but it's a customer is very focused on the younger and only wants to control their height of other good qualities fear that's a lot of eyes integrative any like tools i hope has even whether microsoft word for managing virtual vc vem our hood a community be usefully integrate into scvmm we have not seen my job take them so we really sensing sent sent center as a user interface to the hyper but that's very very easy to manage yes it's like a package box well i think the difficulty that customers hot from sensor versus ESX is that hav RS are very easy to manage in this reference not sweet as much offensive against Ricky I'm a note on CP spent way I cannot careful there's a very understanding of it like there is for the improvement that's the main problem is that they will take trying to get the trust us and customers because you kill cancer you go royal dachshund and get off two years feeling it project that will take time and think that I mean there's a clear road man now and development so double used a primer on the other end management is quite easier center but things like if you update are you doing anything about the object of the approach so what I what I got mine out a entender 602 case hey this is cool because all of the old days you don't you know I need for doing it paint something on their machine it picks up yep so to be really investing heavily into sin server so we really really want people to take it up continue to use it feels very happy with the product not just really young with those were the one will come use it for anything use if I recent what make us very happy star this video this coalition like totally silly snapshots we have fixed various customer problems in that area so i would hope so there is a lot better also for big at the end also for bigamy outside does that will be particularly not as it performs improvements to be now can write also to the disk so we can call as possible okay thank you
