 okay this is Jen from scanner code jam sessions and scan a cup canvas and scale help this is part two of the sticker video this is my I did a 12 by 12 sheet most of the sticker paper will come as an eight-and-a-half by 11 but I just went ahead because I don't have my sticker paper yet and used my printable vinyl you can get this stuff at like crack vinyl comm and it works really well as you see I printed out my design and now I'm gonna load it into my machine I'm gonna have to pause this kitty don't you air even do that no maybe I can get this without moving the camera low the Machine still gonna have to move the camera there we go all right I'm gonna come into my safe data and I want my little flower okay now we're gonna do a background scan and this was skin in the background and show us the pattern whenever we have their oops okay let's bring you up here to focus you in my poopy all right trying to get you a little closer it's about it so now what I need to do is I need to move these to that so wherever they are closer I'm actually gonna come in here oops come in here and do it cuz this all allow me to move it a little bit better okay okay so see what you do is you just take your designs that you have saved on the stick and it allows you to move them and put them where you need to oops what am I doing here and you can come in here and move them ever so slightly which i think is better because for me I tend to shake a little bit let's come up here and get this one a little bit better with this cold I can't breathe now this one up here I may actually delete that come in and reposition it the same with this one if I can't get this one over far enough I may delete it come in and reposition it so let's click okay I'm going to delete that one and I'm going to delete that one because it's too close to the edge okay so I'm going to click OK on these because they look pretty good I'm going to click cut and I'm going to let it cut and I'm gonna let it cut those two and then I'll go back in since those are too close to the edge pull that in okay after I cut that out I'll pull that in and redo it that's really simple okay come back okay so excuse me I have my freshly kiss cut designs right here to make sure they're even you don't want to see my hat gob okay let me find my little edges and blinder than a bat see it I see it I see it I'm sure I'm not happy on this one up up here ok so I have them cut off so know what I'm going to do is I'm going to reapply this one I mean I'm going to move it over and I'll just put it right in the middle you use a boyer if you have it if you don't use a scraper and smooth it down Rogo I'm gonna go over and redo it alright so here I am back here I have my two pieces and it said finished cutting I just clicked ok and it brought me back to this screen ok so now as I need to do this rescan it then we'll reposition it and cut this second part okay oops no I'll just go in here cuz I like using those things okay that looks pretty good all right okay okay cut start so actually cutting stickers that was scanning cuff is really really easy and it's a whole lot of fun and you can create some really cool designs and if you choose to use the like the outdoor vinyl like I have right here you can make some really cool looking stuff all right so let's take it over to the table alright so here we are a lot of people say they they can't lift this up a little bit they can't get this off and like after they break it or something it wants to stick roll it and go crease it what whoa whoa your mat roll it off helps a lot of times alright and to see if you have a good cut take your pick and pick up the edge and yep that's a perfect cut a perfect kiss cut you see it now it's too blurry there how about that so that's a perfect kiss cut and my settings I have the 650 and remember I have really low settings my pressure never goes off of minus one unless I'm cutting really heavy things like acetate or leather and then it normally only goes to a one my pressure is a minus one my speed I had it a 1 and my blade depth I had at a 1 as well and it was a perfect cut alright so I have 4 little stickers and what I'm gonna do let me see if I have it in here yes I do with this printable vinyl this is the only vinyl I will tell you to seal and you will seal it just as it lays right here because you need to seal the color in ok polycrylic I use this stuff for everything I love it and just put a light mist over this you've seen me use it in my the other printable vinyl video I have spray it put it over there and it helps seal the color into the vinyl you won't have any issues with it then so what I'll do is I'm going to take this outside and I'll just spray the light coat over it let it dry and then these will be ready to be used alright guys so once again my blade depth was at a one speed one pressure minus one and you have some really cute stickers and you can make stickers on it anything you see that's why I love the scanning cut we can pretty much do anything we want alright you guys have any questions find me over at skinned and cuffed canvas and scale help you guys have a good day
