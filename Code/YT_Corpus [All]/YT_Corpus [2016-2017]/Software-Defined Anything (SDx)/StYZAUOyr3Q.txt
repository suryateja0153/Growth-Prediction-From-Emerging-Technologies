 hey everybody its gentle SCANA kajam sessions and seanica canvas and scalloped on facebook all right so this is another cutting fabric this is the one with Theriot magic with Theriot magic you spray your fabric and get it enough so that it you know gives it a good coat almost like soaking and then let it dry a little bit and then start to iron it I do have some tape some of my transfer tape covering it because I don't want to get my iron sticky okay so I'm going to wait until it starts to kind of dry out before I actually remove the tape because I don't like to have to clean my iron lazy I find it's just a real pain in the butt so you're going to start to just iron this until it gets nice and crispy and I will probably never use stereo magic again I found the two things that I can use are the pale on or however you want to say it the wonder under and then the transfer tape that I have on hand at all times I really like that I mean it was so easy to just put it down there set my cut up and like I said on the video that I show it I will probably take my depth just a little bit deeper after I adjust my cut head just to make sure that each part of it catches just a tiny bit deeper okay I think that should be good I'm sure it's all dry okay and it gives it this kind of like machine but this washes out for those of you who don't want any gunk stuck on your stuff you know forever all right so let's put this look let me turn this off I end up smelting something which I'm famous for doing well we'll put this on here squash it down all right can right tape back over here cuz it's fully reusable you sniff this and get this you know this stick that down there alright so everything is nice and stuck let's head on over to the machine okay so here we are at the Machine again I hold my mat up at the end after I stick the first part of it in that's America and then I loaded this okay let her drop I have my fabric blade in I have it set to what it said to it is set to three and I go I'm gonna go Justin tick over that blow it out just because of that the last video had the little tiny catch on it we'll see if that helps I'm gonna come back in here I'm gonna decrease the size of this okay so you all know how to do all this by watching all the other videos decrease the size hit okay oops when you pull it away just a smidge yep it okay okay cut angle we'll see how it does okay well let's pop it off perfect cut closer perfect cut okay so this is another one where you just rinse this out and it'll all come out in the wash all right so again this is the Theriot magic okay I have a my blade up for my machine is a it's just a tick over three bringing up to the Settings panel I'm sorry my cut speed is a 1 and my cut pressure is a minus 1 in it cuts just fine all right okay so on to the next one that we're going to do and I think that one is the freezer paper
