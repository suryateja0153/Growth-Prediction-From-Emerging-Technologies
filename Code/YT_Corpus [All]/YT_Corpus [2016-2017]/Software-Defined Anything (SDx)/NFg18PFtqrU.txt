 we got a pretty big day today got a late start I had an early morning appointment so we got that squared away it's 10 o'clock we got 11 more yards to do it's me and old boy we got one done we gotta knock this day down we're gonna do some old school bow and I hope some video a late start man 9 o'clock night well about 9:30 we left the house well no about 9:15 we left the house and it's a big day of driving this is my big drive day so this day sucks there is no route discipline there isn't there is some route density at the end there's no route discipline man we are 10 miles from the house and we're gonna go 30 miles from the house well 20 miles from the house we're gonna end up doing about 45 50 miles today but financial goal will be exceeded out the payroll so can't complain we got to done time to go I feel good all right so we got three done we got nine to go I feel good all right guys so we're moving along it's 1225 got a lot of it driving hundred away so now we're gonna hit that drive-up atm here drop the check off in there run over to grab some drinks and stuff and head on up the cooler so we got four done we got eight more to go and I feel good hey guys got a question for you you ever have these uh these really tall weeds like this see these really tall shoots see that all the way up and the mower deck goes over it and holds it down and the blade don't cut it when you pass it goes up like that I'll show you guys a little trick hopefully this will show for you guys now I recorded outside it's too close I'll try to upload this video in super high death so it'll all show but you can see all those waving tall grass weeds right what's it without you see all that cut almost as fast as the mower can go cut it one shot one kill and then there is tall grass there that I didn't go that high I just went up here ten around one pass chop it right down so how does that happen the trick is see the weed here the deck holds the weed down and the blade never gets to touch it because of the weeds so tall the back of the deck holds the plate holds that that weed down to and the plate goes right over it if you lower your blades by either putting spacers on them before you can mount them up or getting blades that have a more aggressive dip here it lowers your blade what it does is it gets the blade down to about the deck level so if the weeds being held down by the deck the blade still get still gets it as its bowed a little bit so if you can get your blades lower to the edge of the deck here you can get that stuff now there's risk in that and the risk is that your blade you know can contact something that the deck might not contact and you could do some damage to something so you got to watch out for like pipes or or anything like that so you really got to be careful what you're doing but if you know your yards really well and if your machine is capable of doing it space your blades down a little bit with some washers or something get that blade a little bit lower you'll have to raise your cut height of your deck up so instead of cutting at three I'm cutting out three and a quarter but I lowered my blade a quarter-inch so I'm still at three and a quarter or a three inch and you see I was able to go over those really really tall weeds at speed no issues never never really able to do that so just a little trick little trick you can do with your mower so that's just a little something about the blade so if you can get your blades lower to the edge of your deck you can get more of those really tall weeds so you know but you got to be careful hopefully it all came to where you can hear me but you do have to be very careful make sure you know the yard will and you know but that increases your production so much man you don't have to keep going over those stupid tall weeds or pre weaving them or anything silly like that so so we ate lunch took a little bit of a break it's 1:30 we got five done we got seven more to go and I feel good all right so just did one to that two story is three and the black truck is four so we just did four one two three four so let's continue to conversation from Saturday's route density route discipline it took us till one o'clock have you four yards and now from one o'clock to drum roll please 243 so a little over an hour and a half we just did five yards so four yards to do four more jobs for four four hours to do four yards an hour and a half to do five that's because the route density so we were we were chasing $50.00 yards earlier now we're knocking out $40 yards and no time off the clock knocking them out so that's the difference with route density throughout discipline and chasing $50.00 yards you drop your price a little bit and you you build up your the density would be surprised which you can accomplish financially and now it's starting to rain so that's for more added to the five total so we got nine done three more to go and I feel good all right so we're at the last house of travel and then we got the three at my house to do my house and the two neighbors and this house is lost from the weather so we were gonna go ahead and try to knock it out figure we had about ten minutes before the storm came but the lightnings leading the storm and it is bad but this is the lightning show out here look at that oh you guys probably just saw that oh we're going to go ahead and head back down toward my house and we'll just have to do this one tomorrow when when we're done with the thirteen or whatever that we got to do and the one neighborhood right up the road here so no big deal would not add a loss yet I still got an hour of work that I want to do and I got my yard in my two neighbors so we got nine done we got three more to go mine don't really count us off two more to go and I feel good guy lights on for safety wipers on for vision so we got nine done got three schedule that we're not doing right now watch my yard we'll probably be packing it in for the day a lot of tries in man I mean a good party today I mean I can't you know about this twitter route densities matters to sow sorrow up on Thursday I'll be back around my neighborhood discipline attention you know I'm a traitor out there with rain happens catalog the next day after us problem so we're going to go ahead and try to close this blog out for the day because we're not going to be able to do much more we're driving out of the storm right now heading back to my house but this should be honest in just a minute but I do have a valuable lesson for the day and oh boy here can vouch for it be careful what you're saying over the sound of your equipment and you never know who's around when you're saying so Saturday old boys weed eating in flower beds and I have told them in the past you know just barely do because they don't pay me enough to go deep into the flowerbeds and you know just so long the edge where we edge it with the blade and you know square just you know if there's something like there don't be afraid to let the line hit it down but they don't peek through their bushes or to spray or grind weed and stuff like that so I told him before a little bit so oh boy I got a little ahead of himself there he was showing a little extra motivation on a Saturday and he was all up in those flowerbeds grinding down weeds and I'm done I'm ready to you know pack it in and blow it off and and pack it in for the you know for that yard and he still has a lot to do because he's grinding weeds and I'm not getting paid to grind no big deal but I went back there on the machine to see what was taking him so long and he is deep into flowerbeds so I'm like no dude he's gonna call well you told me before to do it again but just a little bit as I'm rolling around and he's in front of me walking we cleared the front of the house so now you have the driveway the car and in their people's front door and I come around the house and I'm blinded you know as I cleared a house I wasn't looking I was looking at him this way talking to him on the zero turn talking over the machine and he's telling me well you've told me before to do it see we're not a meal this stuff's gonna be at my house in two seconds so I was like all right then how did I get it but kid you were effin balls deep in that and his face he just had a war on his face and I was like oh I know that look look this way and there they are mr. and mrs. customer he's got a check in his hand and she's standing there with her hand over her mouth and she looked at me and I was like oh my god and he's laughing and gives me the cheque and customer to lady goes how deep was he I don't want to step there oh I am so sorry and they're like don't worry about it God so I know Zidane back to my trailer with my tail between my legs I felt so freakin dumb so folks just a lesson valuable lesson I was gonna say you were balls deep in that Bush you know in the bushes and the flowerbeds partment at least I heard that and I didn't say Bush I said in that so you never know who's around just be careful guys all right I need to take my own advice sometimes so but we're gonna go ahead and pack this in I'll see you guys a little bit close this block out at my house so we got nine done we're gonna carry four over including mine I feel good holy crap guys look at this look at that driving rain look at it go I mean it's
