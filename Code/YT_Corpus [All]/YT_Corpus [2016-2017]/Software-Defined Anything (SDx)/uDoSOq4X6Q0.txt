 so we're done with the installation the authorization and the registration and all that kind of fun stuff right we're ready to start getting to the business of making music right well almost in this video I want to go ahead and cover a couple of other small details that we need to take care of okay let me show you what I'm talking about real quick if you are a user of Easy trummer and you have purchased easy expansion packs in the past you will now have access to those packs assuming that you follow the suggested path when installing superior - okay but what about the superior kits where all they I mean I've got a bunch of them what happened to them well if you go on into the settings tab right here you're going to see down here there's this button called add path the library alright and this is where we're going to be working is right here in this general middle section here the library section okay what I want to do is add path to library so let's go ahead and click on that button real quick and then I'm going to be greeted with a new sound library window okay now if you recall from a previous video I installed my SDX into my secondary drive that I labeled audio ok and I'll put it in the superior to folder now all I want to do is click on each of these kits one at a time and then we're going to press choose and then we have a little checkbox which indicates a successful pathway has been established for that particular kit okay so let's go ahead and do it again add path the library make sure I'm on my proper tribe scroll down superior to and I'm going to go into the avatar press choose and now I have a checkbox indicating a successful path to that library as well press the button again and we're going to go through the same process actually I'm going to do this for all of these okay so let's go ahead and hit choose custom and vintage good to go add path the library scroll down superior to hit factory and now I'm good with that one I'd Pat the library scroll down superior to metal foundry and I'm good to go with that one now you may have noticed that I went ahead and skip the file that was SL - dfh s that is the original drum kit from hell superior file I put all of my sounds in the same place as I did my new SD X's because as a superior to user you have the ability to utilize the sounds from the first drum kit from hell superior ok so what we're going to do though is I'm going to show you something a little different I'm going to show you how to use the set and clear buttons right here on the right hand side now the main difference is the one on the Left will set a path to the library to a sound library that you might have just bought ok versus the set and clear buttons over here on the right or going to set a path to the sounds it's kind of confusing but I'm sure you can wrap your head around it so moving on let's go ahead and stab the step path for the superior kit by pressing the set button and now we're going to be greeted with a different window it says sounds directory with sound files so once again I want to go to my audio Drive scroll down superior to and then I'm going to go ahead and choose the drum kit from Hell Superior folder right there and I'm going to hit choose and now boom I have successfully established a path to that library and can use it as well now let me go ahead and cover what these other buttons are for example let's say that I decide for whatever reason to move that superior folder later on okay well I can go ahead and clear the present one and I'll get an alert box that says you need to set the path to where you install the sounds before you can use them and at that point I would go ahead and press the set button again and direct it to wherever it is that I moved it but in my case that doesn't apply it's right here in my superior to folder so i'm gonna choose it okay but that's what clear does it will clear the path now something else i want to show you real quick let's say for example that i no longer have the metal foundry or i no longer want to use it rather okay let me go ahead and choose that library and then i can come on down here and i can click on the remove button and completely remove that library i get an alert box that says forget about the sound library cancel or okay well i'ma go ahead and press cancel for now but should you decide for whatever reason to remove a library that is how you would do it okay now there are a couple of other buttons here that I want to talk about real quick for example set path to presets so go ahead and press the button and then you want to go ahead and set a path to where you want superior to save your presets for example later on whenever you start making your own kits and whatnot you're going to want to save those presets okay and it's best if you go ahead and set a path to presets that way it's a smooth process when you decide to save said presets now me for example I have created a folder on my desktop and I called it cool presets for superior - you see that there and now I'm going to press choose and that is now going to be my path to saving presets that I create one last button is right here this is make current library default button that means I'm going to make the current library which I'm using as my default kit when I start up superior to the next time for example I'm going to my construct page real quick choose I don't know let's go ahead and just choose Latin percussion okay there it all is all laid out nice and pretty for us let's get back into our Settings tab and you see right up here at the top I have Latin percussion selected and now I want to go ahead and press the make current Lib default button okay and then we'll see this alert box it says from now on the sampler will start up using the Latin percussion sound library okay and now the next time I start superior to that is the kit that I will see by default okay I ppreciate y'all watching this y'all stick around because it's still got a lot of information left to cover before we start rocking and rolling see you in the next video
