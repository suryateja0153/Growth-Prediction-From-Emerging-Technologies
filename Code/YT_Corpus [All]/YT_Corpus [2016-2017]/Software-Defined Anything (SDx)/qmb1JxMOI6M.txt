 you all right so here we are in ubuntu 15.10 and yes this is in a VMware or VMware Workstation to be specific now I know I said this before but I cannot stress this enough this tutorial is gonna be entirely in a virtual machine software which I highly recommend you do as there's gonna be an extra step to boot USB drives within virtual machines but if you're also watching this without a VM and you're gonna be doing this without one watch the tutorial first and then follow along on the second viewing with that in mind let's go ahead and get started all right so my USB drive is right here it's a 32 gigabyte drive it's called test but we're gonna go ahead and wipe it so go ahead and open up your respective partition editor mine's gonna be gparted if you don't have a partition editor installed I recommend you install one now I recommend installing gparted as that's what I'm gonna be using in this tutorial now look for you USB drive it should be relatively easy to find as it should be your second drive in the VM now of course if you have more than one or if you're following along in an actual computer the drive letter may vary speaking of memorize the device path as we're gonna be using this a lot in this tutorial so here's C Drive and here's the partition now we're gonna go ahead and wipe the entire thing so delete all the partitions and make a new one make sure that the file system is fat32 and if for those who have 16 gigabytes or more I recommend splitting the partition in half or using half of the drive the reason why is that there are some distros if you want persistence you need a separate partition for them so this is just more of if you guys want to use this for any other reason reason for future persistent distros it's right there so I'm gonna call this multi-boot click Add click the checkmark and hit apply and I'll come back when this is completed all right so our USB is all set up so what we have to do now is install syslinux now I found that it's best and I'm gonna use this we're gonna be installing syslinux straight from the source don't worry we don't we're not compiling anything the program's already compiled we just have to run it now there's a few things we need to actually install but we'll get to it when we need to so go ahead and open up your browser and go to syslinux or search your browser insist Linux clicks the sis Linux wiki go to download and kernel.org now again the commands and links for the websites I'm going to will be available in the description alone below along with the sources that I use so go all the way down and as is this video the latest one is 6.03 download this you can use it if you want but I it depends if your distro is able to support zip if not you can go ahead and install the package for it but regardless so now I already have it installed let's go to downloads just do right click extract here or similar go to sis Linh --ax bios and linux will be right here with the programs i'm going to need to run now go back out and let's go ahead and open up a new terminal now we need to install a program and one more for those who are running a 64-bit operating system in Linux the first is sudo apt-get install em tools we're gonna need this if we want to install syslinux on a fat32 format you know I mean go ahead and hit install put in the password and it should install of course I already have it installed do clear and for those 30 sorry 64-bit users the thing that you need to install also you won't be able to run the program is sudo apt-get install libc - i386 hit enter put in and just go ahead let it install say yes all that fun stuff and it will be installed alright so actually installing syslinux do CD and just simply grab and drop the and drop the folder onto here as a great shortcut and hit enter do a quick LS just to make sure you got the right file or folder and what we have to do is sudo dot slash syslinux - I for install - de vie - s DB or whatever Drive letter the or location of USB is in and click I'm sorry I do D and put in a 1 for the first partition this is important and hit enter now let's go ahead and open up multi boot and as you can see it has been installed properly if you have LD Linux dot C 32 + LD Linux dot sis now go ahead and and have this in a separate window as we're gonna have to put in a few modules network now these are essential if you want to run this bootloader in USB we're gonna need these so go to comedy to and below here will list all the files and you need and where they are so I'm gonna go ahead and skip ahead a bit alright so here's all our files right here now we're these are the essential for a simple menu now quit course if you're wondering what I'm talking about just simply go to documentation and do and look under menu it's just text and this thing will tell you what is talking about all right so we're gonna cheat a little and in the description is a link to to a document which will be the SIS Linux dot CFG this is something that we can go ahead and put in I just realized I put that in by mistake without realizing it my bad but this is what we're gonna be using to get the holes to actually go so since we have everything here we have one more thing that we have to do go out of comm 32 back to the BIOS and go to MBR or actually go back to the terminal do CD and go to MBR now this command is actually quite lengthy so bear with me the command is is well this pseudo ddb s equals four four zero space count equals one space co and V equals n ot are you and see if equals M BR dot bin of equals and the air drive USB drive path pseudo and then after that do a semicolon pseudo parted de v s DB s DB set one food on this will put in the MBR are onto the drive along with setting the boot flag on for us to actually boot the boot loader so hit enter and that's it all we have to do now is actually test now before we continue adding any OS is we got to make sure that this thing works so let's go ahead and completely eject the USB so what we're gonna be using for if you want to boot USB drives in VMware you got to use a program that's called plop bootloader and yes I'm dead serious hits called plop now what you want to go to is w w plop at and when you get there just click the boot manager download and down on the latest one unzip it and there should be an ISO link the VM to that ISO and it'll start up so and I'll show you what it looks like so let's go ahead and power on yeah okay and this is plop pretty much if you have a system that that can't the boot and USB this will be your friend now let's go ahead and actually eject if you accidentally had your USB I'm actually connect when I went on boot just go ahead and just disconnect it and reconnect mainly because I found out that if you have this plugged in when the thing is booting then the thing crashes I do not know why so go ahead reconnect and reconnect all right and let's go to click USB and if everything's done right this is what you should see this is what you should see if you've seen this then congratulations you have set up sits Linux it's all set to go what we have to do next is put in the os's all right so we tested our bootloader system X is all set to go all we have to do now is just add in the os's get them all configured so they will boot from it and we're all set to go so first off go ahead and find the distro that you want to use for various reasons I'm gonna be using Debian based distros for veer again various reasons gonna go ahead and open this in a new tab and what we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and make a new folder gonna make one for a boon to and one for Debian go ahead and open up the iso using the archiver or if you're using a boon to or something similar open it up with the disk image mounter it's just really fast and I highly recommend it go ahead just grab everything and just do a drag and drop now what's gonna happen and the image that you seeing right now if you see this error don't worry about it it's just that fat32 just doesn't support Linux symbolic links so it's fine we're still able to run a boon to or any live distro just fine he says that we're just not gonna have the all the links which honestly what we're gonna be doing it's not gonna be much of a problem so I'll go ahead and do a time-skip win both Ubuntu and Debian or both on the USB alright so Debian and Ubuntu are both in so all we have to do now is just set up the sistex config so ill link now I know I glossed over this earlier but pretty much the SIS config file that is available in the description pretty much explains what each thing does now of course what you're seeing now may change in the future either because of people pointing out something wrong or I find something and I change it so this is bound to change but the whole point of it should be the same which showed you how everything works for the most part all right so what we do is we change the label to a boom - and we do the same for the file path and we're gonna add another entry for Debian so label oops able Debian menu label DPN and let's just do a quick copy and paste except we're gonna go ahead and change the directory to Debian and that should do it so we're gonna go ahead and save but we're gonna go ahead each act and go back to plop guys we want to make sure that everything is working okay so we don't have to do anything extra whatsoever so let's go ahead and completely remove the USB excuse me all right we'll go ahead and run plop okay plug the USB back in run the USB it goes and okay so that one is working just fine now of course that's not gonna work because we still have to tell a boon to where the files are now it's no longer on a disk or it's on a folder now so let's go ahead and do a quick restart go ahead and run again whoops helps to reconnect the thing one moment all right so Debian and yeah looks like everything is working just fine suppose go ahead and go back to a boon - or Linux distro wherever you're using and what's go ahead and configure the the ISO Linux files so that way it will boot properly on the USB all right so let's go ahead and go to a boon to first and get that started and we're not gonna go for ISO Linux but instead the txt file does well have everything that we need so what we're gonna do with this is kind of a couple things first off we're gonna change this to a boon to gonna change the file location so for Colonel it'll be slash a boon to slash everything else file equals slash a boon to all that fun stuff and for n int Rd we do slash a boon to Casper it now we're actually gonna go ahead and move this to the first thing on the append area right here now for the record at least for me I found out that apparently placement does matter here so this here first and we're actually gonna add a couple of things we're gonna add the live media path so that way the boon to knows what it go for live and we're also gonna add one more called ignore UUID I'm also gonna go ahead and add in cd-rom equals D detect slash try that USB key CROs it goes true and that should do it alright so go ahead and save and let's go over to Debian now this is actually different different than a boon to because instead of a text file or whatever it's actually in the live one in the live configuration file if you ever find yourself lost just open up with G edit the menu configuration file open up with G edit and look for the configuration files that are included here as their a Molson they'll most likely have the files that you need now for this what we're gonna be adding is well more or less the same thing that we did last time we're gonna add the live media the cd-rom slash detect try used to be true and I will have this in the description below no prompt boot goes live and this seems to work this one is kind of more of an option at least for me but pretty much it's just setting things up so that way to be completely honest like I said this is more of a of an option but you can add this if you want if it doesn't seem to work just go ahead and add it just go ahead and add it and see what happens alright last thing we just need to do is we just need to add it's the new location of the of each thing so it will be /d bian and make sure that we didn't do anything wrong here alright let's go ahead and click Save and what's go ahead and disconnect this thing one more time and we shall run plop one more time Paran plug in the floppy sorry us beat running USB all right and cross your fingers that this works alright so this is actually kind of interesting for whatever reason either because of the distros I'm using or because a plop it refuses to load in the virtual machine so I went ahead and plugged it into my laptop and it worked just fine so if you're having issues skinning plop to run your USB just go ahead unplug it and plug it into your actual PC actually boot your USB and see if you're able to make it and see if it actually runs if it doesn't go ahead and go back and check your settings and see if there's anything that has been misspelled or if there's anything that you may have missed so with that in mind was gonna go ahead and go to the next section alright so with that in mind if you're here just for a live USB then great you have a live multi boot USB you can also go ahead and apply this to the installations as well that should work the ones that we did for life that should work for everything else in terms of having it so you can install or and other things like that feel free to correct me in the comments below now for adding persistence for the live I'm only gonna show one way for one distro because there are some Linux classes that use this to teach students how the boot look how the bootloader works or something similar so sorry guys I'm not gonna reveal everything and this one there's actually another way that's much easier but I'm gonna show you guys this other one instead just because so this one is gonna be for Debian and remember when I said that we should split the USB and half because there are persistence that rely on a different partition well that's what we're gonna do here so we're gonna head do a new one change this to ext3 but we're gonna but we're gonna change it to live that our W that's what the partition name is gonna be and let's go ahead and spring this to about two gigabytes hit add and it was go ahead and apply okay so let's go ahead and exit out of this we'll go ahead and open this up and since there seems to be an issue what we're gonna do is do sudo nano media your home your username cuz it'll be the same library right and we're gonna name and we're gonna name this persistence that CFG let me just make sure I spell that correctly the CP C all right hit enter password and all we're gonna do is to slash space Union do X yes enter and there it is all we have to do is just do one more one more thing and that's the Debian I so Linux live and the only thing that we're gonna be adding here is after the boot - live we're gonna be putting in persistence space persistence - label equals live - RW now what this does is at least persistence label well it will look for any partition file anything that'll have this name on it and persistence which is pretty much will tell tell syslinux that hey there is a a persistent drive here and all you have to do is just find it right here go ahead and save and instead of putting it into plop go ahead and place it into your computer and boot if you got Debian going that's go ahead make a file or anything see what happens and if it works great you did it you now have persistence in Debian and that's it for this tutorial I hope you liked it like and subscribe and I'll see you guys next time
