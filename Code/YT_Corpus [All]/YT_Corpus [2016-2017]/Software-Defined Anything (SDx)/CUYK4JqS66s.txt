 you're watching consumers odd in this video I'm going to compare the cry cut Explorer versus the silhouette cameo and then finally the brother scannin cut these are all cutting machines which allow you to make custom designs on paper and vinyl we're going to look at the functionality as well as the price and availability and at the end I'm going to make some recommendations as to which one of these I think is the best and for which you type of users first let's look at availability you can walk in to Michaels and you can get either the silhouette products or the cry cut Joanne craft stores only carry the cry cut and then this brother scanning cut I couldn't find this at any of the local stores here but all of these products are available online so if you wanted the scanning cut you'd be best to order this off of Amazon check my links in the description for the most current pricing on all of these products on Amazon at the time of this recording the cry cut cells for 183 by itself the silhouette by itself without any sort of bundle would be 225 and then the brother is at 300 and that includes a rhinestone kit for all of my videos I like to look at the total cost of ownership to give you an idea all of these use cutting mats which do have a stickiness to them and eventually you'll want to replace these and the cost of these cutting mats for replacements varies between the different products cry cut sells there's for $7.00 $0.19 on Amazon for a pack of two the silhouette for $9.90 and then the brother is actually at $17.99 for a 12 by 12 cutting mat so this is priced way high for the the brother accessory another way to look at this is the cutting blades after you do a lot of cuts you'll need to replace your blade the cry cut is the cheapest at $5.99 for a pack of 2 silhouette for 7 dollars and 79 cents and then the brother is most expensive at 12:24 starting to notice a little bit of a trend here every device has its own store for purchasing new designs the cry cut has a bit of a dated feature in that it offers this expansion port where you can slide in little cartridges and buy cartridges at the store kind of like a Nintendo but they do also offer an online option and that is $10 per month or $95 for the year and that will get you access to 30,000 images the Salette store is a bit more complicated because it's based on credits which the credits say they're a dollar but you can actually get them for a lot less than a dollar for design so an example would be for $10 you can get $25 worth of credit cry cut would give you 30,000 images you get 25 here on the silhouette so the better design store value would probably go to the cry cut membership scanning cut doesn't charge for their project library what they do charge is a $50 activation card which basically doesn't do anything except for unlock a feature of the software which is the Wi-Fi so without the $50 activation card you simply have to plug it into your computer to access the designs with the $50 activation card you'll have Wi-Fi access I did not purchase that these silhouette over here makes you pay an additional $28 to upgrade the software to use SVG files both the brother as well as the cry cut allow you to use SVG files without charging you extra so we've talked a little bit about the the pricing and kind of like the overall cost of ownership next let's look at some of the functionality so we'll start with software the silhouette has dedicated desktop software for your projects so there's it's going to be a little bit more complicated but there's going to be a little bit more functionality with it the cry cut and the brother rely on web applications which is less complicated but probably somewhat less functionality unless you include the SVG files which it can handle versus this can't handling unless you purchase the upgrade the brother scannin cut is the only printer that can function without a computer so you can use this completely standalone and if you're scared of computers and this is going to be the cutter that you want to get if you like using your phone to design the brother is the only one without any mobile device interfaces the cameo silhouette offers both iOS and Android apps the cry cut only offers a iOS app I like the cry cut because it offers lots of storage options you've got this little cup up here inside the this little cover here that folds to close you've got some more places where you can put your tools and some extra blades and whatnot so this has a lot of storage on it these storage on the Cameo is limited to this one little side pocket thing so it's not that much and then the brother doesn't have any dedicated storage space it just has this thing that folds up and down and you could potentially put something underneath here or slide your pen in there but not not any dedicated storage space let's talk next about ease of use scanning cut is nice because again it can function without a computer the cry cut is nice because this is the only one that doesn't have an adjustable blade to fiddle with the Cameo was the worst because it took me forever to realize why this wasn't cutting there's many types of user adjustments you have to make in here for instance if you want to cut on vinyl without the mat you have to move this roller over there is the blade which instead of being a blade that you can adjust with your hands it requires a tool and for I thought I had to purchase a new blade to get that tool but apparently it's just this little cutout right here you put it in and then you can adjust it by placing it into the printer right here and then changing the number also it didn't cut for the longest time because I didn't realize that this cap had become unscrewed at the top and I just had to screw that back in to make it cut so this was a little bit frustrating to figure out initially and the software is a little bit more complicated than the brother or the fry cut web apps so the features they're all cutters the scanning cut and the Cameo offers some scanning function the Cameo is not the best setup for scanning because you're going to need to purchase a scan Matt place your item on the mat take a photo of it and then upload it into the software brother scan and cut simply has a scanner built in and will scan the image for you so if you're interested in scanning images definitely get this one okay so in summary the cry cut offers the lowest cost of ownership and this is my personal favorite the scanning cut is the most expensive but if you're interested in scanning then this is your device and then the Cameo I felt that this kind of like fell in between all of these and you know I mean it's probably right for some people what's your favorite cutter and why please leave your comments in the section below and let me know what what you think about these different cutting devices please also check out the detailed videos where I do a project on each of these and you do a little bit more of an in-depth review one last word that I'd like to point out is that I get my graphics from graphics talk it's not crap to focus specifically but if you are looking for images and other graphic design then it could be a better value than using one of these services check the description in the video for a link to graphic stock and a
