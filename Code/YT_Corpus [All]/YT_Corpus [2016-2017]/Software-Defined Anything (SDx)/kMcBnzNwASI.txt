 hi Andy Tanner here one of the questions I get often is Andy is it a good idea to paper trade I think it is if you're just starting out in fact even if you're seasoned pro and want to try new things paper trading is about an imaginary account what yeah an imaginary account so number one it's great for practice and you still practice your golf school golf swing practice if I can write that down right you can still practice your golf swing you still practice your foul shot you still practice whatever it is you practice and the nice thing about practice is there's no risk to this right for example if you make if you lose money what's imaginary money it's really look everything else is real stocks real platforms real charts are real scans are real everything else is real except the money the money's imaginary so if you lose money it's just an imaginary loss if you make money though oh well that's imaginary too but you can take that imaginary money buy yourself a brand-new imaginary car go to an imaginary Airport and take an imaginary vacation but there's no risk to it number two is you get to learn the tools okay you get to learn the system so you learn the tools and practice a little bit with the tools we give you an example I'm gonna bring up a fake account this is a totally fake account I don't care who you go with a hundred percent fake and I and it look like I got my charts here I got tools I got scans to look for stocks I got all this stuff and this looks if this is the first time you've seen a you know a platform this can look like the cockpit of of f-16 right under all these buttons and risk profiles and you know probability analyses and where all these numbers do well what a great idea to practice with this especially if you're in the minute club you'll see it every week you practice with this and no risk to learn how to use these tools so let's go to trade just for example and I got Apple in here and let's say they're asking 106 19 I click on it look at that brings up the interface I can learn how to buy stock here it says I can buy a hundred shares I can adjust that up or down if I want hunter sounds good to me that's gonna be 100 shares times out 106 that's gonna be about ten thousand dollars or so little over ten thousand I let's make it a market order and see if it just gets filled see this is where you learn what's the difference between a marketing to stop and limit and trail stop and you know all this type of stuff you know how is it a day order is it is a good tale cancelled right so this is a great place to begin to learn along with your education of what all these things mean to actually be clicking the buttons and doing them as you as you go along when we do our weekly mentor Club and we buy a stock we actually use an interface similar list so you can learn it and like a car you know all the parts are the same you don't need to use the same people we use you can go to any brokerage and they'll still have you'll put in the symbol whether you want to buy or whether you want to sell how many shares do you want you know what what's the symbol are you gonna buy stock or an option we're just gonna go with the market price here we're gonna hit confirm and now it brings up a dialog box saying hey you're gonna spend about ten thousand dollars here plus a $9.99 Commission wait wait that's all fake there's no $10,000 and there's no ninety nine nine dollar 99-cent Commission but it's treating as if if it was real even right down to what you spend on the Commission so this is a ten thousand $700 trade two by ten thousand six hundred ninety one dollars worth of stock tells you how much you have you start out with a hundred thousand dollars and here's what you start off with and you watch it grow and see if you're any good at it and then I'm gonna hit Send oh there it goes I just bought it it was filled because I put in a market order and now if I go to my monitor tab I can see I have some Apple right in here and look at that I've already lost 36 bucks because it's gone down have I really lost that money oh there's only 32 now see Oh only 28 now Apple must be making a run and so the fact of the matter is this is all fake it's like a real experience but this $29 $33 loss here is just a paper loss right this on SDX this $5,000 gain right here is unfortunately just a fake gain this usö right here that was oil body hunter shares a long long time ago I'm not really down $4,000 in that it's all fake money and so that's what a paper trade account looks like now what's the best way to get a paper trade account what's the best way to do it I'll talk to you about this in the old days I'll give you an example what you could have done the old days you could come here and maybe we go to the CBOE let's see if we can find it here and there are places like this you could go to educate yourself say hey I want to educate by practicing with some virtual training tools or you know paper trade or whatever you want to call it and in the old days you could click on these put in a username and a password pretty benign right no financial information have to fill out an application or anything you just start paper trading well now it's not like that if you click on this they're actually going to send you to a brokerage for which they probably get a kickback for and they're gonna want you open up a real account are there purely paper trading tools available out there if you googled it hard enough and long enough maybe maybe so but really the way it works now and the way I'd recommend you do it is set up a real account with a real brokerage okay separate real account and what they will do is they will give you both they'll give you a real account here's you and they'll also give you a paper account along with it if the brokerage is worth anything at all they'll do both can I show it it looks like let's just go here to this but I'm not recommending these guys because these guys might not be the best for you for example these guys require you at least at the time of this recording to make a deposit in the real account right so they say something say hey oh it's not much but they say hey live training put two thousand dollars in here that you can trade live so the risk is real okay put down two thousand dollars in here and where you can trade the risk is real the reward is real everything that happens is real do that at the same time what we'll do is we'll give you a paper money account which is imaginary money right and we'll give you an imaginary $100,000 see it's an imaginary cloud and no risk to trade it and you can take this hundred thousand and lose all of it and hit the reset button and start over as many times as you want to practice so this is practice but this is over here is real okay so if I were to put in my username and password right now and click login I would go back into that paper account and we'd see how that Apple we bought was doing but if I want to trade my real account I put in my username and password and click live trading then I'd know that what I was doing was for real so I think that's the best way to get a practice account and I'll tell you why because then you'll have the exact interface the exact buttons the exact tools for real when you decide to it for real as you learned on paper and that you have no obligation of brokerage you mean if I like these guys I can stick with them I changed my mind I say I don't like you guys anymore I can I just choose a different brokerage that'll do the same thing I'm the customer here you know their job is to please me so that's a little bit on paper trading you know setting it up finding it again you could try like you know these guys you should click on here and and it say hey you know here's virtual trade and click here and you know it'll show you all you know what you're supposed to do and all this but the fact that matter is this is eventually gonna wind you up in a brokerage and and you're gonna be you're gonna be trading with them so best way is is choose a brokerage anyone will do for now if you're just gonna pay for trade some will say hey look you should get a account put zero money in it that's fine will still give you will still give you the imaginary you know a hundred thousand dollars here to trade with in hopes that someday you do fund it and trade with us we just want you to try us out but we do want you to give us your information so we know you're serious about trading and so that's a little bit on paper trading I think that's the best way to do it get an account somewhere open up and call him if you have a question don't be scared pick up the phone say hey XYZ brokerage do you offer paper trading okay can I have 60 days for free or do you have a promo or or whatever and that's a little bit about opening up a paper trading account hey if if there's a question I didn't answer for you call the particular brokerage you're interested in they'll have a live person right in there and they'd be more than happy to set you up with an account and talking about the paper trading options hope that was helpful go paper trade first learn on paper a great way to do it have fun
