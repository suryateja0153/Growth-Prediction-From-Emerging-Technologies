 welcome to the video we've looked at a lot of different flight controllers on the channel but one that we haven't looked at before is the nazar series of technology now there are a lot of people out there that are struggling with the Naza particularly trying to get it to talk to Windows 8 and Windows 10 computers and this video has been put together by one of the painless 360 community a gentleman called Liam so Liam's going to take us through how you make this all work so that if you get stuck you know what to do so a very big thank you to Liam for taking the time to put this video together to help the community and I'll hand over to him to show us what to do in this video I'm going to show you how to get your Windows 10 computer talking with your DJI naza light software a lot of people are finding with in fact multiple different DJI naza products and also some windows 8 but mostly windows 10 computers when they go ahead and plug it in for the first time it isn't being recognized by the Naza em light assistant software I'll show you what happened with mine when I put it for the first time I went ahead and opened up the assistance software I got the loads and screening it sat here and didn't do anything further so what I'm going to do is I have an answer here I will plug that in here to show you and you'll wait a few seconds and you'll see the LED indicator will almost turn off it will go to a very very duller green and the Nas of like system software will not progress any further or recognize the device now what I found here was if you went into device manager and viewed comm devices you may see a few different common devices here depending on what's plugged into your computer however the key point here is if I go ahead and unplug the Naza we should hopefully see one of those three devices that I had disappeared in this case comm 3 and just to confirm that I'll go ahead and plug the device on the Naza back in and sure enough we see the conferee device come back so we know that it is being recognized by the computer however it's just not finding the correct driver so you get the Naza assistant showing up on your computer and the computer installing the correct drivers we have to go and do this manually to do this we have to reboot the computer into a state where it will allow you to install drivers it believes not to be signed I'll go ahead and fire up a virtual computer here so I can show you how to install this software and get yourself into the non driver signing mode needed to install the drivers to reboot your computer into the mode where it doesn't require Driver signatures to be verified what we have to do is click on the right click on the start icon here go ahead to the restart option but on your keyboard press and hold the shift key whilst pressing a restart and keep holding the shift key what we'll see here is the computer go ahead and restart and then you'll get a few more options on boot now if we go ahead and click in to troubleshoot and then into Advanced Options and then in to startup settings what we'll see here is restart to change Windows options such as and we'll see the key point here is disabled driver signature enforcement so go ahead and click restart and we'll have the computer restart once again and I'll ask you to select one of the function keys or the F keys to progress into the mode which you require so in this instance we see here the seven disabled driver signature enforcement is the option we need so I'll go ahead and press f7 your computer will once again seem to restart and your computer will now be booted into the mode where we can install drivers which the operating system doesn't appear to see and having a valid signature what we'll go ahead and do is open up our device manager it should still find in here the comport mentioned earlier just to go ahead and confirm or disconnect the now the device and we'll see one of the comm box disappear in this case again was comm three which I'll go ahead and plug back in now and sure enough come through is reappeared so we know that is our Naza if you go ahead and right-click this device and then go ahead and select update driver software we're presented with two options we'll go for the bottom one of browse my computer for driver software and then I'll automatically try and find the drivers for you however if this won't happen you need to go until it's specifically where to look so go ahead at bottom option here let me pick a list of drugs in my computer that this screen will be presented with have disk option if you go ahead and select this we will then be able to go and select a vise driver now this is currently assuming you have already gone off the DJ website and downloaded the drivers package which installs it into the default location you haven't changed the location which it works to install right so if we go ahead and go into the C Drive of the PC and then to Program Files x86 within here you should see the DJ product folder and then within that a DGI driver folder go ahead into the DJI driver folder your VL FD 3 further folders we need to select the source 64 one in here we'll find an INF file now this is the driver instruction file that we need to point the PC towards for our comm device so if we go ahead and select that and click open and then click OK we'll see the options of the models to select of the DDI USB virtual comm go ahead and select this and click Next and it will then go ahead and install the device software you may be presented with the option which I have which again it's saying aren't verify the publisher of this device we don't believe it's been signed however we know this is the DJI drivers we know it's safe so go ahead and click install this driver software anyway and if we wait a few seconds whilst it goes ahead and install those drivers and see it successfully updated the drivers now this stage if you get any errors any issue saying it was unable to install the device driver software anything else popping up either you haven't put it into the correct boot mode of disabling requirement for signed drivers and sure enough we can see come free now is showing is the DJI USB virtual comport so if we go ahead and open up the DJ assistance software we should hopefully see it automatically go into the configuration screen with a green light at the bottom left hand corner indicating a connection to the detail controller hopefully that should be everything you should then be able to go ahead and restart your computer the drivers are now installed and it will recognize that every time you go ahead and plug in thank you for taking the time to watch that video there are lots of other videos on the channel and they're carefully ordered into playlists so you may find that there are other videos on this same subject that you can go and watch so I would recommend going into the playlist area of
