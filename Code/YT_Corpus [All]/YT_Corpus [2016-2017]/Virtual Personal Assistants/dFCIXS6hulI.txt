 hello thank you for clicking the link my name is dr. Collins and the name of the practice is upper cervical spine and Wellness Center and this is a very specialty type of practice I do work with the upper neck and there's no popping or cracking that goes on you even though I'm a chiropractic physician we're taking very specialized x rays that are digital of the head and neck and I actually use sound wave to realign and reset the Atlas vertebra back underneath the skull and it helps with a laundry list of stuff in terms of helping people get healthy so that's kind of what we're about here what I need your help with with the marketing and you know healthcare kind of PR is Jeanette's been here for about a year she's the office manager and she's been responsible for doing everything even beyond office manager work she's been doing you know following up with patients and getting them set up for workshops that we do what your job description would be specifically is twofold okay one is I do dinner workshops and workshops basically like lectures and health care classes or primarily a dinner workshop which is where you would be bringing somewhere between 30 and 50 people once a month you'd be getting them lined up to come to a restaurant and I do presentation and an attempt to spread the word and get people to come into the office I also do workshops as many as you can really set up for homeschool groups and businesses churches whatever because we really want to get the word out about this kind of care so that's sort of one aspect of what you would be doing I can give you a lot more information about how you'll be doing that later you're looking at talking to existing patients to generate leads calling those people inviting them to a dinner workshop confirming with them setting an evite stuff like that okay too okay this is huge and this is where I think there's going to be a big division and who actually applies for this and sends a resume is social media I really believe that to get the word out effectively about this really unique very niche type of work that we do we need to start getting the word out via YouTube and Facebook and maybe probably even in the realm of like snapchat and Instagram and stuff like that so this is going to be the big division because a lot of people don't even know what that is right now but I'm 32 so I feel like my age and younger you guys are going to know what I'm talking about I really feel like that's the future for marketing so beyond just setting up actual events where you calling people to come to I feel like the long term over the next five plus years it's going to be putting out content on YouTube about our culture about this office about people whose lives are being changed about you know tips for health and things like this so i need your help okay to do that specifically in the realm of like video editing being able to upload and just have a consciousness of how these platforms work so you can leverage them to help spread the word okay so i know that's kind of like a pretty wide range of capabilities that you'll need to have but i know that that person is out there so you'd be looking at being physically here on a monday wednesday and friday so that's kind of a cool thing about this offices we're big on days off so that we can kind of rest but while you're here you're here for a solid day you're here from like 82 six sometimes 630 but you got your tuesdays to chill thursday you are here in the morning typically for a few hours and we're really game planning where things are going on what we need to work on so even though this isn't Stewart small town Stewart I really want this practice to be a high-level team I want it to be a progressive office that's improving and getting better and functioning like a clinic that you might find the New York or somewhere in cali or something like that I really want this place to work really well smart so those are kind of my goals for the practice you're looking at somewhere in the range of twelve to fifteen dollars an hour to start for like somewhere around the equivalent of a 30 hour week but that would just be a base pay and i'm all about bonuses i'd like to even bonus you big time based on how well you perform so it kind of depends on where you're at when you come in like how savvy you are and how much you have to contribute to this place i will happily reimburse you for how valuable you are to the practice so then what else is important so you're kind of looking at needing to be able to function over the phone be personal in person and be able to work video I have some video editing skills photography and just be able to really get that help get the word out about this place on multiple platforms that's about it if you would email your resume to the email below or you'll see at the end of your video I will call you so if you look like you have experience and that's really what I'm looking for is somebody who has already demonstrated some kind of capacity to DD sense in the past and can kind of jump in i don't want to spend too much time trying to get you up to speed on doing that but I think a little just send your resume below today now below and we'll give you a buzz and have you come in i'll probably interview you and get a sense of where you're at and what your goals are to make sure this is the right place for you as well so you can kind of get to know loss but thank you for your time and I look forward to getting your resumes and how can you come in for an interview thank you and have a great day you
