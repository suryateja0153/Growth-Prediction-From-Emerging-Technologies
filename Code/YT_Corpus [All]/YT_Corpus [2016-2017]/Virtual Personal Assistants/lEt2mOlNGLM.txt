 Tisha has been my personal assistant and what she does is to set up meetings based on my calendar and mark my calendar for meetings. She would help me book flight tickets and hotel. She would then make sure that, for example, if I have a flight to Beijing and if I arrive and someone wants to have a meeting with me, she would make sure that I would have time to reach my hotel first, maybe within 1 hour, taking into consideration the traffic. So she would then book a meeting 1 hour later, after I arrive at the hotel and not, immediately after I touch down. So she would do all these small little things, but very very helpful things for me. She makes sure that she keeps me very busy She makes sure that she stresses me out and she makes sure that I have enough work to justify my pay. And this is what she does. And what I want to do is actually to replace her. Sorry to say that but I want to replace Tisha Because she is after all a human. And I want to replace her with Walley That means, what I want to do is to have Walley do what Tisha does for me now. Walley would help me schedule meetings Walley would know that I have flight touching down in Beijing Walley would help me schedule the next meeting taking into consideration the traffic conditions in Beijing, estimating the time that I can reach my hotel and available for the next call. Things like that is something that we are working towards and we are very close to (getting) there. And this is what we are talking about in terms of artificial intelligence. Understanding the user, understanding the master enough to make intelligent decisions for you and help you with your work!
