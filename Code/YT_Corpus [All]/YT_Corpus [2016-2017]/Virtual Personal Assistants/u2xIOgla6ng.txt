 alright so hello everyone thank you for joining us today can you still hear me you're welcome perfect alright so just you you know this training will be recorded and sent to you in the next few days and there is a chat so you can send in your questions during this training and we will answer them after each section of the presentation as well as at the end we'll have a final Q&A alright so just to give you a quick overview today we'll be talking about the vital virtual assistant we will start by showing you how you can call your contacts through the virtual assistant using voice command then we will go into how you can access your email of the faxes text messages and voicemails again through voice commands how to access your calendar and schedule meetings with your virtual assistant how to change your status and your call forwarding how to access your call logs and finally I will be telling you how you can get some help on how to use the virtual assistant so to begin for those of you who were in their last time the status of the project at the moment is that the pilot project actually officially ended on March 31st of 2016 so at that time the cell phone service on your smartphone's was cut your participation was confirmed to us in the middle of March which was right before the end of the project so we have asked for an extension and are currently waiting for SSC to confirm the continuation of the project but in the meantime we have decided to give you the service anyways so what we expect a view as of now is to explore and test the technology as a voice enabled phone service that provides access to messages by phone web and mobile app and we hope that you can give us your feedback so we want to know how it makes your life and work easier and more productive and what you would do to improve the product and most importantly its accessibility another important note before we start is that the accessibility of both the web portal and mobile app are not yet finished we are working on it very hard so we should be able to provide you with more accessible version in the next few days so we're going to start now by showing you how you can call contacts through the ever tell virtual assistant before we start just to let you know i will be using my own virtual assistant for the demos which is currently configured in expert mode so you can actually switch between a beginner and expert mode through your web portal and the way to do that is to access your settings which is the seventh option in the main menu on the left of your screen when you're on the web portal and then in the settings drop-down menu the first option you're going to see is my profile so you would click on my profile and when you get to the my profile page you'll see that it's separated in two sections so first you will find the my profile section where you can change your language and when among other things and below that you will find the phone sessions section with the third option being the speech interface level so this is where you can select your desired speech interface level whether it's beginner or expert and then you would click Submit so note that in beginner mode the virtual assistant will be talkative and holding you through the different steps to complete each command and in expert mode you can use more natural command such as call John Smith on his cell phone for example so now we can go back to calling your contacts through the virtual assistant so first to reach your virtual assistants you have to call your smart number from one of your mobile numbers so first of all what is the smart number the smart number is where people call you where they send you foxes and text messages basically you configure it to specify how you want to be reached when and where you want to without having to give out your personal phone numbers so in your case we actually already configured your smart number so that your calls go to your work number during the day and to voicemail in the evening and on weekends we send you your smart number by email a few weeks ago but you can also see it shown at the top left of your web portal pages if you have lost your smart number don't hesitate to contact us after this training and we can help you find it so now now that you know how to reach your virtual assistant we can show you how she can recognize you so last Wednesday we showed you how to add private numbers to your profile on the ave tell web portal and these private numbers are the numbers where you can forward your calls made to your smart number and they're also the numbers from which you can call your virtual assistant so as previously previously mentioned we have already added your work number to your profile in order to redirect your calls at the office during the day and this means that you can also reach your virtual assistant by dialing your smart number from your office phone so now that we that you know how to reach your virtual assistant I'm going to show you how you can call a contact using voice commands so I've actually added some of you to my contact so that I can demo this so we're going to try today calling and seema who should be listening right now one moment please your status is unavailable what can I do for you kool encima I'm calling ad simmered on the mobile phone is it okay yes all in progress and there you go so anthem I've actually just wrote a message on the chat thing that it ranks so there you go so this is how you can call a contact using voice commands using your virtual assistant thank you very much on for letting as I was ringing so next is how to access your email voicemail faxes and text messages using voice commands so we're going to start with voice mail first so basically you can just call your virtual assistant and ask her to read your new voice messages so we're going to test that once again using my virtual assistant one moment please your status is unavailable what can I do for you read my new voice messages I'm reading your new voice messages you have one new voice message first voice message I don't enough I wanted to sit down with you and go over the afternoon

last remark you choking you one more time Cole what now on I will be waiting in the background thank you all right so there you go so she read the voice message at the beginning we could have also asked to read my archive voice messages or to read my voice messages from a specific contact and after the voice message is read we can delete the voicemail or call say next or call back so don't forget your voicemails are also accessible on your web portal and on your mobile app so now we're going to go on to how to get your emails through your virtual assistant so we're going to test that also it'll take just a second one moment please your status is unavailable what can I do for you read my new email I'm reading your new emails you have 22 new emails first email email from optoma colony the subject is training test email the messages dear participants this is a test email to show you how you can access your emails through your virtual assistant using voice commands what you want to do with this email delete email generated texting so there you go so she can read your emails to you and once you have read an email you can decide to read the next email reply you can forward archive or you can call back the center if it's one of your contact so we're also going to test how to send an email which is something you can do if you're in your car for example or or if you were

assistant using voice commands is it okay yes your message was sent what can I do for you so I'm smile should be receiving my email which will include a voice transcription as well as the audio file of the message I just recorded so next section is faxes so your virtual assistant can actually tell you whether you have new faxes and who they are from and then what you can do with those fact is you can delete or forward them to a colleague for example however since the attachment is an image the virtual assistant cannot read what's in the actual attachment now for text messages we're going to once again test how you can test how you can send a text message using voice commands so we're going to send you a text message again I'm Somalis you can if you if you receive it you can let us know

informed us that she has received the email that we recorded just a few seconds ago so as the other thing that you need to know about text messages is that if Adele can actually be configured to call you when you receive a new text message and apply it to you now moving on to the next section of this training we're going to look at how you can access your calendar and schedule meetings using voice commands so as you may know we have another training scheduled next Wednesday on the FSL mobile app so I'm going to ask my virtual assistant to let me know what's going on next wednesday one moment

have scheduled a lunch meeting for myself on the same day so we have just been informed by an smell that she didn't actually receive the text message that we recorded previously so what we're going to do later on it that we're going to check if the phone number is that that I have in the in her contact information is actually a cell number so we'll be doing that at the end so next section of this training is so now we're going to look at how to change your status and call forwarding so you might have heard when i called my virtual assistant the first few times that she was saying that my status was set as unavailable so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to ask her to set my status as in meeting please what can I do for you change my status to is eating you want to set your status to in meeting yet at what time will your meeting at 3pm you have selected 3pm your statuses in meeting until three yeah what can I do for you method so so I just changed my status to in meeting until 3pm I could have changed it to available not available or out of office as well and now we're going to look at how I can change my call forwarding so let's say that now I don't want to be bothered so I want to send all my calls to a voicemail for example one moment please your status is in meeting until 3am what can I do for you forward my calls to my voicemail you have selected to forward your calls to the main line is it okay no what is your call forwarding command forward my calls to voicemail your call will be forwarded to your voicemail what kind of hang up thank you for calling hi there you go so all of my calls will now be forwarded to a voicemail so the next thing you can do through the virtual assistant using voice commands is to access your call logs so what I'm going to do now is that I'm going to ask her to check my colleagues of yesterday on holic please your status is unavailable what can I do for you read my call logs of yesterday I'm raising your call logs up yesterday add 2 1050 6am you called for 168 00 47 47 what do you want to do with this call next next call at nine thirty six and you received a call sighs 1 45 to 55 55 what what do you want to do with this call hang up you want me to hang up yes thank you for calling hi so what I also could have done with these callers that's what I could have asked my virtual assistant to replay or to call back so now where you can find help on how to use your virtual assistant and the voice commands so you can connect to your web portal using the credentials that were sent to you by email to both your government and your at ever tell that CEO emails you can let us know if you have lost them and we will send them again and when you get to the main menu on your web portal on the left of the screen you would choose the eighth and last option which is called guides and in the guides page you will find PDF documents where that describe all of the voice commands that you can use with the virtual assistant both in beginner and in expert mode if you need one I want to help you can always call us at five one four seven six five eight 470 or you can send an email to support as speech mobility calm and don't forget we have another training session scheduled next wednesday june twenty second at the same time but this salmon would be about the Ewa tell mobile app so now it's time for the Q&A so you can submit your questions to on the chat and we'll be happy to answer them or you can or using your voice for Satsuma hello yes when you set your appointment you didn't I don't think you put a title for the appointment like I think it was lunch could you do that I didn't I didn't hear that you had that option no at the moment you actually cannot put a name for your appointment so what you will see when you go on your calendar as you will see that the appointments going to be called appointment scheduled by your virtual assistant so that's what their automatic fault okay we have any other question yes yes okay and can you set the assistant to call you back for a reminder of an appointment yes you could you could schedule this is we share you can schedule the reminders you do them through the web portal okay air and you could do them also through voice commands where you say call me let's say tomorrow at 9am or so you pepper them like that if you want to have them within and you could use also the mobile app ok we have a day an appointment and have a reminder to call you back is a lobster is going to be nothing this version but in the next version okay thanks it would be automatically like an option remind me why you're calling me yep like 10 minutes earlier before something like that yeah okay okay we need to check if the phone number of an tema is the same number that could receive text messages so can you find out what is the number and that we called and yes i will check this out if you try to send a section what is the number yeah all right so on is it okay for you if we ask you the number we have here is a cell number she says yes all right so we have here a 819 6 5 4 4000 is that a cell phone okay so it's your office number okay do we have another number okay so you can receive a text I know I don't hug me okay all right so this is the reason why she did not receive the text message that we said before because it's an office phone number but if it had been a cell phone number she would have received the text on your cell phone and now we take this opportunity also to tell you if her office number was a smart number from never they're smart number she would have been able to receive text messages in addition to voice calls and faxes on the same number so answered that her ever tell phone has no service though I think you're talking about the smartphone that was provided to you so as it was there at all yes the cell phone so as it was mentioned quickly in the beginning what happened is that the program was actually it actually ended on mar 31st so that's why we had to cut the cell phone service on on the phones that were provided to you so at the moment which you can do it that you can use the mobile app on those phones through Wi-Fi and so right now we're waiting for SSC to let us know if we can continue the project and if we get a positive answer then we will have to look at if we can give you self service back hello can I ask a question yes of course yeah okay about the text message that it would could be sent to the smart number but could that that service send it to the office number also like some time we received text message to home phone for instance the text message you can configure your msn account to that any text message that sent to your smart number you could get a copy of it by email you could see it web portal automatically yeah and you would see it on the mobile app and the assistant can call you and and play it to you if you want also but having said your office number your office number is the one that is limited it cannot receive that correct but so I can set up the end the personal assistant to read to me to text through my slot number to my office number Oh call yeah yeah so if you can figure that you want to be called in the configuration on the web portal for the SMS option you could say when you get a text message call me and read it to me offered to read it to me on this number call me on this number and if you play the number of the office number then the assistant could call you and tell you you have a text message do you want me to read it to you okay so with then and would have that received would have received at the text message to her office number them in that steps situation if we would have sent it to her smart numbers and yes but in this case what we did is we yeah yeah yeah right now it's the test the demo was different al-shabab is one of the compacts of in Fatima's directory is she is not considered as a user but if we have put her Eva del I think we could have done that instead of her cell phone you put the evidence part number and then we could send her the text message she would get it on the web portal on the mobile app and she could have been called at the office pool here yes okay good good point good point do we have any more questions or concerns not right at this point but I will later I've looked at everything that no problem so again I want to take this opportunity to thank you for participating in this test this is a new technology that has been developed here in canada we want to fine tune it improve it adapted to make it completely accessible on the web portal mobile app in addition to its interesting features voice ID and so as we told you earlier we're working hard to get these portal and mobile app fully accessible so that we could make them available to you to test and give us your feedback with your feedback we continue to doing the improvements and the objective is to have this fully accessible interesting Canadian technology ready first of all for Canadians with disabilities but also ready to export in other markets oh thank you thank you very much and we hope to have you at our next training next Wednesday to talk about the mobile app we have to set the reminder oh yes happy all right thank you thank you very much have a good way everyone
