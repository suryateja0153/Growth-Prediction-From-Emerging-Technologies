 [Music] he looks your OS reviews in this video we're gonna I guess take a closer look at both Siri and Cortana as digital assistants or pretty good forms of artificial intelligence incorporated into our current smartphones and obviously the Siri has been used by Apple with their iPod Touches or iPhones and iPads whereas Cortana is more found in their wind and Windows Phone products created by Microsoft and it's being a bit more emphasized through your newer Windows 10 laptops in addition to Windows 10 mobile smartphones that are coming out now so we're gonna take a closer look at I guess in terms of accuracy and things that you can do with both of these virtual assistants so the benefit of these is again if you want to set more complex tasks or if you're driving if you're doing something else while not having full access or full attention to going through settings and setting up alarms or something this might be a good way to quickly find data and also consolidates it in a more simple format but obviously it's not going to be smart enough to do everything and tasks will be limited more or less to things that can be achieved by a simple command so if we take a look at some examples are shown by both of these assistants you can see it being scrolled here such as show me my to-do list you know what's the traffic like changed my appointment to a certain time I can look at all my tips over here as well and same thing with Apple they're going through some sample things that you can ask Siri like how high is a certain mountain open a certain application you know a certain set an alarm for a certain time find a location that's near me using your location services things like that both of these products you can set it up so that even if you say something such as hello Cortana or hello Siri it will you know prompt you for your voice of listen listening to your voice using the microphone and then do the quick search but you can set it's actually turned off by default so that it doesn't accidentally trigger or eat up your battery too quickly so that's why when I'm saying these names right now it's not pulling up anything so I can tap on both at the same time and connected to the same Wi-Fi network a quick sample such as let's just say what's your name and see what it pulls up what is your name so again I can turn up the volume a little bit more on this Apple product but again both of them will read out their answers so it seems like Apple's Siri does have a bit more of sass at least in the responses being provided so you knew that already whereas the Cortana it seems to give the more direct answer right now the interesting that thing about Cortana is that Microsoft is pushing some exclusive holiday based tasks such as playing a holiday movie game and about you a quick demo of that play the holiday movie game seems like accuracy is what Santa Claus alright so that was a quick demo of that it's similar to you know 20 questions in a sense I gives you an image and you have to recognize based on clues what the movie is in multiple tries and it reveals that after I think three tries so it's kind of interesting take in terms of algorithm and a brief showcase of more you know games and tasks that you can do with these digital assistants not just you know setting up alarms or asking them four simple questions or queries that they can pull up from the web so the next let's do a quick I guess comparison of maybe a more calculation based tasks so if want to do something like five plus five so again both of them were fairly quick it seems like response time is about the same Apple just pulls up the answer since this is a very simple calculation the Cortana with Microsoft pulls up actually a web page where you can also edit this and add more complications or complicated calculations so let's do something a bit more complicated for instance square root of 20 million so pretty similar this one is still using the same web page whereas now Apple is giving you more details from Wolfram Alpha which seems to be a source of data for a lot of these calculations I can also scroll up to see my previous answers I don't think that is something quite as easy to do here but probably is still possible so next let's try to do something like set an alarm set an alarm for one minute so those are simple tasks really not too much difference between the two in terms of calling people adding reminders notifications pulling up basic data from the internet but what if we wanted to actually talk to these virtual assistants as if they were human you know which one would be more realistic seems like Apple Siri because it's been out for a little while longer but let's try that now are you intelligent actually seems like both of them were able to understand that we were asking a question to them as opposed to wanting to search something up on the internet so both have been you know already improved in terms of answering it so let's try something else are you a robot or a human so it looks like both of them are just gonna pull up my pages so didn't do too well with both cases how about let's check for something like when were you created so yeah it seems like both of them are able to understand these tasks so really not too big of the difference anymore I would say Cortana has really really evolved and caught on so the first time that you actually turn on the feature on a Windows Phone or your Windows 10 laptop is that ask you for suggestions for improvement so it's gonna use your microphone whenever you're talking to improve your speech as well as then to customize that for each person so through all these trials and trials by error and the fact that really is a software also found on tons of Windows laptops now whereas series with limited just of mobile products at this time it seems like Microsoft has already made lots of leaps and bounds in their virtual assistant I so remember when Cortana came out with the first innovation of very early generations of Windows Phones and it was not nearly as impressive as it is now whenever I would ask questions like this it would just search it up through the internet whereas Syria would already be able to respond in this in this manner or talk about you know the Turing test something like that and to them were we and you know a bit more interesting so some other examples of things that you can do is maybe like say tell me a joke and it actually will be able to do that if you repeat back words to both of these assistants sometimes they'll say is there an echo echo echo echo and try to repeat that so it does try to build up them or character into both of these of these platforms so anyways guys a closer look at - you know fairly interesting versions of artificial intelligence digital assistants that can be found on current modern-day smartphones and in this case both Cortana and Siri are definitely improving and to really help people I guess in terms of multitasking and setting up quick reminders pulling up quick information and these have really evolved and been refined over time thanks for watching this video here at
