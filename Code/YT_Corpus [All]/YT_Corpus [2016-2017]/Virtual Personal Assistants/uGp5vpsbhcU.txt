you have a pool of job opportunities there now it's time for us to take a look and see how many executive assistants are available now we are looking at how many executive since our out there okay because you want to look at the ratio how many jobs are available versus how many of your niche market is available right now on indeed I'm sorry on linkedin.com I type in the word executive assistant

you want to look at it here are 1.8 million executive assistants for us to place and all of those job opportunities that we just looked at now I went on over to indeed.com they actually have a resume database on a decom and I wanted to see how many Executive Assistant resumes I could find I found 250,000 executive assistant resumes this is nationwide and of course when you do your search when you start to research your niche and you want to dive in there a little bit closely you want to look at your niche from a nationwide perspective you want to look at your niche from a worldwide perspective you want to look at your niche from a coastal perspective and then regionally because that will allow you to see do I just want to stay local do I want to grow do I want to dive into somebody else's market you're listen this world is all it all belongs to it all belongs to you so you have many options okay I'm going to keep going now I went to datacom and you listen guys I'm kind of old-school I started with datacom when it was jigsaw comm I wanted to take a moment and to dive in to see how many executive assistant positions were available I'm sorry how many executive assistants were listed on datacom and I was blown away when I saw 56,000 executive assistants I my question to you is what do you have to lose and looking into this niche and starting your own executive assistant recruiting and staffing agency business and having the executive assistant niche as the niche that you represent and that you bring to the table I mean it's just that you have lots and lots and lots of options here okay now a few things before I dive into the financial part I wanted to pull some articles because I wanted you guys to see some of the things that I do when I go and I create a niche I want to see what the world is saying about the niche that I'm about to dive into I found this article and it says no longer secretaries see EA's hold power and Silicon Valley let me just tell you this article was pretty amazing this was in 2013 so you can only imagine where we are today with our executive assistants and what those salaries look like and I actually was on the line with an executive assistant in the Silicon Valley area space yesterday she's going to kill me for saying this this is a true story she literally when I asked her to tell me her salary she would not give me the final number but she told me she was in the three hundredths okay I've known this young lady for many years that's not including her bonus and her salary I know another executive assistant in the New York area she's definitely trending around 240,000 and she's working for one of the largest financial companies in the world understand this niche is nothing to play with you can do so much in this niche honestly okay so I found another article to that I wanted to share and the title executive assistant is the new power job that was just at the end of last year okay and again talking about that Silicon Valley space the top cities that I shared with you are the cities that you really want to focus on I live in Atlanta Georgia and I noticed that the salaries in Atlanta are 4% lower than the even the medium so I may not want to recruit in Atlanta or maybe this is kind of like my extras but my main phone this is in the New York area or the Washington DC area or maybe even the Silicon Valley area I mean you're you have options that's all I'm trying to say so now I kind of want to dive into the financial side because I think this is where it really gets exciting I don't know if any of you are familiar with the infamous calculator and the infamous calculator is is a calculator that I use to determine what I'm going to make and what I'm going to charge a client to fill a position okay so what I'm charging the client and what I'm going to make and I want to show you what that looks like I had to clean my calendar here I wanted my calculator I wanted to show you what that looks like and live in and live in color so I'm gonna make my screen a little bit larger here so you guys can see this I hope you can see this clearly and um let's see okay perfect all right so now first things first one of the first things I like to do is to see what I can potentially make if I am placing my executive assistant on as a direct hire placement and if you're not familiar there are many different models that you can use in the recruiting and staffing industry the two main models that are used as either your bottom line money your your bottom line income which is your one-time payment for each placement that's your direct hire or your residual income that's what we would kind of call it your residual income where you're getting paid for every hour that that person has worked it's works so we're going to dive into the direct hire side so we can see how much money you'll make there now we looked earlier and we saw we noticed that I got to go back and pull all my good stuff up here we noticed that the executive assistant position the lowest salary we saw was fifty seven thousand eight hundred seventy nine dollars here and so we're going to dive back into the calendar on calculator fifty-seven thousand I'm just going to say 58,000 just to get us started with a twenty percent fee all right that's see the the the percentage that you're going to bill to the client so if your executive assistant is making if you're placing an executive assistant if you're matching an executive assistant with a great company and their salary the salary that they're offering is fifty eight thousand dollars a year and you build a client a twenty percent placement see your check is $11,000 six eleven thousand six hundred dollars that's what you make every time you place an executive assistant with this target salary now if you place one executive assistant every month just one for the entire year you're looking at income and actually I had that as a 15% fee your income is going to actually be a little bit more than one hundred and thirty nine thousand let me just change this so you can see because that's at the lower it's about a hundred of four so at the 20% fee you're talking one hundred and thirty nine thousand dollars for that year which is a pretty and not bad number for somebody you may be doing this part-time you may be doing it after work you may be diving in trying to I saw I read a book the other day working your five to nine so you know this could be so many this could be very easy for you if this was something that you wanted to do as a side gig okay now the other salaries that we saw and I want to stick with the numbers here we had a seventy or let's say seventy two thousand dollar salary okay so if we place an executive assistant at seventy two thousand with a twenty percent fee your check ultimately would be fourteen thousand four hundred dollars not bad we see a number here eighty two thousand one hundred and sixty-five dollars as a salary let's go back I say eighty-three thousand I wanted to show you what you have the potential to make sixteen thousand dollars every time you place an executive assistant with a salary near the eighty three thousand where that near the 80 3000 mark okay so there you had I mean it's getting bigger it's getting better are you kidding me it's getting better it's getting better okay now we had another salary here I want to skip the 94,000 let's just go straight to the $100,000 mark and I'm gonna move this number right here because I want you guys to see $20,000 check so if your niche is executive assistants with salaries of $100,000 or more DPP thing strategy strategy these getting started now then you're talking about at least a minimum of a $20,000 check every time you place an executive assistant how exciting is that okay now I we've got to talk about the Silicon Valley space because it cannot be ignored if this young ladies and these gentlemen here are doing $200,000 a year plus equity plus bonuses you would only charge if depending on your model for the salary is that correct right so 20% of 200,000 is $40,000 if you place high-end at the very top of the line executive assistants with 200,000 more you're talking about a $40,000 check for every placement I'm excited just thinking about that let me say you're probably coming out of my skin over here I mean that is just an exciting number there are the possibility okay the the opportunity is huge it's huge this is one niche that you definitely want to tap into no matter what so now I want to do something a little bit different you know I like to just step out of my little box here um I want to go in and let's start converting some of these salaries into hourly rates okay I hope we have enough time here we - great alright so now we're going to take a moment and we're going to look at the aisle we're going to convert the hourly rates so that you can see what your executive assistant when would you would make on your executive assistant for every hour that they worked all right let's get started so let's just start with our typical salary let's start at a general sixty thousand dollars a year to get us started and then I'm going to flow over here and I'm going to open this one and we're going to do an eighty thousand dollars a year and then we'll do one more and we'll type in one hundred thousand dollars per year okay and this website that I use here is very very convenient I use this website all the time when I'm converting salaries the web address is www.carandtruckremotes.com floyd on my payroll this is where your residual comes in now your markup you want it to be between forty and sixty five percent and you want your gross margin profit your gross profit margin to be somewhere below so somewhere between 28 percent and forty percent Robert Half internationals average gross profit margin is 43 percent Wow okay so I'm going to put a number in here and I'm going to say $50 an hour so this is the bill rate that's the number that you would build a client okay and with a 50% markup you are making $20 an hour I want to lower that number just a little bit because typically you're going to do somewhere between 33 and 38 percent depending on how well you negotiate right so I'm gonna give them make the bill rate 45 45 dollars an hour your candidate will make $30 an hour you will make $15 an hour your gross profit margin is 33 point 33 percent you've got a forty four point forty four percent markup this is looking really nice ladies and gentlemen let me just tell you right now okay so at $15 an hour per person you are and you have one person on billing you only place one person on a contract right with a hiring manager that means you are bringing in you are earning $600 a week okay you're earning $600 a week $2,600 per month and 31,000 per year with one person place at the $30 an hour you know hourly rate that's what they're making right well let's just say that you have five executive assistants five executive assistants on contract that's giving you a check of three thousand dollars per week and you're doing one hundred and fifty six per year the average number four staffing agency emplacements on contracts to stay on billing for their first year so you're looking at that number twenty five if you consistently keep 25 executive assistants on billing who are making somewhere around $30 an hour and you're bringing in somewhere around a fifteen dollar gross profit margin you're talking about fifteen thousand dollars per week you're almost doing a million per year seven hundred and eighty thousand per year sixty-five thousand dollars per month oh that's all I can say and you're working for yourself right and you have your own independence and you're moving across the country the way you want hustling flow and doing your thing right this is your baby your business your money your joy for connecting the right assistance with the right companies it's an amazing feeling let me tell you when you make that placement you won't feel anything like it all right now we looked at some really small tiny numbers here let's kind of up this up a little bit let's get some larger numbers here and I'm going to actually skip though $80,000 mark actually because I want to I want us to take just a quick look at that $200,000 mark give me one second I want to pull my screen down here okay great and so I'm gonna type in the $200,000 so we can get prepared to see what that hourly rate looks like right there and I'm going to dive in here to the hourly rates of $100,000 per year and less to see again convert units dot-com it will really allow you to see what your numbers would look like in this particular business okay so at $100 an hour I'm sorry 100,000 dollars a year you're talking about a 50 $50 an hour contract right so let's move our numbers here so we can kind of take a look at this a little bit better so we've said $50 an hour so let's go back and change this to 45 let's see 40 42 Wow there we go and then I want to see what there we go we can do 78 a year okay so 70 I'm sorry a bill rate so we're going to build our clients $78 an hour and just in case you're wondering do companies pay this 100% yes they do I have seen companies pay bill rates of $400 an hour for a particular position that is very true granted it was in a healthcare space or executives space but understand companies have the money and they will pay you don't worry about that part you just worry about what you do best which is which is matching the best executive assistants with the most amazing companies in the world okay so we're building the client $78 an hour we're paying our executive assistant $50 an hour which we are we are profiting $27 an hour and 60 cents our company is making $1,100 per week we're doing 57,000 per year that's one placement all right that's one placement again let's look at those numbers you make five you have five of those candidates on billing five executive assistants are in the billing you're doing five thousand dollars per week two hundred eighty seven thousand per year twenty-three thousand per month let me just stop for a second and ask this question are you making that right now okay all right so this is an additional opportunity this is an additional way for you to earn some additional income or make this your full-time gig because understand the time that you put in here will allow you to increase your your your business your revenue to what have you the way you want it you are creators so ultimately at the end of the day you can create the income that you and the lifestyle that you want to live in this business and impact lives in the most major way and that's what this is really all about okay so let's look at that number one more time with our average of being 25 people on billing per year we're talking about twenty-seven thousand dollars per week we're talking about eleven one hundred nineteen thousand dollars per month and one point four million dollars per year notice I haven't even added on under seven hundred and twenty thousand dollars that I may be potentially making from the direct hire space did I add that yet no I'm talking about I'm talking you know this business with these numbers you're doing almost three million dollars per year with a full-fledged staffing agency this is amazing I mean remarkable am i using some great words here I just want you to feel the energy and know that you have the Opera Trinity to do amazing things in this business now wouldn't went back and we said okay hold on D you said that there are people out there doing two hundred thousand a year and let me tell you when you have salaries that large either the hiring manager is going to want to bring that person on full-time or they're gonna want to try before they buy which we call kind of our contract to hire business and so at a $200,000 per year we're making $100 an hour so let's go in and look at those numbers I get excited when I see numbers let me just tell you I've been in this business a long time and this is what what gets you excited one of the things that gets you excited okay so we're talking about a $100 pay rate for the candidate right for the executive assistant and so we're going to get that let me just see here 80 let's see 83 d let's just do 84 just to take them over there so we're talking $100 an hour here for the candidate alright we're talking $100,000 here for the candidate we're talking 100 I'm sorry $100 an hour here for the candidate let's see what we would build a client all right let's increase that a little bit more to let's say one hundred and fifty three dollars an hour that we're billing the client we're paying the candidate candidate $100 an hour and I want to move this number here cheated here I don't want you see those numbers all right so with these numbers we're talking two thousand dollars per week ninety-nine thousand dollars per month one hundred thousand and eight per year five people on billing we're now making ten thousand dollars per week let's say six months into the business or three months into the business or eight months into the business depending on how passionate you are about this business we're talking somewhere around around ten thousand dollars a week and again let's look at our industry standard of 25 placements per year 2.7 million dollars per year and contract staff or contract to hire but you've got to keep a minimum of 25 on billing in order for you to see these numbers throughout the entire year we're talking fifty two thousand dollars per week two hundred twenty-six thousand per month let me just tell you on the contract side that typically that contract can be forth on a specific amount of time or in a definite amount of time you may have a Silicon Valley or a New York startup or a Houston startup it's not really sure just yet how long or what the scenario is going to be and they may just want an open-ended contract and that contract may last for three years okay or you may have a startup you may work with a venture capitalist firm or company that's growing that needs executive assistants for all of their executives throughout the organization all across the world you have the ability to hit that number 25 very easily more than you know and have an opportunity to place as many people as you like you can do a million dollars in your first year in this business I've seen it okay you can do this if you're thinking if you're wondering I don't know D is this possible let me just tell you it is more than possible I don't know what else to tell you to to show you how exciting how remarkable how amazing it is to be able to take an executive assistant that you may have just met who tells you their story they tell you what they're experiencing at work they tell you the challenges that they're experienced in this experiencing and the successes sometimes they get personal and tell you what they're experiencing at home you get a connection with that executive assistant you begin to love or in your executive assistant and then you have this other party here which is your client your hiring manager who he stressed out because he's got all of this work that he needs to be done and he can't do it on his own and there's a time crunch going on and he needs somebody who's just as passionate about his business and about the work that needs to be done that as he is right and take these two individuals and you introduce them and
