 this week we're gonna talk about different strands of sourcing protecting your time and starting from scratch hey everybody and welcome to Peck TV episode 5 sorry it's been a little bit of a extended break but we're very busy in property education group and in all of our other businesses actually so of course we are still first and foremost property investors and excitingly going into some larger scale property development which is cool however we've got some big news with the property education group and that is that we have just achieved our CMI accreditation which is chartered management institute now what does that mean for us it means we can now deliver management and leadership training on a high level that's what going to be doing going it's companies and helping their managers develop leadership and management at a high level so that's really cool I hope everybody agrees there's obviously some some deadpan faces in the room thinking CMI what's all that about but I'm pretty excited about it and it's part of the the ongoing Pegg vision to help people unlock their potential whatever routes they come from whatever their job is whatever their background is because everybody's different we need to tailor that to help everybody unlock their potential so that's all exciting so everybody's now looking much more excited which is cool so how's everybody been how's things been going since the Stamp Duty changes have come in how did everybody found that any issues getting completions done or or selling property running up to that deadline I know it sounded like it's not everybody was running around with a hair on fire on the last day of March so hopefully you've got that in if you were buying anything or selling anything and it hasn't affected you but how do you think it's gonna affect you going forward feel free if you think it's gonna affect you to put some comments in below if he's not gonna affect you at all just gonna negotiate a bit hard to put that in if you're gonna sell your whole portfolio put that in let me know what you think about that what do you think about that you don't pay me enough to think about that not paid to think about that okay good right I think it's time to get on with the show okay question from Greg Bateman and hey Rob enjoying the content here's my question sourcing I know you saw using a VA or PA to get direct a vendor do you back this up with an unpatched campaign of say leaflets and direct marketing Greg thanks the question so sourcing yes we do use Virtual Assistants not really personal assistants anymore I did used to have a personal assistant by I actually found that the virtual assistants we were paying them probably 25 percent of the money and getting a hundred percent better better result so anyway we do use virtual systems but to answer the question actually have loads of different sourcing streams out there so I don't rely on one particular sourcing stream and I can't say this with everything whether it's whether it's sourcing whether it's marketing whether it's finding landlords don't put all your eggs in one basket and rely on one string because if that doesn't work anymore than you've got nothing so rather than having one channel where you're getting all of your leads I would rather have a hundred channels each of which is bringing one lead each because you're very much hedged then which is great so virtual systems direct targeted letters definitely now of course you need your VA s to find those properties use things like Rightmove and property B or Maus price to identify that motivation with a vendor and then go direct with a targeted letter bandit boards and this sort of traditional darkman is not something I've particularly ever done but there are some areas in the country that works really well northeast is one South Wales is definitely one don't forget just going in and speaking to the agents and developing those relationships so that's key we also source through our local council so we have strong relationships that our local council empty homes officer a local council regeneration officer and they every now and again bring bring us things bring our sites network network network network two of the in fact three of the projects we're doing at the moment have all come from various networking events we've been to and met people through people now these are not the traditional property events where everybody's going to look for money they're probably business events networking with high-level high-level people or even builders we've got a big one at the moment coming through from our builder who's brought it to us so really to answer the question Greg have multiple sources multiple streams and to get in one or two from each one of those rather than all the eggs in one basket okay so we're just going to change the format of PEG TV a little bit and over the last or the first four episodes what we've done is done three questions what I'd like to do is only do two questions but have a little bit of a personal development slot to help you achieve more with less in your businesses so today what I'm going to talk about is protected time now something that I noticed with a lot of the clients that I work with is that everybody's running around with their head on fire all the time and really doing just operational day-to-day admin sort of tasks in their business and not doing those real big picture now I call it quadrant two and if you haven't read Stephen Covey's seven Habits of Highly Effective People and Ross we'll put something up on the screen probably down here to point you in that direction go and read it and it's his habit 3 which is all about time management and it sounds a little bit boring I know I bang the drum over this but sitting in quadrant 2 which are things that are not urgent but really important is something that as entrepreneurs property investors business people we should always be doing and that is developing income streams for our business developing relationships networking strategizing all those things that are really important but not urgent so we put them over to the right all the time and therefore they don't get done so what I'd like you to take away from today's personal development slot is to build in protected time into your day so it could be it could be an hour it could be 30 minutes could even be five minutes a day protected time to do something which is not urgent but very important so let's say we are or you're in a position in your business where you're starting to do the opposite manual you start to write your family and everybody always says I don't have the time to do the ops manual if you just give you give yourself five minutes a day to write a paragraph in two or three months you can have it done and it's gonna be it's gonna be simple to do that rather than thinking I need to sit down for a week and do it all at once which they never never really works and never happens because we you know we end up fighting fires during that week so protected time I heard a great quote from from Gary Vee Gary Vaynerchuk the other day and he's got a little little video on about it which is called one it's greater than zero and all that means is doing something it's better than doing nothing so set yourself some protected time every day to do a quadrant two task and even if it's five minutes is better than nothing and then even if it's 20 minutes better than five minutes if it's an hour is better than 20 minutes so put that protective time in your day and do something productive and effective to generate more income or more time in your lives and that's my personal development of the day what do we think of that this feels like it's a tough crowd in the office today I think I think I need to get maybe it's cuz it's Sally's birthday and she didn't want me to say this but it's Sally's birthday so maybe that's why Sally's feeling a bit a bit unloved in the in the room because her birthday we're making her work on her birthday so everybody say happy birthday to salad okay right just to save any more embarrassment from that right some of the lights talked about very quickly is our property and system summit we have opened the early bird list so the pre-registration early bird list so all that is is sign up and you're going to get early bird notification of launch dates of venues launch offers Ross is going to put a link at the bottom which can go to and I'm also going to put that link on the Facebook post or the YouTube post however you're looking at the so please go and check out that page get yourself down on the earlybird register to get all the pre notification of the july summit which is 15 16th of July I think it's 1560 I say Saturday Sunday it's that weekend or 1670s will post that of course but please put that in your Diaries ok question from case cowan if you had 50,000 pounds and hadn't started your property investing journey with what you know now how would you invest and why great question Kay and thanks for making sure I get this answered for you on the show so I had a real real long think about this question actually and I know people in the room are going what would have done so I think the big thing is we're now in a totally different a totally different market a totally different property investing landscape so where we were when I started 2010 2011 that was the depths the recession it was easy supply buy below market value and so therefore that was my my strategy now interestingly that you said if you have 50,000 what would you do that's pretty much similar to what I started with now back in those days and actually I don't know where your base K but I think it's probably not up north so up north in 2011 if you go go in and buy something for cash with less than 50 K refurb it with cash and then recycle it and pull most your money out so when I started that's what was doing but in hindsight it was a really slow way of doing business had my pot I did one recycled bought another one recycled and it was really slow and Sally will tell you probably took two two and a half years before I could even generate remotely enough cash flow to leave leave my job even a full-time job so it's very slow going and even then when I left the full-time job we have to do massive sacrifices because actually when you got a portfolio single let's you've got to have quite a lot before you get any reasonable cash flow so what would I do now if I had 50,000 pound and everything was wiped out tomorrow and had 50,000 pound in the back pocket so this is without a what we'll do in the current market especially now we're in a strong market especially now the tax changes have come in the stamp duties come in the interest rate relief has changed I would use that fifty thousand and I would go and find as many service department units that I could so I'll probably go rent to rent apartments wherever your base somewhere where the demand is and by the way there is demand pretty much everywhere as long as you know what demographic you're hitting for service department now we've started service part business and depending on the quality and the demographic we're hitting anything from two thousand to six thousand pounds of upfront costs of that includes you know you first once rent you deposit furnishing the property and we're finding each unit is developing delivering us five hundred to a thousand pounds a month profit per unit so with fifty thousand I would say you can probably go in and take ten service departments get ten service departments up and running and let's say it's at the lower end and each of those ten is delivering you five hundred pound a month so that's giving you five thousand pound a month passive income now without a doubt let's let's say we do one a month within a year you've got that up and running and then you've got experience you've got a brand you can now start looking for joint venture investments go and start buying properties so two strategies cash flow and wealth building and you need to be doing both concurrently but if you need to get out of a job or you need to live you need to get that cash flow first when you've got that and you've got the experience and you've got the brand you can then look for joint venture finance to go buy units whether it's HMO single let's block to flat service departments start that wealth building strategy with joint venture finance and then you can carry on building those concurrently and you've got the cash flow and you've got the wealth building and that's what I'll do if I lost everything tomorrow I'll probably have a couple of pints tonight I wouldn't be that wouldn't be that that happy but that's definitely what I'll do and the great thing is when you've got that intellectual property you know what you're doing actually it doesn't matter if you lose everything tomorrow because you know you're gonna go and do it again so that's how I do that so thanks for that question I think that was a brilliant question everybody that's been it's been the show episode five with format changes Ross is gonna do his best to make sure they get edited in nicely you if you're behind scenes you'll see there may have been a couple of errors as we came into those format changes which is all my fault as usual but Ross will do his best and work its magic in the meantime please do post down how you think the Stamp Duty changes are going to affect you get those comments in the post get over to property system summit registration page and get your name down for the launch offers and the launch sequence and I will see you on episode 6 you
