 these ingredients to you this is dr. o the PA Pro otherwise known as just plain old Omar Abdul Malik I hope you can hear me I'm still at work so there's a lot of extemporaneous noise that ya camera my phone may pick up but anyway I wanted to do a video on getting into the PA school I hadn't done one and I think it's been several months but I was getting a lot of comments upon my comments section of some of the videos that I've done about people saying that they could decide between being a PA or an MD or wanting to know was I'm really happy with with you know being a PA again as I as I'll reiterate what I said before really it's your life you can't judge and I have a bad habit of doing this you can't judge your projected satisfaction with your career decisions or life decisions based upon what you see other people doing you know there was a time I met dr. ben Carson maybe almost 25 years ago I had read his book gifted hands I go I want to be a neurosurgeon I had no idea how much work it took to become a neurosurgeon I just didn't I didn't have a clue so for those of you all that are that may look at some of my other videos that that extended to my other life as dad in a an educator in an athlete and say well okay that's PA that's the thing I want to do this guy's got a good life I would I would issue a caveat and and say that don't base what you want to do based off of what I say for those of you all that are kind of torn between PA school versus med school i would say i i'm theistic lee in clients but the kufi in this the the muslim so i I pray about things and in you know what God kind of guide me to where he wants me to be you can do that and in you know really follow shadow as many people as you can shadow doctors who specialize in different things shadow physician assistants who specialize in in different things the thing that I like I personally like about being a physician assistant is that it's such a young field and it's so versatile I'm now doing something called it's it's the kind of long-term acute care and management of sick patients and working with an extraordinary team of people of doctors nurses Tech's therapists to kind of help people get as well as they possibly can and hopefully go home for other people yeah come on okay sorry but but um you know it's I actually worked pretty long hours handsomely rewarded for it I'll say yeah it's well respected but you know don't base that don't base your decision off of what I'm saying in terms of getting into PA school it's so much harder than what I applied you know almost 20 years ago now oh my god I mean you have to have a bachelor's degree they've Debo's the the PA coach makes you GPA check his videos outside you know you have to have at least the three I would say a 3.5 or 3.3 is what he said I would I would tend to concur with it you should have a 3.3 science GPA a good solid year of direct patient care contact meaning your CNA working in a hospital or a long-term care facility an EMT I always go to the EMTs emergency medical technicians I want to see them and ask them if they're interested in PA school this constitutes direct patient care you're using using a stethoscope here you're getting very I would say rudimentary skills and - physical assessment and in the clinical decision-making you know if you if you have that that's um that virtual patient contact hours and I can't tell you exactly how many hours you need because every school differs in some schools one you know maybe a hundred hours other schools 1000 hours yeah so it varies if you're if you don't feel and this is another caveat OSU if you don't feel that you're a particularly competitive applicant at this time I would say give yourself a year to become a competitive applicant because you don't want to waste your time you don't want to waste your money you don't want to waste the time of other physician assistants like myself I write recommendations for piays on the Kasbah it's a lot of time they are writing the having a student follow you you're trying to teach the student that the pre PA student then writing the recommendation if you're not a strong applicant at this time and don't have at least a 3.3 GPA if you haven't finished all of your prerequisites you you have to have a bachelor's degree now you have to have four I'd say a little more than half the schools maybe 60% of the schools now what gr want you to take the GRE now I took the GRE I'm 25 years ago so I don't even know what the format is now but it suffice it to say it's just way more competitive now they want they want you to have very good recommendations you know so it's it's it's something to think about it in making the decision between one PA school versus in med school I have a few classmates that became doctors Niraj min Narada you can google his name and he's he's on YouTube I'm so proud of him he worked as a as a PA for several years and decided going to become a doctor and I think he's an internist now Sharif's Massaquoi is another one glenda spits i believe is a doctor now so several of my classmates I'm proud of them because they chose to continue their education and that was their decision I chose to go on and get a doctorate in health education I think I would like to run a PA program someday in my future she'll want God willing we'll see what happens but you know it's you know with with being a PA applying at PA school versus med school that's something that you really need to decide for yourself I would say time is a factor which is why I think there is a preponderance of women applying to PA school is 80% women I think is the is in the field though because I want to start families and get married so so you need to consider time you need to consider money and most importantly I would say consider you know what's important to you in life I hope this helps you're welcome to call me I'll put my number on my my youtube channel and you can also email me I'll look over your your cash flow statement your personal statement for your your caspo application for free if you're in the Washington DC Maryland or Virginia area you can you can shadow me hopefully God willing so I hope you found this helpful I jumped around a lot but you know it's there's a lot of things to discuss and a lot of God well I'll do it in future videos also so please subscribe to my my channel tell your friends and family in that perspective about PA students about me and I wish you the best of success peace
