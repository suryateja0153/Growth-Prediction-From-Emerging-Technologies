 welcome back to another episode of things stop things stop date and I were you I'm your host and my name is Matthew so just got done watching google i/o 2016 today was the first day they released some awesome news some awesome information new technology and I wanted to quickly go over everything that I understood coming from day one and let you guys know all the cool things that are about to be first they talked about this thing called google assistive and google assistant is an ongoing conversation with the user and it's going to be able to learn from you and it's going to be able to understand it um context and be able to learn your likes your dislikes preferences the way you talk I mean it's gonna just learn you as person and it's personalized for each individual user the more and more you use it the better and better that Google assistant becomes we will come back to Google assistant a couple more times but for now we'll move on so next they talked about Google home in Google home is going to be a device that you put in your home and it's going to be in home assistant because Google assistant is built into Google home it will be released later this year and it will have a nice simple but yet elegant design and it comes in different colors so you don't have to worry about it not match the editorial fit in nicely and the nice thing about is is that you can put multiple Google homes within your home it's going to have a bluetooth speaker and from what I understand it's going to be on par with most of the other Bluetooth speakers that are on the market currently so you can expect a good sound it comes with the microphone obviously so you can have google conversations and ask google questions you can play music through the cloud but you can also use your phone and use google cast managing your tasks is going to become a very simple thing when you have google home google home you're going to be able to ask about your current schedules your kids schedules you're going to be able to ask about reservations meetings you can change reservations you can make reservations for restaurants for movies you also be able to handle text messages make phone calls be able to ask a Google home to play a YouTube video and have it turn on your TV and play on your TV to get the full experience of Google home you're going to need a smart house you can obviously do it you know just like if you have some bluetooth speaker that will work with Google home and if you have a smart TV you can definitely get some use out of Google home but in order to get the full use where Google home will turn off your lights change your temperature security I mean all that stuff you're going to have to have a smart house moving on communication apps we have to app all of a llo and duo d you oh and they're basically sibley naps from what i understand the first step all o is a messaging app and that messaging app learns from you coming back to gullible assists google assist is built in so obviously that's what's going to be learning from you and it's going to be able to do so many things for you which are subtle changes and massive changes so we'll start with subtle changes now they wanted to make it instead of you having to always type in capital letters to get a point across or two maybe yellow shout so now they have a feature called whisper shout and whisper shout is basically a font size slider they're also releasing the future ink and inks going to allow you to write on your pictures I mean that's basically what it small feature the greatest feature of all is going to be smart replies now I said Google assistants built-in and this is where Google Essex didn't come into play Google assistant is going to give you smart replies so instead of having to type out a response these smart replies are going to allow you to just tap and continue going now at first I will say that these are probably going to be generic so smart replies also works on photos and so say someone sends you a picture of something that is a tasty food send you a nice picture of strawberries now in the beginning Google assistant doesn't know you yet doesn't know how you talk yet so she'll probably just give you a generic response as in that looks tasty now you might say that but a lot of people might say something different so after a while Google assistant after I type in my responses to these questions is going to have a better understanding for the way that you talk and what words you use and she'll be able to then give you better replies so it sounds more natural and it sounds like something you would say now on top of smart replies Google assistant is also going to be able to interact in your conversation so say you are making plans to go to eat they'll say where you want to go eat now as soon as they asked that question Google assistant is going to comprehend it what is going on in the conversation and Google assistants actually going to offer you suggestions of nearby restaurants and if you so choose one of those choices then Google assistant will then also make reservations for you and to how many people and what time you want to go and you can do all that without even leaving the app and i think that the other cool feature about this is if you type at Google and then ask Google what you want you can directly communicate with Google while in your conversation on all 0 which means say you want to take your girlfriend's to the beach and before you want to ask her about going to the beach you kind of want to get her excited so what you do is you take at Google and then you would say show me pictures of Laguna Beach now what's going to happen is that Google assistant is going to pull up pictures of Laguna Beach and everyone in the conversation can now see these pictures and so it's going to bring a more interactive way communicating with people if you can directly communicate with Google and have google search things for you and then both parties can see it it's just a communication tool and really that's what this app is all about is communication now also and lastly in this app you can have a direct conversation with Google you're going to be able to ask your many questions you can ask you to play videos you can even ask her to play games and so by doing this you're going to be able to help Google assistant yet again continue to learn you and understand your likes dislikes what you're into and how you speak because Google assistant is being incorporated in all these different aspects now Google assistant is going to become a very big part of the experience of just being a group of you so the next appt is duo and duo is the partner app to Allah although as the messaging app and duo is going to be video calling back now one of the great features that sets do all apart from all of these other video calling apps is a feature called knock knock now knock back as a feature that's going to be 42 type of people there's going to be the person who really likes to know why people are calling before they answer and you also got the people who want to get people engaged in the conversation before they call so what knock-knock does is it sends live feed of what you're recording to the person that you are also calling at the same time so when the person looks down that their phone when they're receiving the call they're going to see what's going on in the video call before they even have to choose to answer or to reject the call so say Jim just proposed to sarah and sarah just got this beautiful ring and of course she wants to tell her friend right away your best friend is so she gets on duo and she sets up that knock-knock feature and what she's doing is she's holding her phone up to her hand showing the ring and so when when Mandy looks down at her phone she's gonna see Sarah's hand with a ring on it which immediately is probably gonna tell her hey what's going on to Jim propose she's gonna probably be freaking out and she's gonna answer the phone so it's just a way to engage the person before even having them answer the phone to then find out what's going on both apps are going to have great security they're gonna feature incognito mode which just kind of deletes conversations after you're done having a conversation the duo is also going to have a feature where it is always searching for the best signal whether it's Wi-Fi or data signal to give you the best video quality now both of these apps are going to be available on Android and iOS and they are coming this summer so with these two new apps coming out that begs the question what's going to happen with Google Hangouts because if Google is really pushing for this new messaging app in this new video calling nap what is that leave for hangouts so now what a lot of people are excited for is the new version of Android Android n Android n is going to be released later this year but right now they actually don't have a name for Android and and they're actually asking for everyone's help to give suggestions so you can go to ww android com /n and it's going to bring you to a site where you can give your suggestion a lot of people are saying they want android nutella i think that you could maybe go Neapolitan I know they did ice cream already but that could be something or nectarine so Android n is going to see some performance changes is changes is what the changes so Android n is going to be seeing some performance changes and they're going to be adding a new thing called Vulcan 3d graphics it's going to lower the requirements of CPU needed and it's going to give developers more control over the graphics that they are able to put in their applications they're also going to be upgrading the Android runtime they're going to be adding something called jit compiler JIT compiler is going to allow for faster application installation and it's also going to reduce the memory requirements of applications by 50% next they're going to be changing the way that updates work they're going to be making updates automatic and they're going to change the actual way that updates look when they're updating they're going to be improving their security which is going to be a file-based encrypting and media framework hardening and they'll also be some other security updates multitasking now a lot of phones actually already have this feature but not all phone support it so if android end they're going to be allowing any phone with android to use those features multi window is one of the features of multitasking you're going to be able to hold down that recent button and while you're in an app you're going to be able to pull up another rap so that's going to be really convenient for multitasking now that feature is going to be for cell phones and tablets but the smart TV also is getting a feature it's called pitcher in a pitcher and that's going to allow you the example they gave was say you're watching a video on Pacman because you want to get the pac-man app for your TV what you wanted to check it out and while you're checking out that video you're like hey I think I'm gonna go get it but you don't want to necessarily leave the video that you're currently in to go get it so what you're going to be able to do is you're going to minimize the screen that you're currently in into a small picture and that picture is going to continue to play and allow you to continue to watch it but in the background now you can go download that app and you can have a different screen displaying that while you're doing so so that's picture in a picture and that's for the Smart TVs also another feature that they're going to have is going to be kind of this bouncing feature where if you double tap your recent button it is going to just pull up your most recent application you were just in and then if you double tap it again it's going to go back to that app you were just in so it's going to allow you to bounce back and forth if you don't want to have to windows hoping you can just double tap your reset button and it will pull up your most recent window also to help save on potentially your battery and your speed your phone before this change usually you can have like tabs open for ages and your tabs will just stay open in your recent folder and most people don't go all the way back so what this new feature is going to do is basically put a time limit on your open tabs after a while they will just close them for you because most likely you're never going to go back so that's going to help make it so your phone doesn't bog down so silly also they're adding a feature we're basically going to give you the ability to change the options on your notification settings just by long holding a notification that you get and then lastly they're just going to be updating the emojis and giving you more emojis so that wraps it up for Android n but certainly not the end of the day and another thing that they had talked about was this thing called Android in some apps and what Android instant Apps allows you to do is go into applications without actually having to install them so if you wanted to make a purchase and that purchase wanted you to purchase it through the app you're still going to be able to go into the app and you'll be able to purchase that thing through the app without actually having to install the app now this is going to be a really great feature for emerging markets because right now at least the United States you know they're increasing the memory cap and phones so storage is not an issue put in emerging markets where companies are selling cheaper smartphones and memory is still an issue not having to actually install a bunch of apps and just being able to go in and still use the app is a great great thing for these emerging markets from the app you can simply install the app when you're using instant things now it sounds like with Android in stamps you're going to be able to set up your information so if you go to a different app that you don't have installed and you want to buy something you don't have to put in your card information or all your information because android instant app is already going to have all your information and lastly they said that android instant apps will work all the way back to jellybean so if you do have an older phone you can still use application so what's next for virtual reality so it sounds like it's going to be a fall release and it's going to be Android and integrated it's also going to come with a new headset and a new remote now the changes they wanted to go for immersion so it sounded like they are going to be upgrading the technology that causes leg it when you move your head and as the image is loaded so it's more smooth so does it feel like you're looking at your phone or a device you're actually looking out into the world um and then they're going to also try to improve the comforts of the headset itself now the feature inside of the virtual reality headset is called daydream and a daydream is going to be for Android users what they're going to be changing with the VR is that they're going to be increasing the sensors and the graphics and they're going to be trying to get that light and seat down to nothing and your devices are going to be able to let you know if you are daydream ready so it sounds like when you put on your virtual reality headset it's going to bring you into daydream and the daydream is going to have its own google play store just for / to reality apps you're going to have the ability to have TV streaming in your virtual reality headset you're going to have a lot of major networks giving you the ability to a stream TV including Hulu HBO Netflix ESPN and you also have big name developers and independent developers working on games and applications for the headset you also be able to use Street View and view maps and they are completely rebuilding you too but for the new headset and developers currently can start developing applications for the headset with the developers preview so the next topic is going to be Android wearables and this is going to be the last topic that I go too in depth with because the fact that the rest of the information and the new features that were coming out are for developers I'll still go over the last few things but I just wanted to let you know that I wasn't going to go into great detail so Android wear is updating 22 point no platform and they want to make it so you can show any apps information on any of the faces they're also going to make it so if you tap the screen you can get to your other notifications quickly they're introducing smart reply a new keyboard and also handwriting with text recognition it's going to come with Google fit and has automatic fitness tracking which means if you start running and going for a run you have to do anything it'll just automatically understand and sense that you are becoming active and it will start recording and while you're working now or jogging you can launch music there is no longer a need for your phone to be with you while you go out exercising all you need is your watch they're trying to make it so apps can stand alone so the watch can stand alone and if your watch has a cellular signal then you can run your watch off of that and that was basically all the updates for the Android wearables all right so we're moving on to the last two topics and these last two topics are for developers so the first one is called Android studio is it ninety two percent of the apps that you find on google play store were created with android studio they say it's going to be 10 times faster the emulators are giving three times faster you can do test recording build layouts faster it's just going to be easier to use in general just sounds like the whole program is just going to be faster they have a new APK analyzer a new layout inspector and many more features that's android studio and the last topic is firebase it's also another program for developers to help you build your application firebase is built for apps it'll give you analytics it's free and unlimited for iOS and Android notifications Cloud messaging there's crash supporting to help you build a higher quality app you can do remote testing of new configurations and the new firebase is actually available today so if your developer go ahead and check it out so that wraps it up for day one google i/o thank you for joining me and if you like it please give it a subscribe and you'll definitely be seeing more content and i'll see you guys later you
