 all right hey this is Steve wiedemann today we are hanging out with Raffy's how you pronounce it that's correct all right hey I got it right we're gonna be talking about internet marketing digital I'm going to talk a little bit about SEO and some basics and kind of a boot camp SEO in 30 minutes or less specifically around local talk about content and what types of content and templates should place in EU rank foreign search results and rap he's going to talk about some personal branding and how you can build your brand online attract followers and subscribers and we'll kind of go from here so I'm just quickly on my crown I have about 15 years of background in inbound marketing of work for some pretty exciting companies including Disney and ticketmaster and some other really fun brands been consulting for about five years just got done with a week of consulting with the map consulting group and I'm totally burned out so I can tell it my voice but I said we're going to do this so we're going to make it happen I do a lot of consulting for brands that you might be familiar with such as Technicolor and Skechers and indirectly through some of the agencies we support public storage in my Nicky so a lot of multi-location brands that want to rank for various search terms this year we're focusing on trying to help the small business community and we've got this really cool program called SEO roadmap that that we think will add transparency to do the whole SEO industry so we're looking forward to that rafi won't you give us some background yeah yeah it's hard to fumble actually after that kind of a background um I've been doing SEO not for the last 15 years um I started out doing it professionally full-time lasa I guess it's been about three years now but I developer he quickly got into the field start exploring started out with me just with my own website trying to get traffic eventually understood the basics of getting traffic they started start up reaching out some local businesses and offering my services for free and if I can produce results only been i was charging them like if I can get some more traffic to them get shares that kind of stuff I started oh yeah so that I eventually turned into sort of like a digital marketing consultancy I was just working as like a you know independent contractor for a lot of these companies in Memphis Tennessee okay at the same time I had some other ventures I was kind of working on the side as well that we're kind of you know if he in and out have a thing they eventually came out to Los Angeles um and started working full time as a consultant I mostly work with software agencies SAS agencies I work with typically startups a lot of them are struggling to get you know quick growth so I basically present myself as a growth hacker / growth engineer most recently actually partnered up and we start another company together called airplane it's me and a couple of software engineers out of Stanford okay the guy from Harvard with a marketing background these all of us have background in startups basically so it's a pretty good pretty good team with evenly matched skill sets and we're focusing on basically growth engineering as a service so kind of taking the idea of growth hacking and combining it with technical expertise of software engineering and coming up with weight is use technology to essentially automate and growth hack into any business and for that we're mostly working with a lot of the people are venture-backed startups or celebrities we're looking to grow tack their their social media NMR so that's what is growth hacking for those people who have never heard that phrase before mmm yeah so I think that there's a lot of definitions out there for that is but that way I would describe it is being being able to use technology shrewd marketing tactics and things of that nature to essentially go from point A to point Z without having to go through point B inches so traditional way to grow business was you create a business plan you get investors and you start a business and growth a Kia say I've got nothing and I'm going to make this thing happen with the website and some word of mouth and and some inbound marketing and other things right that's that would be grow talking at its most basic form and we then would combine that with using technology to sort of put marketing on steroids and automation as much as you can because we think that marketing at this point we have so much technology at hand a lot of it can be automated to a certain degree here fantastic well hey let's say I was wanted to look uh let's jump into SEO is that work there okay absolutely so and I think you might have a little bit of a time delay now you're on a laptop yeah so you're probably hearing me like two seconds later but hopefully you can you can handle it it happens so so we'll talk about some basics of search for those people who have a specific word that they would like to appear for in a Google result that isn't their name if you're not ranking for your name there's probably something seriously wrong with you you're you're tired online strategy but for a keyword for skechers it might be something like shoe store in Anaheim for public storage it might be self storage or storage facilities or storage units in Anaheim or wherever they have locations so though they'll come to a strategist and say I really need to show up in these places for these keywords what do we do about it and right out the gate for anybody who's who's new to search the first thing we need to do is figure out what needs to be addressed on our website and Google gives you a lot of great tools such as their search console which used to be called webmaster tools you can start there you can start with the google SEO starter guide we created a free site called SEO roadmap org and you can download a list of checklists to start working on your own SEO and basically you perform an obstacle analysis where where can we fix things on our website to make our site more search engine friendly and how can we optimize our content to rank and perform better in search results so one is really thinking about how crawlers access a single version of you know a page of content on your website the other is thinking about how your page performs compared to the competing pages next you kind of want to create a baseline where am i right now compared to the competition so we create a report called a competitive analysis where we basically use some tools like Moz and archive org and web page tests and all these other third-party tools to come up with a baseline of how our website performance is both on our website as well as you know visibility signals we take that and create some columns and say here's where we are day one that way we can down the road create a delta report and see how we've improved then we want to think about some of the other core ranking factors right it's the the basics are you know one is relevancy to what somebody searched too is visibility and how visible is your brand online where search engines can find you off your website and three is how users behave within search results are they clicking on your listing or competitors and are they choosing you and staying on your web page so thinking about those three basic factors when we when we get into creating a strategy first courses looking at how visible we are looking at links so ref you and I were talking before about some of the videos you saw me through out online these cheesy how to's and one of them is how to determine where the best link opportunities are going to be so we like to use tools like a href scom ahrefs calm and there's several others that's just one of them and what we'll do is we'll dump all of our major competitors maybe five to ten of our competitors into that tool and then we'll create a frequency table to see how frequent a particular link is coming from from a certain domain it might be that all of them are getting links from an auto industry directory so that's a great way to think about the Semantic Web and be where our competitors are so that when Google looks a list of businesses and you're not on it you're sort of out in left field but if you're able to get on those lists and on those websites where they're talking about your competition then it puts you in more of a semantic relevancy bubble and that's the goal so we look at that frequency table and say here's where you know nine of ten of your competitors are getting visibility so these might be the best opportunity since so many of your competitors are already there on the location side of business if you're serving a local area thinking about those local directories like an LA directory or LA Chamber of Commerce maybe there's some la bloggers that might you know have a on your topic that you could get them to you know talk about some cool thing that you do or that you're interested in on the industry side we're thinking about links there's going to be industry directories so for some of those multi locations it is specifically storage directories or for a car repair it might be a auto MD or auto directory thinking about that gets us referral traffic as well as hell long-term SEO so we'll think about where those opportunities are list the top ones in that plan put it off to the side and move down to what we need to do with our content so as we're as we're thinking about research and trying to figure out what are the keywords that are really going to drive natural free traffic to my website forever using that same methodology that we didn't a href we use a tool like sem rush or spyfu or then a third party tool will dump in you know 5 to 10 of our competitors or if you're really aggressive but in 20 if you if you have that many a depending on your business niche and then run that same pivot table where are the most frequent keywords what what are the most frequent keywords among the competition and then you know create a column and start theming what those those keywords are and so you look at it a really high level if you haven't done any SEO or search engine optimization at all taking a look and with that column and creating a theme this name might be breaks this theme might be muffler this thing might be exhaust you know breaking those different keywords into themes to help you decide on what content needs to be added on the website with a little bit of sorting and filtering you'll have a nice cluster of specific search terms that serve a user intent you'll sort them by the you know obviously by relevancy and vice by search volume and that top keyword that focus keyword them that competitive keyword will be your focus search term in your title likely used sporadically within your web copy and then you'll use those supportive keywords this sub topics or in the HTML world a subheading or an h2 so that you introduce those those common themes but focus your title and the thing that we know is going to be the most valuable in terms of potential search traffic so from that you basically create a page in whatever project management system or spreadsheet you're using for each keyword theme and then you work through the different SEO attributes for on page for organic I know we're doing on time for organic you know those those themes you know usually just a a video and image the file name of the page itself headings and subheadings and different focus points that we know search engines look at analyze and put into their database to define a page for local it gets a little bit different so we're we're trying to rank and this is kind of an interesting segue into a multi-location if we're trying to rank for a broad search term in a specific city and we have multiple locations we're going to use our city page right so it's going to be locations California Anaheim and we're gonna use that city page to optimize to appear in the organic search results those are the results that are below the little map pack area so that organic page will give you a nice little listing and will say you know ABC auto repair in Anaheim you know with a city page that lists all the locations in turn Anaheim that page will use some of the quirky words that are important to us like auto repair brake repair you know those those search terms that we know generate the most revenue since we already have service pages at the national level that aren't likely to appear in organic search results if you have that city page optimized well the next thing that will think about is a property level so what happens when the user gets that City page and they click down into the actual location at 123 Front Street you know and in whatever city when they get to that page what's that page for that's a show up in the maps that's the page that we're going to submit our business data to to search engine aggregators like axiom and factual and local lease and info USA that's the URL that we're going to submit to directories and maybe even use third-party tools like Rio SEO or yak store-brand if I so that they can submit that information all over the web where it belongs so that Google will find your information frequently and rank your business location your Google my business profile at the top of the maps now you have two placements you have your property page in the maps then you have your organic page in the area below the map area in a search for service and city then we get into some creative stuff so that's your baseline strategy right it'sit's obstacle analysis it's competitive analysis it is you know link opportunities it's keywords and content you know putting all those things into a PM system and in different buckets for the people who are working on them webmaster you can take the text off content writer you can take the content stuff social and outreach you can take the links and let's divide conquer and really start dominating you know with what our search engine goals are but what are some creative things that we can do when our competitors are doing the same thing well that's where linkbait comes in what what can we introduce on our website that's going to draw naturally links and traffic to our site one of the tools that we started using research recently is called answer the public you go to answer the public comm and you pop in your industry keyword very short and clear you're going to get a lot of questions people ask those questions are really interesting but they're not really useful until you put them into a tool like say the google keyword planner and then you do the same exercise you did before when you took sem Russian spy foo information and you start sorting and filtering and organizing by search volume now you're going to be placing how-to articles and y2 and where to that people are going to share and link to and and grow your organic search naturally because you're creating useful linkable organic content measuring is the last most important part of what you're doing in SEO and you know we we like to use conductor as an industry tool to really help us map the categories of keywords we want to rank for so skechers for example break down categories for men's shoes women shoes running shoes kids shoes so that we can track the performance and ranking and traffic for those categories other tools that are available that people discuss a lot online or Raven tools there's the maaz maaz calm mo Zhi calm they've got a whole campaign structure hey Chester mentioned earlier I think they're getting a little bit deeper into campaigns so there's a lot of great tools that you can use to really measure your performance and what you're measuring is of course ranking over time I'm not getting obsessed about being number one but you know obsessing over the content that is going to continue growing in the quantity of keywords our ranks for and you know the amount of traffic it receives over time and that's from end to end is creating an SEO strategy and tracking it using an industry tool and went through a lot of stuff ref any anything you think i mighta mr. that you'd throw out or question you know I don't think it is much you miss I think if anything there's a lot a lot of things you can already might as well have just launched as the definitive guide to local SEO it recorded all that yeah now set some really good stuff right there i think i have a couple of questions i think that maybe the audience might be interested as well is um so I know Google these days is using LSI to figure out you know what your webpages are about how much does keyword density or how many times the keyword appears in your h1 h2 tags new permalink image alt x how much does that really matter to them as much most of those factors are off page now as as the links are becoming less valuable it's the co-occurrence or co-citation of your name on a page that talks about a given subject and and an experimenter and exercise that you can run is work with somebody who has a an older page of content around a specific topic that has a keyword in the title or description so what you could do is get them to mention your brand then maybe link to your brand somewhere in the content or with where they mentioned you and and then watch watch your ranking for that that search term I think you'll notice that you know more people are starting to Lincoln and share and over time you'll see that that ranking move up so it's really about the the external signals now more than about what's on your web page and in an example if you want to kind of prove that is there's em as a page that I think was the oatmeal because the oatmeal created if you do a search for when web design goes to hell or go straight to hell and it's this funny little graphic on one page and yeah there's up there's an HTML title when web web design goes to hell but there's no content on that page no headings no subheadings nothing it's just a big cartoon graphic and yet it ranks for I don't remember how many you know thousands of keywords and it's got thousands of inbound links and thousands of shares and everybody's really engaging with it because it it resonates with people makes them laugh it's useful it's funny so at the end of the day yes you can still use that focus keyword in your title and your support of keywords in your meta descriptions supportive being the semantics that you're talking about the LSI and that's helpful for Google on category categorizing what your web page is about but you're not going to really receive traffic for those at least of their competitive keywords until other websites are mentioning your brand maybe even copying a piece of content from that page like a list or you know a graphic and as that happens is those external signals are happening and people are searching specifically for your page and typing in words that that relate to your page and maybe even the keyword and your brand name because they remember the article they're looking for that keyword and then they use your brand name as those type of user signals happen more and more over time you'll continue to move up so I wouldn't wouldn't obsess so much about the key words on the page itself particularly after hummingbird the hummingbird update where it said hey we're not going to give you a result based on your keyword we're going to give you a result based on what we think your intent is and your intense driven by your location by previous searches that you just performed minutes ago or hours ago or just your historical Google history so many different factors that play in I think it's more important to do what you were talking about earlier and just drink some outreach and getting people to share your content mm-hmm absolutely that makes that makes good sense there's one point I am I remember if you talk much about which is excuse me how much does the age of your domain and the age of your website determine how well you rank for certain keywords you know whether you're doing any sort of SEO work or not I've seen a lot of older websites just rank just because the domain is old there the DA naturally goes up and these pages start start to rank even if they're you know they're not mobile friendly they have horrible content they've got you know spammy backlinks to them some of them have like terrible keyword stuffing you know that he was done how do these pages still ranks oh well it's a great question there's a lot of variables to domain name or domain age itself doesn't matter you could have a domain and you bought it 20 years ago if it's been parked there's no historical information that Google has in its database for key words that were searched where a listing came up it was clicked on goes into their database you know and and is stored as part of their ongoing trust signal the domain itself doesn't matter but if there's been a website on it and Google trusts that that domain has has served a good result to users over a period of time then you're right there's a domain score and that metric isn't visible anymore in this year you're trying to emulate what google pagerank is say with maz tools with maz rank and but PageRank startup stopped updating their toolbar thing years ago so so there really isn't a way to measure what's the domain the actual domain page rank is but you could you could use some of those third-party tools and say and you know make some inferences say ma says this domain has domain authority of you know 50 or whatever and you can start with that and say you know what I think I want to leverage that domain authority to help improve my brand visibility now if you if you create a page on that domain that Google can't crawl to from the root of that domain that carries all of that high authority then it's almost useless and you see a lot of services that sell links on hacked forums on a edu or whatever simply because that edu as a high you know domain authority they think that that that forum link is going to add value but the reality is Google can't crawl to that link from the root of that domain because that route would never linked to it because it's just spam attacked right so if you were to get placement or visibility on a page of content that was as close to the root domain as possible then there's there's some value there particularly if the content is relevant to your industry because now you get referral traffic and you know people are finding that content useful the linking to it they're sharing it now that pages value has much more long-term value to your page then you know just simply you know getting a link from a domain that has a high domain authority I don't that answer your question but that kind of contours what you say yeah yeah so she look at what you what your something it seems like to me died Google is room only ranking pages and not websites so pay attention to the page itself the PageRank the page Authority those kind of metrics rather than looking at just the domain is of your degree remember that the domain Authority still plays in if there's if there's historical value and and that domain is is promoting the content on that domain but if it's not promoting it you're simply getting a link because it's on the domain and no one's really going to see it even a you know Huffington Post that's in some profile page that nobody is sharing you know ultimately it's it's you know thinking about that that triangle that pyramid of you know where the values coming from the root domains awesome but if you know if there's no middle layer and Google's not really finding that content from that middle layer through other links then it's orphaned it's not getting crawled or found it's not linked to from the root so how how do how to search engines then rank that page if they can't get to it from the root or from third party sites so so spammers will go out there and they'll create you know these crazy links all over the internet that also have zero value build link wheels and whatever else to try to get that page to look important than to be crawled by Google thinking that Google is going to calculate the domain authority you know with the quantity of links that are pointing that page off the website and historically that works but you know Google penguin this this whole spam algorithm not only is that as that's you know getting less and less valuable but it can actually come back and hurt you particularly a bat page never gets any traffic or any links or any visibility it was just there created to give you a link over time that links actually going to be a negative value and hurt you so um you know i would i would say focus on on quality focus on pages that you know you're going to get traffic from hmm makes sense that's a great answer Steve it's one what one more question I had actually going back to a previous thing you mentioned directory submissions I know that's still I mean técnicas links would be considered two point oh web two point O type of links now when you're doing directory submissions how do you know which sort of directories should you be submitting to should be local directory should it be directories that are specific to your business should you try to scale this and try to get is there any sort of negative things that can come out of just you submitting your business to let's say I use some service like on Fiverr for example right I'll submit your business 200 directory site what's right exactly so what's that what's the pros and cons of doing something like that sure we used to be really big on the the directories back in 2005-2006 it was yahoo and best of the web and and business com and you know it's 299 399 and and then the demo's fight right we we'd sit there and fight with odm 0 Z editors resource zone forever who hated s killers but we needed that because that at one point it was google's original database of web sites before they started crawling they use dimas so directories unfortunately are embedded into a lot of SEOs brains as fundamental and the reality is for a brand that doesn't serve their local area and have a Google my business account there there really isn't that much value in directories anymore and if you look at third party tools like a similar web or hitwise or compete calm and you look at the traffic going to those directories it's diminishing even Yelp you know this was hit quite a bit last year and some of that had to do with their app but you know directories just aren't aren't really providing the value for national companies that don't have a local presence so that being said for a local business it's critical to get into business directories not to be construed with web directories dmoz and yahoo directory which is gone now best of the web you know those those are those are links from a link directory it's a page of links that share page rank and nobody links to a page a page on dmoz that lists you know a list of lawyers for example there's there's no links to that page except from from the root domain so that root domains value as it diminishes and no one's linking to the directory page itself is just going to die so I would say as a you know looking at being a local business owner focusing on those local directories because some people do use the local directories I use was OC now and orange county register and and pages that list businesses that are local to my area all the time I bookmark some of them it's it's useful it drives traffic and it's geo relevant so that you know Google can help me place you know my listing at the top of you know the map area so i think i think for local businesses industry directories industry directories as well as local directories are going to have the highest impact as it pertains to getting placement in google maps which of course you know results in being in the universal search results in google is there any easy way to find a collection of these local directories or industry specific directories you easily without manually searching for them yeah i use buzz stream quite a bit so i'll run search operators through buzz stream search operators like list of and words maybe even using site operators so that can kind of play around with search queries where i can get different opportunities and then i go through each one and add it there are you could do a list of law directories and you'll find a few they used to be a really good site that had industries but for whatever reason it went down but finding am isn't rocket science don't don't use the Moz list and i hope brand isn't watching this but i was using Moz had a list of industry directories for local search and and what they did is they they did that aggregate exercise i was telling you about before where they showed the frequency of local business directories for a specific area and all it was really doing was showing web directories or your your national business directory like like a Yelp or merchantcircle or whatever and as I mentioned earlier the value of those directories is going down because nobody nobody actually uses them and nobody ever links to them so I would say if you're going to find a list talk with with your peers that serve that niche specifically there's a lot of law firm SEO companies for example so i would i would talk to them and say hey I'm you know I'm doing a study and we're trying to come up with a consolidated list of whatever would you be willing to share that if i give you attribution you know and we're going to market and you're going to get visibility from it and they say no that's secret to us we're not sharing it then pay for it to say great I'll pay for it how much do you want and then you'll get that list from them and you know they then do the same thing with all of those different agencies and then dee doop your list and you'll have this nice little consolidated list we have about 98 law firm directories now you know by the same exercise just for law firms mm-hmm very nice those that was some really good information I feel like my mind is just like got a lot a lot larger as far as on-page and technical SEO is concerned I'll be reporting to the loops I know how this stuff yeah that was really good actually there's a lot lot of this stuff actually where are techniques that I've very actually new to me even I never heard of and if I did hear of it's just very you know a lot of people when they describe some of these things they're very blurry about it not really clear and actionable ways how you can do it you were you're very clear us exactly hawkward obtained these lists how to perform it you know and then even if they can't do it then they'll ask you to do it right that's that's the trick well we we Chris consult so we you know we're kind of at capacity with our consulting business but this roadmap that we have has been great so do it yourself it's got all of videos and stuff and how we do it so we're able to finally clone me which you know I didn't think I'd ever be able to scale but we figured it out no thanks various well I'm glad you gave us your actual time this time not a clone rich so let's talk about ran personal brand so I'm even reinventing myself right now and I'm getting back online I'm I'm not under the radar anymore connecting with my peers on facebook and you know trying to be more social so for someone interested in in their personal brand and using that uh where do you start and how does how does that whole personal branding online work sure so personal branding the way I would define it you know first of all is basically building a brand around yourself right everyone has a personal brand whether you're you know 20 or you're 60 years old there are certain set of actions there's certain persona that you've built up over the years that people have come to learn follow and your store this figure um and this is really important when you're first starting out in business is that you don't really have a sort of like a brand figure yet right you might have started what say uh Steve's uh local SEO business or Rafi's local you know personal branding consultancy but no one really knows about your brand so to initially get started what you want to do is reach out to your friends and family and tell them about your new business and when you're doing that what you're really leveraging is your personal brand the reason you were able to reach out to these people is because you are connected to these people right they know who you are they've kind of seen you in action they trust you and you're selling yourself to these people so people typically understand that concept but what a lot of people business owners tend to ignore in my experience is they don't continue to build that personal brand out further than just their friends and family so what what that means essentially is anyone that's relevant to your business or your industry connect with them right it doesn't take a lot to just you know I there's lots of tools I'll talk them in a second but there-there's tool set up that let you every time you have an interaction with someone don't lose that interaction try to keep some form of future contact with that purse check in with them I'm sorry I check in with them what's normal how's it going what's new exactly exactly add them to some sort of a list whether it's an email list your building maybe you're adding them to your LinkedIn maybe you become facebook friends maybe you guys are you know you have a group on Facebook that you're connecting with a lot of these people on add them to your group whatever you do don't lose a network because networks typically almost always help in some way and typically the most successful businesses this is especially true for like consultant consultants and like a one-man type of businesses the larger their network the better they tend to do in their business um so what I try to focus on is you know with with my clients that I work with and they even for myself it's creating a lot of these huge networks and there's a lot of shrewd techniques that you can use to build out your network let's talk about like some of these specific platforms on let's say you want to build your network on facebook facebook groups are a great way right figuring out groups that have certain basom keywords personally I like to use a tool called um it's actually called ninja blaster okay it's actually have you heard of before no your chant their me with all these blacks are you ok ok so what ninja blaster will do is you can put in different keywords and it'll auto join will request to join lots of Facebook groups for you based on the keyword I can put in a keyword like growth hacking our growth hack for example and request to join every single group on Facebook that has you know growth hack appear in it it'll also let you auto post so if you want to make a post in a certain group either let's say like I publish a new article and now that I'm part of all these groups I just run my software and just auto post to all these groups so it's not spamming because you're actually putting relevant groups and you're sharing relevant content with people educating them now it might come off sometimes and be a little bit like a year kind of pushing your own brand a little bit too much or you're selling yourself and that's fine and if enough people start to complain then you don't post in those subgroups you can filter those groups out but people that are interesting your content which they typically are if they're part of that group you can share that content get yourself out there not only do you do you promote your personal brand you're promoting your website you're getting traffic to your website hey um I see this with chess ice write a lot about chess back in the day so I would join these you know I'm part of like hundreds of top maybe even thousands of groups on Facebook and then I would write an article and i'll blast it out to all the chest groups and i would get like literally like eight thousand visitors to my site that day just from that blast all interested while commenting sharing that kind of stuff so you can replicate this entire strategy on any niche on facebook going back to like you know building the brand out just start joining groups start joining groups start engaging in these groups and start adding those people anyone that ever comments on anything that you post add them they're likely to follow you and so what happens when you run out of room you facebook allows you five thousand friends make another account right get another gmail address and make another account and facebook typically will approve your second account as long as you can you know verify your name so what for me I have multiple facebook announced I have like five or six Facebook accounts that I maintain that are all these large groups you know each group is dedicated towards a particular niche so I'm groups that are just as CEO is that groups you know I have an account that's I'm friends with just um just internet entrepreneurs in general I'm you know I have one from a personal use I have a personal Facebook account so you can start to really build these pays with profiles out and this is also a wait a good way to get traffic to your public figure page have you met right all about once you once once again how do you manage all that virtual assistants you don't need to manage these things you need to use Virtual Assistants to automate a lot of these things so I have people that I all they do is just I post content from my personal account and then they take that account they dictate that content posted all other other social channels that I have you can do some of this stuff with something like HootSuite maybe but there's lots of limits and it doesn't I don't think it lets you share between two personal accounts so you're going to have to use virtual assistants and you can you can hire them for two dollars an hour and they'll do this free every day it's going to cost you like you know like 10 bucks a month to just have all of your content curated to all of your social channels on the web so the idea is that yeah well if you're going to take your time to create content why not get it out get the maximum reach that you can't reach each piece of content which as you know even an S us especially true is that you should spend maybe like starting out twenty thirty percent of your time creating the content and eighty percent of the time should be spent in promoting the content so what we're seeing is that content gets promoted a lot better if you have a large social network or a large following around your brand and some of the best examples in the web you'll see people like Pat Flynn right huge following no matter what Platts gonna Pat creates it gets out there John Chow does a really nice job with this brian dean does a very nice job with backlink oh if you see the comments on some of these posts it's crazy and the funny thing about brian is he's only got like like a hundred posts on his website and from that he's getting all this traffic is he's so good at ranking those posts and getting them out there Neil Patel does an excellent job of personal branding and just creating community around the brand so you can look at these people as examples and just try to emulate what they're doing right their strategies are different or in every platform but it works they have huge followings um that's just kind of the Facebook strategy is there any other printed particular pattern that you want let me get on besides clover might go for some reason if you want to if you want to mute on your zip all you won't have that echo I know thank you my love feedback that's okay we'll keep going ok so I'm so I know this a lot of niche networks real estate has activerain for b2b of course you're going to be in LinkedIn if you're your local and you're trying to promote yourself you know to your local community into your high school friends into your college friends you're definitely going to use facebook i think as the medium that to try to you know build awareness i'm trying to think of if there's any other specific networks i know i know twitter is changing quite a bit and you know they're allowing more characters and their you know questionable about whether they're going to be in five years from now but I'd to the big ones unless you disagree are probably still a twitter linkedin facebook and i think instagram is going crazy and the snapchat thing i mean it they change their business model recently and i see comedians and travel friends that I have that are like hey if you like this stuff you should really see my snapchat you know i I just I looked at it the first time I came out and just never went back to it and I guess I have to reintroduce myself to it and then this periscope and there's this new blab that we're on now and there's all these different mediums for getting in front of people and I would say now how do you find a fine balance between where to to go live and where to publish and and how to share i know there's tools like sprout social and HootSuite and so forth that allow you to distribute your social content which annoys people a little bit unless you change it up a bit since those people follow you across different networks if we posted the same thing Lee never monta the travel guy I follow if he posted the exact same thing on Instagram as he did on facebook I would unfollow one of them because it would just be redundant to me but if he posted something different and he shared and did a longer feature about that particular visit in facebook and the pictures were a little bit more specific and less content then I probably follow both that way I can kind of see the two but how do you how do you decide on one which networks to be in to how to distribute efficiently and you know three what your distribution schedule looks like I know especially with Instagram there's certain times and days that that tend to get more engagement than others right right to figure out the platform it really depends on your business if you have a like a food business you should definitely be on a thing like Instagram and Pinterest if your business is primarily b2b you need to be on linkedin if you're primarily to B to C space need to be unfit very active on Facebook it just comes down to what where your customers are you need to reach them in the medium that they best want to be reached I need to reach them in ways that your competitors are not doing either so for all your competitors are putting all their dollars in facebook ads maybe you can consider YouTube ads right it just depends on what's the best way to reach them um as far as the contents concern sharing on multiple platforms what I what I've seen is that yes you it i can definitely there's a like people could unfollow you if they're seeing the same thing but what what matters is the presentation right how you present your content on twitter is not the same way you present the same post on facebook you can have the same blog post but on twitter maybe you can add change up the feature image right that shows up it's a little different and twitter gives you all sorts of restricted yeah how you can show it anyway on facebook maybe you have a different picture right you have the same thing on instagram maybe you don't post an entire blog but you just post the picture the feature image and then no no links nothing like oh actually instagram doesn't even does it allow you links even i don't think so great we'll put the URL but it won't be an a truck tag right exactly so it that the same content can be presented in different ways as far as how to efficiently do this i'm a huge believer in Virtual Assistants the reason I connect with so many people on the Internet I'm connected to like half of India I feel like sometimes it's because like it's a really good way to you know growth hack your business and automate a lot of things that are really low cost typically i work with virtual assistants at a price of between one and two dollars per hour I mean that's the cheapest you know you can get any when it's like hiring you know like a set of tools right because they'll manually do this stuff for you um so I'm a huge believer in getting virtual assistant do these sort of repetitive type of tasks that you're you know like you're posting somewhere and you don't have a tool that auto posts all these kind of stuff need to change the content up a little bit virtual assistants are amazing for that when when you have that many profiles and that many post what happens on a day where you get a thousand different people asking you questions about it in that Network do you have them answer for you or how does that work I still reply to all questions and things like that on my own Facebook's and Twitter's and said well I don't check my Twitter inbox personally but facebook i do for sure um i don't get hundreds of questions it's not that many typically on average i get maybe ten emails asking me different things about SEO and digital marketing and then i get maybe about 30 40 messages may be on facebook but i spent a lot of time you know i have my facebook fold up and I'm kind of working you know from from home typically the Sun it's not that difficult for me to answer this group like some of these going crazy over here well that's awesome as long as you can manage it that's a high challenge I'm working about 18 hours a day right now so for me being social isn't as much of an option as I'd like it to be but if I were to use someone like a virtual assistant my fear would be that somebody would would comment or say something and the virtual assistant would reply on my behalf and then then it loses its authenticity I suppose the syndication of its fair break the engagement of it should always be authentic right you should not you should not allow them to make comments in a post you should do that yourself the same thing with blogs right when you get blog comments don't let your right our post you know reply to them you should reply yourself because then yeah like you said you lose authentic to building a personal brand so you're starting with one starting with your friends and your family to joining all the social networks setting up groups in facebook creating Twitter lists and Twitter adding really fun probably ego-boosting names and Twitter through Twitter lists so they see hey you've been added to expert or whatever for Google+ so answer so what else and what's the next step you created all this stuff and all these groups all these circles all these lists and you're pushing what's what's next to build your personal brand or just rinse and repeat yeah definitely the first thing you want to start with really before all this stuff is I think I I personally would start with a blog without your blog you don't really have a voice in the web social is great but your blog is where your real voice is so I would create a blog ideally with my personal you know with my actual name as the domain name so I personally have Rafi Chaudhary com from that then you have a place to create content and then you have a reason to share the content on socially because it's your own voice you're just using different microphones to shoot it to different channels I think with blogging is that one of the easiest ways to really build up your brand initially is guest posting right relevant networks because then you have a reason to connect with these people so I'll tell you one of my growth attacks i use on twitter i realize you don't really need to unfollow people you don't need to unfollow anyone really at this way at any point using to keep following more and more relevant people so what I do is I go to AA influential accounts on Twitter let's say your account for example we've got a ton of followers that are very interested in SEO i would first yeah i would first follow all the people that you are following because if steve is following him they've got to be important they cannot be just some random people and i use it i use a Chrome extension called Twitter follower and all a little you will do is just scroll all the way down to the bottom of the list and just press a button and it'll just follow everybody automatically and you do this every day once it you know once a day I mean to twitter has don't exactly what their metrics they use but it's a ratio of how many people follow you back how quickly they follow you the quality that followers all this kind of stuff but on average you should be able to follow you know they stop you after a point but you should be able to follow ton of people every day and what we're seeing is about quarter of those people will follow you back as long as they're relevant people so you don't really need to do a lot of these other things on Twitter just start following people and I grew my Twitter 200 in like 30 thousand followers just using this strategy in the last two years that's the Twitter strategy um on linkedin it's all about following local people and following people in your niche so put in a keyword so I use a keyword like growth engineering or growth hacking and I click second degree and I start adding all those people because linkedin the strategy is that yeah you just don't want people to not accept your request because if you do then linkedin will start to block e I've been blocked before several times in LinkedIn I think it went had 3000 connections like a block when I got to 5000 I got blocked again but I just emailed them back and saying hey I'm trying to network I open networker on linkedin and this is what I du Bois no unblock usually so i got my linkedin to now I think close to 10,000 connections doing the same things as well um so I talked about Facebook and again facebook again is that when you could get blocked on facebook from adding people at some point but in this case I have a simple JavaScript I use with just unfriends or deletes all my friend request with one click so you added like 300 people and a lot of them didn't add you back instead of manually you know canceling your list just use this script and I'll give this D if you guys want to UM you know Julie all your friend requests at once and then start again this way you're too you're doing things that most people in your bin space are not doing they're trying to focus on getting facebook ads to get likes your page well you're just personally connecting with these people and then using a simple JavaScript to invite all your friends to like your pages right you're doing the same thing all organic you're not spending a single dime you're still getting targeted likes to your facebook page at least people didn't start to engage and it's really important as virtual assistants to autumn a lot of stuff because like you said it can get very overwhelming so you train them as to the type of content you want to create and let them poster shoot the content out there and then you reply to your comments and things like that this way you're building up your brand and and you mix that with you would you belong you do that with your personal your personal my personal day they they post um like a lot of it let me not even my personal facebook and like an eighty percent of it I would say it's automated as far as what content i create so i use things like ifttt common if you're moving that website too yeah curate certain content on the web and share it um i do things like um as far as my actual post like i'll put you know i'll put images and quotes those are my all my virtual assistants do that i don't really do a lot of that kind of stuff they'll create the images though you know watermark my logo on it they'll post it and then they'll share in all their other than us the things when the comments come in then I reply if I feel like it needs to reply so the alch you're saying your content you should train someone to the kind of content you want to create and let them do the promotional part of it and then you do the actual engagement part of it where you reply and things like that like that i can imagine where you can take that with thinking about important people if you have that virtual assistant tag the person who wrote the content if it's twitter using you know they're there handle if it's Facebook you know friending them first or liking their page and mentioning my cassie where where they would appreciate it and thank you and follow you back and sort of create an organic experience for social that's pretty cool yeah one of the easiest ways to get of traffic if you just want to create like let's see you get no traffic to blog and you instantly want to create a bunch of attention on your blog what you do is you find some of the top industry leaders and do a curated like a like a listing list type of post top uh entrepreneurs to follow in los angeles right you create this detail post and write a small blurb about them and then reach out to those people and say hey i mentioned into my blog would you like to share because these people have huge followings and instantly you get this surge of traffic to your blog and all of a sudden not people know who you are what you do you go right when I you gotta be careful with that grant Rand Fishkin recently I think it was on Twitter or Facebook or inbound org was calling out someone who is doing an expert roundup like I think maybe the experts in at least in our industry are getting kind of burned of being pitched for roundups you know as link bait I don't know I'm I don't know is is it maybe it's just because it's that industry but if you're looking at at other industries outside of digital maybe it's still active but in my industry I think I think we're all kind of burned out of the you know of being pitched for the expert roundups I don't know it depends I don't know of this in specifics I personally actually haven't done something like that just yet but I've seen that people do this very successfully a friend of mine recently you'll Isis did a post on how Neil Patel grill attacked my SE owed my life right and he promoted this thing so well he's got comments from Neil himself from brian dean from actors and act like that's a wig great way for him to get his name out there when he has absolutely he's had no sort of following anything that he was like a high school student and the next thing you know actors are hiring him and then like some of the top I Internet entrepreneurs a lot around it though that's me that's me interviewing an expert and or or curating from an expert in giving him lots of love I think that's awesome but the whole day I'm doing an expert round up right now and I want your feedback for a top ten list I would just say give give the digital world a break from it for a while and but if it's an auto services or or accounting or something that's probably still viable but in our industry I'm seeing a lot of people joking about how they got hit up for another round up so that's yeah it's different interesting yeah I can see that I've been ran much personally I haven't ran into that as much but you have a lot more experience than probably doing because you've done these before um but yeah that I can definitely see that then yeah in that case I would focus on people maybe that don't get mentioned as much on people that are maybe I would do the outreach first and see if it's okay to talk about them and then only then mention them because you will also get branded traffic because of this like if you can rank yourself or words like brian dean and steve would emit like that I'm getting all that traffic to my site like all of a sudden right you rank yourself for Nike for example you know better than nike then you're gonna get all the nike traffic so so ranking for like you know all right hi search traffic based people if that's another strategy get traffic to your website but yeah you definitely there's there's some I think some ethical issues and in that I think I think the best approach I would say is to reach out to the people first I think that that would be okay and get some sort of a quote from them splash splash OPM i think is their page what facebook page are their website they did something like that recently where they reached out to a bunch of industry experts and they got some really good feedback they asked what what is he definition very prominent bring i know i know it works if someone i respected reach out to me and said hey i'm doing a survey you know danny sullivan or anyone today I'd like your feedback on this particular topic because you know we we know each other in the industry and I respect him I wouldn't even question it but if it was someone I didn't know and I looked at their website and it looked like they were they were trying to sort of a brand hack their way into getting more visibility i don't know i don't know if i would spend as much time on unless it was really authentic but that's awesome right yeah you can't have to build up a relationship with them first which is goes back to again what i was saying earlier is just adding these people to your network engaging with them talking to them hitting them up doing you know webinars and things like this you build a relationship people that's really what it comes down to everything that you do in real life when you go to like a conference you talk to people right you can do the same thing on the internet it's not any different it's just using different channel so do you have a checklist for people that are better really start their personal brand like i like a guide or something they could download i know a lot of people that have asked me the question before like hey i want to get my name out there we do have some stuff for you know how you get your name to appear in a google search result and trying to understand how that whole algorithm works but for somebody who's really destroying up to you know sort of celebrity brand themselves in an industry as an expert do you have like a checklist or something they can download or how do they I mean the process of creating a guide on personal branding which is it's going to come out pretty soon hopefully it might be like i might do actually i'm sure thinking of doing this as a guest post probably on try net blog accepting people for not when it comes out I would totally do that for you as soon as you have it no I'll put a whole paper yeah absolutely absolutely but right now there is a really good guide out there um quick sprout has a really good guide on personal branding I think that answers almost all the questions that you could have on that so for right now you can refer to that that's all I'd rather wait for your thing though you're you're sounds like it's pretty pretty built out so let's let's get yours up and build a whole page around personal branding and try to promote that I'd love that sounds great i'll let you know when that also comes out so i don't know what else is new coming out in the industry right now i know i'm at least in that in the search world there was a big update allegedly a core update that happened a couple weeks ago I think they confirmed it there's no real talk about what it is other than it might have incorporated an occurrence spam filter panda as a core part of the algorithm here what I think's coming in the next next several months and this year I think I think local local SEO I think it's going to be paid I think you're going to see what happened at Google Shopping happen to google maps I think in the organic universal results I'm just you know being presumptive based on what I'm seeing them do with the 3-pack shift last year and I think that's going to happen but I do see a lot more translation be are coming into the pictures people are going to start not using google glass but putting on Villar at home and searching you know with audio and doing more audio searches versus at keyboard searches I don't know I haven't heard a whole lot else about what's what other industry futurists think are going to happen up other than that whole translation now go and maybe a paid search adjustment what about you anything anything new anything that people who watch this down the road can anticipate change yeah what I'm seeing with Google is things are becoming a lot more personalized right everything that they're doing now is just personalized results I think you're going to start to see a lot less of the generic type of results things are going to be based on your location and intent based results and even I think in the near future even blogs has to start have to start doing something like this where you go to a blog or something like that it greets you and say you know hi Rafi here's your list of curated content that we've created for you or like you know like a google homepage or things like that it's gonna be a lot more base around you your interest kind of activities you've done because that's all Google and Facebook is doing they're collecting as much data about their users as positive to compliancy to notice this last year with HTTPS EU is now forcing if your site takes cookies to put a cookie message on so thinking about things that are happening you know other places I envision probably like you do like that you're going to see a lot more migration to https a lot more cookie warnings a lot more notifications I said the site would like to use your location do you approve I think we're gonna see a lot more of the compliancy become standard rather than just you know politeness absolutely I definitely see that coming as well yep because all right now a lot of our data is collected like on the internet you know if you get anything out there on the internet one time how do you get it retracted even right you get something out there that how to get rid of it there's it's just out there forever now I think there is gonna be a lot more regulations that are going to be coming on like yeah how things get shared you know the legalities of it I do see that becoming a bigger and bigger thing in the near future well we've totally got to do this again this was fun and I know there's gonna be a lot of cool stuff going on so anytime something's hot and you want to get on a call and just do this I'll send you link to my calendar feel free just throw yourself on there and let's let's jump on and do a podcast I think it'd be fun um sound screen yeah I really enjoyed it as well you've got some pool but a few people that jumped in and out here thanks for hanging out with us I think a few people just kind of kind of see what was going on will do more of these and we'll I'll definitely make sure I put a link up so that when we do these in the future that we've got a place to send people awesome thanks Omar stop recording and eula we'll go from there
