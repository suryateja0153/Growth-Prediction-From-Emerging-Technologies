 hey it's Tina foresight here I want to talk to you today about the three ways you can pay your team members now to be clear I'm talking about contracted professionals virtual assistants online business managers copywriters web people bookkeepers etc we're not talking specifically about employees today although certainly some of what we share what we talk about in this time today will be it could be applied there as well too but how do you know how to pay your team members there's actually three different ways you can pay the people that work with you number one is hourly number two is a package rate and number three is incentive so what are the differences between these and then how do you know which way works best for you how do you know what's going to make sense for you and the people you're hiring and your type of business and all of that jazz because here's the thing the way that I pay my team is what works for me in them the way that you pay your team may be a little bit different so this isn't really about a one-size-fits-all approach but as sharing and finding what works for you and also knowing what makes sense in different situations so paying somebody by the hour this is by far the most commonly accepted its kind of the default mode for how we pay our team members paying by our is great in the sense that it's very simple somebody works X amount of hours you pay them X amount of dollars per hour for the work that's being done paying by the hour is great whenever there is uncertainty meaning you don't know exactly how long it's going to take to do work you're not always clear on exactly what you need them to do they're jumping in to help with various things and there's kind of just a little bit of open-endedness if you will as to the work that needs to be done and how now hourly can be great it's something I absolutely recommend especially when there's that uncertainty or when you're just starting to work with somebody or you're just trying some things on but part of what becomes a frustration on the hourly work paying somebody by the hour is a couple of things first and foremost if you're paying somebody by the hour then hours need to be tracked and you need to be thinking about hours and so the people that are working for you they need to track their time they need to report in on their time they need to account for their time all of that's very important if you're going to pay some by the hour you need to see and know that likewise though if you're paying somebody by the hour one of the things that can happen is you always have to continually think about and wonder okay how long is it going to take how long is it going to take this person to do this thing I really need help with X but what if it takes too long and I'm not really sure paying by the hour can kind of get in the way sometimes there's also the fact that you know the truth is some people take longer to do work than others and I personally get a little frustrated when I feel like I'm having to pay somebody who's maybe a little slower than someone else and so hourly is great and at the same time there can be some frustrations around hourly now paying somebody package rates in order to pay somebody a package rate there has to be certainty in place so with hourly you don't need certainty you're just paying by the hour for the work that's being done if you're going to pay somebody a package rate a package rate is always based on a very clear deliverable and set of expectations so you might hire somebody to help you with a website and they're going to give you this kind of site with these pages and these features and boom badoom boom badoom very very clear you might hire somebody to do a marketing project for you you might hire somebody to do your bookkeeping or to do copywriting to pay somebody a package rate requires that there's absolute clarity and certainty now the beauty of a package rate is you know exactly what you're paying it doesn't matter how long it takes them to do the work you kind of don't have to care how long it takes them to do the work likewise on there and serving you they don't really need to worry about or get too concerned with the amount of time it takes to get the work done all that you care about is your going to get X for the amount of money that you're paying and so package rates a really really beautiful alternative to hourly when there is certainty in place now there can be certainty as well with longer-term team members so say for example you have a virtual assistant who serves your business in the beginning maybe you were paying them out early because there was uncertainty and getting to figure out what they're doing for you and there in the business and you're kind of growing and changing things at a certain stage in your business growth if there's certainty in place that's where you can look at something like a packager or more of a retainer base scenario in order to work with that person now a retainer can be based on hours usually more so than a flat-rate package rate but if you're really clear on okay this person is doing X every day week month etc it's part of their role it's very consistent and solid than package rates can come into play now last but not least is paying somebody an incentive now this is one that it works for some people and it doesn't work for others I personally am a huge fan of playing by paying incentives but incentive requires a little bit of risk on both sides of the coin this is where and how some people sort of resist the idea of incentive what does it mean to pay somebody on incentive so again how early is about paying people for time package rates are both paying for specific deliverables incentive is about paying for results incentive is about working together collaboratively it's about coming together this way as opposed to this way if that makes sense an incentive really comes into play with those deeper longer term relationships it requires a level of trust it requires a level of leadership on your part it requires a level of being really ready really ready to take that on so what can incentive look like just to give you an example in our online business manager community when we train and certify people to become OPM's and this is what I did for years myself too when I worked as an online business manager I hated tracking time I hated you know having it's almost like time would get in the way you know things just needed to get done I didn't want to have to stop and think and go oh my gosh can we get this done where are we at with their hours for the month I'm not really sure I need to account for all of this and then you're thinking where is this person add and can we get these things done or not and what's going on here with certain roles and with certain types of projects hang by the hour can simply become more of a burden than it is a benefit and so incentive comes into play with those higher end longer term relationships you may bring somebody on board is an online business manager and instead of paying them by the hour for the work that they're doing you might start working out early together just until you get to know each other and really see what's going on but instead of continuing to pay them by the hour what you might do instead is decide on a base a flat rate that they're always going to get paid you know month in a month out and then pay an incentive based on the growth of the company pay an incentive based on the results that they helped to create and so that might mean let's say your business is making 20 thousand a month on average they might get paid a base of say 2000 as an online business manager to help manage and run your business and then anything above and beyond twenty-five thousand a month in revenue they can get paid an incentive or a percentage based on that now who would you pay incentive to and why why would you pay that incentive I want to be really clear to incentive is not Commission Commission is where a sales person or a referral partner helps bring you a new client that's where you pay somebody a commission incentive is a little bit different because when somebody is being paid incentive they are taking a risk as well if you have an online business manager plug into your business it's not their job to own get clients that's your job and are other people on the team whose role it is to do the sales and marketing their job is to help manage the business their job is to take care of everything behind the scenes and make sure things run smoothly make sure that clients are having a great experience as i like to say part of their role is to really help you keep the money that you make it's one thing to bring clients in and to make sales it's another thing to make sure they're taken care of and they get everything they need and they have a great experience that's a huge part of where an online business manager serves they are also there to help take the weight of running the business off your shoulders when you're freed up to continue to grow and expand then you get to continue to grow and expand and they get to take care of all of the rest so incentive is asking someone to work with you this way it's saying to somebody you know what we're going to work together on this you're taking care of your part I'm taking care of my part together we get to grow this business and as the business grows that's where they get paid more it's them being able to say to you you know what at a certain point it doesn't make sense for me to keep charging you hourly as your online business manager because there's just there's so much going on and there's a lot of work to be done right now that may not pay off until down the road helping with launches and projects and creating new things and so on that can require a ton of energy and effort upfront and when you're paying out early for that all the time you're paying out all a little bunch of money upfront and then not getting the return until later I'm likewise to there's something to be said for just letting people enjoy the journey with you I think that when we have somebody on our team when we have people come together to work with us this way that you really do get to do it together you know the people that work with me on my team I have some people who are paid incentive you know my business manager Tiffany who of course is our vp of everything as we like to say at this stage in the game she has been on incentive since the second month we started working together so for six years now she's had a base plus incentive arrangement with me and she will continue to get paid more as the business continues to grow and so on and you know what I am beyond happy to pay her more as the business continues to grow because heaven forbid I had to do all that work myself are you kidding me if I had to take care of all that back end stuff of my business there's just no way we would be growing period right it just wouldn't have happened at all not only that though I love to be able to work together with somebody you know there's other members of my team who have different types of incentive in place some of them have a percentage some of them get paid a bonus based on reaching certain goals incentive take on different forms but it brings this space together where it's like you know what two are going to create this growth we're going to create the success together and as we as a business reach certain milestones then everybody gets to reap the rewards so to speak everybody gets to share in that success it's not just me paying somebody by the hour to do work it's not there's something so there's something really deeper in that and that's where I say some people like incentive some don't it requires a risk on both sides you're taking a bit of a risk to pay an incentive to somebody you know as a default it can be really easy to say like why would I want to pay a percentage of my company of somebody why would I want to pay somebody more as the business grows it depends on how you see and value that person it depends on you really knowing and understanding and feeling the value that they bring to the table for you to really know and understand how that's going to free you up to do more in some way shape or form likewise it's a risk on their part they're getting paid a flat rate every month if the business doesn't grow they don't get paid more and they might be putting a lot more time and energy into things than you even realize but for the right person who's looking at incentive they're willing to take that risk with you they're willing to be with you in that journey so again hourly that's the simplest method it's kind of like if you're ever in doubt just start with our lease start there you can change it down the road with certain relationships and scenarios but start with hourly it's the simplest way to get started package requires that there's a clear deliverable there's crystal clear here's what you're getting exactly in this project or each month or whatever it is that's when you can go into package rates that's when you can kind of like flat rate stuff and keep it really simple that way takes hourly out of the equation you don't have to be thinking about time how long is it taking blah blah blah all the time and or incentive as a final option for people who are key players in the team for people like online business managers or maybe they're helping you with launches they're helping you with marketing and different things too they're playing a role in the business that you simply could not live without those are the people that wear the peace comes into play and becomes very important so food for thought here I hope you found this helpful I would love to hear any questions or comments that come up for you around how to pay your team how to pay your contractors and freelancers and so on likewise I would love to hear what's worked for you in the past where there are times that you've paid somebody a certain way and it did or didn't work out really well just go
