 my name is sue and i'm a personal assistant from Darby the lady i work with as Martin she has a condition called Frederick's ataxia which also gives her diabetes she does need a lot of help with personal care and notice general housework we do have another side to the job where we go out we try to go out as much as we can we go to bingo we go to concert out for lunch to the book we go to the farm and feed chickens have a cup of coffee out there basically everything the woman of her age would want to do training qualifications I have under my belt so far but an NVQ to in health and social care I've got handling medication first aid in my previous employment I was a support workers for people with learning difficulties and mental health problems so when I came here for induction it was more about martyrs needs than actual learning about the job since I've been here the only qualification i have done is moved in handling because that was geared toward Marta's needs used to find that really difficult so it's best a bit of time getting in and out the car and clamping in and saw say that we have to make sure we've got that right the best bits are not only having a job but having a friend working on a one-to-one with somebody you get to know that person really well whereas similar aid we enjoy the same social things and I think it's important to work with somebody on a one-to-one that you do get on well with if you were thinking to becoming a personal assistant I would really recommend it it's really the best job I've ever had I don't feel like an employee per se I feel like a caring friend who is enabling my friend to do more with her life than she would to do if I wasn't here you
