 so my name is Cathy pearl I'm director of user experience at sense Lee sense Lee as a start-up here in San Francisco and we have our virtual assistant is a nurse named Molly or Holly or Olivia depending on where you live because we found people really seem to care about what their avatar is named and we're focused mainly in the healthcare space helping patients with chronic health conditions my background let's say so I've been in the speech business since 1999 doing I started out with doing I be ours the ones as Tim total mentioned everybody hated so that was a fun career for a while and just doing other stuff in the boys space and my backgrounds in cognitive science and computer science so my name is Anton gobble my backgrounds also many years that nuance with Kathy so this is a very contentious panel we can tell before that I was doing more speech really the language related rd with emotion detection and automatic language identification and things like that and then I left nuance and I went to Amazon for a little bit and worked on echo and the phone and then I got recruited to my current company which is called 22 waters and we are also obviously in the health virtual assistant space we started out by focusing on the acute side and the very first thing we did was a colonoscopy app which if you know anything about colonoscopy you know that's a fun time and if you don't have something to look forward to and the thing about colonoscopy is that the preparation so it's usually in this country at least as different other countries here we hit fifth we need 50 the doctor tends to say okay it's time for one but there's a lot of preparation including it to change with how you eat you know don't eat any nuts certain number of days before things like that and people are just you know freaked out right and they don't want to do it and they kind of mess up the instructions and then they show up to the appointment and they may not be prepared and they might be sent home and that to come back later and so obviously there's this thing about losing you know money and time and so on so that was the first thing and now we're also in the chronic space but our assistant we basically have a platform that allows us to create very quickly based on the clinicians instructions a virtual assistant that has the same content but presented in a multi mobile fashion so that we have speech out and we have you know QA that person can ask you know their own words questions about the procedure and so on thank you for that introduction I can tell you're both bringing it really fascinating perspective to this space and I just just just to start an exciting that the potential teams seem staggering what kind of changes do you think that widespread use of virtual assistants in healthcare could bring and how soon might we start to see some of these chips so I guess I'll start so i would say james for the second part we're already doing it so we have for example some patients in a chronic heart failure program and they use it on a daily basis every day they use our avatar they talked to her she asked them to do take their weight with a bluetooth-enabled scale the blood pressure cuff asked if your questions this information is then transmitted back to their clinician and if there's an alarm like they gained weight very rapidly which is a bad sign when you have chronic heart failure the clinicians are alerted right away and they know that that particular patient needs a phone call or an intervention and I think the real way that this is going to revolutionize healthcare is that we have shown research has shown that people who get more attentive care especially when they have chronic conditions have better health outcomes we do not have enough nurses and doctors to call someone every day or visit them every day and essentially is not interested in replacing doctors and nurses we are interested in making tools to assist them and making patients outcomes better so if they can interact with a virtual assistant it gets them to do these things that are important for their medical lives that a doctor a nurse they just will have time to do and that's going to be a great fit I think to fill this gap that we have in the medical field I totally agree the other thing also that we find is around engagement is we can actually tell from based on how much people are engaging with the app we can predict how likely they are to be a no-show for their actual appointment which is obvious something that's of interest to their providers and but yes to be able to actually engage the user to allow them to take some amount of responsibility and ability to actually answer their questions easily and whenever they have them and we also do not try to take the place of the doctor instead we are very clear that you know the the content is all based on the clinicians stuff they have to sign off on it and it's also helpful for the user to know that hey this is something that my doctors actually saying this is good stuff what are some of the roadblocks that we might hit as this technology becomes more mainstream both both technical hurdles and and otherwise i would say a lot of the hurdles we've run into or not so much about our avatar or the users being able to talk to the avatar that's actually gone pretty smoothly our problems are more around because we're in the medical industry and you let's say you want to work with a hospital or clinic and they're very interested in your product but the process to get it approved and in the hands of the patients is very slow even if they're eager to do it and even if they approve it then it's like getting that set of patients for example with chronic heart failure these patients are generally older a lot of them don't have smartphones it may be harder to build up the number of patients you need in order to make the program effective another technological issue that's again not around the avatar or our technology but around integration medical devices we integrate with Bluetooth devices which if any of you have tried to pair your phone with your car or other Bluetooth things it can be very frustrating and imagine you're 82 years old and I was talking to a patient last week and he got a new phone and his appt didn't work anymore and I had to walk him through over the phone you know this is how you pair your blue cart and Bluetooth blood pressure cuff and things like that so there's going to be a little bit more of a learning curve for some of those patients but one thing i want to emphasize is don't give up on those patients a lot of people might say oh they're too old they can't use smartphone they can't use the blood the blood pressure cuff no they might need a little bit more time to get comfortable with the technology but they will do it and we should not just dismiss that patient population because it can be very successful for them this is a real key thing what you just said you know we really both really find that this is something we would like to you know get across to everybody especially I mean it's a basic thing of know your user and build bought your building for the actual population you're trying to reach right so like I said we call na city suffered since that's something that it's mainly older users we immediately have the same well what should the app look like and of course we have made it is multimodal but it's very important to have text that's not like skinny grey font right but have something that people can read and talk at a level with using words that are appropriate for whatever the audiences because also mean if you're if you're stressed out because you're sick or because you haven't eaten for a day you're not going to relate to the material very well so you wanna make sure that you're actually you know speaking to the user in a way that they can comprehend but yeah don't give up on older years because older users are that's you in the future and older users are very smart and very very much willing to help you if you're willing to listen at them yeah health crises can be you know some of the most vulnerable experiences in an individual's life and I'm curious to know how virtual assistants can gain the necessary level of trust to be able to help people through these experiences I think it's a really good question and we're finding that already our patients are building trust in our avatar they tell Molly very personal things they might tell them tell her that they're stressed out because their mom is in the hospital or I'm worried about a procedure they also tell her you know I was thinking about the the presentation yesterday with Dennis talking about the messaging the scheduling app and people saying thank you aiming all the stuff our patients do the same thing they when they miss their check-in they apologized to her they say oh I'm sorry Molly I miss my check-in this weekend or have a nice weekend or it's time to go to church or I mean they tell her all kinds of things and the reason that I'm excited about that I mean it's kind of neat but the reason I'm excited is because to me that means engagement they're engaged with her they trust her and this trust and engagement means better compliance better compliance means better health outcomes yeah and the two actually have something where the doctor says or their medical provider says this is something that I think is a good thing use this then itself builds trust right away right but like what Kathy was saying the kinds of quotes that we get from the users is great I mean it's like to actually hear this directly from people and just in post interviews and things like that too not just automatically in the virtual assistant but you know some of the quotes that I pulled out some things like it's like having a little procedure buddy it reduced my anxiety level it feels like a bit of human contact things like that or one of my favorites here is the I was just at safeway stocking up on clear juices because you have to drink clear juices for colonoscopy I thought briefly about how vodka is clear and would go well with a prep but sadly the app said I was not advised so I just imagine they're standing there in front of the liquor section and asking the question is it okay to drink vodka today and the app saying no he can't do that yeah and to add on to that and in patient interviews after the fact I always ask my patients you know it takes a little while to do your daily check-in when you talk to Molly and she go she guide you through the whole thing would you rather just have a nap in front of you where you could just push buttons it would do the same stuff it would take your blood pressure would take your weight but it'd be faster and they all say no that would be boring I don't want to do that and just think these people are asked to do this you know for 90 days every day over and over it's boring nobody wants to do this but they're doing it in fact they're only required to do it for 90 days after the 90 days have ended our patients keep going they don't have to but they voluntarily are doing this one patient told me it feels like someone is holding my hand it feels like somebody is watching over me they know it's a virtual assistant we're not fooling them but they still find it very comforting that's wonderful and these applications of course can take many forms I've been dabbling with lark a messaging app that you know monitors an activity level and diet I'm curious to know what role you think avatars in particular have to play sure so the avatar for us is kind of at the forefront of what we do we have an avatar we use text-to-speech as our output and there's been research at USC that shows that when people are asked a bunch of questions if it's an avatar versus a still picture or like a list of questions they're willing to answer more questions when they talk to an avatar they're also often willing to be a little more personal or honest with an avatar so that's kind of the foundation of what we're doing and what one thing I find interesting is that the Avatar doesn't necessarily have to be extremely complex to build trust and engagement people will still engage with with your with an avatar that's not like super intelligent they'll still want to engage I think the moving avatar is a really interesting space for those exact reasons we haven't used that so much so far we are we have different photographic images when we do need a nurse but then we have and we don't use TTS we actually have reported speech to go with it and you know people are still very happy with that I think one thing I would be concerned about what avatars is just what do we do when there's no connection or something if it's actually something that is running up in the cloud but and also if you have an avatar I think it's important to have some amount of choice right because it's kind of more of a bimodal thing right where some people might love it some people here just like in the old in our old ivr days right if you get if you do a set of voice prompts for the ivr and have a talent it's very you know peculiar in some way very like strong persona some people are really unloved it and some people are not hated right if you go more vanilla then more people will put up with it but then they need you know love or hate it right so I think something that probably come up with avatars to write that you might want to have some level of choice I think I want you know male or female or whatever yeah so always that always a fine line I'm arriving at a design that works for everyone and we know one question of course that's always top of mind in artificial intelligence is is is what this means for humans and I'm curious to know how you envision these virtual assistants working with them health care professionals yeah for us it's part of our key model which is this is a team so we've got the patient at home doing their remote monitoring and it allows the clinician to not have to call all 500 of their patients or only see them every you know so many months to see how they're doing now the clinician can be more focused because the system the virtual assistant is telling them these are the patients who are having trouble right now this is where you need to make your interventions and those patients are going to benefit so we see it very much as a team effort and one other thing I've been thinking about recently as I was talking to doing some research on people with Parkinson's and I was speaking to some people who were the caregivers often the spouses of someone with Parkinson's and originally we were thinking what can we do with this app oh it can be like a whole whelp of medical knowledge about how to manage Parkinson's but I really realized after talking to these caregivers that their most frustrating moments were around a lot of interactions with their spouse where there's they had to be the bad guy and keep telling take your pills do this or the they would get frustrated because the person with Parkinson's might have memory issues and be telling the same story over and over again asking the same question I'm thinking if the virtual assistant can offload that thing virtual assistant doesn't care if they tell you ten times to take your pills because they don't care if you get mad at them you can ask the virtual assistant that question 10 times offload that to the virtual assistant what's going to happen to the caregiver they're not good they're going to have more energy they're not going to be so fed up with the daily maintenance that they're going to be able to sit down and have a real human to human connection with their spouse or whatever because they're not fatigued by these other things so I'm not sure I'm saying let the virtual assistant do some of that other work let the human get to have that human to human connection yeah i think more freedom both were the patients you know the end users or whatever and the caregiver both that's key this reminded me actually of something else that i heard in a post interview where the woman who was using this rakossa vegan was actually saying that oh this made a lot of like reading through this you know multi-page small print thing I tried to find the answer but actually sit there with the app with my spouse and go through it together then it was easier to sort of show what was going to happen it was kind of this joint effort there wasn't just me going off in the corner and doing this by myself but actually it was kind of like bringing together you know people and not be and again like not being like I'm not making this up look she's saying it yeah I'm sure it won't be look long before we hear stories of virtual assistant saving marriages and I'm curious to know and what role does an LP play in all this as you try to build assistance that can connect deeply with with their users I was reading an interesting article the other day and wired by Clive Thompson where he was talking about a lot of what we think about making a conversational assistant we think it has to have so much knowledge so much deep learning in order to actually have a real intelligent conversation but he was looking at the version of Cortana in China forget what it's called it's text-based and those have very long turn taking things people are on average talking like 23 back and forth switch for a chat bot is a very long time and he thinks the key there was actually there was a lot more chitchat you know when you go into a restaurant you sit down you don't just say I want this food the waiter says how are you doing today and you have a little back and forth you establish something so this these chat BOTS have these more chatty kind of personalities and that's not like super NLP or super intelligence it doesn't it require some of course but you can get a long way with some of these basic models I don't think we should just throw up our hands and say it's too hard we're not there yet we can still build a lot of engagement with the tools we have known holy I think if you want to actually if you want to understand what somebody needs you obviously under need to understand what they're asking for and so it's a question of having the content base and the ability to actually understand they'll take what this kind of scattered sentences that they come up with which is not going to be Wall Street Journal quality right if they're asking a question and understand what the what's underneath it and you know we do make a lot of use of speech and parsing a various ways in our in our apps and like I mentioned you can do something like it just ask a question oh it's a still okay to eat peanut butter right then you're going to have a different answer one day versus another maybe you can also say well can I peanut butter tomorrow and you know better understand that you're talking about tomorrow and not today right and so those are just kind of simple questions and so we have also whole you know ontology structure around you know the kinds of foods people might ask about things like that so there's a lot of back and forth like that that and really comes down to really understanding him trying to get a sense of what does this person really asking for or if it's a question of how are you doing today which is you know something we'll both do also what are they actually saying when they say you know my feet hurt I'm really fascinated by how and personality plays into all this and I spoke with the creator of one medical avatar who has the Avatar actually speak in a British accent to a marriage news there is some sort of finding that people are less critical of a virtual assistant that you know doesn't speak like they do and I'm just curious to know in New York you know in your you know early experiences with patients if there have been any qualities that that people seem to prefer and they're in their virtual assistant it's interesting and we have a british version of ours but that's in britain so we haven't tried the British in America I think the qualities consistency was one thing that was we talked about yesterday in terms of putting trust in personality so we make sure our avatars very consistent she doesn't do strange surprising things otherwise I think it's important to have empathy and also you have to be careful with the empathy but I notice for example we had a patient after they weigh themselves if they haven't gained weight the Avatar says you know nice job and I was talking to the spouse and the staff was like oh it says the silly thing nice job but she said but my husband really likes it so you know you had you don't want to cross over to the line where you sound patronizing or fake but at the same time don't shy away from it completely don't always have IV our customers and say you can't say I'm sorry it's a computer the computer's not sorry but it's a discourse Margaret's what's what with how we communicate that's the model we're used to so you have to find the right balance but it's important to have that be part of the personality yeah I we have your one like I mentioned we have one voice in one koto although the photos same person different angles and things like that but since we're not using TTS we have more control obviously about the emotional delivery of the voice right so she's very good about actually delivering something that's you know not over the top but really conveys concern when appropriate or you know great job and that's appropriate and so far all the feedback has been oh yeah they really like this and you know she's really nice when she wakes me up in the middle of night it was you know she's very polite about it
