 you everybody chris here and welcome back to the fifth and the final video clip in this series specifically for readers of the virtual freedom book thank you very very much for sticking with me hopefully my those are British tones haven't put you to sleep but I do appreciate that appreciate you sticking with me so in the last video we talked about the importance of not assuming when it comes to training and working with your VA's and really you know spending time on the training aspect we discussed the VA training trifecta which is featured in the book a little bit and broke that down a little bit more and then we also talked about the importance of you know really placing a very high level of commitment on communication with your virtual assistants and really how that helps you manage them day-to-day and keep them motivated and all that sort of stuff so in this final video what I want to do is really give you the bigger picture view here as to what's possible with a real team of VA's in place for you now most people were usually when it comes to building their team of EA's up from the ground from literally from nowhere up they're going to start with their gva or that general virtual assistant throughout the course of the first year maybe 18 months or so of working with that gva they're going to discover the power of outsourcing and what it can genuinely bring them in regards to building and ultimately running the business at an arm's length whilst they go out about and do other things whether it be travel or spending more time with their you know their family or building more businesses or whatever the case may be right so that chi VA is a really important role and those additional team members will float around them so we're talking about the other types of VA's that we discuss in the book here right so we have the graphic designer we have the web developer we have the SEO or the web marketing VA we have video and audio editors we have mobile app developers these are all the different types of virtual workers that are quite frankly right out there right now at your disposal ready and waiting to be hired and utilized from an entrepreneurial growth perspective but here's the thing after you've hired two or three extra virtual workers and brought them on to your team what's going to happen well you're going to start to become a manager of people and not somebody who's running a business so I would say around the three to four hire that the three or rather the third or the fourth higher it's such a great idea to be able to them really look at your GV a they've probably been with you for a year year and a half or so by this point and look at them as a potential project manager VA quite frankly the manager of your virtual team and what happens is when they get promoted and they go into that role you no longer have to work with the individual additional members in your team you just go back to working with that gva who's now your project manager and they go ahead and work with the individual and the additional members of your team and that makes you go from that manager of people right the way back to running and growing your business again we're just working with one individual person rather than a whole collection of people now I'm not saying that it's a bad thing for you to work with these individual people if you feel the absolute necessity to do so but based on my experience and the experience of a lot of my coaching clients and many many other people that I've come into contact with this is the way to go you bring in somebody you put them in charge you work with that person and they then go ahead and work with the rest of the team for you and that is how you leverage the power of outsourcing properly and that is exactly what i did in late 2010 when I achieve that goal to become a virtual CEO I had all but pretty much all but everything had been removed in terms of what I was doing in a day-to-day basis in my business I had a team of management people that were in very very specific areas and strategic areas of my business from operations the training to IT the marketing the biz dev recruitment you name it these were all things that I was doing right up until the end of two thousand nine when my own superhero syndrome made me hit a brick wall and I experienced burnout once I built that team up and I did it in a strategic way my life became not only are less stressful but also a lot more enjoyable and as you all know from reading the book my business has grown you know three fold in terms of revenue it's doubled in size and I live now a very very happy less stress in used lifestyle both with my family my business and my friend and everything and anything around me so look that wraps up this video series I just want to say thank you one more time from the bottom of my heart for a for buying my book this was a long time coming for me and when I when I got the book deal I knew that it was my chance to make it a little bit of a dent in the universe and hopefully try and change a few mindsets along the way in regards to how entrepreneurs were physically working on and in their businesses and how to potentially maybe become you know slightly more happier people in the process it's my mission to help you try and fall in love with your business all over again remember when you first started your business that feeling you had going to work every day it's my mission to help you feel that again and I'm a big believer that you can do it through working with virtual stuff so
