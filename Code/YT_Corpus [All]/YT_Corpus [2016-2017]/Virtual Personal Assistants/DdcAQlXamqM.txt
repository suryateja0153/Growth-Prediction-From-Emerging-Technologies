own digital and web consulting things like SEO link building follow building advertising facebook marketing and a variety of other areas for some great expertise in that he also builds his own online courses in the marketing area so not only are getting courses but building forces around marketing SEO and link building and excited today to talk to ryan stewart from web risk if you want to learn more about ryan you can find out about its Facebook page facebook.com slash hello web Rah's web versus w eb r is just like its own so welcome Ryan reading outta here excited to learn from you and and see how your building and marketing your online courses and it's more information those from the files you're using through Facebook and various yeah portray admin area Greg great welcome so I get started I mean your your your background is you've done stuff in extension and it will dive right into the core stuff but just curious so you actually started at the big consulting forms doing digital marketing yeah I was not how did you make that kind of transition to the self-employed and doing your own consultancy and webos yeah i got i graduated undergrad in 2009 and got very fortunate to get a job with etc right out of college when the economy was really bad and i was doing a lot of big implementations mostly analytics and eventually started pushing in a digital marketing with an accenture but um you know I'm not even really the entrepreneurial type you know if this was 20 years ago I would be on the fast track so you know corporate corporate life but you know I i just started looking around me and realizing how many tools were available and how many opportunities were there for even non entrepreneurial introverts how much like myself who are doers for the for the most part just so many opportunities so I just started kind of pushing off from my own and building content online and people were finding me and hitting me up for consulting still eventually got into consulting I still do consulting contracting I now have an agency just due to the full demand of too many people come to me for consulting so weber's is a full-service digital agency and that I eventually started we'll just launched my first online course i never thought i would i would just because I'd been burned by so many people in the past when it comes to internet marketing products but you know I figured it was the best way to scrape the market you know I was doing one-on-one consulting with people i was doing agency services to people but i was so leaving like you know eighty percent the market of people that were coming to my sites that were just looking for advanced information and help so i built this course and it's it's been going really well now you know i'm hitting all three parts of the market and really able to monetize all aspects of traffic come to the site so it's pretty exciting stuff next one yeah that's interesting you say that cuz i do see a lot of people who are speaking recently with a guy named David Meerman Scott who does news jacking and he said he came and he had the really expensive speaker to her going um and he had a low entry point price point for his book you know twenty thirty dollars but yeah nothing any renderman also was twenty dollars or you know thirty thousand plus dome so getting those horses really got that middle ground as he said it picks up that eighty percent that are looking for zone go ground so that and you can always net leverage them up to coaching or clients or other thing but that's great seer taken managers out there yeah it's I didn't realize how big tomorrow you know you hear all these stats and stuff and you hear about success with people having when they're building or online courses but you always kind of say yourself like I could I couldn't do that you know it's not really what I do and the success in the last month of launching this course just to kind of my own personal circle and people that have been you know following my blog and stuff like that has been tremendous and it's something that I'm it's going so well you know I could do full-time so it's exciting it's cool it's definitely a good way to monetize you know that traffic that comes to your site that's not obviously you know five figures a month retainers so there's a huge market for it it's really crazy so what are the mean that's that's great that you actually made the transition recently and I didn't realize it was that recent that you did the lot yeah that's and you're seeing some great results that's excellent what you know if there's some further for people who are just getting into this what would be some of the big wins that you would say focus on from a marketing perspective and yes yeah I mean number one it's about the product I mean what you create has to be valuable I can't leave the stress that enough because honestly and this is not just online courses anything really but specifically with online courses because there's so much kind of garbage out there you know specifically internet marketing courses mostly are just teaching you how to sell stuff online it's kind of ironic actually we focus on building a product and in the course that I'm selling its specific to link outreach and it really solves a problem that marketers has with simply SEOs anybody in the SEO industry knows that link building has always been tough and just how difficult and stringent the algorithms gotten with the quality of links that you need there wasn't really a solution out there for agencies so I even niche down you know I built something of value but I niche down I'm focusing on kind of that individual entrepreneur people that want to be able to scale link building across multiple clients there was nothing out there for that and there was not even on blogs and stuff so I just kind of started with a hole in the market right and it was something that I was doing internally and then I just listened to feedback from people to once I built the original course I gave it to a few people and I asked them for feedback and I can't really stress that enough I mean I literally gave to people i said hey looking i'll even pay you to take this and give me your feedback and don't hold back because you know i need this city good and people did and you know what i did i started reformulating and actually went back and rebuilt the course based on the feedback and focused it on process so i mean what i learned from this to that you can go to empty blog even with a mazda calm and learn everything you need to know about SEO tactics but what it doesn't have is the process when i started looking at a lot of what people were having success with with courses they were talking about process they weren't specifically calling out but it was a process but they were saying you know this is the process this is a system because information is free now I mean you can go to youtube and learn you know get an MBA but you can't get the process for how to execute it so I focus my course on being step-by-step process driven building a system internally and then really being able to take that training and pass it off to people that you know staff virtual assistants whatever to be very siloed very organized and just taking information from the web you know how to guest post how to do link roundup Saturday resource page broken link building and putting a process to that and step-by-step very highly organized videos and that's ultimately why it's successful then the marketing that I'm doing on top of it which I'm happy to talk about as well but ultimately I mean focus on focus on the need in the market and you know who it's going to benefit and really blow that out to to an extreme because the best marketing is people who have taken it that are willing to get on camera and say this is amazing I learned from it it's the best marketing you can add honestly so excellent that's great any actor you agree more on the step by step that's great hear you say that because I do think it's very very different the online learning space then say someone going to a university and taking a degree in a job or getting again a job they're totally content to take biology 101 and just learn about biology whereas when you're going online but I think people do have that expectation of I'm going to have an outcome and you're going to show me the steps to get there so it's good to see that you're doing that you mentioned the videos of getting video are you actually getting some testimonial videos of people ensuring that we are today yeah I wonder what a look I put them on the landing page what I did again I did like a kind of soft launch for people i have a good email list and i've got a facebook group to what about 5,000 marketers in there now and there's some people that I've connected with mutual respect I people you know that I gave to for free ask them for feedback and I opened it up just to my email list kind of by the senate Iman said hey I'm watching this course if you want in you know i'm willing to give you a discount on the ticket price so i got like 15 users in and again got more feedback for a second round got really good feedback so i was getting ready for launch are also I said I look you know I'll jump on the phone into a an hour console with you know really help you to build this in exchange for video testimonial so I got like six video testimonials which which helped I mean everyone knows social proof specifically in a space as competitive and crowded and again just kind of ridden with bad online trainings yeah it was really really really important really important that's Korean I actually my first online course I got a lot of video testimonials well not Lots actually I had less than a dozen but and I went out and sat down with people in person one-on-one and interview them but that's really that's an interesting tactic I see you doing is that you know saying almost spend some time with you to take it I thought would be on the course give me that video testimonial that's awesome and then you can just record it in a super skype or something like we're doing right now that's a obviously big win when people see that someone endorsing a product who's used it taken in gonda you up that would it works so that's awesome that's kind of a flow of a little bit of how you got to watch and improving it from there I love the fact that you did essentially apply light at a discounted rate got that feedback and really improved from there do you so in terms of the actual marketing and how reach or getting people to get exposed to your course I know that's something that a lot of people who are just getting started maybe don't have a big audience struggle with what are some of the big wins you got there or even suggest people do yeah so so I had been building you know i i'm sure everyone now is to really with gary vee but you know the whole Jab Jab right hook concept of giving giving giving and then monetizing yeah I I had been I didn't even know Gary B was I love him to death he's best marker on the planet right now but you know I had been doing that just through blogging and just giving because I didn't have a way to monetize so you know going back a year ago when I really started blogging pretty heavily in creating video content and promoting it it wasn't about it wasn't about I didn't even have a right hook in mind right i was literally just creating for the purpose of creating and i think i've built like a micro following you know not nothing nothing major but a couple thousand followers here a couple thousand people on the email list that were just heavily engage with the content I was creating so that again was what ultimately drove me to create the course because they were asking for more information or like you know I can't afford to pay you but do you have any more in-depth training stuff like that it's kind of a way to scale one-on-one consulting really so that was what ultimately drove me so I had a kind of a smoke engaged community that I was able to monetize pretty easily but after that in it was it was a matter of really two things number one was outreach in number two was most facebook ads and really the the glue between all of that and really what's helping you sell the courses content which I don't think people are talking about enough you know people talk about cuts marketing but putting a layer of content on top of the training or additional layers of content on top of the training that really you're able to predict you please can't promote you can't do outreach for effectively for a landing page right because it's a sales page is kind of like you know I do like building all the time and I know that content is effective in SEO because you can really sell your product without selling it through a piece of valuable content and you can promote that because it adds value to people right like a product page as no value landing page as in the value you can't really market that unless you're doing like Adwords or point of search or ranks for SEO so in order to to to market it something like that and it's just disruptive manner which is what advertising is right you're disrupting people's day you've got to have something of value on top of that so what I did was and again I'm very anti internet marketer I know that a lot of internet marketers right now they're funnel is like you know do a what they call Justin time webinar so basically it's called a jit web Webbie is what they call it in internet marketing slang it's a pre recorded webinar that you put on a piece of software and they run it with Facebook ads they run it with banner ads and it pretty much says hey you know opt in to this to this webinar it's coming up just select the time and it starts in an hour writes like you're not running an out webinar on my schedule right so obviously it's recorded but it works so so basically what I did was I took it one step further and I recorded a webinar with no sales pitch in it and I called out the fact that like hey I'm putting this on youtube you can watch it whenever you want and I literally walked out the process of how we're building links for some really big clients step by step by step in like a 45 minute to the point webinar with absolutely no call that it was really a very valuable piece of content right I put it on YouTube up here on my blog and then I used that webinar as two things there was an outreach tool so what I started doing was just following the process that's in my course really which teaches you how to find opportunities and then outreach to them and then kind of do with that scale I did podcasts outreach I did webinar outreach and I use that as kind of like the bait that really good webinar that says hey look and I'll come on your podcast will talk about this i'll talk about how you know we're scaling link building for this big company and we're you know building 100 links and one for this big company so I took that value from that and I started pitching that but obviously underneath that is the fact that you can't really execute that process effectively without my training right so I added a layer of a value on top of it we're kind of open the eyes the people who are in the SEO world that aren't overly familiar with outreach by adding that on and then I could take that and market it so I was doing out ribbon doing outreach for it's from working really well getting on podcast is just kind of spreading a net you know it's not necessarily direct conversions but you know the way the web works now is that there's just so many different touch points I mean the more places that you can get even this you know even if 50 people see it that's 50 people who didn't know who I was before that are now exposed and then if they see if it okay they're just much more you know able to buy I'm and then the second second part of that is facebook ads which is a mysterious on it on the podcast side of things yeah do you have you think I so I've done some podcast but one thing I've struggled a little bit with is the metrics behind it if you go on my cast they might have thirty thousand listeners how do you really know that they came from there now we've done a custom landing page for the podcast that they Nisshin don't know it's the most people order they're listening to this on their phone on the way to work they hear about you to get to work that Google you and they find you so it shows up as a direct like someone who just did an organic search I'm using found many ways to I really personally haven't seen too much quickly up on gas result of you see much no I mean it's it's kind of like old school PR right it's like if you're doing a book can't book launch you're just doing you know you're going to Regis and Kathie Lee all the stuff just I'm going to micro scale obviously right I mean it's the same type of idea you can't really track it but it's just one of those things that you know works again it's the way I look at marketing it's not just about the direct sale anymore because they say people are just they're just these people even as an S deal right I know that people just don't go to Google anymore and type in like by black shoes and buy black shoes just not the way it works right so there's different touch points in each marketing tactic that you has that you utilize has a different goal like going on podcast for me I don't I didn't come here expecting to sell trainings right I came here just to get my name out there because you know two weeks from now you might see an ad or two weeks now you might say guest posts that I did or two weeks from now you might be googling broken link building coming on and guest put a post that I wrote on my site you're like oh wait I know this guy right he was on this whatever right and that connection right there that's when people start to buy that's what people don't realize so you know the goal of me googling on a webinar it's not even to drive traffic to it I don't even track it right it's just more of the fact that I know that I'm reaching a new audience that you know eventually will reconnect in another way when they're looking for right over when I can reach them again so so to answer the question no I mean it's very difficult to do cross-device analytics it's just something that hasn't quite been developed yet unless you do the direct landing page call or you know do some sort of micro site or something like that it's very difficult to track but it just works right it's just once things where you know the more people you reach it's not going to hurt you so yeah that's kind of a goal of the podcast it's not it's not to just get out there and sell books it's to spread value and just you know continue this quest that I'm on so and that that's great about the youtube video with the dose CT I've seen more and more people doing something I'm email from chris brogan the other day that had zero CTA or even a link in it it was just sort of i love working with you and yeah it was warm and fuzzy and amazing and it just it makes you that much more likely to read the next email and get all the next thing I love to see that kind of stuff for you to put that kind of value of their own YouTube with no CTA that's awesome to see and I think I think you're right it's a big big job that's going to then help you with with all the future right hooks so yeah and I think what people dummy my courses it's it's expensive it's it's 850 bucks for the smallest the smallest version of it and I think what people don't really like people are programmed when it comes to online marketing like people like oh people click on anything like you have to put a call to action you have to this you have to make your buttons red because people will click more but like clicks don't mean sales right so like if somebody watches a webinar with no call to action what happens is is that even if there's a call to action that says hey by this training now sure they'll click on it but it doesn't make them more likely to buy what makes them likely to buy is the value that you provide in that content that you're that you're displaying to them right so like I could have a video with no call to action or an email no call to action or this with no link to my site in what happens is if people are interested they're going to seek it out right if somebody's into their watching a YouTube video they're gonna see my name they're going to google the training and they're going to find and they're going to buy it right it so to me it's almost like a marketing play to pull back to call to action just because you know again I like going against the internet marketing grain and saying you know I get internet marketing has like these standard practices that everybody follows and they live and die by them but like then times change it's not always like that and if you're able to kind of go against the grain just a little bit and connect with people it were it just works yeah it really does it works so um the I mean yeah it'sit's an effective method and our skepticism meter is so high online right now because everybody is so de- also use nothing and there is always that click here go here next and so it is your right i think it's almost a bit of a shock to the system you get to the end of a video or webinar and there's no we're a click you start thinking huh where can i find out more about this ryan stewart guy and burn from i want to dive into the facebook stuff but i didn't want to have rice have eight hundred fifty dollars as he said at a low point that's a pretty high price problem yeah how did you arrive at that yeah so so basically a couple of thing I mean I looked around I mean uh you know have no problem promoting Brian bean has a very similar course Brian Dean's amazing market I've actually taking this course very very similar in the sense that he's probably the only one that's out there that's also doing like an outreach base course this is a little bit more focused on content mine's a little more focused on scaling for an agency um I looked at what he was doing the success he was having obviously he's much bigger in the space but I looked at that and then I just looked at the value in terms of the sweat that I mean it took me four months to build this course there's over a hundred three to five minute videos in there each one comes with a step-by-step PDF guide like it's very very very four months of my time it was an incredible amount of sweat equity that went into it that and then also the value to customers and just again understanding my target market I'm not going after the beginner SEO I'm going after the SEO that's been doing it for a while that's either been using gray or black hat tactics that just wants to switch so they've been having success they have a budget I mean in the grand scheme of things you know looking at where I am you know 850 bucks for a course that's going to help me transition and really take these tactics and apply into my business and instantly implement it for clients you know honestly I think it's too cheap and also it's if for agencies right it's for its for internal training what I wanted to be I wanted to target the digital agency that wanted to do outreach want to do it at scale so you know if your business 850 bucks is it's nothing right you know so it's what I pay for video hosting for my blog you know it's crazy so understanding my target marketing and kind of the threshold for what people in terms of the value that they get out of it you know I haven't really heard any complaints about it and it goes up to so the 849 just a tip for people I mean I the way that I price it also was so there's three levels there's 849 there's 1249 and then there's 1949 and I priced it so the 849 version it's just kind of like old school marketing ecology right like 849 was the value that I wanted from it and by putting those three levels on it so I said that you know if you're for a single tweet wanting for IP logins for the chief amount so if you're a civil user you want to for a small team get the small version and then you know if you're a bigger team bigger agency get more IP access and ultimately the biggest version you have unlimited IP access you can share with people stuff like that you know i did that just because when you look at age 49 alone you're like damn that's kind of expensive but then when you see it next to 12 29 and 1949 no you're like it's actually not that bad you know like i can get away with us in ad it's so um I actually I thought when I first watched it I was going to have an issue with pricing but it honestly has not been an issue at all you know so that was kind of how I came up with the president excellent yeah I'm hearing a lot of good stuff in there like you've got a really clear target as to who you're selling to you understand what they're willing to dish you what their alternatives are but the big thing is you really tied it back to the value they're getting out of it you're saying you know you're in an agency or transitioning how you're going to deal with all of this stuff and you know how you're going to deliver value to your clients that makes the 50 nothing on any kind of pockets they have so that's that's great to look at it that way plus it the framing of pricing had something I did with my initial online course would be a huge difference initially I can't put a price point and then I added I had three price points and I drove everything to the middle so the middle race point for me had sort of the ultimate value it was pretty little in the bottom one and the top one and almost it was quite a bit more expensive than had almost nothing more than the mill so even if someone called and said I'm form should I get the really expensive one or the middle why I would say go for the middle and they would buy it instantly there's no it was a no-brainer to go from you know cuz that's forever all value for people you that's great it's the balance this ass model it's proven it works you know yeah awesome okay so okay Facebook Ads let's not forget it I be you got a good book fun how can you tell us a little bit more about how that works I know it's media your strategy but but you know how is it working for you what are you doing for it yeah so you know it's one of those things where Facebook is is like d hot the hot marketing channel right now everyone talks about all of my clients are asking about it they're really wanted to push their budgets from AdWords into it the problem that most people have on Facebook is lack of patience right because people think like for example perfect said was like you read all these like awesome blog posts about like psychographic targeting and like remarketing and all the stuff that's really not that complicated but you know people will will invest in facebook ads and then I promise you I hear this all the time from people when I tell when I tell people I tell people they tell people they need from it and it's because what they're doing is they're either not running they're not running they're cut they're not doing a good job with content they're not doing a job with targeting in terms of targeting cold traffic or they're just assuming that remarketing is going to solve all their problems like just because somebody came to your website doesn't mean like thing about in this way a standard website conversion rate is two percent so if your remarketing to that you're still going to have a very low conversion rate because website traffic just doesn't mean by irshad right so like people go in with saying like oh I've got a really good remarketing list let me just remark it and offer to them they're gonna buy it just doesn't work like that you know the key the key to success on Facebook is really it's a combination things number one is understanding understanding how to use the pixel in custom conversions to custom audiences to the right way because it's key to building a funnel so you know making sure that you're set up with tracking conversions in terms of checkouts track conversions terms of leads that that is set up in tracking and then building custom audiences off of that is key to and then the use of content so the net webinar is the probably actually built it for the Facebook funnel so what I did I built it I put it on my website and I've got the pics on there right so i can remark ensued so what i did was you build individual little funnels within facebook so it is all based on interest targeting so for example i targeted people that like Moz the software with that webinar offer and i have i use all videos because videos are just really easy on facebook and it's a very specific video that talks to fans of moss and it says hey you know using Moz techniques or whatever like i put together this webinar so it's specifically talking to them right and it connects with them that way and that initial that's running too cold traffic that people that just like ma's and then i'll run that and then i'll run to the landing page and then from that landing page or not the landing page from the webinar page on my site I'm remarketing to that so if somebody watched with a minute and a half of that video that to me tells me that they're at least somewhat interested that'll min and a half is kind of a long time on the web so the only then if they meet that requirement and again this is based on being able to set up the right retargeting pixels and stuff like that in your site I'm remarketing then I'm remarketing the landing page for that so before they even get to the landing page I don't even talk about that and again the webinar let me talk about i'm just showing that m i'm finding people that are interested in SEO I'm speaking specifically to them and then I'm sending them a free webinar they don't have to opt in for right and again where a lot of people go wrong with Facebook Ads this will be like Oh opt in to see the webinar and then what happens is they get them on the list they don't convert because they just got onto list to see the webinar alright so again you're wasting time you're wasting money and you're wasting energy by saying by assuming that people want to buy just because they want to see your webinar right so taking it one step further that you just use the webinar or the blog post whatever is as interest bait right so you're relying their interest on facebook with the content and then off of that if they show interest you know you could do like some sort of click you can do time on site whatever that is then you remark at the offer to them right so the offer that I have is I have a free trial of course so I have a you know so that into that traffic to that specific funnel I'm remarking the line page you're going to have this for all these different interest targeting right I have like a neil patel interest targeting i have a link building interest tarnished all sorts of different just amazing howdy targeting within Facebook and then so I get them to the webinar and then based on their interest in it then I remarked the landing page right and then if this so there's a free trial anyone who does not opt-in they get us another reading marketing message so they come to the landing page and then I'm remarketing to them if they didn't opt in right they did often they go to a separate phone so if they opted in then they get a they get a message that says of another video message that says hey you know I appreciate you checking out my webinar I appreciate you checking out the landing page you know did you know that I give away freak like a free trial of course you have nothing to lose just opt in and then of course once I opt-in then I have an email funnel but like that whole interest targeting right there oh and then again off that so once they've opted in yeah so the fruit to the free trial sorry I'm talking about what's they opted into the free trial then I have a final remarketing message so if they have not purchased the full version of the course which again these are set up by pixels if they have not purchased the full version the course then I'm remarketing a very specific messages of them that says hey you opt into the free trial I really appreciate it I hope you got the time to check out the videos if you did you have any questions let's settle any like I want you to buy let's set up a time to talk on the phone so i'm actually driving people to a phone call conversation with me which has been killing it because you know you get a free console when i talked to on the phone and I've closed all so I'm almost taking like a direct sales approach tubes about 850 bucks it's worth you know 15 minutes on the phone for me so yeah that's kind of the basic funnel that I'm that I'm following it's just it's killing it I mean it's really killing so basically now what happens is this all I have to do now because the the funnel is set right if I can get people to the webinar yeah then the fungal is automated writing the email funnel that I have to it's all automated so now all I have to do is focus on getting people to that webinar page and that's again where outreach comes in because if I just outreach to you know 100 bloggers and say hey where you share this on Twitter the more traffic I can get to that page the bigger that remarketing list comes then the more people like getting to that interest funnel on facebook so i don't have to worry about any of that it's really simple then as a marketer it says okay I've got this really awesome webinar who else might be interested in and I can just go out and just push it to as many people as possible and again i can run different cold traffic from facebook i can run traffic from a tree wherever it may be right the more traffic i get to it as long as that person goes to facebook they're gonna get caught in that funnel so that's yeah that's that's why I work so well so i'm going to i just leave those facebook ads on because i know they convert and i set the cookie window to 27 days so if you've been to that landing page within 7 days you're just going to get caught in that funnel and again i can just leave that on for eternity the you're only getting two on that message probably once and they just get tumbled that so like I've launched it 30 days ago and every day this get a couple sales trickling in facebook because I'm just going out and I'm marketing the hell I'm that webinar just getting people to that webinar on my site and then once that happens again then they're in the funnel so excellent and I think actually said what you did with very very free webinar that's 45 minutes and has a lot of value is that just makes it so much easier to go and share with influencers and other people and they discover and to share with their audience or email it out because they're not emailing out even in ogden it's just hey here's a resource it's free at your value after you've watched it there might be an often but they don't you know it's not something where they feel they have to be kind of directly related to promoting you it's just a great resource that at pure value so everybody's really happy to share that kind of stuff so yeah to kind of summarize the process though so you're running you've got multiple funnels based on interest in facebook that dries to a there's a Facebook ad that is a call to action there that takes you over to watch the webinar is it sort of check out this free webinar on on yeah yeah so I have again there ever every ad that I run on facebook in the video because I got I think seeing that person really helps again it's like kind of growth hacking these multiple touch points online yeah you know if you can see my face and hear my voice in that add that to me is a touch point as opposed to just like an image of stock people use stock images all times when you're just gonna use a stock image of nobody when you can put your face on there you know sound like it's a no-brainer so so every every every touch point that I have with that person it's a video of me talking there's a picture of me on the web so it's very personalized right and again the videos that I'm running to it's speaking to the to their stage in that funnel so like the cold traffic that I'm running its it's saying hey you know you know like I know you're a Nazi I know you're a monster whatever it may be right it takes two minutes to do these videos I'm just you know personalizing the message the whole way through so again i'm targeting these people in the video just says hey I've got this awesome webinar there's no often it's on YouTube you can watch it there you can watch it on my site wherever you're comfortable with come back watch it later you know it's going to show you exactly how the benefits going to show you exactly how we build you know 100 likes a month or how we do our retest get whatever it is right yeah and then again when I'm remarketing to you like you so you go you watch the webinar and then I'm remarketing to your seeing my face and talk to you again driving Atlantic tasting my face talking again driving the today office it's just like it's it's a it's a constant process where by the time people get through it they not only are highly interested in the content but they feel like they know neither feel like they're comfortable jumping on the phone they feel like it's sincere it's genuine yeah it just it just works it works really well so yeah and I mean you're building your brand through the whole process be right with the stock images you put your face on that the morn or you do that that's what all of the influencers do that's where you're building that influence or brand yeah I'm on facebook I've like SEO was so that you flagged me I see your ad which is a video that says hey like SEO was come and check out this um this free webinar online outreach and link building I click through I go to your site where i watch the webinar for free that tags me and Facebook through the retargeting pixel at the end or partly through that webinar I've got the option to opt in wait is it right to the free trial of course sir no it takes you to landing page so I want to get people to Lenny page first because there's a lot of there's a lot of value on that landing page that really talks about like I have another video on that landing page to that actually walks you through um my analytics just to show you the just the ridiculous increase in organic traffic that my personal site had seen that like a fifteen hundred percent increase in organic traffic here we are crazy right so I'll walk you through the analytics and then I actually do kind of like a back-end look into the into the training so people could see it see how easy it is to use and stuff like that so I wanted to get people to the landing page yeah because you can also you cannot only opt-in but you could buy it there to realm and I don't want this bypass the option to pay for right up front of somebody's really interested so that land is crucial to the whole process but yeah that's how it works and there is one so when you get to the webinar on my site there is a button that says check out the full training underneath it people didn't want to click through and they do you know I'm actually converting a lot of people just on getting people that to that webinar so it actually saves me money yeah but again yeah i'm thinking it's just the whole process i try and like to just go on the way to do it all you know ok so the flow then facebook add to a little video in facebook takes you over to the landing page for the course where you have actually another free video and talk about the course at that point they can go free trial or they can go full paid course I think I'll free trial obviously there's another final of emails reminding them to go in and purchase the course and then even the opportunity for a consult phone call to do the sale there so you have multiple touch points where you're getting the operation but you're actually giving them value at every touch point right off from that video on facebook the video on their first webinar page the page and then the consult call plus I guess at every point along that way you're tagging them with the retargeting pixels and then hit using active grabs and Facebook the dry them through to the next step yeah exactly as it ended yeah the email i use active campaign for your email um the email list too and this is what i was i was talking some about the other day is that because I wait so long to get that opt-in for the free trial like I don't even talk about enough Facebook right I'm not even like I don't use lead ads I really want people to see the whole thing now you know I'm generated in the last month it's been like 620 free trial users so a pretty good amount in the open rate the average and then it's a it's a seven-day drip campaign because it's seven day free trial each email goes at four o'clock every single day and it's it's it's it it's value right and outside the email is split into two times too so it basically the email the email list is option one is if they have not watched a certain level of videos I'm remarked kind of like remarketing with the email it's driving people to use the trial of the course because I firmly believe if you if you're interested you see the value in the fridge leaves just watch the videos and you'll want to buy it so the first email list is saying hey watch the videos watch the videos watch the videos until they watch the video then the pixel on on the training domain file I then they get they get migrated to the second part of the list you know just kind of splits yeah and that one is driving towards purchase that I want to sing hey you did the trial like that's when I starts a hard sell once they get to that our goal in each email that I have it's like it's almost like a micro case study it'll be like you know how we build links for an online casino that's the first email and it has a ninety percent open rate and a 50-percent click through it in the hole crazy right the whole list a zombie statistics it's crazy but I butt in and I firmly believe in the whole list average has an eighty percent open rate 45% clicked right not just do a screenshot on which at it it's it's crazy and I firmly believe it's because of the amount of time that I waited to get people into that email funnel it wasn't like hey opt-in to get this webinar it was hey watch the webinar hey check out you know the landing page hey check out the free trial right and then once they're in it I know they're interested they're highly in it in the data shows that right so yeah it's just highly excited i stumbled on it so i don't want to take full credit for it i just kind of did it because I've never really been like a good hard seller you know I'm a marketer not a salesperson so and I don't I've never liked I just met like I often be like some of like the biggest internet marketers email list to see how they were doing their email marketing too because this is actually new for me I was like this is terrible like it's just like five emails a day of just like me me me me me me me like old-school Infusionsoft just like really bad looking template like poor design it's just like really long form its like people are at a touch man like I know myself as a business owner like if you email me something that's more than two lines long it's not getting red it's not happening now say might get to the point and why are you me like it's the value right and i think that gets that gets lost because again people think that like just because you're on the email list you want to buy there's like no you're on the email list because you made me get on email so so so there's again this whole this whole concept of just like providing value it's not about me it's about you and like how could i benefit you on and how I better reach you when you want to be reached all this type of stuff that is the core of online marketing right now it's just like traditional internet marketers just like throw to the wind and just like are happy with like a you know a five percent conversion rate on your email list which doesn't have to be like that right so so yeah I mean it's it's it's I myself and in cry surprised that that's excessive it because I thought I was gonna do okay but you know like i said i mean i could make a full time living just walk in this course now it's crazy I'm so really it's crazy that's awesome well we're gonna have to get you to put together a course on how you did all of that for marketing courses like I mean just so many bits of gold in there from how you kind of came up with the topic and researched the space how you ran a pilot project and got the feedback and then refine the course from that and then of course the will overreach in how your ex remarketing any files like that I'm sure that's not the only thing you're doing to promote it so yeah you're interested in teaching or our audience how you're doing it I would be be awesome yeah I'm sure there's much more in terms of the procedural and step-by-step they can pick up from you too yeah I thought about writing a like a long time that time but it's literally all my to-do lists to create about it and just tell people because uh I think it's something that needs to be told about you know selling stuff online it's it's easier than it ever was it just takes a lot more work you know yeah great well if you do let me know we happy to help you get the word out about that too yeah what for sure awesome well that's great anything anything else to add I've been for people watching this has been ryan stewart really educational i think there's a lot of stuff
