 hi Michael hellicksen here for club wealth and today we're talking about assistance you know it's often been said that if you don't have an assistant you are one and I want you to really think about that write that down and remember it because it's true if you don't have an assistant you are one and that means that you're doing all kinds of things that you shouldn't be doing in your business things that someone else could be doing at a rate that's far less than what you and your time are worth so let's talk about reasons why we want to hire an assistant once you take a look over here number one is leverage right oh I'll leverage my time with other people's time if I can leverage I can now build an organization instead of being an entrepreneur I can be a business owner and I want you to think about that most real estate agents are entrepreneurs if you leave your business for six months or even two months or even for many of you two weeks what happens by the time you get back your business is chaos you have to start over again you're starting from scratch whereas for those of you that have teams in place those of you that have at least one assistant when you leave on vacation you'll oftentimes come back and you'll have more business than when you left that's when you know you've gone from being an entrepreneur to being a business owner and that's the goal if you want to reach seventh level if you're a Keller Williams agent or for the rest of us if you want to reach that point where you're doing seven figures of income working 12 days a month you need leverage so another thing that's important about this and another reason why you want to have an assistant is peace of mind you want to know that things are getting done you want to know that people are being taken care of you want to enjoy a higher quality of life so instead of it happen to be you 24/7 you want to have other people in place so that you can take an hour and go take the kids to their soccer game or whatever it is that you want to do but it will increase your quality of life not only that but your stress level will be reduced and that alone helps your quality of life you want to be able to offload the things that you don't want to do again we're talking about quality of life here and we're talking about making sure that those things get done to the highest level possible because if you're doing things that you don't enjoy doing in your business guess what you're not going to do a great job of it but when you hire someone else who loves doing those things that you don't enjoy doing guess what now they're done well now they're done at a high level and that your business reflects that result all right better customer experience I want you to think about this for a minute your customers deserve and demand the best experience possible and when you can consistently deliver the exact same high quality customer service and customer experience time and time again guess what you'll get more referrals you'll have less complaints you'll have less issues to work with with or to deal with and guess what now you'll be freed to go focus on what you as an agent need to focus on which is lead generation bleed follow up and lead conversion all right you'll also have fewer dropped balls how often have you been in an appointment and something comes up or you're on your way to an appointment somebody contacts you and you jot something down and you go into your appointment you get off on to ten different things and all of a sudden you forget what it was that you had to get done it just slips your mind and so balls get dropped when you have a high-quality assistant that doesn't happen now remember it's not enough to just have an assistant you have to have the right assistant that's critical well so I'm gonna show you in a minute here exactly how to hire the right assistant I'm gonna show you what ads to place I'm gonna show you how to place them I'm gonna show you what to put in the ads everything you need to know in order to hire the right people for your team and to ensure that you have the right people in the right positions on the bus we're gonna show you how to do that all right you also at the end of the day get more money in your pocket again this has to do with leverage if you want to make seven figures a year in real estate it's next to impossible unless you're in a market where it's super high price points and you want to work yourself to the bone to make a solid seven-figure income and real estate you've got a leverage and for those of you that are saying well gosh I really don't need to make seven figures that's fine I understand that but at the end of the day you will make more money in less time and your dollars per hour DPH your dollars per hour will be much higher when you leverage your time with others people time and have a high-quality assistant on your team all right so let's talk about the different types of assistants there lots of different types of assistants out there there's all kinds of administrative assistants we'll talk about those first you've got your executive assistant this would be your right-hand person that takes care of everything for you manages your calendar all kind of stuff and we'll get into the details as to what an assistant can do in a moment but that executive assistant is really your right hand now for some of you when you're starting off your first assistant is gonna fill multiple roles here there they might be filling all of them or they might be filling a bunch of them but as time goes on when you your team grows like ours did we grew 244 team members at one point well when you have 44 people on your team you segment that workflow to of such a finite level that each person has a very very specific job duty and you're in what's really nice the luxury that comes with that is that you can ensure that people are doing exactly what they were born to do and what they enjoy doing what they're best at and they bring the most value to the team and to the clients by doing that all right listing coordinator this is the person who takes care of all your listings from start to finish you walk back into the office after having gone out and taken a listing you're gonna walk back you're gonna take your listing packet you're gonna drop it on her desk she's gonna take care of it from then forward you're done you don't have to do anything with that property she's got it handled and by the way she'll do a better job of it than you ever would so listening court in a very important position on your team my listing coordinator for years was a woman named Stephanie and Stephanie was fantastic one of the best things Stephanie did for me was I would come back and I would go to hand her my stack of papers and she would look at me and I kid you not she would say to me what only four listings yesterday what's wrong with you are you slipping did something happen did you get in a car accident and she would guilt me into taking at least five listings each and every day let me tell you that was important to my success and I was really thankful that I had an assistant that I had a relationship with that wasn't afraid to had to have that kind of conversation with me I needed her to have that conversation with me so that I would be pushing myself to higher to greater heights all right transaction coordinators transaction coordinator is absolutely a critical position in your in your company you will on your team probably start off your first assistant will be all all of those first three things the executive assistant the listing coordinator of the transaction coordinator she will fill all of those roles now some of you are thinking to yourself well I already have a transaction coordinator Michael I have somebody I pay a fee to on a per transaction basis and they handle those things for me that's not the same thing folks she's got a checklist that she follows and that's all she's gonna do you want your assistant to follow your checklist not one that she's decided as her checklist or that your company's decided you want and need an assistant that is your assistant whose only interest is ensuring that your company succeeds at the highest level possible that's what you need all right and when I say company I mean team when I'm not talking about your brokers I'm talk about your team you want somebody who's focused a hundred percent on your team all right short sale negotiation at one point in time we had a whole department on my team that all they did was negotiate short sales not only for us but for other agents around the country and mark my words short sales are cyclical just like REO is cyclical the real estate market as a whole is cyclical so guess what even though right now maybe it is maybe it isn't a big short sale market but someday that market will come back and that position will be a valuable position on many of your teams some of you choose not to ever do short sales that's okay but for those of you that do and are good at it you might want to consider having this person be in-house and offering that as a service to other agents as well all right Marketing Coordinator now normally this is going to be the same as your listing coordinator in the beginning unless you get a really large team as you as your team starts to really go grow and you're doing four 500 transactions a year and more and let me tell you a lot of you will be doing that many of the people watching this right now are already doing that if you want to grow from four or 500 transactions a year to over a thousand like I did well guess what you're going to need so a separate listing coordinator and marketing coordinator you want people who are fantastic at that specific thing buyers agents these are very these are hires that you make very very early in the process generally speaking for every 55 leads you have unless you're in California we'll talk about that in a second but generally speaking for every 55 leads by early that you have coming into your organization you need to have one solid buyer's agent and that buyer's agent at a bare minimum needs to be closing two transactions per month ideally they're probably closing more like four or five if they're a rockstar they're closing seven to ten transactions a month now if you're in California I hate to single you guys out but the reality is that buyers agents in California are gonna handle less on their plate than buyer's agents in other parts of the countries and the price points are reflective of this and so in California I might depending on the market I mean I may only want to give my buyer's agents let's say 30 or 40 leads per month but in any case I want to make sure that each and every one of my buyers agents has enough leads and that they are able to follow up with each and every one of those leads so I don't want to give them so many leads that my leads are getting poor follow-up it's all about pull through here I also want to make sure I'm tracking my ROI not only based on lead source but I want to be tracking my ROI based on buyer's agent this is very important all right REO assistance REO is a different animal than retail and you need different you need people that are trained specifically in REO in order to take care of your REO side of your business in a particularly asset managers at a high level now at our peak about half our businesses REO and half of our business those retail and I recommend that by the way because it gives you a nice balanced business and you're not so REO focused that when the REO market dries up your business goes away and you're not so retail focused that when the REO market market comes around your business dries up and goes away now I also want to cross-train my staff I want my entire team cross trained in all of these different things things happen folks people get hit by a bus they get married and move off to another part of the country they decide that it's not a good fit for them and they move on for some reason you decide that it's not a good fit and decide it's time for them to go on things happen people get sick they have a day off right whatever things happen you need to have people cross train so that no matter what happens if any one team member needs to move on or is not there for that particular day that you have coverage and then your clients and your business and your team are taking care of very important all right is a is this is a very hot topic nowadays Isis are inside sales agents now there's a lot of people that are using virtual assistants as Isis and that's okay at times but you really need to analyze what do I want my I say to do are they gonna make outbound calls or are they going to be taking inbound calls are they gonna be expected to do both ASA's are fantastic and can really help even out the lead flow in your business which you've really there's a conscious decision that has to be made as to what that role is and how that in how that interacts with my buyer agent role is my is a going to incubate all those leads before I hand them off to a buyer's agent am i maybe even going to incorporate a showing assistant into the mix so there's a lot of factors folks those of you that are club wealth members I really recommend that you have this conversation with your coach because it's not something that's simple enough for me to really convey properly in a video because there's so much about your business that can have an impact on the decision you need to make with this so this is a conversation for those of you that aren't club wealth members if you haven't done so already take advantage of a free strategy session with one of our coaches doesn't cost you anything they'll walk you through this process they'll take a look at your business and they'll decide hey this is what I would recommend in your business and by the way our coaches all of them have done more business than you are currently doing you are always matched with a coach that's doing what you would like to be doing not what you are already doing so believe me you're talking to someone who's gonna be able to give you advice at a high level all right so that's my that's the different types of assistance and we'll go into more of that another time there's more than I can possibly mention on this short video but I want you to understand that there are a lot of positions that will need to be filled as you scale your team up and grow it so what are some of the things that your assistants should be doing for you let's talk about this first and foremost let's just say that you're the Lone Ranger agent you're hiring your very first assistant number one your assistant needs to print out all of your calls for the day so whatever CRM you're using you should be putting in next follow-up data in there for each and every one of those calls your assistant now is going to go in and she's going to print out your calls for today hand them to you along with your calendar your week at a glance calendar for this week and your week at-a-glance calendar for next week once you have all of that you're ready to go jump in the car and do whatever you got to do and you just need to focus on that little piece of paper and just making notes in the margin a lot of you are thinking your stuff well Michael why don't I just do that for me for in front of the computer and the reason is its inefficient you get sidetracked you get distracted and you're not nearly as efficient as if you do this on paper trust me we've tried this a million different ways with a whole bunch of different people from top producers on the on down to new agents and it believe me it works much better if you print this information out all right I also want your assistant print out your a plus and your a client list every single day I want you to have that list in the car so that you can make those phone calls as well because you constantly need to be touching those folks inviting them to your next client event for example and by the way if you haven't seen our blog on client events you need to check it out all right following up on yesterday's showings this is something you don't need to be doing one of the things you need to keep in mind is in O in the overriding question of what should my assistant do for you or for me the answer is everything that I don't absolutely have to do for myself if it's not something I have to do myself I want my staff doing it I should only be doing those things that only I can do that's how you get the most out of your team and that means spending a lot of time effort energy training your team you got to invest yourself in your team now some people say well Michael but why would I invest all that time in them when they're just gonna quit down the road anyway well maybe we are either hiring the wrong people if they're quitting on us maybe we're not the right person maybe we're not taking care of them like we should maybe we're a manager instead of a leader that's something we need to consider in my manager or am I a leader and if I'm a leader my people want to stay with me if I'm a manager I'm a dictator right if I'm a manager people don't want to be managed they want to be led there's a difference and so I you know I need to look at my behavior and if that's having an impact but at the end of the day you have to invest yourself into your team and to the extent that you do that you can duplicate yourself you'll have a phenomenal team that will want to perform you'll have a cohesive team that do their very best not only free because because you want them to but more importantly because they want to because they take ownership in the company because they take pride in what they do and that's much better than you pushing them to get them to do what they want they need to be done alright so they're gonna follow up on all the showings from this last weekend for example they're gonna call the sellers and they're gonna feed give the sellers feedback from all the showings from the last weekend they're gonna prepare all your listing packets so that when they hand you your stack of stuff you've also got a stack of all your listing packets ready to go if you haven't already seen it check out the 44 point listing appointment checklist blog that we did if you want to see an amazing blog we had when we first launched that blog we are branding we first launched that thing it was 3000 hits in two hours on that blog unbelievable so check it out it's a great resource posting ads all your crazy list adds anything Facebook Ads everything all the ads you can imagine your assistance should be posting those ads prepping your showing appointments making those phone calls to make sure it's okay to show those properties posting your Facebook ads how about this prepping your swag right so if you're gonna stop by with swag at one of your sellers house we talked about our internal marketing that's your referral based business they can be preparing all of this they can preparing and be preparing a map for all of your swag stops right so if you're gonna pop by a lot of people call it pop buys so if I'm gonna be doing these pop buys I need a map on you know so if I know that I've got appointments over in this part of town I want to do all my pop buys in that part of town and there's great resources for being able to do this very efficiently they can print out all my flyers for my open houses my listings and all that good stuff prepping my marketing materials for door-knocking if I'm in a door-knocking neighborhood updating my database prepping for events creating events on Facebook how about creating and mailing the invites for the events setting up clients on home searches there's so much they could be doing scheduling photoshoots for listings calling agents and getting their permission for us to market their listings that's something your assistant can do you don't even have to do that there's just so much that an assistant can do I'm not going to cover all of it right here tell you what we'll do we'll make sure that we included downloads so that you can get a list of all kinds of things way more than I could possibly talk about here at the end of watching this video go to the download download the information we'll have that and a whole bunch of other stuff in fact we'll even have ads that give you the language that you need to use to attract the very very very best candidates to be assistants for you alright so how do I do it first thing I'm gonna do is on my place the Craigslist ad again we're gonna give you the copy for that in the download so check it out make sure you can download that we're gonna want to post our ads on LinkedIn we're gonna want to post it on Facebook we're gonna want to post current employee testimonials so literally if I can I'd like to get video testimonials for my current employees or my current and by the way let's call them team members not employees because the reality is that's the that's the environment we want to foster but I want to get testimonial videos from my team members that I can post and give links to when I'm posting my ads because now people go to that and they can say wow that person seems to like their job maybe that's something I should apply for remember the goal of posting the ad is to get as many people to apply as possible and ideally want to get as many of the right people to PO to reply as possible also I'm gonna go I'm gonna ask my broker for referrals hey mister missus broker in the office who do you know that that's maybe a good candidate for an assistant for our team or a for a buyer's agent for our team they will know you'd be surprised and it may not be somebody in the office it might be another agent from outside the office but they may be able to point you in the right direction I'm gonna email all the agents in the MLS and see if they're interested because there's a lot of agents out there that maybe got into the business thinking that they were going to be a rock star real estate agent and then they found out that well it just didn't quite go like they wanted they're maybe they're really good with buyers but they're not really excited about working with sellers so they haven't had as much success of sellers so maybe they want to be a buyer's agent and maybe they're really good at working with buyers they're just not great at getting the leads well these are all reasons why someone might want to be on a team instead of being on their own and there will also be agents out there in your marketplace that might know of somebody that's looking for a job maybe they have an assistant and they just aren't doing as well as they need to be able to keep that assistant and rather than just firing that assistant or laying them off they'd like to help that person out because they feel a connection there they might want to refer them to your team so they don't feel like they're letting that person down lots of reasons why you should reach out to the agents flyers in those agents boxes all kinds of stuff so let's assume now that I've got my ads out there and I've got the right ad because you've downloaded and hung our download so I've got the right ad out there that's gonna attract the right candidates and now I've got all these people that have come in and wanna that are interested in this position next thing I want to do is I want to set up a group interview yes it's a group interview I do not want to do one-on-one interviews one of the colossal waste of time and a huge time-suck don't do that so when I'm setting up the group interview I'm not going to tell them hey by the way would you like to come in for a group interview I'm not going to do that why because a lot of people just wouldn't want to do it what I am gonna do is I'm gonna pick an odd time right so I'm gonna say something like hey I want you to arrive promptly at 10:05 I've got you scheduled for 10:05 if I give them an odd time the chance of them showing up on time go up dramatically so give them an odd time so it feels to them like it's very specific to them then when everybody shows up am I gonna have a few people that are gonna be upset absolutely litmus test number one this is gonna tell me if somebody's upset at this point in the process do I really want them on my team heck no that's not the kind of person you want to have on your team I want people that are flexible people that are team players and people that are willing to do whatever it takes to be on this team because they get that this team was filled with rock stars that's the kind of person I want on my team so once I've got them in the room I'm gonna spend 30 minutes maximum usually less than that but I'm gonna spend somewhere between 15 and 30 minutes telling them about the company history a little bit about my own personal backstory I'm going to tell them about what the team does and how we do it I'm gonna teach them what they are what this position is being hired to do so what would your job look like if you were a member of this team well let me tell you I'm going to talk to them about ours pay why the team is special all this stuff that everybody in the room is going to want to know I'm going to cover that in the group format so I'm pre selling them on wanting to be a part of team and some of those people might be pre opting them out right some of these people might be hearing me say these things and they might think that's not for me okay no problem so that's great because if it's not for you I don't want to interview you period so I get through that now I'm going to move them to the one-on-one interview so I'm going to let them know hey those of you that feel after hearing all of this that this team might be a good fit for you we're gonna now do very quick five minute or less one-on-one interviews this is your opportunity to just chat with me privately and my opportunity to chat with you privately and we're going to get to decide whether or not we think it's a good enough fit to move to a more detailed interview because let's face it in five minutes of sitting with each other what we're probably going to know whether or not it's worth moving on not and so we're gonna do the five minute interviews first so I line everybody up with you our five-minute interviews when I'm done with my five-minute interviews all I'm deciding now is who do I want to move to a second one-on-one interview which is going to be more like a fifteen to thirty minute of you so at those five minute interviews I will schedule them for their fifteen to thirty minute interview and I'm not gonna do all these folks I really want to whittle this list down if I start it off with 40 people in the room I'm gonna Whittle my list down to maybe eight to ten maximum probably gonna Whittle it down to like four from those initial five-minute interviews because I really don't want this to suck my life away do I I want to find the right person as quickly as possible and be as efficient with their time and mine as possible all right so once I'm done I'm going to pick the person that I really want to hire out of that interview and so out of those top two or three candidates I'm gonna be asking them things like what you know tell me a little bit about you what do you feel why do you feel like we're a good fit tell me what I can't read in your resume that I need to know to help me make a decision on whether or not to hire you these are all things that I want to have kind of in that fifteen to thirty minute interview when I'm done with that I'm gonna be I'm gonna I'm gonna go to a final interview so I've got down to my top three we're going to a final final final interview here right with me there's one more coming up but this is the final interview with me I'm gonna go deep on the stuff that's in their resume I'm gonna start asking a questions like you know why did you leave this job you know why was this long period of unemployment I want to know on each job why they left what they were making when they're at that company I want them to define their dream job I really want to get a feel for who is this person what do they really want and am I gonna be able to retain this person long term or am i setting them and I up for failure by bringing along the team I also want to find out what do they not prefer about their next job or there are their previous jobs and you know how would their supervisor describe them I want to know all the things that they liked that they didn't like and again what others you know whether it's their supervisor or coworkers would say if I were to interview them all right I want to find out about the skills that pertain to this position that I'm hiring what skills do you have that pertain specifically to this type of a position I want to know what the lowest pay rate they would expect is why do I want to know this I want to know that's because some people have unrealistic expectations on wages and I need to know going into this if this person is unrealistic and if they come to me and you know they're theirs they've got no experience in the industry and they're coming to me and they're saying well I want $30 an hour well you're in the wrong place and you know I frankly I'm not sure that those kind of entry-level positions even exist out there so I want to be very very real with them but compensation right from the get-go I also want to find out what rate do you want turn what rate would you like to earn long term and then we talked about you know well what do you think it would it take to get there so I can kind of gauge do they have realistic expectations as well in terms of long term income and then I want to find out if they have any questions for me and also at this point I want to review their disc pros five disc profile so I've already at this point asked them to fill out a disc profile and now I'm going to discover if their disc profile is something I think will match this position then after all is said and done I've got it down to that one person that I feel like you know what this person's fantastic I would love to hire this person now I'm gonna have them do a final interview with my club wealth coach your club wealth coach is is already has a heads hired people if you're coaching in tier 2 or tier 3 or tier 4 your club wolf coach has hired lots of people in the past and so they know how to do this probably a lot better than you do take advantage them they will actually do that final interview for you and let you know how you know how they feel about that particular candidate and if you have other members on your team other assistants other buyers agents at this point after your coaches interview after everything else is done at this point I would highly recommend giving each person on your team five minutes to interview this person you're looking for them to throw up any red flags they might have this is important because they're gonna have to work with this person long term and you need to make sure that you're not gonna have a conflict of personalities that's going to prevent these to you from working well together so it's very important that everybody feel a part of this process right down to the receptionist in the office right down to every single point whether it's a runner or receptionist of buyers age and listening it doesn't matter everybody in the team gets their five minutes with this person alright so how do you pay your assistant this is important so many people ask me questions on Michael what's the structure for pay how does this work well one you got to decide am I gonna pay an hourly or am I gonna pay him Commission and let me tell you this if I'm talking about any administrative positions I need to be paying them an hourly rate not Commission if I'm gonna be paying a buyer's agent and actually REO assistance is not the same but if I'm paying a buyer's agent or an ISA my buyers agents of my ISA do like Commission income generally speaking a buyer's agent is going to be a hundred percent commission based an ISA or an inside sales agent is probably going to be a hybrid of hourly plus Commission or salary plus Commission so knowing who you're dealing with their personality type the type of position we're dealing with will dictate what type of pay structure I'm going to put in place that being said other than your buyers agents pay very close attention here other than your buyers agents every single other person on your team and I'm sorry listing agents as well buyer's agents and listen agents everybody that does not have a real estate license and is not a hundred percent a buyer's agent or a hundred percent listing agent needs to be paid on a w-2 now a lot of you are gonna argue with me about this and so many people I get this all the time people love to tell me oh oh but Michael it's nuts not how it works I've researched this and I've I've looked at the guidelines and I can get away with paying my people on a 1099 good luck with that you let me know how that goes for you when not if but when you get caught because when you get caught it's not going to be a little slap on the hand it's gonna be huge fines I've seen it happen I've had it happen don't let it happen to you trust me on this it's a lot cheaper to just pay him properly from the get-go pay him on a w-2 you'll be happy you did alright there's lots of companies out there that will handle your payroll for you you don't need to know how to do this how about paychecks that's a great one it's cheap ADP there's all kinds of them out there we personally use paychecks but there's lots of companies out there that will do this there's companies out there that will also perform the HR function for you so if you need help with HR they can help you with that as well but at the end of the day make sure you're paying them properly take the burden off of yourself don't try and have yourself - it's not worth saving a few bucks to try and do your payroll in-house unless you've got 44 people on your team like we did really just hire somebody like paychecks to do it it's cheaper for you in the long run let your team focus on what they're best at now that being said don't be afraid of this process it sounds more complicated than it is there's a checklist for everything club wealth members ask your coach for the Trello checklist on how to hire an assistant for everybody watching this video right now I want you to go to the
