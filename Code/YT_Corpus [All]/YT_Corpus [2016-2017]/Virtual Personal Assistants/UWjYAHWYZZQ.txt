 hi there welcome to offshoring business trends with case studies this is the first webinar over three webinar series my name is Michael Hagen I'm the founder and owner of mini movers in Australia business I still own today which does short distance furniture moving across Australia i'm also a semi-retired today living in manila philippines where i teach australian businesses or western business owners how to offshore and also have a good look at your business models and help you bro business i am a serial entrepreneur i currently own for businesses sorry six businesses in four different countries to really get an idea of offshoring and where it's going in some case studies we first of all let me talk a little bit about the philippines and why so many people today are using the philippines same timezone as Western Australia population of a hundred million people a medium age of twenty three point three years and falling that means they about breathing faster and faster two-thirds of 100 million people in less than 15 years of age ninety percent Christian many of them very very devout Christian sodas and a very unusual country in Asia it is a fully Christian country that means it has the same core values as US has a 97.5 bit sent literacy rate due to the fact it was an American colony for nearly 80 years and the Americans put their education system here in here they made it compulsory they met a compulsion English that makes it the third largest english-speaking country in the world it has half from half a million five hundred thousand college graduates a year and currently the offshoring industry which is absolutely exploding here currently employs in the Philippines 1.2 million people Filipinos working for Western businesses of which 75% work for the USA which means 75% of them started ten o'clock at night and finish at five o'clock in the morning and of course when Australians come along we want them to start a six o'clock in the morning eight o'clock eastern time and finish at three o'clock in the afternoon five properly some time and under putting all this is a capital city gross wage of a young university degree qualified worker doing an ordinary administration type role is around about one hundred dollars Australian a week and in fact as you go up to the school levels into the one of the different skills the wages don't raise very much at all in the in Manila you'll find them peeking out probably around about at one hundred and forty dollars a week this of course means that there's a massive great opportunity here with the wage differences and when you connect those wage differences with the internet and then you add to it in recent years cloud-based solutions the foundations are in place for a massive luminous in the business offshoring services and people in other words building teams and other Philippines and we're we're seeing the real the real results that they out the individual workers in the virtual based solutions and home based solutions it's when we can get your own team in your own space and above your own people and that's what we're going to talk about quite in quite a few of the case studies we're going to follow absolutely worth today off shoring of course is changing rapidly and is the started 25 years ago with the large corporate businesses because of the cloud-based solutions and the connectivity in announce more micro businesses can also use it and this is equalizing small micro businesses with large corporates and it's changing the business world dramatically it also gives Australian businesses of footing in the world business stage and creating a new export income feeding the lifestyles of every Australian you know most businesses in Australia have the opportunity to be able to source either product or sell product and or do both and also control it all with administration and sales from third world countries if you get into that mantra and you're developing everything at world's best value then you're creating a lot of export dollars coming into Australia which ultimately leads lifestyles so let's get into it let's start talking about some actual case studies about what I'm seeing and what I'm involved in here in the Philippines with offshoring the first one of course is fairly low hanging fruit but as something was dead in my heart I've been in business for nearly 40 years now and probably for the last 30 years I've had a PA a personal assistant attached directly to me handling all of my personal and director easy to do tasks for the last 14 or 15 years that PA has been a filipino and indeed during that time I've gone through three different Filipinos in that role so that stayed with me but stable and the great too great to work with sort of things they typically do for me I do have them enough work the last 14 years I've had a full time designated PA working for me on odesk and later on of course it became up work I like to do that because I like to keep the boy from the politics of the various businesses I have to keep them away they are a personal assistant vera and they're not a virtual assistant there are always doing research for me I'm always needing to find out things I'm always giving them tasks to go up and go and find out about this don't research this go and find that for me and there is a lot of that going on they have organized appointments it's a little bit like herding the cats sometimes but they organize all my appointments that set my times for me they run a lot of small processes for me particularly as of growing new businesses might smilla to us is run by my current PA Emma she does everything I just turn up and run mature but she does the bookings organize the dates organize the hotels and that's all done with little set processes that were developed around that particular business and they control my contacts they keep them clean that keep them all sort of that will clean and tidy they learn who is who that detect new ones when they're coming in update them and everything else and always say also looking at my linkedin and controlling and sorting that out and mission those with my contacts to make sure i'm always up to date with lucy lucy and what's going on they very much quickly learn who's who and who they are is urgent to and who's not urgent to me in the different rows of people coming at me and then to handle that quite seamlessly though read all my emails we've always done that we use Microsoft Exchange and outlook and we could see each of our hsl emails we can see the folders and everything else and my pas have always read my sent emails and that's the way they keep on top of what's going on saves me a lot of time and tell them about what I'm up to they can see what's happening with my sent emails obviously they clear my inbox they take care of the simple stuff of somebody asked for a simple appointment with me they'll just jump in and and announce themselves they don't they don't know known actors me they always say who they are on my behalf but they do sort anything out and take care of it so my email actual emails that ice each day is dramatically reduced out of though all those that i need to see and they use my credit cards they use paypal they book things flights and hotels and buy anything we need that's all normal stuff I give a lot of thumb people asking about they're not going to tell you look it's all very very tractable and it's a very trust arrangement as it is with most employees and I've never ever had anything that vaguely resembles the trouble any trouble of that they do need to lose you can use your credit cards pretty clever though because a lot of the online stuff they need to be able to answer the questions or otherwise we had locked down and discovered that few times but we get pretty good at that and look they they set up and run live blogs and my webinars and attack this webinar spin completely set up by Emma I've done the slide she's giving them an overview and check them a little bit and the all I'm doing is turning up here they're webinar she's tucked record she'll click finish at the end and then send it off and get it all set up and put down and uploaded so you guys all listen to it and why do I believe everybody to us do as well at the end of the day a personal assistants saves me an awful lot of time and it's very very cost-effective for me it makes my life easier a lot easier and it also adds on I'm a lot more productive as well so I suggest that as soon as you get and get going in your business the earlier you can get somebody and beside you as a PA to take care of all the ring let me stop the better off it is it's not a menial task they have almost the same status of my business as a senior manager they are making decisions in quite large decisions and so it's not an immediate task I don't I do develop trust with them they do learn to golf to do things without any supervision that's all part of what you need to have a good PA would include so that's how i use PA and i'm using up work to to source my PA and also to employ my pad to make it all simple for myself the next story is a story that started just after i got serious up here i got very very seriously using philippine six or seven years ago and around about of just after i started here one of the largest carpet cleaning companies in Australia decided to move the majority of its operation up here and in a pretty short time they pretty well moved everything up here except for franchisees so all i have in australia is pretty well franchisees cleaning carpets and they are across most country towns as well as every city in australia there are very large operation they've trained their filipino team and it's Elizabeth demas all in one office there with what he dare together they're cool send us their their sales sales sections there they're marketing's their their back office administration's their lead generation bookkeeping wages and all the complaints that they do it's all in LED and from finding and engaging franchisees finding in booking clients is all and all of the administration's I sail with them are all done in the Philippines I understand that operation puts a good two to three million dollars extra on their bottom line it also means that they can do an awful lot more for their their clients than their competitors can do and gives them a distinct advantage in the market so they've got the advantage of good profit and they've also got the advantage of being able to do a lot more for their clients of what their competitors can and I think it's a general trend that you going to see in the service sector everywhere this type of operation growing and exploding across from Australia very interesting like a lot of operations not all the jobs in there are jobs from Australia far from it after they get up here and discover how how the low wages work and how clever the Filipinos can be they very quickly decide they can invent new things particularly often in marketing in lead generation in those areas and in doing more things for their customers with a little out down section that does outbound phone call such we'd never dream of doing in Australia we could never afford it to do it up here you could afford to do those things easy so very quickly you invent new jobs that add more value to your clients and more value to your business as well and that's quite a common thing that you're seeing here in a lot of the business I see the next one is a young it's an example of what we call the fourth wave which is that the second wave was manufacturing leaving Australia third wave is its employment in effectively moving across in the fourth wave we believe is going to be the professional services or a lot of services setting up their full structures in ER in these third world countries and then selling retailing their operations back into a strut into the Western world and this particular one is an accountancy firm and when we visited on tour they've got a very very large room with about term a very large room full of Australian oyster Countians they have another room with us a accountants and they have another room with youth care counters I've watched this company grow from five accountants to 130 accountants and just under three years it's been a spectacular success they retail accountancy services to businesses small medium and also large businesses in each of these countries in the same way that an ordinary standard accountancy business in Australia retails directly to you except where an Australian accountancy firm is basing its charges on about three hundred dollars an hour this company is basing its charges on twenty dollars an hour and they are very very good at what they do they are learning very rapidly they certainly they're doing everything they can a chem accountancy confirmed accountancy firm can do except for tax advice and what I'm commonly seeing happen is that Australian business has come up here they start using these type of services they still keep their existing accountant in Australia but they down drank all the work the bass goes out to the standard pianos and compliance statements come out and all go to the Philippines and pretty well only the only thing that's left with the Australian counts of tax advice at the end of the air one or two meetings a year your time they restructure something and that's that the rest of it's all all the arms or legs stuff is all done by these accountancy firms up here so you still keep you Estonian accountant but just using them for pure tax advice only and some other advices it could be needed that only arms or legs that stuff is all down here and it is accountancy it's well beyond bookkeeping as well this next business is they a rent roll business it operates one of the largest rent rolls in Australian if you lease properties houses and we're sort of things these guys run all those processes for you so as you can see that first lady in the slide she does the rent arrears chasing lease renewal processing and chasing sending sign leases to owners and tenants smoke alarm processing issuing notices to leave vacation packs postings breaking lease processing repairs and maintenance the middle one of course is doing QA and health checks on bond payment check checking in some mining or some data trawling or research that they need for their business is long using RP Data the last person there is booking the inspections putting up putting up and removing the signs doing entry notice for leasing inspections routine inspection looking business development administration tasks and indeed there's a massless this company has quite a large team drumming at about 35 people and they all have all the different roles running all the different processes so all those process with technology are very very easy to move to the place like the Philippines and you come up here you train them to do it your way and with the loyalty factor you get here and the fact that they really have a desire to do a job and what their wages I talked about earlier you can develop a massively effective team to do these things this business is rather interesting this business is also been around here for quite a while about five years that I am aware of it's an American business I've used Google Maps there to do the shot but they knew they use more higher resolution than google maps in Australia we have a thing called me maps can take low high resolution photos in an impact in the states is a similar thing as well and what they're doing is they're working their way up every Street in the USA and they are measuring every route by putting little red dots like little laser points with the computer on the points of the roof and that does an automatic measurement of the route they record the address they record the size of the roof they record the type of roof and the condition of the roof and they move on to the next one and do that then they move on to the next one and do that they have 900 Filipinos sitting in an office space and that's all they do all day every day five days a week measuring roofs and really this is all about lead gen and data collection data mining here you have people talk about data mining you think think of the idea that they're in websites trying to get to email addresses for those days of perfect line nowadays we're using a lot of different ways that we can mine mine data and certainly morning data from aerial shots a--'s is the game this company has a down to an art and they just sell that data they sought to insurance companies they submit to all sorts of different people and I don't doubt the roofing industry would also be interested in paying for that data as well and that's all I do all day every day collecting darlin like that it couldn't do it anywhere else and be impossible to do it anyway and then sell that all those that need it this one is interesting it's a friend of mine I've actually changed the product by his request it's a very similar product to as I presented here but can you imagine if you were selling swimming pools well your Tigers of course somebody hasn't got a swimming pool so if you have a look at this aerial shot here it's an aerial shot actually in the gold coast of Australia in Brisbane at gold coast and bottom of Queensland and as you can see number 11s got a swimming pool number eights got a swimming pool and other tens got a swimming pool number twelves got a swimming pool number and number 215 here it's got a swimming pool number 13 here it's got a lovely big backyard and no swimming pool and so what they do is they click print screen which two snaps a shot of it and then drop that that photo as such into a flyer situation draw a circle round number 13 put on it as this your house how about a full of spy on your backyard go online to this address web address or phone us at this phone number and let us explain how we can easily install you'll pull us fire they then click print and it prints it on like a card and it prints the address on one side and it prints this this image on the back event and down on the Gold Coast there's a guy in an office and he's got a printer in there and every few minutes one of these things drops out because in the Philippines they have two guys and make up to people filipinos all are doing all day every day is working their way down the streets finding the places potential places that will sell pools put in a circle around and click print and the printed the printed fly if you want to use that term the printed postcard comes out in printer in on the Gold Coast every day they collect them all take them down to Australia Post drop them in the postal service and they arrive in your mail and of course the secret to it is it if you get something in your mail that's actually got a picture of your house on it you actually got to stop and look at it and in fact you're probably going to show your partner look what came in the mail and indeed they really hit some major home runs with us in the industry of that are in which is similar to swimming pools they are a very major player their competitors all know about them but have no idea what they're doing because they don't actually have any public advertising you don't see them at all I don't push a bit their name out there they don't need to their markets very very nice very direct to the to the target and a few I have a large backyard you'll certainly get something from them suggesting that you buy their product a very clever way to do marketing once again something you couldn't dream of doing in the Western world without costs that we've got there at the moment this is a BPO that up until a few weeks ago was owned by the New Zealand Post are they still use the services in it it's now owned by another operator but what they want is Ellen post owned it for a number of years doing a lot of our work they're also doing work for New Zealand postal workers as well in these in Auckland New Zealand they put in a mail service and in that mail service they they have a that the parcels will arrive in its automatic big automated mail service with conveyor belts all the parcels right well in a conveyor belt fix them up and as they roll along the conveyor belt they go through a scan of cameras and there's a bar code on the parcel and the camera detects the the software detects the address label and reads the address label and then tells the tells the computer than that barcode equals an address label from now on so when it gets down and it gets to a little arm it's just north island south island knows which way to swing the arm and when it gets down and goes Christchurch and Dunedin and no switch waiter to swing the arm to switch the parcel on about thirty percent of them for various reasons they can't read them properly sometimes this because and this is how clever it is there's not there's there's there's not that many numbers in the street or the streets misspelt to the suburb or the suburbs miss bill to the street or something similar always just ripped screwed up or in some way it cannot be read an image of that instantly appears on a screen in the Philippines and a Filipino who knows pretty well the spelling of everything in Australia and sorry New Zealand fixes the fixes the problem and he just comes up on his screen against to collect it's gone and he has four seconds in which to fix it because that's four seconds is when the parcel gets to the first bar code and if it is sorry to the first sorting if it's if it doesn't know when it gets that sorting out it's going to go right round the whole look the and do it all again so they do in the four seconds and it's an amazing thing to go in and sit down and watch a small team of Filipinos glued to the screen the if dress comes up and go bang bang and they change it and it goes back to Australia a nanosecond corrects it and parcels on the way a very very clever use of video footage and video transfer and a very interesting example of how good the internet set is here and how you can get some do some amazing stuff because of the greater than that we have the next one is an American friend of mine is a radiologist in general terms a radiologist in the West costs about 120,000 dollars a year there's one of them reading an x-ray they have a because you have one human doing something you will always have a mistake margin and they do have a mistake margin with reading x-rays in the Philippines a radiologist is about 12,000 am so this guy can afford to have three radiologists read one x-ray he has the three of them read the x-ray as the x-ray is taken in mistakes that's actually dropping the image of it is dropping down on a massive great big screens that he has an ax dark room full of radio radiologists in the Philippines three of them read the same x-ray in different parts of the building they all type in the report into a computer the computer compares the three reports if there's any discrepancies that goes to a supervisor to be to be sorted out if there's no discrepancies that flips straight back the report flips straight back to the USA almost fart or pasta then somebody in the states could have read it anyway but of course with no mistakes absolutely zero mistakes if you've got three people agreeing on something the the potential for real estate is extremely minor indeed so they're reading them for a third of the cost they're reading them with zero mistakes and oh reunion pasta it's an absolute no-brainer I think us entrepreneurs when we look at this type of thing we can see so many ways that we can eliminate mistakes and get faster results of cheaper prices using this type of that this type of thinking in your business this b2b marketing process I'm seeing a lot more now I can tell you that my mini movies has a massive team in the Philippines that are detecting potential clients are doing a lot of research marrying up using a whole lot of databases to find out more about those potential clients making a decision when they think they're going to move even if they are rentals and going to move in the next few days we can store out very very quickly for that or in a few months time if it's a house being sold we're profiling that and then we're contacting them in a warm wait and indeed we're also closing the sales from here and we're doing that in a big way and I'm seeing it over and over again so many many different industries where you can have an absolute target market b2b business to business arrangement you know who it is you probably know what business it is once you go to that business you it's not hard to do researcher in that business to find out who the owner is or the sentiment decision-makers are it's not hard for you to manually screw down and find out a lot more about them and find out their contact details is not difficult then have somebody here contact them that can be by phone it can be by email it can be by messenger it can be by linkedin can be by any number of different ways and then obviously when their contact them they extract some sort of reaction and that turns it into a woman quarry then flip it over to a sales person to close the sale we're seeing this in all the services businesses we're seeing this a be a business up here that sorry an Australian business that sells hospital equipment and are selling into the USA doing exactly this I've got a couple of Filipino people working at night bringing us American hospitals talking to the person in the particular section that they need to talk to and then sending them some information online and then following that up with a trial arrangement they have with ACN actual equipment to them to trial and then closing it into asylum at australian businesses selling that product without anything in the USA at all it's just doing it clean with much of its team from the Philippines making worthwhile same as software I'm seeing people selling software that specific businesses same deal zero in on the business do the research make sure the business is right find out who the decision makers are and do that and you can afford to do that here you can afford to have a team doing those sort of things in some of the numbers out of these things I yuge they really are and how they doing in this is a business that does work in the building industry they do insurance repair work specifically they do a lot of it for when there's been a major disaster they have a mess of great problems getting Assessors trying to get assistance into the sites and trying to skip the assistance to be efficient obviously and assess it goes out to do an assessment for insurance purposes it's got to measure everything guppies didn't go to go into a big list go and work it all out calculate it all out type it into a big report and then send it in as they submit it there's a lot of work in that they spend a little bit of time on site on an awful lot of time doing paperwork we've managed to eliminate that and we also managed to eliminate the need for so-called qualified assistance we just common sense people could do it I myself am a trading electrician I did my trade as an electrician when I was young young fella I don't practice having breakfast for years but that's given me a common sense of how all the building stuff works and I understand all that stuff easily imagine if I walked into a building that it has say three feet of pflumm water through it I'd be able to switch my iPad on I'd be able to talk to the ipad and point the iPad at the damage and say radio this is the claim for mr. Smith and so-and-so street claim number such-and-such on XYZ insurance as you can see there's been nine hundred milliliters of blood water in here this is the rumpus room at the front and there's a power point here and there's something here that cup it's got to be replaced and I can just turn it remove the video the ipad around the room talking to it describing what i need to see when i'm finished the walking through the whole site I could then click send and that video footage would then be sent and would arrive in the Philippines obviously use some sort of third party in the middle Dropbox or whatever to type her handle that process where in the Philippines that an engineer can get hold of it go through the footage and then on off the video that can do the fundamental measuring do the measurements work out a list of everything that's got to be done and certain deep costs out the job with a big list of infantry list of everything that's got to be done and then of course send that back as an insurance claim and they can turn that around faster and a court and of course the the on-site ass insurance assessor to send a video as soon as he's finished one he's simply out up the road into the next one and he's doing that he's not sitting in office process in the mall that's all being done in the Philippines they are playing with doing in tandem for accuracy much the same as the x-ray guy and they're also recently been playing with getting Filipino to control the actual the actual job when they get the job because obviously I off that video that can work out what needs to be ordered in what order you know strip it back step back to the frame get a electrician to do a pre wire get the job Rocky to do the jib rocking you know right through the painting and putting the carpet down can all be controlling the right order believe it or not from the Philippines and that's being done by this company as we speak and it's highly successful for them something that we started doing about three years ago and they're ramping it up and having quite often with the people that come on i actually have a business learning tool which i'm going to talk about shortly and i get a lot of people coming up that are experts in their actual industry like accounting or at an RTO that's an expert in training and all sorts of things in what I tell them is quite simple if you're going to stop and what's sorry what's missing in in the Philippines is expertise in all these particular areas there's lots of accountants here there's a massive oversupply of qualified accountants of the Philippines but they don't know fully Australian accounting they've been taught theoretical accounting at University and they don't know that the interests of Australian accounting and the captain came up and he said to me where's the gap in the market i said well quite simple there's a massive shortage of australian iced accountants this is an American education system they have to do crack to get their degrees accountants have to do six months what we call oj t on job training to get their degree so you can actually have them working as long as that training for six months for nothing and I said what you should do is simply go and find somebody has gone breakfast a 20 computers or whatever go and grab 2000 JT's from a university sit them down and fully Australian eyes them train them to spell best forwards backwards upside down to still superannuation forwards backwards upside down obviously being a very American I understand what a 401 is that have no idea what superannuation is he did that accountants up here have a starting salary after training eighty-four dollars a week say he had 25 he focused on Australian izing them and ten weeks he trained them up to be incredibly good at what they do he kept the best for his own business and then he sold the rest to his industry and this guy has taken off he now has over 300 accountants working for him in three years and the growth is not going to slow down he's going to go to thousands nothing's going to stop him because he's feeding a demand with a product that's really good and there's a lot of demand coming up here and can't get that last level of expertise the way to do it say if you're coming up in you want to set up your own team and you're going to Train somebody in a particular part of your industry niche to do it your way well near muscle harmonics on to your competitors will start a new business and growth as well it's the way the entrepreneurs are getting ahead of the j-curve of what's coming at them in the way of change and so that's a really good story and when I'm seeing successful and I'm seeing it I'm not even counting on seeing it done a law right now as i said i'm seeing a Tubba an RTO and training I've seen it down so many very little niche areas so in real degrees of engineering and all sorts of things where I'm seeing this this training specifically for the industry and then of course the industry will readily buy it because it's very much trying to do the right thing this is the company it's been around for a long time second generation company used to be based in Brisbane in Brisbane what they do is they do left and left the right hand or right hand to left hand car conversions basically some very large American trucks and specialized American cars like tomorrow's and stuff like that there's a market in Australia for these products they are not brought out with a steering wheel on our side that to be changed over manually there's a market out there to buy them the model that they usually have us they have a selling agents right across the australian obvious typically if they are cards large car dealerships you go into the ford dealership and timbuktu for instance and us for big airport 50 or so don't have one but if you want one we can order it through third-party that does the conversion we can deliver it to you and you place the order they get the car out from the USA they move everything across there's quite a bit of work involved in steering wheel the gear stick is going to be changed the doors have got to be changed the Middle's going to be changed and of course the complete dash is got to be changed apart from what's done underneath the hood in the poem as far as the steering box and a whole please consider they used to have 10 mechanics they always had a shortage and always had trouble with them they were charging forty five thousand dollars a conversion with no profit they packed everything up moved it up here to a special economic zone here mechanics are about fifty three dollars a week and there's a massive oversupply of them today they have a hundred mechanics they charge 17,000 for a conversion so they've dropped their price for 45,000 17,000 which means they're capturing most of their market and they have a good profit with it and the big bonuses after they got operating here in the Philippines they discovered that the sea lane see this is more worldly with far as the seal on sea lanes are concerned they can ship things a lot cheaper from here in the camp on Australia they very quickly discovered that Thailand Singapore and Hong Kong all drive on the wrong side of the road like we do and say they started selling into this and just recently like crack the UK and they're now selling into the UK if you're in if you're in England and you want to support come out tomorrow you go to your dealer in England and he refers it to this Australian company which is based down got its operation in in the Philippines the conversions done is shipped to you in England just like that the world has become small the world has become easy to deal with and that's a good story a good story that company actually probably wouldn't exist today and continue operating writing where it was it was running at a loss it was going backwards and it would have ceased to exist but now so thriving and growing because has managed to move and shift but its cost based and as productivity that will stick to another kind mainly the Philippines typically this is what you see with a lot of businesses particularly like our carpet cleaner and all those sort of businesses you're seeing specialized people being been being hired in a team situation guys like the web and database developer down in the left-hand corner there the marketing quarter if I mean telemarketing an appointment setting person I doubt a minor or a researcher setting things up bookkeeper an accounts receivable salesperson assistant your personal assistant of course yet helping you and a team leader who's also the social media was a typical of the teams and then a team of whatever it is you special to me whether specializing in whether it be drafting an engineering law accounting it doesn't matter what it is that in sales telesales it doesn't matter all those teams of things are here and growing rapidly as I said currently 1.2 million Filipinos employed in this industry the growth rate overall it's just over twenty percent the growth rate in the Australian sector is currently running between thirty and forty percent a year it's absolutely massive I've lived here full time for three years I've been seriously in operating here for six years and I've had Filipinos working for me for 10 years so I've been doing it for a while and I've really learned how to do it so this webinar is part 1 of a 3 part series in my next webinar I'm going to discuss your culture differences and management techniques that help maximize the productivity of your Filipino team and in the final of the series the final webinar I'm going to discuss the seven different ways you can engage services or people and between the three webinars she'll get a no good overview of how you can do it and go about this great thing so many fail to maximize this opportunity because they don't really know what that they don't know my intention is to address that I also conduct a a three-day intensive business learning tours first of all I take you on an amazing offshoring an entrepreneurial journey you're going to see all the different ways that
