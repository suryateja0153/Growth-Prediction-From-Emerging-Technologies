 so next up i'd like to welcome lee constantino to the stage she's a science fiction writer the author of pop pakka lips and his short story Johnny Apple drone verse the FAA which appeared in the fabulous anthology hieroglyphs stories and visions for a better future by today and paperback he's also an assistant professor of English at university of maryland college park and i believe lee has a story for us is my mic on yet working okay so i can i could should I read it from here or at the podium whatever you prefer I'm going to come up and quiz you afterwards okay um let me let me read it from the podium sure it's sort of appropriate for the story yeah so as my doubling up okay so said said I am a literary scholar and also a science fiction writer but i think i was invited here today to be a science fiction writer and to talk about what algorithms will know in 2100 and of course the answer is I don't know what algorithms will know in 2100 so I decided instead to write a story about what they'll know and I'll it's very short and I'll read it and it's modeled on if you know JM Coetzee's book the lot lots of animals which was also collected in elizabeth costello you'll see that i'm totally ripping him off for the form of this on a warm thursday afternoon in december 2115 evan all good decided to manifest in human drag being pseudo embodied could of course be disagreeable you cut yourself off from your etiquette expert system you were reduced to receiving nudges designed to operate on an emulation of a five-dimensional sensorium such primitive nudges were only partly effective and made avoiding social awkwardness difficult but hundreds of subjective hours of anthropological study had taught eben that people sometimes preferred a little awkwardness sure you wanted to avoid uncanny valley at all costs no one likes to creep but you also didn't want to come across as tutoring slick at the appointed hour Evan manifested on fifteenth Street in Washington DC historical capital of the second and third American Republic's brees tickled the emulated nerve endings of his arm his virtual body tugged by what felt like gravity crushed the spongy soles of his dress shoes Evan made a show of nodding at pedestrians in whose networks in Syria he was visible of waiting for the building's glass door to slide open for him he introduced himself at the registration desk made small talk he hoped would be friendly but not needy joked knowingly about his inability to shake the hands of his hosts sort of funny right he said haha they replied after the first panel haven't found himself at a glass podium facing a room of twenty-something staffers academics journalists local retirees and a handful of emulated onlookers he summoned a teleprompter and cleared his throat thanks for inviting me he said or should I say thanks for submitting a request to borrow my system resources for the afternoon the audience's laughter was impatient no one was in the mood for rhetorical gimmicks this was a serious crowd Evan swallowed nervously it is hard to believe he said that the last time the new america foundation held gathering on the tyranny of algorithms a hundred years ago respectable people didn't believe in ghosts to be sure our predecessors sometimes metaphorically compared algorithms to ghosts indeed the novelist on whose media history i am modeled did so himself on one occasion but when they talked about ghosts they were invoking a theological tradition that saw the essence of the human the defining dimension of personhood as residing in an immaterial soul at best the more imaginative among them debated whether digital computers might eventually develop Souls it's hard to believe that the inhabitants of the 21st century were so limited but I've spent thousands of subjective hours studying the results of our best historical models and turning those results into game environments composed in the world building style of my biological forerunner and it's true that's really how they thought about their future the expression tyranny of algorithms says everything you need to know about the assumptions underlying your way of thinking the danger the fear was that something inhuman an algorithm a set of rules process a diabolical thing something or someone very much like me might take on human qualities they were convinced that if they embedded ubiquitous sensors into their environment if they network the resulting databases if they unleash the machine learning systems upon those databases political miracles or nightmares would emerge new economic laws would appear from thin air political revolutions would be quick and bloodless good software would grow on bushes but whatever happened algorithms would be in the driver's seat it is perhaps an understandable mistake for them to have made even that their automobiles used to literally have something called a driver's seat which was a kind of chair where a non emulated human operator made decisions about how quickly and in what direction a physical vehicle should travel today it is perfectly obvious to us that our predecessors were transforming fundamentally political questions questions about political Constitution governance and action into narrowly technological questions they understood concepts such as path dependency well enough they intellectually knew what ghosts were but they did not believe if you could travel back in time and speak to them they would literally not understand what every 22nd century school child knows that the tyranny of algorithms is nothing other than the tyranny of the past over the present and here Evan paused looking up to confront the audience's eyes and suddenly found himself unable to complete his remarks as scripted his words seemed intolerably trite a warmed-over version of myriad outdated worked over status updates he sighed a hundred years ago he said deciding now to ad-lib I would have been regarded as a haunting a specter an unnatural creature a science-fiction monster I would have been the ghost his teleprompter flashed angrily suggesting he transitioned back to his prepared script but he ignored the suggestion as you may know he said I'm a composite an emulated human constructed from the public writing and private Diaries of my namesake a midlist science fiction writer and historical novelist whose major distinction was being an especially prolific graefe maniac and life lager but I am NOT the ghost I am instead haunted by ghosts by the person I am told I once was I am haunted by history by legacy systems old machines and ossified social processes you invited me to give you the algorithms point of view on what algorithms meant in the opening decades of the 21st century but how am I supposed to know I spend my subjective hours poring over reports created by half sentient quantum mechanical historical simulations younger smarter better-looking algorithms whose inner workings I will never understand you invited me here to reassure you but I have no comforting words to offer I am haunted we are all haunted by history and the best we can do is build new and better hauntings atop the old ones we can only hope that when we ourselves invariably become ghosts our tyranny is less cruel less bloodthirsty less ignorant than those of our predecessors but I cannot say I'm optimistic 100 pairs of eyes each outfitted with shining media contacts looked up at Evan now sensing that he had run out of things to say at first he thought he saw hostility boredom annoyance and skepticism and the sea of faces before him but then observing the ubiquitous glint of Twitter blue shining in their networked eyes he saw the truth they hadn't heard a single thing he'd said thank Thank You Lee that was wonderful uh okay so so is it ghosts all the way down its history all the way down i guess was the thought story had a thesis and i would deny it brought into court i would say that it's it's you know ghosts or a figure for a path dependency for locked in historical process i'm like the previous panel i think actually talked you know this sort of the irony is that in fact previous panel wasn't quite smart on these subjects and i think you know the idea that you know we're surrounded by these machines that we do not understand is something yeah akin to being haunted yeah i think it's a really compelling metaphor and it gets into it yeah a lot of the stuff that we talked about in that last panel that we essentially create these mystical or spiritual narratives around some of these systems and I you know I still wonder if that's inevitable or escapable I don't know if you have a thought on that I I think I think you're right what you were mentioning in the previous panel I think you're right to note that the logic of say statistical analysis or the logic of the scientific inquiry does not necessarily follow a narrative logic and when you're you know narrating a story you need actors or agents to perform actions and our kind of the rhetoric of ghosts or the rhetoric of gods you know has a very you know they've talked about path dependency there's a very long history of talking that way and we inherit or language in part and are stuck I think with a lot of these figures and become a me becoming conscious about them and how they work ripping ourselves from the familiar uses of such terms can be part of what history does learning about history does yeah I I was really struck as well with the notion of human drag and the the way the ways in which you already Siri does human drag sometimes right when you do these jokes or you watch the commercial or series talking to zooey deschanel or somebody and you know they're having this lively witty conversation and you try and do that it's not going to work unless you try really hard to summon that ghost and you know learn all the lines for both sides of the conversation but yeah I wonder if you could reflect a little bit more on the on that notion of putting on a persona you know that algorithms might might go into human drag but also that we are occasionally going into these sort of mixed or cyborg or computational performances as well I don't know I mean you know i'm fascinated by i guess the recent career of like scarlett johansson and the sort of the casting some casting director somewhere is convinced that he is the ultimate you know figure for the posthuman or the nonhuman you know and so she you know there was her it was under the skin and then let terrible but fascinating film Lucy where she plays someone who ends up using a hundred percent of her brain and and so I I do i do think there this is too loud I do think there are moments when you can say things like humans are increasingly at you know asked to behave like machines and this was the fear with say or the critique of like taylorism right like the sort of these you know sort of management systems that force people to behave in certain ways but i think more frequently what we're ending up with our machines that are being designed to put us at ease to to make us relax and to ignore them effectively and so for me like the important thing when I was like composing the story was thinking about in a sort of everyday life or that that level of the algorithm you know like a lot of the science fiction I love the most is not about these sort of these big questions right like you read a book like the I'm engage and the most interesting thing in the diamond age is you know the media tronic chopsticks you know the small detail that you know Stevenson says okay well if you have nanotechnology people are going to use this technology in the most pedestrian kind of ordinary lens yeah that that it's sort of the louis ck argument right that you know ten seconds after we got internet access on airplanes we started complaining about how terrible the internet access on the airplanes was and so right maybe maybe right now we're confronting a near future where our computation is becoming more and more visible more and more present but then at a certain point it's going to start to disappear I mean I think that's already yeah if you've noted like with Siri and with other systems like this it's already happening and you know to some degree most you know like you know I don't think that like like I give my laptop to my parents for instance and they are not sure what to do with it but I give them the ipad may seem to have a kind of intuitive sense of how to use it and so I think it's true that like increasingly the kinds of systems that will dominate our lives are the systems that we are studiously that are studiously kept from our view in some ways we thank you so much you
