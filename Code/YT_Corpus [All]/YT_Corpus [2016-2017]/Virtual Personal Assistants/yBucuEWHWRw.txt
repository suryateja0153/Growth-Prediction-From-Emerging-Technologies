 so hi everyone welcome welcome welcome to my very first ever Facebook live post and I'm quite nervous because I've had a few issues today with the internet not working i'm actually going live from my mobile signal at the moment because i've had so many issues with the internet here with virgin media today driving me mad i'm also a bit nervous because I've not really used to doing these broadcasts showing my face I've done quite a lot of webinars as you probably know but normally my face is off camera so do bear with me and I decided it's about time I got on with doing some of these kind of live broadcasts because I really really want to help you out in the group in the facebook group just a brief introduction to me if you don't already know I'm Tania Kurt and i'm a freelance virtual assistant an award-winning freelance virtual assistant and I chain pas executive assistants and administrators to set up as freelance virtual assistants so as you probably already know as well I love being a virtual assistant it's what allowed it's what's allowed me to work flexible hours and see my daughter grow up and earn more money in this time so I absolutely love it and I love to help other people as well who want to go follow in my footsteps so I'm as i said i'm recording this live in my facebook group but if you're watching on instagram or youtube i'm just going to hold up now this is my facebook group i hope you can read it probably because from my angle here it looks like mirror writing but um apparently it is in the right direction i think so hopefully you can read that this is the facebook group to come and join us for tips and vice and chat about becoming a freelance virtual assistant in the UK so starting from next week I'm going to be doing a little mini series of videos and it's going to be about helping you to overcome your procrastination and address what is stopping you from starting your be a business but for now this week because of popular demand lots and lots of people have been asking me for some linkedin tips so don't worry if you're completely new to the VA world and you're not using LinkedIn yet for your VA business or you know perhaps your VA business is still an idea germinating your mind so don't worry about that watch along with us anyway because you will learn something and you will be able to watch this recording access this recording and watch it again at like at a later date so first of all I want to start off by saying that LinkedIn like all social media is of course a form of networking and networking is the long game nothing happens overnight with networking so it's about building relationships it's about building trust and it's crucial because it is a long game it's crucial to start it as early as you can in your VA business so my favorite form of networking as some of you probably know is face-to-face networking I love face-to-face networking but if you can't do face-to-face networking linkedin is the next best thing and here are my top tips for using LinkedIn to market your business and find clients so before you do anything my first tip is if you're working full-time or if you're working part-time please please please check with your employer but they're okay with you and promoting yourself on LinkedIn as a virtual assistant that's the number one thing number to make sure that you have a photograph being on linkedin without a photograph is like going to a networking meeting wearing a paper bag over your head there's absolutely no point in it whatsoever nobody's going to want to communicate with you at all so please please please get a half-decent photo on suddenly looks reasonably professional and don't use a holiday snap don't use a selfie so um the next thing that you need to do is to review your professional headline and those are a couple of little lines that appear and your name in your LinkedIn profile and these are really really important and the reason why that's important is that when you like posts or you comment on posts or you share posts underneath your name those couple of little lines do appear so it's really important that that does say clearly what you do if it says virtual assistant that's really really good because people do search on linkedin using the term virtual assistant and once you've done that what you need to do is to actually brainstorm have a brainstorming session about who your ideal client is and your ideal client is not just anybody your ideal client is not just any small business owner marketing works much much much better if you can target it towards a particular particular section so if you do a brainstorming session and work out who you want to work with who do you want to target and when you've done that you need to rewrite your profile summary addressing yourself directly to your ideal client so that when they read it they recognize themselves and another thing that you need to do is once you've finished doing your profile summary you need to research and find examples of those ideal clients and then have a look and see where they're hanging out on linkedin what kind of groups are they in and try and join those groups linkedin groups are really really important because they're a way of connecting interacting with people that you're not already connected with so they're really really key for your LinkedIn strategy so what you want to be doing in those groups is doing things like posting useful information asking questions liking people's posts stop it starting to build up relationships with people in the group and don't just endlessly post links to your website or sales stuff you want to be posting around about 80% useful and interesting information and about twenty percent possibly even s at the beginning sales related stuff stuff that's directly linked to your website or your own blogs what you then need to do is to start sending connection requests to the people that you're looking at your profile you probably already know that people on LinkedIn can see sorry that when you go on to LinkedIn you can see who's been looking at your profile it's actually really really interesting to have a look and see who's been looking at it and you can start to send connection requests to those people because guess what they were looking at your profile because they were interested in you so if you think they might be an interesting person to you send them a connection request and I'm say probably maybe fifty percent at the time they'll probably accept that connection request and then also when people send you connection requests consider all of your connection requests before rejecting them you know unless you think they're going to be really spammy or something like that i would say accept them and the reason I'm saying this is because the search facility on linkedin is very very powerful and it becomes more and more powerful than more connections you have you can reach more people through that search facility if you have more connections and you can have up to 30,000 connections on LinkedIn so it's not likely going to reach that limit very anytime soon so in my opinion except as many requests as possible unless they're going to be spammers when you accept a connection request send them a message thanking them and asking them if there's anything you can do for them and then there's your target clients so when you come across people that you think might be potential clients you should tag them there's a tagging facility within LinkedIn where you can categorize people so that you can keep track of them and keep them all sort of listed in one place and and they can't see these tags but you can so you could take everyone for example with a tag called potential client or something like that so you can make sure that you go and you regularly check on these people and send the messages or like and share their posts don't become a stalker though because they might think that's a bit odd but you know you do want to be starting to come with these people and the number one rule with LinkedIn as I said with any form of networking is it's a long game it won't happen overnight it does take longer to build relationships when you're doing them purely online as opposed to face-to-face networking so that's why it's really really key to keep to start this as soon as you can the other rule is consistency you need to be doing little and often you know try and get on there every day or every other day and be active there's no point in going on there like once a month and just like spending a whole day on there and then not going near it again for a few weeks consistency is absolutely key so those are my top tips for LinkedIn if you've got any questions or comments do put a post or a comment on this post and I will answer all of them if you're watching on Instagram or were you watching the recording of the live post then just put your comments in and I will answer all of the comments that you put in and all of the questions and don't forget if you are watching on Instagram or YouTube this is the facebook group that you can join and become a virtual assistant in the UK we'd love to have you in the group tips advice and chat on becoming a freelance virtual assistant the other thing is once you join the group you can find out about my free webinar
