 we're talking about systemizing your business and offloading task so your VA can get them right so here's key number one it's context before content context before content so before you delegate a task you've got to make sure that your VA understands why the task matters what the big picture is and when it occurs so why the task matters you know if we this is really this is really important because when we do this by baba Baba good thing happens and if we don't do it above our bad like a mini why stack for your VA so they get the context where it fits into the big picture and then when we do it you know so we do this every time a new client comes aboard we do this every Thursday at 6am right just tell them why it matters how much fits when it happens ok you want to start with context first so that your people understand where it fits and why it matters so they can bring their best to the job and they don't make some mistakes it's like looking at the you know if I haven't come out a whole bunch of jigsaw pieces and trying to try to figure it out blind or looking at the the cover of the back of the big jigsaw boxing going oh okay this fits here I can do it now you know what else I found when you share the why behind a task sometimes the hell changes but if they know the why they can you know now they can use common sense but they can't use common sense if you've said i want you to click here and send that but if you give them some context then they can kind of step up and be you know have show common sense and leadership because they understand that even though the house change they get the goal they get the out and they get the context and they can just rock it well I remember used to work with this guy called gran who used to tell this story about he was walking along the around a park one day just going for kind of a morning walk and there was two guys who you know in Council workmen like gardener uniforms and one of them they're kind of walking just behind each other like a couple steps apart the first guy would had a shovel and he'd dig a hole and then he'd walk on on the other person was like two or three steps back this person would come in to kind of fill the hole back in so its front person digs a hole back person fills the hole back in and they just did this every 5 meters for a while and my friend grant just couldn't understand it and he goes so I don't like I've been watching you know first co fills in the hole I've dig the hole second guy fills in the hole I'd like what's the point and and according to grant the the person that the front said you know there's actually three of us usually in the person in the middle usually plants a plant seeds for a flower in this hole but she's sick today so we're just doing our job now clearly i don't think that story if it really happened but that's what happens when we get content but we don't get context so before we delegate a task i want you to share pip share with your VA why it matters where it fits and when it happens so they can do a great job for you context before content
