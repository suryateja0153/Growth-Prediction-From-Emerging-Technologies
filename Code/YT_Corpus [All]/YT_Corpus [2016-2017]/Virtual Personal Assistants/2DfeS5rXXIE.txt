 I started looking for a virtual receptionist when I was losing sales because people weren't leaving a message if I got a phone call and I was on the wine with somebody and somebody else rang through they would get the voicemail message that I had set up and they wouldn't leave a message they would just move on to the next business I what I found that people were calling other companies and the reason that I found that out is that the system that I used at that time to take the voice mail would record the phone number of the person who called so even if they didn't leave a message I would still call them back and say hey I missed your call i'm just returning your calls or anything i can help you with and probably half the time they'd say oh I call somebody else and already ordered what I needed because I really needed to get it done I mean how can you not recommend Ruby it's like if you're a business owner and you're by yourself or there's maybe two of you it will make your life so much better that is the key
