 impact of emerging technologies emerging technologies refer to technical innovations which represent progressive developments within a field for competitive advantages first artificial intelligence or AI artificial intelligence deal with developing machines and software with human-like intelligence such as X persistence work computers have been programmed to make decisions based on information they are giving as in medical expert systems where fish's illness can be diagnosed based on symptoms input robotics refer to technology that deal will automated machines that can be programmed to take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes all resemble humans in appearance and behavior languages computers are programmed to give interpretation of different human languages and they are spoken to them game-playing computers are developed to play games against human players impacts that artificial intelligence can have on everyday life increased leisure time robotic vacuum can clean floors without human intervention people can leave them running while as they enjoy extra leisure time a cure prediction of whether artificial intelligence is used to examine weather data more accurately than humans so that it can predict bad weather and automatically ishes warning of approaching storms increased personal safety artificial intelligence software is used in modern home alarm systems to detect intruders then automatically errors the police improve medical care robotic surgery assistants are being used in surgical operations to quickly and accurately pass the correct tools to doctors the few seconds saved in the process may save patients life safer of transport driveless trains already exist in some countries as well as self-driving cars and cars capable of self parking already exist they could drastically reduce road accidents because machines avoid human errors laughs hissing concentrations and defects in sight among other shortcomings vision enhancement low vision enhancement system uses video technology through headset connected to a computer images are projected inside the headset in front of the eyes objects appear closer for the user of the system night vision enhancement amplifies infrared light and visible light in order to see images in darkness in this process large Souls is captured and passed through an image intensifier tube to produce a clearer image used by the military to carry out surveillance at night biometrics refers to authentication techniques that rely on measurable physical characteristics of an individual that can be automatically each check there are several types of biometric identification schemes first fingerprint is the analysis of an individual's unique fingerprints second our recognition we have retina is the analysis of the capillary vessels located at the back of the eye and we have iris if the analysis of the colored ring that surrounds the ice puter third voice recognition is the analysis of the tone pitch cadence and frequency of a person's voice biometrics details such as fingerprints or voice matches are captured and stored within computer system so that they can be used to identify the person later on biometrics are used in place of passwords and physical locks as a means of secure the computer would analyze your fingerprint to determine who you are and based on your identity authorized you different levels of access access levels could include the ability to use credit card information to make electronic purchases biometrics have advantages over other methods of security such as passwords and keys that could be lost forgotten or stolen impacts of biometric on everyday life better airport security iris recognition is already in use in some airports travelers have their eyes scan into a system and this detai is later matched up when the person is performing Airport checks increased building security fingerprint access to buildings have been replacing the older methods of locks and keys these methods ensure that only authorized people can enter restricted buildings or rooms secure mobile phones some mobile phones use a fingerprint reader to identify the true owner of the hoon and to protect the valuable data that it contains it will not unlock for a fingerprint that doesn't match reduce car theft cars use fingerprints to unlock their doors or start the engine for the fingerprint that is reserved only this makes the car harder to see robotics concerned with the design creation operation and application of robots and computer systems necessary for their control sensory feedback and information processing we are used in various jobs such as disposing of bombs spray painting cleaning up nuclear waste exploration robots used to explore extreme environments where humans cannot visit these environments due to lack of oxygen and high pressure or heat levels such as inside volcanoes planets the depth of the ocean manufacturing Rovers used to perform repetitive and high-precision shots is much faster and more efficient as aim production lines packing and welding carrier robots use the moving heavy objects such as in installing large engines moving pallets of items carrying heavy loads over dangerous terrain as in the meditators are used in homes to perform cleaning tasks such as Dracula impacts of robotics on everyday life increase personal time they free up more time for us to spend as we wish this could mean more time spent at work or for more enjoyable activities such as socializing more efficient manufacturing products can be manufactured much faster and cheaper this means that companies can make more products at less cost which means greater business profits on the other hand loss of jobs due to hire and chief of productivity robots are taking over the manufacturing jobs that used to be carried out by humans this means that humans are missing out on employment on assembly line and factory work safer working environment robot can safely carry out tasks that are too dangerous for humans such as spraying cars with toxic pain defusing bombs on battlefields and search-and-rescue operations and building destroyed by earthquakes quantum cryptography cryptography is the science of making a message not clearly understood or expressed to any unauthorized user this is referred to as encryption so encryption means the sender usually computer uses secret key or code to encrypt a packet of information before it is sent over the network to another computer and receiver another computer of that packet at the other end uses that key to decode it or understanding quantum cryptography is based on the use of photons that is tiny packets of life and our physical quantum properties to produce a cryptography system that is unbreakable this is because photos oscillate in various directions and produces sequence of random beasts across the optical network this Hatford the security of data being transmitted over fiber-optic cables it is based on the laws of physics rather than mathematics one term cryptography is produced by using LEDs or light emitting diodes and source of creating photons one at a time instead of arm polarized light through the use of polarization filters we can force the photons to take one state or another or polarizing them by assigning barnico to each photons we can transmit a secret key once the key is transmitted coding and encoding method can take place in paths of quantum encryption or every de la completely secure voting securing votes with quantum encryption methods ensures that they cannot be tampered with or change completely secure bank transfers any electronic transfer of money such as at ATMs or buying goods online will be completely secure completely secure communication using quantum cryptography to secure the messages would eliminate the risk of them being read or held by an authorized yield this can be used by the military completely secure personal information such as health records then get is and other types from hackers and other people wishing to commit identity theft crimes computer-assisted translation or ket cattail where a human translator uses computer software to help in the translation process test software can reduce the amount of time that the translation takes the term CAD covers a range of tools spell checkers either welcome to word processing software or add-on programs can automatically flag up spelling errors and suggest translation of misspelled words grammar chatters you don't welcome to word processing software or add-on programs language search engines software our internet based systems which allow translators to select the language and enter the text they want translated in minority managers allow translators to manage their own terminology bank in an electronic whole translation memory tools consisting of a database of text segments in a source language and those translations and one or more target languages impacts of computer-assisted translation are everyday life more accurate documents misspelled wars can be quickly corrected to produce an error-free document using spell checkers a more multilingual society anyone with an internet connection can access translation tools which makes accessing other languages much easier than in the past and makes it easier for people to learn these new languages quicker and more efficient translations foreign visitors to countries can be communicated with much easier through these CAD tools they are especially useful in pieces like embassies where a wide range of foreign visitors mean to communicate with local officials about problems or ask for advice 3d and holographic imaging hologram is a physical structure that flag slide into an image when it is applied to technology it allows 3d images to be produced the hologram is produced by for splitting visibly half of the light is reflected off the object onto a photographic plate the other half of the light is effective of a mirror and onto the same photographic plate the holographic image is produced where the two light beams meet on the photographic paper images are made to appear three-dimensional and to actually have tips impacts of 3d imaging on everyday life improve secure where credit cards articles software and some bank knows include Holograms as a way of trying to prevent Falls topic is being created where Holograms are difficult and expensive to reproduce better movie experience using 3d imaging with on the production of movies provides the viewer with a much more immersive experience 3d movie is required you to wear special glasses for the effect to take place the glasses project two images shot at different angles one indicia and your brain puts them together as one 3d image greater data storage it is thought that the technology behind holograms will eventually be used to provide the means to store large amounts of people this that use holographic players have the potential to hold a massive people time terabytes virtual reality is a computer technology that 50 Keys an environment will or imagined and simulates a user's physical presence in this artificial environment in a way that allows the user to interact with it virtual realities use software along with data goggles sensor suits detail gloves or helmets to artificially create sensory experience which can include sight touch hearing and smell eye Google's these produced the 3d images that make up the artificial world the goggles project slightly different views into each eye and this who's your brain into thinking that the scene is 3d special gloves these gloves detect your hand and finger movements which are input into a computer and processed when users touch who use items in the virtual world the computer can carry out these commands and make them happen this allows the user to interact with the virtual world and perform tasks such as moving objects or switching on lights etc powerful computer is needed to create the virtual environment and to process output data sent into the system by the users action for example the computer produced graphics that appear as goals our goal scenes an object such as cheese impacts of virtual reality on everyday life you pull medical surgeons surgeons can be trained using virtual patients this allows them to practice over and over until they have perfected a particular surgery without risk to a real patient larger and stronger buildings virtual building's allow architects to walk around to experience while the building would look like when completed and check for potential errors before the actual building is constructed virtual buildings will also be able to be tested against factors such as earthquakes to see what effects they would have on the current design this allows architects to modify designs quickly and GP and will potentially allow for the development of much larger and safer buildings than we currently have training in dangerous situation virtual reality can be used for training in dangerous situation where it is impossible to practice the real thing more realistic education virtual reality can gives students the opportunity to learn in a much more interactive way for example astronomy students can learn about the solar system by engaging with objects in the virtual environment they could look around stars move planets and track the orbits of comets
