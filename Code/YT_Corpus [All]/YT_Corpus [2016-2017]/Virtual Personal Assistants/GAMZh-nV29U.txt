 good morning see if this is working good morning let's do a little better it's early you're all drunk and hungover come on a little better so I'm a little nervous today I have to admit because I'm a little out of my comfort zone so I was talking to my teenage son who doesn't talk before this presentation he said dad where'd he what are you presenting and I said well I'm talking about the future of travel I'm talking about how technology is gonna impact the way the next generation travels anyway well that's cool and I said well no it's it is really cool and talked to him a little about some of stuff and he goes on that this is interesting he goes what are you gonna wear and I said I don't wear a suit and tie and he goes okay if you want to look old and so I said are all right what should I wear and so I helped him pick heep helped me pick my wardrobe which is what's making me nervous but it is important because what we're seeing is a change in the traveling public so you've got in five years forty-seven percent of the workforce will be millenials which is a change to how we need to think about the way that they'll think about and by 2017 they'll have as much buying power and travel as as as any other generation so we have to start thinking about what that means in terms of how does that change our thinking because if you're like me this is what a rock concert used to look like right it was all lighters ready to go this is what a rock concert looks like today and when you talk about the rate of change the pace of change that's out there when I first saw this picture I didn't think much about it because it's st. Peter's Square at the Vatican when in 2005 Pope Benedict was announced and again I thought it was an interesting picture there are a lot of people but I didn't really think about it until I saw 2013 when Pope Francis was announced it's a dramatic change in the way that we think about our environment the way that we think about technology and its impact the way that we move through daily life so what happens in an Internet minute if you look at some of the data it's truly astounding it's amazing a hundred and fifty million emails sent in a minute 21 million whatsapp messages sent in a minute in one minute Sabre will book 2,000 passengers that's 30 people booked on a trip every second and they have to in order to do that we have to process almost 700,000 XML messages in that same minute which is a billion a day and those data that continues to grow is creating opportunity for us creating opportunity for the industry to make better use of the data that we have on hand and turn it into actionable analytics what's crazy about that is for every baby that's born we activate five new smart phones so we're growing the digital usage in a really dramatic way and in a way that has the potential to really impact all of our lives this is 2015 the data around how many people utilize mobile applications on their phone and their smartphone while traveling so if you look at China nearly 100% of the people of the Chinese people that travel utilize their digital phone some of the things that they do 81% use it for navigation 67% use it to look for things that are near them activities so you're looking at a group of people that's actively engaging with their digital environments to try to put in place experiences that will turn into things that are meaningful to them and by 2030 we'll have 1 billion more travelers so you're adding a billion people to the mix because with the rise of the middle class and population growth we're getting to a place where we're really adding complexity to the environment but with that complexity comes the need for us to find ways to simplify it find ways to take this which is an average day that is an actual screenshot of flight planning software for for Sabre that shows where planes are over the world so we have to deal with complexity and I think sometimes we don't take enough credit as an industry for some of the things that we've already done that are truly innovative things that are truly advancing the way that we think about things let's take an example New York to London New York to London on any given day you take there are almost two trillion fare and rule combinations in the fares database there are five billion of those that are specific to that origin and destination three billion on that same day six million that are actually available so six million fare and rule combinations that are actually available and you have to take that down to 500 you want to present back to the consumer in a transparent way so they can make a good strong buying decision so that they can find the one that's right for them and you have to do that in under three seconds because consumers won't wait for you so that's what Sabre does we take that complexity and we turn it into something that's usable and that complexity is what's making things easier some of you remember the snowstorms in New York in 2011 and JetBlue stuck a plane on the tarmac for seven hours seven hours because they didn't have recovery modules in place to allow them to take what is a big data problem which is how do I move things around to put my airline back together consumers hate to hear this I have bad news for you as travelers your last on the list something goes pear-shaped you have to move aircraft and crew first it to the passengers last so you have to have a recovery module in place to do that good news for JetBlue is there was a snowstorm Jonas that just blew through they did have the recovery modules implemented and they were the first airline to start flying again so they fixed their problem and similarly in the hospitality space we're having to find new ways to connect with travelers because shoppers in the hospitality space are looking for experiences Instagram Abul snapchat Abul moments right and so they start with not the rate screen they don't look for the availability screen where do they go the photo gallery so we finally had to do things like embed the booking engine inside the photo gallery so that you don't have to go to the photo gallery click through and then go back to the place where it all started embed that experience as you move through the process and technologies allowing us to do that and so when we start talking about tourism in 2023 what does that kind of feel like a billion new travelers the idea that we've got all these new hubs the change in Europe from the fact that the new airport in Istanbul the expectation is that it's going to go from 42 million travelers today to a hundred and fifty million travelers changing the dynamic of the hub structure in all of Europe so I was trying to think of how do i how do I explain that change and so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take you on a trip we're gonna go on a on a trip together actually in 2023 and see what that feels like so we'll start by preparing that's new so if you're like most people that came to ITB for the first time this year what's the first thing you did you got lost because it's so big and there's so many different halls that you ended up trying to pick and find your way through right so in the future oculus rift which is what's up here which is a virtual reality device there are already a number of uses for it but in the future you could potentially before coming to ITB go download the ITB service where they will have already walked through for you they can show you and you can virtually experience IT before you ever get here because if you're like me I love to travel I love going new places but I don't like looking like a tourist I like to pretend that I fit in I know that I don't all the time but I like to pretend that I'm that I'm experienced already and be a virtual reality you'll have the ability to do that in fact Marriott's already done it they've created several virtual reality trips that you can take one of which is to their Hawaii property you can actually walk around the entire property you can see the beaches you can experience the the way it would feel to be there and people sometimes ask me around the virtual reality thing won't that decrease travel won't that cause people to feel like they can just virtually experience the trip without actually experiencing the trip and the reality is now I think it's the reverse it's exactly the opposite because what it means is it takes you to a place where you want to go so that you can experience the smells the tastes the sounds the sights for yourself so virtual reality it's actually here and will becoming more digital assistants will help me book my trip no longer need a personal assistant just need my digital assistant bad news for all of you that use Gmail by the way Google is already reading your email and so if you give your digital assistant the ability to read your email they have the ability to begin to book things just on message that you're having back and forth I think if you look at the application world today so if you look at the App Center the App Center is filled with apps that are really just artificial way to help us communicate and connect more effectively and that's going to become more and more embedded in both email and in messaging applications where apps that have have sat around the communication component will become part of it so we're ready to go now we prepared we've done our virtual reality tour we've got our trip planned time for me to head to the airport I need to make sure before I pack though that I look and check the weather the change in biometrics and wearables is going to be dramatic you're no longer gonna have and I actually I would I would point out that when you talk talking about wearables and things like that we had in 2015 1.4 billion smartphones 233 million tablets and 75 million wearables that number by 2020 it is predicted to be six billion so when you're looking at the number of people six billion is the same as everybody in Germany everybody in the United States and everybody in China owning a digital device and they're getting better which is pushing wearables more aggressively into the end of the mix and they'll begin to use our biometrics more effectively my digital assistant tells me it's time to go to the airport what's next want to take a look at where we're headed want to know if she's gonna push me a message hey by the way your flights been canceled but you're in luck I've already rebooked you we're good and again all without me having to request it it's going to be a more push environment you're not going to be today it's really requests to reply on your mobile device very soon especially in the travel world you're going to be in no longer a request for apply but in a push environment you'll be an environment where the applications that you interact with are interacting with you proactively get to the airport check in with my fingerprint biometrics are already in use unfortunately the underlying infrastructure for the use of biometrics and the data collection facilities aren't quite there yet but by 2023 we should have the capability to make sure that fingerprints and other biometrics are easily captured and maintained and mapped against things like your passport so the ability for us to utilize and streamline things like security border control etc all the things that make it simpler for travelers will be in place we could even move past fingerprints because there are embedded ECG the electrocardiogram things did you know that everybody's heartbeat beats slightly different it's a very independent thing much like a fingerprint there's the way to track that and identify you just based on your heartbeat things like the Apple watch already do some interesting things that make things simpler so if you use Apple pay as an example once you put your Apple watch on and log in once with your password you have to log in again why because the watch knows whether you've taken it off or not so it knows that it's still you so as you begin to ease through some of these things that that today are cumbersome having to constantly add my password the fact that my kids don't think it's strange at all that I can log in that they can log into their iPhone with their fingerprint whereas my mother think that's magic she's she she literally thinks it's magic I mean she's she's of the old generation also so so much of the old generation that she has email and she has some text capability but every Friday she calls me because my kids don't talk as I mentioned they only text or email she calls me and goes did the kids email me I go yes she is what they say because she's an email because she's older and so she's got to get used to but but we won't think anything about thumb prints or heart beats to identify us in the future because it'll become natural and like we said half of the workforce will be Millennials very quickly so it's going to change and even the idea of holograms on your phone are coming I don't know if it'll make my seven year window but some of the technology that's there exists today it's just super expensive to be able to begin to have holographic capability on your phones so you get in flight a way to check out again oculus rift this is a VR fully 3d immersed environment so watching a movie no longer on the small screen in front of me but utilizing a technology that I may carry with me or that might be provided to me will change that long haul experience the abeer and to really escape my environment perhaps get notified by my Bluetooth luggage bag that I made the flight but it didn't this one's slightly annoying to me because it makes me realize that I could actually find out on my way from here to Sydney Australia that my bag didn't make it rather than finding out when I got there and being annoyed for a couple of minutes I now get to be annoyed for 20 hours on the way there however I guess it's still important to know that I could be in sync with my bag this example actually allows you to just see that you didn't get your bag as you're pulling away from the gate and actually activate the app that puts a red screen on the luggage that says lost tells people that it's lost which again maybe is helpful but I'm not exactly sure and then some of you have seen because there's an airline here in Germany that's rolling out the Ramada the electronic bag tag so you download your the app you utilize your check-in capability you sync Bluetooth to the bag and it automatically puts your bag tag on the bag the good thing about the bag tag too is that it's immune to humidity and rain and you can't tear it off so the less likely that your bag gets misplaced because it couldn't read the bag tag and it's the same size as the current paper bag tags so you're in a good place no matter what and all of this is a big data problem so I just want to talk for a second about we're talking a lot about the point-of-sale kind of things the things that we all see but underlying that is really the need to take all of the data that's created inside this wonderful industry and make it usable and actionable and that takes the ability to bring that data into a meaningful form and create technology that begins to lift that data up one level so that it can then be utilized in in really tough mathematical problems from time to time to become usable to the end consumer so let's head to the hotel scared to death about this but I know it's coming my autonomous car comes with no driver to pick me up because it knows where I'm going it knows how to get there the current estimates are that the biggest user of autonomous cars will eventually be uber so we'll get used to in the next seven years hitting our uber feed and having a car pull up with no driver which again scares me to death but seems like it's in that seven year horizon get to the hotel this is already happening digital key cards get to the hotel Hotel knows you're there don't have to stop at the desk because I've already loaded my payment information the hotel automatically checks me in because I've gotten my app that says I'm already assigned to room 704 walk to room 704 as soon as I check in with a digital key card or open my door with the digital key card on that first time the hotel knows I'm there so they don't lose the human interaction because hotel yers are worried about losing that touch point with you because they want a chance to upsell they want a chance to offer you would you like the free breakfast in the morning they want a chance to offer you those things but now they know so as I get their login to the app check in at the door the first thing that happens is a ring from manager hi this is the hotel manager mr. web we're glad to have you is there anything I can get you extra by the way before you unpack all your things I have a suite available for only 29 more dollars if you'd like me to switch you to that I can right so the opportunity is still there for all the things that all that interaction that's been in place it's just that it's going to move forward in the process certainly my digital assistant will send me things based on my preferences in my phone so she sent me the fact that the Foo Fighters happened to be playing that night easily allowing me to pick up something but driven really by the fact that my phone knows that I've listened to the Foo Fighters more than I've listened to any other band and it just so happens they're playing so all of those things that your phone is collecting about you all the time with movies you watch what music you listen to can all be utilized to focus on how to make your experience more meaningful more personalized and more scalable so then ahead to IP ITV head to the conference love this exists today RFID chip nametags so I walk in log in to my phone ties my contact information to the application and so when I walk into the room if I walk over here it'll tell me that Claudia is in my contact list pop-up any personal information about her might also tell me to either go talk to her because she's a contact that I need to talk to or might buzz a little differently to say stay away but it's the idea that I no longer have to try to remember why I met you last year at ITV because it's gonna tell me in my phone why I met you last year at ITB and who you work for and what your phone number is and as I move around the room it'll change then we head to dinner because Claudia and I decided we want to go to dinner end up with our iPad that has the menu on it that probably tells me hey been watching you lately you should get the fish not the steak I of course ignore that get the steak anyway and then we moved to a beyond expense world which is pay electronically and that automatically goes to my expense report so no more walking back to my assistant and dumping receipts on the table so the idea of the current expense reporting system in the future we're moving to a beyond expense world because you no longer be buying collecting and logging things you'll just be buying and automatically logging that in a digital world and so I think as you begin to think about that it changes the way that we think about how we move through that process so then we go back to the hotel I hate looking like a tourist so I've set up my Maps application to connect to my smart watch my smart watch knows to tell me one buzz for left two buzzes for right so I can walk back to the hotel without ever having to look one buzz two buzz right so I look like I know what I'm doing even though I don't get back to the hotel and all of a sudden my temperature set perfectly for me the low lights already on the curtains are drawn my musics playing and it's a personalized experience just for me based on what I like and what I want and not such a genera fied experience and then it's time to head back home I get a reminder I need to get my kids something my assistants very good so if I could leave you with just a couple of things it's that really this is all driven by data and there's a ton of it out there today the problem is it's just not all actionable so we're getting to a place where we need business intelligence applications that allow us to take big data and turn it into actionable analytics that allow us to interact with people in a new more effective personalized way and trust me we're moving out of a place where we all talked about the fact that you need to be mobile first now you can kind of get over that and just say we need to be mobile only because all of the devices that people are utilizing today are becoming more mobile the idea of the iPad pro as an example which is a 12 inch iPad that has a keyboard that you can utilize it's rapidly replacing along with the Microsoft Surface tablets is is rapidly replacing not just laptops but desktops so the idea of not thinking mobile only is huge mistake and then we're really looking for efficient personalization because you can get a personalized experience today it's just not scalable so hotels do a good job at the high end if you go to the ritz-carlton they will do a really good job of giving you personalized service but you should be able to get that personalized service at any hotel they just don't have a way to scale it yet because they need too many people and lastly you'll just be connected through automation the entire time really the idea of not being connected to your travel traveler from the start of the trip to the end of the trip will will effectively go away you'll be in constant communication and a constant messaging platform and it'll all be consumer eyes because consumers are ultimately going to lead us to where we need to go it's already gotten to a place where the consumerization of travel is happening it just needs the infrastructure to catch up but we're all being led by the fact that crowdsourcing around the way that we think about travel in the future is happening so this is true the futures already arrived everything I showed you in the presentation exists today in some form there's some capability around it so the future is here it's just not fully distributed and evenly distributed it's what Sabre is trying to do is help it be more effectively distributed and I think what you'll find is that we're at a rapid pace of change and if you're not caught up today the chances of getting caught up are very very unlikely so I would suggest that everybody make as much effort as possible to get in front of the in front of the curve because the pace in which we're seeing change in the environment and then travel and tourism industry is dramatic so thank you very much have a great rest of your day
