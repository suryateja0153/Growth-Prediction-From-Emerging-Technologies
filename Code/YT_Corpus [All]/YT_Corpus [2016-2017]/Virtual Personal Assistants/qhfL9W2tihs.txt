 hey everyone I'm JJ ramberg and it is time now to answer one of your business questions exclusively for open forum let's get our Board of Directors in here to help us out Jim Blasingame is the president and founder of the Small Business Network and the host of the small business advocate show and serial entrepreneur Bill Rancic is here as well you may remember him as the winner of the first season of nbc's the apprentice good to see both of you guys here on the set that's great to hear hi JJ all right let's get to the question it's about company culture we have linguists all over the world and we also have employees in several different locations so my question is how you engage and create a culture when you have beautiful employees I love this question because culture is so important and everyone talks about telecommuting and working all of the books I find it very hard to have employees who don't work in the office with me to instill this culture and you do this value of your companies all over the country so how do you do this well I think it's simple you have to embrace technology and there are so many different outlets where you can get everyone together virtually it's almost like being in the same room you have to embrace that and I think the companies that are succeeding in that arena are the ones who are saying hey maybe there's a different way we can get everyone together and maybe you do an annual event or semi annual event to you know create face-to-face culture which is also important but it starts at the top and it works its way down yeah I think at least for me I feel like at some point during a year you have to get everyone together whether that's your holiday party or an off-site or something what do you think well if you think about it don't we all work remotely I mean I have employees people in my office my little company are no more than 50 feet away and yet we may be together all day long without seeing each other so really I think it's really not much different whether they're on the other side the planet our next door one of the most important things I think is too is all the values Napoleon once said that a soldier will fight long and hard for a bit of colored ribbon your ribbon your flag are your values don't be afraid to demonstrate your values explain them identify them and lead with them your people will follow if you do that whether they're next door or on the other side of the planet but I also think it comes to hiring the right people right you know you gotta hire the right people who can thrive in that type of an environment because some people they can't handle all that rope you know what I mean they need to be micromanaged and they like that structure so you have to find the right employees who can handle working remotely and then and then expectations that's a big deal because if you have to make sure that they everyone knows what you expected them everyone has to deliver you can't sustain success right and so you have to make sure they know what that is and knowing those expectations are important for everyone but especially if there are farther away there for their remote I just a quick last question you both have had multiple businesses have you had similar cultures and all your businesses I think so because I think the culture the culture and the values comes from the leader and and you know the especially Millennials they want they want to align with people whose culture and values are like theirs and and so they're looking for that these days and and so if they don't like yours I don't think you should be ashamed of whatever you have present that if they like it they'll work with you yeah we're not for me it's always been a family environment and some people will disagree with that but I think you've got to create the right environment for people and give them the opportunity to thrive and I never understand business owners who create a hostile work environment they think it brings out the best in people I disagree it's all about the people i mean before we move on I just want to ask you have this coffee sitting right here in front of you except Ellis well this is a it's actually an incredible program that I've been working with for the last few years with the folks at Intuit QuickBooks it's called small business big game and we are giving a small business owner a fully paid fully produced commercial that's going to run during the biggest football game of the year so this year the winner we are announcing this week is death wish coffee it's a young man in upstate New York typical story like every small business he put his life savings in the line he moved home with his mom I mean risked it all and I'm februari seventh his life is going to change because over a hundred million people are going to see his 30-second commercial jackpot well you know what the folks at into a quick books are all about fueling success of small business and this is another example of how they do that and I can't wait for this commercial the rug how big is this company right now right now it's nine employees but he's proud going to quadruple that company where he is preparing as we speak and he's ready how many entries were there over 10,000 and and you know I'd love to see this guy get into target and walmart and start getting
