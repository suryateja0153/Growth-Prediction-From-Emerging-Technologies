 okay so um this is a video that I told you guys about that was going to make this video companies this blog post I made right here away x-ray an in-depth tutorial and it's called how to make thousands laying in bed with nothing but a laptop and I called it this because that's exactly what I did when I first started using it I was laying down in bed with my laptop started to check it out and you know Here I am maybe you know not to not too long later and I've got a decent sized shipment going out about two thousand the profit and almost all that is from products found with Oh a x-ray so definitely works hmm so um I just want to go through a few things you know what is OA x-ray so I mean Oh a x-ray is basically it's a Chrome extension okay and it was made to help people with online arbitrage if you went to a page like this and you wanted to know which one of these are profitable before this extension I mean you would you would have to download any number of other free extensions or paid ones which cost God knows how much when you add all together and collectively they still wouldn't be as efficient as this one plug-in so you would literally have to open up this and you know like copy the title open up amazon.com paste it in click it okay now you have to go back and did I just find something did I just find something that's kind of funny no no I didn't I didn't okay that was like wait a minute 17:35 68 but you could see um no sales rank right so this is not this hasn't sold so nothing here but so yeah I mean that's just that one item okay so um you know basically it's kind of a pain in the ass I mean let's be honest and it's the furthest thing from efficient as it could possibly be so anyway what this extension does I'll just show it to you real quick so we have like what maybe one two three four five a row five 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 40 items on a page and you click this button up here okay and it's going to look at every single offer on the page and you can see the red is not not profitable and the green are profitable it's going to tell you the sales rank it's going to tell you the return on investment the net profit right here and it doesn't just compare the site you're on which is one of the things I really like about it it compares it against a huge number of other sites so this product is 49 on Walmart um but let's take a look let's see this one thirty nine ninety seven you can see it's it's actually cheaper if you want to get on eBay and so that's really cool um but you know I'll get into that but um and then you know you could pretty much slice say you want to just filter it down to positive return on investment okay so these are all technically profitable okay but you can see the ROI and some of these is kind of low so we'll get into more about how we do that but um yes so um what do you need to start right because I mean if you just saw this right now you're if you've never seen this before your minds probably already like wait a minute what did I just see this thing just took a page full of 40 random items and just looked up all this information in like 10 seconds are you serious yeah that's that's pretty much what it does and the real insane thing is it supports like 38 different websites which is you know crazy and they keep adding more they keep adding more and you never pay more like the subscription is not going to go up or anything they're just adding more value you know as the life of the extension continues so um what do you need okay so first thing you need you need a decent computer okay it doesn't have to be like amazing but it should be pretty good okay and um you know you should have you need to get you need to have Chrome which is a free download okay so and then there's a few plugins are going to need okay you're going to need to keep a plug in and there's links to all this on the blog post which I'll put in the video description and the keeper plugin is going to tell you things like sales information historic sales information price fluctuations sales rank history and it's free okay next thing that you don't really need but it's really helpful this calculator widget and check out what this thing does if we went right here and let's say we want to take a look at this item right here with a 68% ROI looks like $18 on a Walmart and look at this right here this is really cool image comparison right because you want to make sure you're sourcing the same item all you got to do is mouse over and it shows you that all right so you click here okay so let's say um you know this looks pretty good we want to look more into this so we open it up in Amazon see this little calculator once you install that you click this boom brings you right to the FBA revenue calculator and this is a pain look at it the whoever listed this didn't even put in the the product dimensions and the weight which I hate when people don't do that so maybe not the best example but when you pull something up let's do something else because I want to show this to you because it really is cool actually you know we're going to get to this in the later part of the video so I won't get too much into it but you could see how you have it open you click the calculator button boom it brings it up there's no fussing about copy and paste in any of that nonsense it brings up the a sin right away just a simple time-saver that is just going to make your sourcing that much easier all right and then oh I x-ray right I mean that's that's a backbone of this entire thing and I was able to work something out where you know people that read this blog and watch my youtube channel get an extended trial so on to do that you can click this link right here or you can go down right here in the post I'll also put it in the description of the YouTube video and you can just click that what we'll do is we'll bring up this page it'll say Jim Pickens special okay when you see this that's how you know you're going to get double the trial so the three days you get six days so gives you a little longer to see if it's right for you tries things out etc so um but yeah that's what you need okay and then cash right you're going to need money because once you find something that's really good you know you want to be prepared to buy it I personally decided to test this out with about thousand dollars but you can start with ever you feel comfortable with um I spent that thousand dollars real quick and I ended up breaking the limit because I just kept finding profitable items and you know I like to make money like anyone else so I just kept going with it and you know so that's what you need okay so PayPal account credit card those are really the two forms a payment that most sites are going to accept installing Oh a x-ray I'm not going to get into like things like installing chrome plugins like basic stuff like that because it's just super simple and you can find that like anywhere online so um really easy just sign up with the link that I gave you right here they will email your instructions on how to do it okay now the same thing for these I have the links to these extensions here very simple so how do you use it okay so very simply and it's pretty much to show you this but let's say go to Walmart calm okay follow this directions exactly as it is here let's say we go to all departments we go to Home Improvement we go to power tools okay let's do a different one actually because we just did power tools we'll go to drill and router bits okay very simply click this button on the top right magnifying glass boom it'll bring this up and you give it a little bit of time to work but now watch this let's say you know what there's a whole bunch of items here so we want to do the second page too we do a mean we have a good computer it can handle it well let this work go back let's go to the third page ok now depending on how powerful your computer is you can do this from multiple pages and just bang through this you know hire a couple virtual assistants for three four dollars an hour teach them how to do this and you can already see the possibilities it gets crazy alright run this boom okay we let these run and you know once these are done running this turns green up here the blue it turns to like a green green blue color right and yeah so I mean pretty much this runs through hit positive ROI and you know I'll get into more how you can narrow this down a little further to get like these low ROI things out of here because we don't really care about things are nine percent return investment right that's just silly so I'll get into that but uh it's that simple right so at this basic level that's how you use it I mean it really is it's that straightforward okay um so then we get into well how do we know what a good sales rank is for a certain category let's say oh this looks good price is good what about sales rank right so that's like the speed the item will sell technically it's the time since the item last soul that category but it can pretty much predict how many items will sell in a given time this particular item that I thought we found something a wait wait a minute oh this is something else this is something else I'm getting confused here this one is a hundred and seventy three thousand okay and one hundred and seventy three thousand yeah under seventy three K and home improvement so how do we know that's good right because 173 K and home improvement can be very different from 173 K in a lot of other categories well luckily I created a spreadsheet and it's free it's going to tell you the top one percent and top five percent sales rank of every Amazon category now there's a lot of these on the web right now but most of them are outdated or just flat-out inaccurate so I suggest highly suggest you get this all I do is click this button if you haven't signed up it will just ask you for your email nothing crazy confirm the email and it'll bring you it'll give you a link and you pretty much just download this and here you go so a home improvement we could see a top 1% is like 100k top 5% is 522 K so we're well within the range here right so that would be a decent sales rank and home improvement that's that's an item that I would personally buy if everything else matched up so for sales rank how do you know well I just pretty much worked on this for a night and I put it together so just I'll put this a link to this too and just go here click download and put your email I'll send it right to your email and you know use it because it's so very important you don't want to buy a whole bunch of stuff and then find out later that it's really slow moving stuff that's going to take too long you want to flip your money fast so what makes a good flip there's four things top things I look for okay return investment 35 to 40% or higher okay everyone wants to make 100% return right but it's just not realistic you're gonna find like 40 sixty percent items all the time and you will find 100 percent ones plus two three four hundred even but a lot of time will be out of stock however you will find these items in stock ok you just have to be fast and don't linger ok you find something good confirm everything but once you know it's good you know buy it ok make the buy and but yeah something like forty fifty percent ROI that's consistent ok you spend thousand dollars you make fifteen hundred back right you spend ten thousand dollars you make five thousand dollars back right that's consistent you can consistent I can tell you from using this plugin is extension that you can consistently find those deals I find them all the time and they're in stock and people don't deal with them a lot of resources they just don't deal it and I can't for the life of me figure out why um so I personally found that so don't worry about oversaturation or anything like that you know decent ROI items you will you will find them a good sales rank okay to me or a great sales rank to me a great one is that one is they want the top 5% of that category so that's where the spreadsheet comes into play this will tell you if you're not sure check the spreadsheet okay a stable price history okay so this is where keep would become so useful if an item selling for sixty and we can source it for twenty it looks like a good flip initially but if we look further into it and discover that that same item was selling for twenty dollars on Amazon for the past three months becomes a lot less appealing okay items are going to take time to ship to your house or prep center and they're going to take even more time the ship to the amazon fulfillment center a lot of things can happen in that time so you want to be sure that the item you're sourcing has gone for a decent amount in the past one item sold for in the past is really the best indicator we have for what it will sell for in the future so that's very important and you know when you when you install that keep a plugin it's going to show it right below right down here okay and you can see this one's kind of all over the map 23:32 now all of a sudden it's $40 so this one's kind of fluctuating quite a bit okay Amazon doesn't sell the item this is kind of a big deal you really don't want to be competing with Amazon the only exception would be like a real low sales rank item or keep a show is that like Amazon's going in on stock so you would see like the orange and the keeper graph and it keeps it's like orange white orange white they keep going on stock then you could wait for those times but otherwise I wouldn't deal with it and especially if I was dealing in high volume I just move on there's too much stuff out there don't worry you don't even I wouldn't get a second thought so my personal settings okay so um I've seen a lot of the people they use Oh x-ray and they pretty much just they click the button it comes up right and they hit positive ROI and that's it all right that's all they do right so right here someone will click positive ROI and that's it okay and it's a good start because it gets rid of negative ROI items right but the problem is this going to be a whole lot of junk on your screen right here sales rank zero four hundred forty percent ROI who cares you know who cares no one's buying it right sales rank zero who cares sales rank one point three million okay I mean that might be okay unlike the home category sort of what you know and other categories not something we want okay so this is pretty much what we do okay there's a spot on your oix or a screen it says rank and it says ry the two checkboxes okay so you go here and your rank whatever number you put here it'll filter anything over it roi any number that you put here it'll filter anything that's not at least the number you put here so I like to put 250,000 rank because there's a big fluctuation or categories like I said so I like 250 is a pretty decent number that kind of spans across a lot of categories so I put that and then Auto why I put 35 right I can put kind of like my lower end and then what you do is you hit my bias boom what happened all the junk is gone only the stuff we really care about is left now it might seem like a little thing but I mean look how much crap we just got rid of all this stuff that looked profitable that really wasn't look at this nine percent gone this 20% gone and all we have left is what we really want to see in the first place you can sort click ROI and it will sort by ROI if you want to sort by sales rank you can do that and you know now you could look further into these items if you want to this item right here it looks like you make about 68 percent return on this one you know not too bad and you know I'm not blowing anything out this is real this is me really looking this stuff up right now I just open Walmart's page click down a section boom we just found three things our potentially profitable we could buy right now and if you actually click on it it's in stock it's in stock so there you go and so there's that now those are my those are my settings and they are it's very powerful just that alone okay so some basic do's and don'ts right always double-check your bias okay you want really make sure the item you're getting is really that same item on Amazon Oh actually does its best to match up the items but it can make mistakes okay so you really want to make sure that it's really the same so you want to like really go into a check the pictures that there's multiple pictures if there's some kind of code model number check that so make sure you're double-checking your items okay also in this game resellers are your competition a lot of them are lazy especially people that are going to be doing online arbitrage lazy people don't like to work and getting unguided and a lot of Amazon categories can be really troublesome okay need i say more I put need i say more and you know i pretty much what am i saying there guys right you know reading between the lines people are lazy okay there are some categories that are really frigging easy to get on gated in that people make them out like they're super hard probably because they don't want the competition but when you really look into it it's really not hard at all and now you just cut out so much of your competition that's doing online arbitrage and now you can you know really go kill it in that certain category and think outside the box right open up your sourcing possibilities don't just search for things like toys like everyone else and you go be more successful look for other things other categories okay don'ts don't ignore the get notified feature okay now what i'm talking about there I know Toys R Us happens to have one go to clearance let's click on electronics tech toys right here click on this okay this isn't stock but if we found an item that's not in stock you know basically you can you can add it you can be notified right and instead of this button Add to Cart it'll say you know tell me although notify me or tell me when it's back in stock put your email and do it don't ignore that because you will get an email and um you know it could still be profitable it could have come back in stock tomorrow you don't know and then you'll get the email boom you can make the buy and make your money okay don't go deep on an item you're not a hundred percent sure there are so many deals around right if you're just getting started don't buy more than like five of an item right I give you a chance to really get use of different categories as sales velocities see how long it takes these items to really sell okay now if you've done your homework and it looks like a winner don't linger on it make the buy don't wait too long someone else might take it before you and it wass stock and then you're not going to make the money so here's one tip I found that can really improve your efficiency tenfold okay and it doesn't work on all websites but it works on a lot of them and it's going to be up to you to kind of figure out which ones it works on now Oh expert supports 38 different marketplaces okay and if you want to know which ones are you simply go to o ax Raycom and there's going to be scroll down the home page right here click view all boom and they actually have a video kind of showing you a little bit more that they made themselves on you know how they do it I mean it's pretty straightforward but there's a video they made for each one if you want to look into it okay look at all this stuff guys eBay you know how big do you know how huge it is guys that they support eBay you guys know how many items I found on eBay since I've started this it's crazy eBay de Amazon flips has got to be one of the most profitable things you can do and now it's only going to work on new items but once of the UPC or ISBN but there's plenty of that stuff out there and hey new stuffs better anyway right you don't even have to deal with it if you deal with a prep center you have other people pack your stuff you know it's all the better it's new you don't have to worry about it it's like you're getting used crap sand somewhere and you have to examine it and make sure it's not missing stuff okay fisher-price jet came our Kohl's Macy's overstock Petco Walmart Walgreens Target Sears all these websites you know it supports and the list is right here okay so um on any number of those websites this trick could work so like right here let's go this link right here it's on my head we're looking at dog food okay so it shows 30 things on one page so if we click this we could see that um you know it's going to run it on those 30 items so that's cool let's see if we could do a little bit more on that so go to the bottom it lets you go up to nine hundred ninety weather okay so that's even better there's 425 in the categories now we got 90 we could run on this and that'd be more efficient but did you notice what happened when I click 90 right here in the URL boom rows equals 90 okay this is what you want to change they have 425 in the category so we'll put 500 hit enter and what you're going to notice happening on sites that will let you do this look at this results one two four twenty five it's showing the whole the whole category so now we click this magnifying glass I can just close out of this because this is I don't need it I don't care about the tab that has 30 I'm gonna do the whole thing in one shot okay so let's see if I found anything already hit positive ROI okay I got a whole bunch of crap in there if my buyers already got this prefilled Wow look at all that look at all that stuff and it's only and it's only like 12 15 20 percent done okay so that's what you can do and a lot of different websites you can do that and it just just it's just easier right instead of having like 10 tabs open you can do it on one so that makes a really big difference so don't underestimate that all the websites may say something different like you may have like a little symbol and it say R equals 20 or whatever they want to call it but if if you're in doubt just select a number of items per page and like if it's 30 change it to 60 and it'll put that number in the URL up top here and that's how you know when you find that number you know that's the number and then just change it to whatever you want and hopefully you'll support it and boom just increase your efficiency by a whole lot so let's get into some actual examples so we got I got something here on the blog that some you know just some stuff I had I have prepared but you know why don't we do something live right here kind of just show you I mean do something real look at this we found I found this one right when I first started let's see if I still have the window open change this to two I'm not sure if this was a window or not let's take a look oh yeah this is it okay so 68% ROI okay and here it is I think this is it yeah right 173,000 ranked if you don't have this little add-on here you just go down here it'll confirm it right there now make sure it doesn't say 173,000 in a subcategory okay they say 173,000 and jigsaws that's totally different than 173,000 a home improvement okay sometimes the plugin will slip up on that I find it's usually pretty good but sometimes it will there's a huge difference between that make sure you watch for it okay so we got this item right here decent ROI so now fortunately this looks like a newer item so there's not a whole lot of keeper information but there's a few things that we look for right and if we scroll back back up to the top what makes it good flip a good ROI this is 68% okay so that's already good a good sales rank I define that one within the top 5% we're good on that a stable price history if we look looks like it goes as low as 23 90 then which can be misleading because if they're ever merchant offers that could be twenty three ninety plus ten shipping so reality is it would be up here should really be up there through shipping you won't know that though so you know what it's not like anything crazy it's not like it got super low and you know so it's okay right it's not a whole lot of information here though right so if I were to buy this I probably wouldn't go too deep on it but I like by a couple um and you know Amazon doesn't sell the item right that's the last criteria and they don't so this is a decent item I'm I mean I might take a look at this I wouldn't go bind like 50 of them but I might buy a few and send them in and so let's say you watch like the or why you want to make sure there's nothing crazy going on it doesn't weigh like a hundred pounds and it's not like super oversized now Oh x-ray does have it does tell you if it's oversized right there's a little column here okay but if you want check yourself you wanna know for sure that here's where that calculator plugin comes in click the calculator and it's going to load this FBA Revenue calculator okay so it's 1873 not so much here we go this is where the pain is your pain comes in and wants to know the dimensions of the item I don't know if I want to get into looking up all that nonsense but it says it's 4.8 pounds okay so let's let's just put 12 by 16 by 10 we'll put 4 point 4 point 8 pounds okay inbound shipping you want to put you know you're not going to know what it's going to be so we'll just put like we'll put 75 cents because it's a few pounds okay maybe more or less spinning where it goes prep service you put how much it costs how much you're going to pay for it 1873 is the cost per unit so we'll put 1873 hit calculate and it'll tell you what you make so this says four dollars and eighty-eight cents so that's and then and the reason why this is lower than the 68% of set is probably because the weight wasn't in Amazon right whoever made this listing didn't do a good job so you're making a little less but see we see we might not have known that if we didn't run that so this is why I put this in the post and I'm showing you in the video because you really want to double-check things would it been that big a deal no you're still making money on it but on it's good to double check so so he makes you still make money you make five bucks would I jump on this yeah probably not but um you know it's really not that bad I mean I guess if we really take a look at it I mean 488 divided by 1873 26 percent return so some people might do that that might be in some people's business model but um sales wake isn't that good right it's not like 2,000 sales rings so it's not going to like sell up fly off the shelf so you know something I'll probably pass on so um so I got some some examples here right a barbie cash register so you could see in this picture here you can see it's 25k sales rank it's got like a 35% are ly so it's decent okay and it's selling on jet comm for $27.50 and it actually gives you a little discount look I put 10 for the cart it says 1240 off so it's taking a dollar 24 off every item okay that which i x-rayed didn't didn't know about that how could it right so um and then check Amazon Amazon sauna for 50 95 and hey guys I actually as of recording this I think these are actually the same price as right now and I think this is actually in stock so it'll be funny to see when I upload this video if the item ends up sold out because I kind of outed it but that's okay I just want to show you this for the purpose of the video um you know I'm not worried about it so 5095 good rank right 52k is where it's currently yet so um you know it's a it looks pretty decent so um we checked the kippah graph and we could see that see this green that's the sales rank and we can see it stayed at a pretty consistent rate okay pretty good right down here 50k spiked at 150 at like one point but still well within our range and marketplace new so that's that blue line this is we want to use to be relatively consistent and for the last few months it husband it's been right up near 45 40 ish level now remember that's if it's merchant fulfilled that's without the shipping cost so this is going to show Mercia items too but it's around 40 which is good enough for me right that's close enough so it's good it's a good stable history so this is a good item this is something that I would probably I'd probably I probably pick up and you could see the FBA revenue calculator I already ran it here arm just to show you you could see 50 95 that's what sells for you put the 50 cents in for inbound shipping $26 and 26 cents because it's taken off $1 $20 24 and we end up with 10 dollars and 72 cents profit which isn't really that bad right if you buy 10 of those and you send them in you make 107 dollars and you'll probably make that inside a month I mean that's the cost of the subscription alone right there on one item so I mean that's just kinda show you people that might say oh well it's kind of expensive it's really not expensive if you really look into like the power of this extension to say it's expensive it's kind of ridiculous um in my opinion so um so there's that so we got another deal here that I found and I find this stuff all the time so really pay attention to this one we've got a nerf combat creatures terror drone 35k ranked a 338 percent return that looks really good so it's $29.99 on Kmart you can see right here now the only reason it's kind of unreadable up here is because this I'm in the buy list and sometimes it gets like that maybe it's something they can fix at some point but $29.99 s sells for a hundred and sixty one dollars so you can see now it happens to be out of stock on Kmart but you here you see right here 161 94 was a really good sales rank people are actually paying this for this item that must be hard to find for some reason that's that's bringing up that window I'll have to fix that but if you went to Kmart asad stock so um a lot of people would stop right there but what I do I take that as an opportunity and I put it in a spreadsheet that I call local beetles okay since I started using I x-ray anything that's not a stock I put it in a tab spreadsheet separated by retailer and now all I have to do is simply call Kmart or targets or whatever and see if they have it in stock now it's best to wait do you have a decent size list so that you can kind of go down the line and you know make sure it's worth your gas when you go down there and if some items they don't have you know they're going to have other ones so having a good size this makes it more likely you'll find a good number of you know profitable items so um so if the item looks good but let's check you know the kippah graph right so we can see here this item has actually been up above $200 back in December and has stayed pretty consistently around 175 down to 960 for the last three months this is a consistent seller at a consistent price if you find these I came out you better buy them okay good sales rank consistent price this is a good buy without a doubt so yeah so this is all just kind of explaining what we just said if we open the FBA revenue calculator here an example film it brings all that off automatically all you got putting the inbound shipping and put 50 cents and prep service that's how much you pay for the item twenty nine ninety five you click calculate and it'll come up right here margin impact right over here that's how much you make hundred dollars and ninety five cents of profit per unit per unit think of what you can do with this extension during quarter four when Amazon is going in and out of stock on every frigging toy that's even halfway desirable and people are merchants fulfilling toys so you don't even have to wait for the item you get the list of stuff from Oh a x-ray I'm Nam now I think I'm saying too much but you kind of see what I'm saying here right I made about twenty thousand dollars from merchants fulfilling toys in December and I didn't have any anything close to this level of technology on my side so I can only imagine what I'm going to do this year and this is but you can do this year around right um but yeah if you bought five of these let's say you found five of them a couple different Kmart's that's five hundred four dollars you know in profit on a single item which is I mean that's five times the cost of the subscription right in one item so you know you're not going to always find deals like that but when you do it's great and you know it does happen and I happen to find a lot of good stuff at Toys R Us in particular they had a good sale and you know I thought it was out of stock online I found a bunch of stuff in the store so there's other other uses so retail arbitrage we just talked about that right you make a spreadsheet and you know and you keep track of this stuff and you can make really good profits off off of it eBay de Amazon flips I talked about this briefly before away x-ray does support eBay right it'll only support the items with UPC's or ISBNs but you know that's preferable anyway because when you got a deal with you stuff you deal with missing pieces stuff that doesn't work it's just pain and especially if you go to a prep center if you think you're going to if you think you're going to buy used stuff and send that to a prep center yeah good luck with your Amazon account not getting suspended real fast with that so you know the fact that it only does new items I don't really consider to be a downside hiring virtual assistants to help source now they will actually let you hire VA s from places like Elance and they give you permission for your virtual assistant to use the tool as long as they're using it just on from one single Amazon account which is fine you just give them an info you can I think you can set up a Amazon user accounts that are like limited in capability or than like limits and what they can see you know if you have a wife or something you can girlfriend somebody in the house I mean you can set it up and teach them and you can look and all you need is a laptop all you need is a decent computer all right so if you don't want to pay a VA you could do that but if you did go the d8 wrote the route I mean you know there a lot of these guys are over in the Philippines and the currency is a lot different there and you know they'll charge like four dollars an hour because that's a lot of money to them and I mean it's just crazy I mean if you really think about it the fact that you can get a VA for as little as four dollars an hour and if you teach them how to use this software and you pay them for X number of hours I mean just imagine the massive buy list and spreadsheet you could get from that so it's pretty crazy that they let you do that but they do so I would definitely take advantage of that and I'll be personally looking into that in the near future price matching so they can help you you know find discounted stuff from retailers you know like Walmart Target so you find something on Amazon and you know target has a price match policy and no match Amazon you know other resellers are not doing that they're not going to that length so take advantage of things like this when you find them and if you need more ideas Oh a x-ray I put a link right here they have a whole page dedicated to creative ways you can use this extension and it's it's a lot longer than mine it's 23 different things right here so take a look at that a prep Center so right now I'm prepping stuff myself but when I up my volume I'm definitely going to use a prep Center because there are companies who will accept your shipments okay they'll label pack and ship them to the FBA warehouse for you typical rate is like $1 per item this makes your whole process basically 100% hands-off it's really incredible that these places exist and at rates like this and Plus sense really purchasing brand new items you don't to worry about missing pieces documentation any other hassle that comes with buying used items so you can be pretty rich you can rest pretty much assured that stuff's going to be in working order so some things that you want to keep in mind you know learning you Zoey x-ray and online arbitrage process in general is not something that's going to happen overnight right you need to time you get a process down and really figure it out like for example you might not want to deal with certain categories like shoes because there's a high rate of returns on certain items you might only learn this a month or two after doing it having gotten several returns on shoes and deciding it wasn't it for you so now this is not necessarily the case for me but it's just an example and some final things I want to bring up checkout sites like fatwallet Ebates mr. rebates to get more bonuses a lot of these places will give you two percent three percent or more cash back on your purchases and sometimes these little percentages will turn an unprofitable item into a profitable item when what I mean by that is I'll say your minimum is fifty percent you cannot go into that you might find stuff that's forty three percent ROI but these little cash back bonuses from these sites will bring you up to that level so make sure you check those out before you make the buy and go to the O x-ray Facebook page and like the page because these guys are always making new posts and you know bug fixes they're doing contests and they add new retailers to the extension so so like the page so you get updates as those things come out and oh yeah one more thing you might think because it's a extension that people can you know they do have to pay for it but it's public that you know there might be no deals left you know they're all gone all the deals are gone because of oversaturation now maybe oh maybe not that dramatic it is something that did kind of run through my mind at first I wonder you know so I want to say I wonder if you know is it oversaturated let me try it out well I decided to actually you know try it out and that's why I did and that's why this video was even coming out because I saw that it worked for myself and I found that there is plenty of items that are still available plenty and because of the monthly fee it's actually a plus because you keep out you know tire kickers and people that just want freebies and it cuts down that number of users significantly where you know a bro person might say $99 a month that's expensive no thank you you know a businessman will say $99 a month for what this thing is capable of that to steal I could make 10 to 20 times that amount with very little effort right so there's different ways of looking at it and I personally found that in my opinion it is a steal so and luckily like I said I was able to get the extension an extension for you know how long be able to test it normally it's only three days but for people that watch my videos and read this blog post you're getting double the time so instead three days you get six days try it out see if you like it right here this is just a shipment I have going now actually tonight is about two thousand dollars of profit right here as god maybe 50 books in there but 90 99 percent of it 90 percent of it is all stuff I found throw away x-ray and that's going out tonight so you know check it out see if you like it um I personally love it I'll be using it for very long time as long as they continue to support it and you know like I said I'll leave a link in the description send this blog post you'll be able to find the link but make sure you if you're going to try it out use this link like you said like I said you click it it's going to say Jim pic and special on the page so that's how you're going to know you're going to get the six days as opposed to the typical three days and you know see if it's for you might not be right for everyone but you know um maybe you're stuck at home and online store thing is really what you need to do right and maybe it's something that you're a really busy person or for whatever reason like online arbitrage really appeals to you um you know I couldn't after using this I can say I honestly can't imagine doing it without it so um you know that's pretty much that's pretty much it so you know let's want to do this quick video you know like subscribe if you haven't already and you know go out there and make some money guys make some money because it's out there the money is out there alright alright guys peace
