 hi there this is Tracy Baker I'm the director of coffee not implemented and today I wanted to share my story with you about how I got to have the business that I have today and how the journey that I've taken to get to where I am today as literally would be no exaggeration at all to say it's transformed my business and my life and I wanted to share with you I hope maybe not all of it but I hope maybe some of it resonates with you and it helps you maybe to think about doing the same or starting your own business maybe so yeah I'm the oldest of six kids and so money was always a bit of an issue when we were at home it was always a bit tight and I was very much brought up with a mentality of you go to school you get an education and you get a job and that's that's pretty much what I did I went to a normal state secondary school here in the UK and I got I got good grades nothing exceptional but either I got good grades I studied Business Studies I didn't really ever know what I wanted to do when I was at school I really didn't know what I wanted to do as a career so I did secretarial practice as it was called then and Business Studies and I came away with reasonable grades in those and I started life in the corporate world and took admin jobs in financial institutions and charities engineering companies and it served a purpose it didn't excite me it didn't thrill me I'm it served a purpose and it gave me an income when I was young free and single at the time I was still living I'm then so there was no major major problem with it merely I'm but I hated the whole office politics I hated the having to climb the greasy pole and of promotion and that kind of thing the fact he had to ask somebody if you want to time off that you were stricted to the amount of time you could have off and so it served a purpose that was that was as much as i could say really about about life really it didn't thrill me it didn't really like me up so to speak then in my early 20s I got married and I had two beautiful children I have a son and a daughter who I absolutely adore and i came across the age-old problem that us working mums generally have which is trying to find a way of earning an income around having toddlers and babies and yet try and try to find something that fits in and i did i tried so many work at home opportunities and are so many different things and it's trying to find that the fitting round their nursery times or their school times you know what it's like it's just and if they're ill or if there's parents evenings and and that kind of thing so I found it really difficult and then just by chance our family business at the time was growing quite rapidly and so they asked if I wanted to join them as an admin assistant and I thought off fantastic this is great because it will work round the kids and I'll have more flexibility and I'll not be bringing in some money now I would point out my money was always a secondary income my husband's money more than enough covered all the living costs that we had so my money was only ever secondary income it was it was for the nice things the extra things if you like for for making a home home but um but yeah I thought this was great I thought this was fantastic this was this would be this would work perfectly so I started working in a little portacabin office in the in the yard where the law reason and that came in so i started doing administrative stuff there and then a very old-school accountant that we had it with us at the time taught me bookkeeping and I actually really enjoy it i reckon i was really liked it so I went off to study and qualified as a bookkeeper as time went on and to be honest the children start doing nursery and things like that and so some of the time they were with me and I was having to bring them up the yard me and that wasn't great because I was trying to do the admin answer the phones do the accounts do the payroll and my kids were out in the yard and I didn't know where they were and they were lawyers coming backwards and forwards and there was machinery out there and I was like a cat on hot bricks as every five minutes I was looking at the window trying to get them to play in the office and it wasn't fair on them it was really really wasn't fair on them so there was that aspect of it that kind of had a negative effect and then as I got more ingrained in the family business and their financial side of it I used to cause huge amounts of house between myself from my husband at the time and it caught a lot of stress and awful lot of stress and I did that for a few years probably about three for three years and then it just got too much it just got too much the the constant to him frying the constant arguments the the fact that we could never switch off from the business we were constantly rowing it it just got too much so I decided I wanted to strike out my own it's something that I'd always wanted to do but really hadn't had the opportunity and I figured that as my income was like a second income anyway that if I was if I was going to do it now would be a good time to do it so I decided then that I wanted to start my own business and I left the family business didn't make me very popular really didn't make me very popular but I got a few clients some of the clients actually came from the waste disposal family business that we had because they came and all they'd heard that I was bookkeeping and that I'd set up on my own so I've got a few clients and again it was still secondary income it was still a small amount of money it was for the nicer things it wasn't it wasn't a major because my blog though my husband's income and took over that and I really enjoyed it I really enjoyed it but I got to the point where I was I had an office in the house I had clients coming to the house to pick up paperwork I was dropping off paperwork sometimes I wouldn't be able to use their accounting software on my computer so I'd have to go to their offices in between doing the school runs and the things that go on at school that the kids need to be there for and I just thought you know this wasn't actually what I signed up for this this doesn't feel like freedom at all this this still feels incredibly like I'm dancing to someone else's tuna not my own and at this point the family business financially had taken a severe nose dive and we were in real trouble so coupled with the arguments that we'd already been having they form I left and then with me leaving the family business then the business taking a nosedive we were looking at losing our family home and it just there were lots of other things going on the background as well but to be fair it was the straw that broke the camel's back it was the final throw no nail in the coffin and it just broke our marriage it completely broken so we ended up going through divorce and about eight years ago I ended up with two very distraught very unsettled children who were by that time in their early teens and moved to where I am now rented accommodation but I had not hardly any income my money had been like a subsidy really to what we'd had before and I it wasn't even enough to pay the rent so when I moved over here it's like oh my god what am I going to do how I going to do this and I had to claim state benefit which we have here in the UK and some of my friends and they it was well intentioned I'm sure but they were saying but you've paid into all your life so you should claim for this that and the next thing I hated it absolutely hated it this was so far removed from I wanted to be so I had very little money I was claiming benefits and I moved over here like I say with two very unsettled upset children I was like what am I going to do and I felt really really pretty low to be honest and but at that point and I think it's always one where our lowest point I made this unanimous decision I made this commitment to myself and my children that I would never be financially independent on anyone ever again I wanted to be able to provide for them I wanted to be able to support them I wanted to inspire them to be able to see what they can do in the world but how an earth was i going to do that where I in the in the current situation I was in I Vera money like hardly anything and was feeling really low I still had a few clients and one in particular I'd worked with for about six years and he had started a secondary business and he was around here one day talking about this business he was really excited about this property investment business that he was going to be starting up in the US and he was telling me all about it and then he sent our I found this amazing VA he said she's so super efficient the company's fantastic the customer service is unbelievable the skills the knowledge what is a VA what is a VA I've never heard of a VA and then he went on to explain this a virtual assistant is somebody that works purely online and they have all their systems online and I was like you don't have to go into an office you don't have to deal with paperwork and and it's kind of thing in the how on earth does that work and he was absolutely blown away by the company that he'd used and it was virtuous Friday it was Michelle Dale's company and he said to me he said Tracy you need to get on to this he said every skill that you have he said everything you've learned in business so far he said would be so perfect for you to be able to do this it would give you the freedom and the choice and everything you're looking for and I was kind of like yeah I'm i was i was skeptical i was skeptical because since I've got divorced at this point I'd gone into a lot of self-development I'd made it a mission to go on a huge learning curve in self-development I'd read books I'd listen to audios I've been to seminars I'd and the seminars I'd come out so enthused and so motivated and so I was going to do this and I get home in a few days late I'm like but they didn't tell how they said you could do this and you can do this and you can dis but nobody told me how and then I felt deflated and then I'd feel I'd be really hard on myself then because I'm like oh you stupid woman how could you have done such a thing how could you have traveled up to London for a weekend and done this course and actually is not really taught you anything and I did a lot of spiritual searching as well and not everything that I went on was rubbish in the self-development kind of thing and to be fair i went to see Eckhart Tolle in London speak and that was incredible I'm so pleased I went to go and see him he's a spiritual speaker and he completely blew me away so I had been on a huge nuts like self development journey fast-paced journey since I got divorced and I had learned a lot I'd learned a lot a lot about myself and when this particular client said you should look into this I was like yeah but at that point I really didn't have anything to lose so I started looking online and I found Michelle my client had given me links to various different blocks of hers anyway and I knew she must be something pretty special because this particular plant I was working with he was hard to impress he was seriously hard to impress for somebody to have absolutely wild him I thought that there has to be a glimmer of something in this and I started reading Michelle's blogs and I started reading her newsletters at the time she was doing a Friday fortnightly and I couldn't believe she was so what came across most in her blogs was her honesty and her transparency in everything she does oh she's even at some point on if you want to email me I'll find out but I'll find it for you she's even put up there on her blog somewhere her income statement she was I was just incredibly impressed by her honesty and her transpire see and then knowledge she had and the journey that she'd been on herself and so I was literally just reading all this information and beating on her blogs and I really resonated with her she was just so out there and really really on the ball and not long after I'd been being only a couple of months after I've been reading her blogs Michelle put out an invite for people to beat a test her very first training program which was the VA apprentice and I thought you know what I've got nothing to lose I really feel as if I know this woman I know it sounds odd because she was online at that point I'd never met her but I really like her style I really like her authenticity and I thought you know what I've got nothing to lose at the point i am now i have nothing to lose by applying to be to test her course so she was looking for people to test the VA apprentice so i put in my submission and i got on with the rest of whatever i was doing in my business at that time and i just prayed and prayed and prayed that I would get a place and I did I got a place and oh my god I was telling everybody I was jumping for joy I ran round the room absolutely tears down my face I was so overwhelmed i thought this this opportunity has been given to me and i have to grab it with both hands because i knew from what I'd read on what I'd seen so far that this was impressive stuff so I couldn't wait to get stuck into the course so I got into the VA apprentice I was over the moon I cannot tell you how pleased I was but what didn't I wasn't prepared for was when I actually got into the course and saw what was involved in the content of the course it's like nothing I've ever ever come across and believe me I have honestly yet for years now been searching online looking at all these lifestyle laptop life style gurus and online training but nothing came close to the content that was in this course it's literally step-by-step a blueprint of michelle's own business everything from how to structure your business how to market your business how to secure clients Michelle and her team created my brand coffee not included and they created my website which I absolutely love and I have had so many positive comments about over the years and how to set up the social media side of it how to manage your money how to do how to do the econ tracks and non-disclosure agreements or everything absolutely smooth streamlined efficient and it's all how to it was what I've been looking for I've been to so many things they've said you can do this and you can do that and you can an X amount of money but nobody showed me how and this is literally a hand held in front of me was a handheld guide right the way working through from even what equipment you have she recommends you have in your business to start off so I was as you probably gathered from my enthusiasm I was completely completely blown away and every more joy in the course as well was also in video there was a transcript of it and an audio so no matter how you prefer to learn whatever your learning style is it was covered and my clients now are just that they're blown away they're blown away by the systems and the way my business is run the tools that I use but I recommend to other clients as well and it's just completely transformed how I work i am not a technical person I really really am NOT and if I get completely stuck I we're still even to this day Michelle we still I still class Michelle my mentor I will still go to her she's my go-to person along with a facebook private Facebook group that we have virtual assistants but i will post questions in there or issues i might be having and if Michelle doesn't come back then one of the girls in the virtual assistant where it will come back and they're all really everybody's really really supportive and that was what I needed because my confidence was just like below zero I didn't have any confidence i started this course and gradually my confidence grew and then i started working with clients using the methods that she taught and my confidence grew again and it's just grown and grown and grown to the point now where I actually feel confident in putting together premium price packages for clients and most of my clients are all knows now and they don't they don't have a problem with that because the service they get is really really excellent but it wouldn't have been possible if I had have learnt that stuff in the first place so that is where I learn all the skills from was initially from the VA apprentice and within in fact I hadn't even finished the course I hadn't even finished the course when I was studying it because you can do it at your own pace but I had and I was really into it but I hadn't even finished the course when I got my first client then I got a second client and those two clients would double the income that I've been owning in my offline business straight away and I've since quadrupled my income like I was saying because I can put together these premium packages now and because I have the confidence to do that and the knowledge and the skills to do that now my income has quadrupled and what that has meant to me is unfathomable honestly I have been able to fully support myself and my two children no help from the government no help from anybody else I completely support them financially I am financially independent my confidence has absolutely gone through the ceiling because i was just so unconfident like i say i'm not a technical and so I was thinking oh you've got to be hugely technical and you've really got to know how to code or how to work just to work online I when I have my offline business I couldn't see how that could be transitioned and how you can have a paperless business I mean really I've been able to take my kids to the Caribbean and through the Panama Canal and open their eyes to travel and that got me into the traveling bug even more so I've been to Budapest and I've been to Marrakech I've climbed the Atlas Mountains I'm planning to go to New York and I've put my kids through that there it's enabled me to put my kids through their driving lessons I bought their first car for them I paid for their first use insurance for them I could never even contemplated that I would be able to do these things and run my home and pay all my bills as well and it's just there are so many other places I want to go and see as well for traveling because that's really important my children are now in their early 20s and they're working themselves so so it's enabled me to maybe think more about my travel plans and I'm learning Italian at the moment because I'd like to go to Italy and completely immerse myself in the Italian Way of life not necessarily the touristy places because I don't tend to go to those when I travel but just to really I love going and visiting other countries and seeing the cultures and the way they live and just completely immersing myself and this business completely allows me to do them whenever I want for however long I want it won't stop by me traveling um what else is there's my daughter she works weekends she works most weekends so during the week I would take an afternoon off and go and do a shopping or cinema or coffee or we just go off and have some mother and daughter time I wouldn't be able to do that if I was working for someone else and I can shed you my work around my life and not the other way around that's what it boils down to I've literally within the last month paid for my daughter to pay for her plane ticket to go and visit her dad because I dad now lives out or their father now lives out in America so she wants to go and visit him obviously which is fine and I've just paid for our plane ticket how incredible is that I could pay for her plane ticket for her to go and visit her dad for two weeks so having my own be a business but keeping business has opened up a whole new world to me a world that barely five years ago I could have only dreamed about I knew nothing absolutely no I'd never even heard of the ACE I didn't even know what virtual assistant was but I met Michelle and her husband and her two children back in january 2014 when Michelle ran a live workshop in Cornwall here in the UK and I was I was mesmerised by her two children because do you know what they were they were playing woman they were talking in English the next minute they were talking in Greek because Michelle currently lives in Crete and I was like that is if there was one regret if it is such a thing it would be that I didn't find all this information this way of working when my children were younger because to see Michelle's two children interact and and are just the experiences they're having as I growing up is incredible so I've since gone on to do other courses of Michelle's I've done the VA passport the VA passport is basically a wealth of video tutorials of how to's lots of lot of hundreds i think probably now of how to videos on working online and creating different things online and this class is in there as well and if you're considering working online but being a location independent and working as an online service provider but I'm believe me I understand this being budget being an issue Michelle offers a shoestring program and it literally is exactly what it says it's the VA apprentice on a shoestring so it's the branding the content the website creation the business tools and they're all very very low cost or they're free I invested in Michelle's mug to creator and administrator programs so as you can prolly see from somebody who was really really cynical because I found somebody who does and actually does what they what I wanted to create but they actually do it themselves and have a very successful business doing it because I found Michelle I've done quite a lot of her courses I will invest in future courses and I still very much consider her my mentor and my go-to person if there's anything on having any issues with or something I just want a run pass through as a project so I'm really excited about the future of coffee not included and if their website there was any regrets is that I didn't find Michelle sooner and when I was looking for that business that income that fitted found my children and that would allow me the freedom that I now enjoy so that's basically my story if you want to find out more I've got a if you

a question if you've got anything in my hope that you found my journey interesting and that maybe some of it resonates with you and that it's helped helped you to inspire you to a different way of life because that's exactly what i have now i'm loving it so take care and asked me to you soon
