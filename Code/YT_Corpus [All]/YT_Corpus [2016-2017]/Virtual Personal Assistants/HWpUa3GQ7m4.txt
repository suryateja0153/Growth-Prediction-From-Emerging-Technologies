 hey guys troy here welcome to today's video in this video I'm going to share with you how to outsource both your work and life can be a bit intimidating but with the right resources and information you can get started with this in no time at all and the resource I'm going to share with you is online jobs pH there's going to be a link below in the description you can go to click on that and follow along with me or click on that right after this video so you can get your account set up and start leveraging this marketplace right away it connects you with qualified va's for whatever job that you need there is a whole slew whether it's bookkeeping customer service content writing you name it you can find a virtual assistant to outsource that work to so once you have your account set up the first thing you're going to want to do is either post a job or search for candidates yourself when you're first starting out I'm going to recommend that you post a job that gives you the opportunity to really define what it is you're looking for what the position entails and it's a really good exercise when you're first starting with the outsourcing process so let's go and click on post a job and once that's done you'll be taken to this screen here you plug in all of your job details the title the description so include any applicable skills needed previous work experience pro tip here is to include a sentence that makes mention of showing your attention to detail plz mention orange or another random phrase to have the candidate make mention of that to show that they fully read the description and they're able to share that with you because they have a very good attention to detail then you're going to plug in wage or salary this again gives you a great example of how much you're going to be realizing in cost efficiencies by leveraging Virtual Assistants 400 month 400 hours of a month as an example but you can set any wage or salary is there as you like type of employment whether it's full part-timer freelance plug that in you can skip over or if you want include ID proof this essentially just ensures that the proof of ID is there so you know who you're working with in the marketplace you can plug that in but higher is of course better what skills are required in these fields you're going to want to pick based on the role responsibilities what fields makes sense you can go and just click on those that are intuitive to the role and this should be pretty cut and dry again this is a good exercise for you to make sure that you know what you're hiring for once you've got all that filled out in the applicable fields plug in your email address plug in your contact name and then you're ready to submit the job for a pool so you can already see if you haven't done this before that took me about you know obviously took me a minute but if you're going to do it I probably take you two minutes to just plug in what you need to start outsourcing a task it's so simple now let's say I'm not home screen we click through and we said well we'll search on our own you can see here how you kind of have to you kind of to trudge through the marketplace a little bit you really have to evaluate candidates if you haven't done this before you really don't know what to look for so it's far better for you to plug in through the post a job option get candidates submitting their information to you and vetting them from their much easier for the newbie or the beginner so we've got a lot of leg work done in no time at all but i also want to share some insights with you once you really have started to initiate the conversation with the right candidate so i've put this together for you as a little helpful aid what I'm always going to recommend to you before you effectively outsourced a task and start working with the virtual assistant is to give them a test task and always think in terms of what's in a murder amended version of what you need so if it's a detailed report or ongoing writing maybe that's a short writing sample that you need that is in the tone or language that's consistent with whatever that project may be so always think in terms of scale of minimizing the work time and workload but still have some of the applicable parallels as to the overall task you're going to empower that virtual assistant to take on also when you're working with that virtual assistant keep in mind there may be a language barrier there may be a few things that are a bit nuanced so always break things down in a sequential manner both when you're empowering them with tasks and on an ongoing basis if they have any challenges hang-ups or questions think of where they're in the process so always look for milestones in which you can say this is the next point of achievement and so on and always think in an order this is a huge huge point to remember because you're empowering them with certain milestones and really key stones on a project that they are completing very powerful point not to be overlooked also think in terms of communication always be mindful of first and foremost when you're evaluating candidates how do they communicate how do they communicate their skills how do they communicate the expectations of a given project it really genuinely is the foundation for success because then you can lose the expectations game if you don't communicate effectively what you're expecting and in part what they are having either successes or challenges with now another thing that I've learned with outsourcing that's very important and impactful and powerful is to follow this this kind of a rule if you will it's a little something to keep kind of in your hip pocket I would even recommend jotting this down and it's a process for training and it's i do then we do then you do so in in this case you will shatter have the virtual assistant shadow you and you will show them you doing it and then you will collectively do it whether you do it or they do it it is in tandem or at the same time and then you shadow the virtual assistant as they complete that given task now this is not going to be applicable for writing assignments copywriting there will be other places where writing sample suffice or your communication in which you can glean how they write or complete a given task but in most cases this is so empowering to set the expectations as I mentioned before in terms of the expectations games this provides complete transparency and clarity as to the expectations of the outcomes you want to achieve so I wanted to show that quick that quick PowerPoint with you alongside really what amounts to the quickest resource and best that I found for getting you in touch with qualified virtual
