 each year microsoft research helps hundreds of influential speakers from around the world including leading scientists renowned experts in technology book authors and leading academics and makes videos of these lectures freely available you our next speaker Julian Bleeker so Julian is also i'm so happy all these speakers could make it for this panel today and Julian's one of my favorite humans he's a self-described recovering PhD engineer photographer and product designer who just formed a bicycle parts company as you guys know and you probably would know his work from the near future lab and his most recent TBD catalog which hopefully he'll talk about a little bit and if you haven't seen it you should totally check it out welcome Julian thank you there it goes ok so I'm Julian a designer engineer publisher so I work or worked still work but not really in a design studio would latch a top secret stuff that'll never see the light of day I'm an engineer I love crawling into things and figuring them out and I did a I did a book a Kickstarter book that was a that started successfully there's a joke here but now I see time I go he'll remember maybe a couple years ago i punked the sketching and hardware crowd to say I did a Kickstarter and shame on you guys because you didn't support me and people started like shifting nervously in their seats and looking at each others like did he do a kick start I'd check Twitter was going and that the point of the other Punk for for the sketching in hard we're all friends and was just good fun was to basically look at the ways in which people represent the possible what could be and the different archetypes by which people represent the possible and one of them for me very powerful one is you know sort of Kickstarter and all the things that it stands in for in the world of crowdfunding so people do projects that are you know you look at and you kind of like oh my god I want one of those we talked about in the crowdfunding breakout session and just even the form like the visual design of the Kickstarter page becomes a thing where people like I have to get that must get it before it sells out add to cart and that kind of thing and I think that's absolutely wonderful I love that as a kind of a you know a means to open up a conversation or discussion about either just crowdfunding generally or specific ass crowd funding there was we were talking I'm a coffee Josh mentioned a device to actually aged wine actually doesn't age one it kind of gives it better flavor by basically aerating it very rapidly and I was like Kickstarter retirement plan like let's like white label blenders and call them age whiners and I sorry wine agers and put it on Kickstarter and I almost guarantee that that would be like a you know multi hundred-thousand-dollar success anyway so this didn't really exist but I thought it was a pretty good idea but then the thing was in sketching Hardware this year I said okay let me explain to you why I did that punk I owe you an explanation so it's just about this is about tangible representations about things that might be but then trying to go a step further and construct some kind of representation about what it might be like to actually inhabit that world that world with the wine ager with the ear freshener with the 3d printers in every room what is what does that world look like beyond just the that initial burst of excitement you get imagining having one in your home because often not always but in many cases their disappointments in in all the kind of normal ways like the new device never works exactly the way it's supposed to the advertisement for the self-driving car says it's meant to park itself but it keeps ramming into the curb like whatever it's going to be that's going to happen so just some examples of stuff that we've done in the past this was a newspaper that we did called winning formula as a commission from the the Football Museum in Birmingham and we propose doing a supplement to a newspaper that said what is sports going to look like in the future and so it's just like a 12 page insert that they actually put into the evening paper that that just sort of said sports will be like you know it will be sport + data we had things looking at you know actually rather than doing a particular game just run the simulation because the simulation is actually better than the game you can get through them quicker all these kinds of ways in which you might just extrapolate today into tomorrow there were a couple things that we sort of you know in a in a cheeky way sort of a nailed so like we speculated that a lot of big tech moguls winded up into buying sports teams mostly for the data so they want to own the data for the sports team and that that's we see that sort of stuff happening we did another project called curious rituals just maybe this will play so this was a project where we looked at the way in which people might interact in the future so looking at interaction visuals the things that we end up doing with devices and imagining those extrapolating into a future world so in this one is a self-driving car or a self-starting card looks you a visual face recognition to start the car but she realizes that she had different kind of like appearance when she first configured it so this is the nozzle is what the nozzle does it looks at you instead of but you know interprets who you are and then requires you to actually change your makeup in order to look as you were so yet why do we do these things the the reason I didn't know until quite recently but the thing that I feel comfortable to say is that as you know designers engineers artists thinkers researchers we maybe we're not finishing our work so we're proposing ideas but we're not running them through to the point where we're badging our ideas inhabiting the world in all the multivalent ways in which they would which means they work well or they don't work well they don't configure properly they interact badly with each other whether their BOTS communicating with each other do they get to surly arguments which you didn't really anticipate and so this idea of finishing our work by that I mean we need to basically add to the specifications and describe the characters and the props and the the points of failure the experiences that would come when we actually have all these things in the world so these are some examples of real things that people are trying to build and they it starts out with a statement like wouldn't it be cool if dot quadricopter zan drones are everywhere it means very easy to imagine that extrapolation being the equivalent of my next-door neighbor who loves his leaf blower blowing his leaves all the time so quadcopters flying all over the neighborhood for one reason or another what is we'll look like and how do we manage and what is the kind of what are the consequences and implications of that which isn't to say you know we should stop doing any of these great wonderful things but it is to say can we inform and shape our design decisions and our engineering decisions and even like our policy decisions by looking at what that you know how that world plays itself out bathroom door api's I think I was proposed someone was working on sketching and hardware like cool idea but like okay really what is that world is it you know on the one hand people like would it be nice like right now if you knew the bathroom is occupied like on an airplane and a little light went on like incredible increases in efficiency all of a sudden we're all more we're we're we're not wasting less time but at the same time is that you know like consequences for like personal modesty or whatever might be aquariums on the internet I know some folks at at highway 1 are working on putting aquariums making them another thing on the internet and what is I will begin to look like and how does it change our relationship to our pets whether they be marine animals or not 3d printers for everyone I'm a little bit nervous about that like you know what people are excited about it and I get it but having worked in a product design studio for 47 years with three very nice 3d printers it becomes a real waste management issue and so is there now a fourth bin outside of everyone's house aside from the lawn and garden and the stuff that doesn't compost and the recyclable stuff that's like 3d printer ways like these are ways in which we can start addressing those kinds of issues and then the Internet of Things move it's a whole thing so what does I world look like well I saw a movie maybe it looks like this not quite sure but this zoom iam is like one specification of what that world could be like maybe the world looks like this we're all our personal assistants we get emotionally attached to and so these are the kinds of representations that I'm sort of I guess trying to evolve and develop and encourage other people to pursue its not just a product requirements document it's got to be a little bit more you have to start telling the stories that draw people in and allow them to sort of think about what they're doing and why they're doing it actually makes the design work much more robust and also a zillion times more fun so people say everything that can be connected will be connected which they do say I mean CES just passed I would ask can you be more specific about that world what does that mean and if you're saying everything I'm going to hold you at your word and ask you to say if my fork is connected to my napkin what does that world look like and why would those be things be connected and you're doing that not as a child it will the chat as a design challenge like what actually are you meaning can you add more detail to that can you be more precise about those sort of open statements and then what are the consequences and implications of that world describing instead of filling it out so rather than just sort of saying we wanted a world in which everything is connected to everything i would say tell me a story about a world in which every bathroom door is connected with an Internet of Things door knocker and an Internet of Things occupancy sensor so that becomes a little bit more of a more robust design brief in a way than just sort of opening things up or tell me a story about a world in which legend has it that fruit once came from things called trees because people are developing food fruit printers so there's a there's a reasonable chance that maybe maybe not my nephews but maybe their children are kind of like a fruit used to come from trees that's weird doesn't grandpa you're being silly and that were that those kinds of consequences are things that I think now it's worth thinking about tell me a story about a world in which a woman beats up a teenager flying drone over connecticut beach like these things happen that i'm sure you know very few designers of drones are really sort of running through which is again isn't to say don't make the drone that you can fly over people at the beach but it is to say we should start expanding the narrative expanding the considerations around that sort of thing tell me a story about a world in which everyone has a robot personal assistant ik member who talked about robot personal assistants in an era na is but the world might look like this and this is a much richer story about that or it might look like this i hope not so a few years ago I wanted to sort of begin to address these kinds of things but do it in a very tangible way so I gathered a bunch of people together Aaron was there and we started with a brief to say let's create a catalog of products from the future so like let's take today's whatever is the top at this time I think was 2013 when I was twenty eleven when was it its way to longer 2012 you know the top of the Gartner hype curve what are all the memes of the day and now let's extrapolate those things all the way down to the long tail to the point where they're three for a dollar you get them at the corner convenience store they're about as like exciting and fascinating as a laser pointer which to me is like mind-boggling and the laser is like Nobel prize-winning technology and now effectively it's probably the world's best category I could you imagine like if she's like what are you making making a cat to it now come on that's not going to work so looking at the ways in which we could do this we use that archetype of the product catalog and initially it was like imagine sky mall in the future what does it actually become and what does it look like when they're 3d printers aren't as precious as they are now but they're they're made by cuisinart or something look at that and try to represent that so we spent a day in the absolutely amazing archives of the Henry Ford Museum where they've got a collection of all the mcdonalds happy meals which isn't it fantastic I think and we we did a lot of documentation on the process and a lot of discussion about how to represent these things we did a prototype of what the catalog might look like and then we actually made a catalog this for me is like another one of those archetypes like take your product or take your idea or take your sort of market plate your market space where there's internet of things or connected aquariums or whatever might be and now actually fill that world out don't just focus on your one thing like make the entire accessory ecosystem make all the service infrastructure that's going to live alongside of it you know it create we've done this another archetype is like comment forums make the common forms what are people going to say and they're kind of like really bad pros and hacked up kind of like the thing didn't work I got it and there was nothing in the box like people say these things about products but it adds the kind of depth to the narrative that I think is quite important sold them all around the world which was which was super fun put up some some advertisements this was all part of like a massive be a social media kind of campaign because I was very nervous about this a very large number of boxes living in my house and i'm sure my wife wouldn't be happy if they didn't sell out so just kind of went crazy on the internet trying to promote it made made it a little bit weird to say you know some people kind of like I'm not sure what this thing is who's this guy and what are they trying to sell and we got all kinds of wonderful and weird kind of like emails back people saying like I already made that why are you guys selling it or was another one hey can you put my product from my product in your next catalog it's really great these kinds of things was made it all that much more fun fun billboards and then just lots of I'm just going out on Twitter and doing what Twitter does well which is like you know make up lists and numbers of things so 116th the truths about the Internet of Things opportunities I would then behold the real Internet of Things catalogue things some are of the internet 116 products 62 classified 112 pages reassuringly astute behold water-based Ice Cube's go from retro to artisanal and the point of the whole thing was was what you know number one have fun because that makes it better make it all normal but also a little bit weird account for like current date trends do it in print just because that seemed like a you know like having a real thing at it added a little bit more gravity to it don't make it about predictions so we're not trying to predict what the world might look like but more make it about provocations like conversation starters things that people begin to start talking about and thinking about and then make the extraordinary like 3d printers quite ordinary and bunnell so it's that quick quote a ting every day that Fiona's panel should have focused on in the yesterday here's some here's some spreads its give you a sense of what it looked like there was a lot of like that we call them sort of like ancillary material around it so we made crowdfunding quite routine so some of the representations little pictograms and they would say you know 12% funded and so you get the sense that that becomes so ordinary and people have sort of accepted there's a lot of sort of algorithmic generated things so there was film that was like ninety-eight percent algorithm written there was a well just like a whole range of like very peculiar sort of bizarre things some of the things that made absolutely gets in some of the things just felt like your kind of flipping through Alibaba on LSD or something like this Cory Doctorow called it may be 2014's fly inside finest science fiction which was like when panda jerky was another one because pandas go for Ural because they figure out how to clone them and they lose control and so there's annual cullings and then it got really weird so you got a call from Fox News who are like can you talk about your weather technology products which was which is wonderful the funny story about this is that when i went there there's the guy with the clipboard he's like okay right this way mr. Bleeker you kind of go through and into the into the makeup room like oh this is a real thing like thinking it like make me up was like no there was a there's a closet behind the makeup room with a chair in it and a monitor with a furry fuzzy background of the newsroom so then it looks like this when you're actually on Fox News trying to be very serious and so that's what we did that was a you know a bit of an experiment like I said mostly to have fun but then also my my sort of semi serious goal is that I feel like design fiction should be a kind of practice that is employed sort of routinely it's it's the thing that I think now is much more modern than doing a consumer panel or doing a lot of sort of research trying to understand what the market needs I think it's a way of sort of bringing back in a bit of creative insight and storytelling to enliven things with so the thing that I was concerned about is that people might not take it seriously like I thought people this would be sitting next to the potpourri in the guest bathroom that people would just sort of like pull out and joke about and you do think it's kind of a serious thing to think about where we're going and and how we're going to get there and what we do want to do and what we don't want to do so the next one that we're doing another archetype is the industry report and we sort of went through the same process so we had a workshop in Geneva at the beginning of beginning of december to think about how we might actually shift things around and so what we're going to do is we're going to take things that you might find that people want to do in the Internet of Things and represent them in a couple ways so we're going to be more straightforward with the archetype we're using so you know cans will be connected to the Internet and the idea here is that cans will be traceable so you can decide you have control over the cans you buy on the internet to the degree that you can say I want fifty percent of the refundable deposit and the other fifty percent can go to the person who collected the can or you might be a little stingy and be like no no I want it all and so you imagine a sort of economy where the the kind of you know that the folks who kind of go back and forth in my back alley on recycling day collecting cans which are perfectly happy for them to do become part of this larger kind of weird ecosystem of Labor and ramune remuneration or maybe not so we would talk about the can we talk about the ecosystem that exists some of the technology that would support a can that was connected to the Internet and then do things like fake ads like how would L khoa big aluminum manufacturer how would they represent this new innovation and how would they talk about it as they might in an advertisement which is complete you know a lot of PR and that kind of language we would do things like if there were an internet-connected napkin called tap 'can that you tapped in order to interact with it how would that be as a kind of earnest kickstarter by a couple of stanford mechanical engineers or whatever how would they actually talk about it and describe it and what would they say they're trying to do what would their funding goals be and all that kind of stuff when google finally introduces the you know i'm calling it al gore the the google car how would they actually represent it and would they get equity actually get ease bahar to do the interior design of it in order to get a little get a little clout if people recognize this is sort of aping the ogilvy & mather car ad for the VW there's some characters so there's our Birnbaum because they're always these kind of pundits who promote their ability to help you sort of navigate this new world so our a burn ban is the data wealth king and he will be on data wealth King calm he's got a book telling you your data is your wealth and how to actually use your data in order to generate revenue Apple's going to connect health to bespoke drinks so you drinks are formulated for you individually so Oh Aaron you'll have a drink called hydrate that you can actually get from your Cuisinart that's connected to your apple health account to give you the right level of enzymes and how would Apple actually try to sell that how would they represent it in their in their idiom in their style they might also have lunch ready to eat for your child because they're also connected to that system what would be the way in which that packaging would look like and how would it represent a world in which data analytics kind of goes to its logical but also slightly strange and weird conclusion so that's that's about it that we were going to do well just so another architect I'm very interested in and actually for I XDA which is next month here i'll be doing a workshop on Quick Start Guide so we're going to create a quick start guide for the pilot Helios so I made that up but it's a it's a self-driving car so i'll have like all the five major aspects and functionalities of the car how do you get it to park how do you put it into taxi mode how do you put it into privacy mode so that it draws the blinds when you're actually driving like all those kinds of things in order to play out the kinds of interactions and touch points and understand how the technology might live in the world that's it thank you
