 all right so we're here with the quad industries and who are you I'm a Christian so responsible for R&D at cotton asti's Belgium so what I'm looking at here there's a it looks like there's like processors together with flexible yeah actually you've actually here it's what we call hybrid electronics so what we do here is combine two additional traditional silicon based components with printed electronics so how do you do that so you have the printed circuit and then you glue assemble the components on top of this fall's glue precisely in the right place so yeah pick-and-place machines like conventional they can place receipts used for soldering components on conventional electronics you can also do it with by gluing and here you have a if you dissin issue yes so this is a force sensor based shoe insole so you have eight pressure sensitive areas and in that way you can analyze the data doing gait analysis of the gait analysis of the top Sportage yes like the high at Lane yeah this is now already used for by Olympic athletes to do really analyzing of their training or their their runners so nice they have a battery and the shoe somewhere connected to it they need the battery yeah actually the product looks like this this is developed by our customer we do the production of this and you just clip this at the side of your shoe you can go and run and they have information about where on the foot they put pressure or yeah food analyze of the movement or the movement of the other foods and give the feedback then to the sport nice what are you looking at here actually you see the more so we are already active for more than 30 years 30 years and user data faces membrane switches so these are the oldest so this was like a long time ago there was products like this yeah so this is actually a memories loose so you have a graphic print that foil and behind this you have also a silver printed functional circuit on top of that with metal domes and other components and you assemble everything together nice what is that actually this is a touch-based usually the case so here you have a capacitive slider which you just can read out in this case prince-elector luminescent inks on a foil to have back lighted finish alright so where you based you are in Belgium headquarters in Belgium and then volume production is devaki and so there's volume production is already in volume your staff volume are we talking about millions of devices no no up to let's say 100,000 pieces it's in the user interfaces and let's say on the new application within the printed electronics you are aiming at a few million pieces you're aiming at yeah that means you are still ramping up everything to make it happen true it's still a new business so to say so prediction typical production budgets now are up to ten thousand pieces and you are really qualifying and ramping up those volumes so what do you do with ten thousand pieces is for this kind of product for for batteries and we do printed batteries we relies the C of M few cell battery technology and therefore we are now running quite large production batches so this is a flexible battery yeah and what's inside is it safe it's safe it's fully printed flexible and safe and what's the material it's a zinc and manganese and how much power is there it's printed so it has its limitation but for example this one it's 1.50 and it's 100 million per hours that's amazing so after the you use it you have to throw it out yeah you can recycle something like all right like this flexible where does it go if you take this to some volumes it will be around it's euro range so it's around 1 euro 1 euro and it could be in for what product is it for smart clothing this is a nice product which has been made based on printed battery so in this case you have a printed circuit combined to it printed battery and you also have one component assemble to talk about nice what kind of component is it in small microprocessor actually this is a fully integrated chip developed by an HP having an integrated temperature logger integrated memory integrated NFC communication so it's all-in-one silicon chip combines with printed electronics where possible is it an arm cortex-m zero plus or something and small arm could be what are these kind of chips there these are test chips so this is really to evaluate the production technology so in the future there's going to be lots of hybrid stuff happening with the factor for the with the for high performance applications yeah you still need some silicon and combined to it's printer technology all right so I guess you have a lot of future products you're working on right yes yeah a lot of stuff in the pipeline well fortunately we cannot disclose everything but some of it so yeah smart labels a lot of smart labels so like this temperature sensor but you can add other sensing technology but also labels for advertisement where you add some led functionality and nice cool
