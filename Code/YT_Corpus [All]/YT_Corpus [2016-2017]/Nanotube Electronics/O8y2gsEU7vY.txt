 nano online simulation and more for nanotechnology hello I'd like to tell you about a project that I'm involved in needs is a five-year initiative is jointly funded by the US National Science Foundation and by the semiconductor Research Corporation I mark lundström at Purdue I'm the lead investigator the four universities involved in this effort are Purdue UC Berkeley MIT and Stanford we've recently had our fourth annual review meeting several of the presentations that were made at that meeting are available and for downloading at this website what I'd like to do in this quick presentation is to give you a brief overview and tell you what the whole program is about so these are the three things i hope to accomplish first of all just to tell you a little bit about why needs was established what it's all about what we're trying to do a little bit of a sense as to where things stand in your for of this project and then a little bit of thinking about you know what we're setting the stage for where this initiative is heading so it really this effort really came out of preparing for being effective in electronics in the 21st century so we've recently heard that Moore's Law is ending electronics is entering a new phase but it's a new and even more exciting phase from my perspective but things will change Electronics is going to be more and more pervasive in the 21st century it's pervasive now it's going to be even more so in the future it's going to be more differentiated and more differentiated in two senses one is being driven by a much wider range of applications but also solutions to problems enabled by a much wider range of materials and devices and technologies so this is it's going to be a very exciting time that we're entering and in order to be successful in this new phase of electronics it's going to require a new kind of engineer or applied scientist and part of our objective is to help give our students the experiences and training they need to be effective in this new era so if you just look at happening these days you can see major initiatives by the semiconductor industry this particular one was done jointly with the National Science Foundation to look at new ways of information processing people are looking at lots of new architectures lots of new device technologies and one of the things you notice that we're seeing more and more of is putting together teams of people who go all the way from basic materials and devices all the way up to circuits and systems and architectures because we need this end-to-end approach to solve the problems that we're entering the problems that we're addressing these days but electronics is more and more about more than information processing and communication energy systems things like photovoltaic solar cells and PV arrays are complicated systems that have many of the same challenges that complicated electronic chips have but they still have not benefited from the kind of model driven hierarchical design approach that is common in electronics and one of our goals is to bring those approaches to this field and deal with its challenging problem is how do you confidently predict fifty-year reliabilities for systems like this there's more and more interest in civil infrastructure programmable when those energy scavenging sensors in in civil infrastructure so lots of new opportunities for new technologies to solve important problems in civil infrastructure this is the decade of the brain there's lots of interest in producing instrumentation that will help us probe on probe what goes on inside the human brain understanding human cognition developing brain machine interfaces lots of exciting new opportunities that will require new approaches and new technologies and health and medicine is another example of another opportunity for electronics and there are many of these opportunities that is going to require very broad individuals that bring a very deep understanding of electronics to them so we can draw pictures like this when we talk about end-to-end research pictures that start at a very fundamental level of basic research that go up to developing models that help us understand and optimize materials and devices and then to higher and higher levels of circuits and systems and applications and we're very much in this initiative about trying to connect a work at the fundamental level to work at the system's level the National Science Foundation when it established this program anticipated that most of our efforts would be directed here at the fundamental level materials and devices nanoscience but a key objective of the program is to connect that work the circuits and systems and applications that's what needs is really all about and we have chosen to address these complementary challenges to focus on deeply physical compact models that are useful both in driving fundamental work and in simulating the performance of circuits and systems so we're not a compact modeling initiative we're very very much about putting together teams of people that address problems from atoms to applications but the primary focus in this limited-time initiative is on developing compact models physics-based compact models because they provide a strong connection between fundamental work and applications so let me just say a word about what i mean by deeply physical compact models when we do research and new materials and new devices we do experiments we do measurements to characterize those experiments of course we need a model to interpret those measurements with we do very detailed first principles atomistic level simulations we do higher-level continuum level simulations no one of these gives us a complete understanding of the new material or device but by putting it all together and developing an analytically compact model with equations or simple MATLAB scripts that capture the essence of the problem and all of the information and what we've learned from each of these different aspects we can develop an understanding of the device based on what we learn from fundamental detailed work feed that back in proposing new experiments and interpreting experian and that iterative process ends up producing it's what we mean by understanding a new material or a new device technology and it produces a very analytically compact clear understanding of what's important for that particular device and a PhD student might might do this for a while and publish a few papers and that's a PhD thesis now needs is very much about developing models like this and maintaining a tight connection to fundamental research but what makes needs different is that in addition we want to take the next step and take this very physical model it doesn't work in a circuit simulation environment and develop it into a compact circuit model that will work in a simulation environment for circuits that will help us understand the performance of the device in a circuit that may undercover uncover issues and problems that we had not originally addressed that we can feed that back to the fundamental work but that might also give the designer a tool that can be used to explore what this particular new device could be used for in applications so just some very quick examples of this fundamental work that's going on within the center there's a lot of nano transistors a wide variety of nano transistors this is some work that was done with the virtual source model developed at MIT by Dmitri an tinnitus and his colleagues this particular paper was using it to explore extract physical understanding of mean free paths and injection velocities in very short channel silicon MOSFETs more recent versions of this model had become less and less empirical and more and more predictive recently the model has been applied to some very high-performance 35 MOSFETs in which which are operate almost exactly at the ballistic limit and in which these ballistic effects just stand out crystal clear and very recently it's been applied to some problems that companies have been uncovering when they're developing FinFET technology so advanced nano transistors is one aspect but they're a wide variety of problems that are being explored and driven by deeply physical compact models within this program photovoltaics is another example of where we're trying to develop models that comprehend the physics of a solar cell the variabilities that are present how those variabilities affect the performance of a panel in the field and very much trying to produce this end-to-end simulation framework much like we use for designing complex chips but bringing that to a new field and understanding how variability at the device level affects performance at the system level and understanding how you develop physics-based reliability models to predict the long-term real reliability of systems like this another aspect of the work this particular work is going on at Stanford it has to do with carbon nanotube electronics carbon nanotubes are quite variable materials carbon nanotube transistors are very highly variable the team at Stanford is developing a framework driven by a very physics-based compact model that comprehends these variabilities but making that the starting point for a comprehensive framework that goes to higher and higher levels and explores the design of systems in the presence of highly variable devices through this hierarchical framework and this is being deployed as a case study on our website and an example for others I mentioned that there's a wide variety of physics and devices and approaches and materials being explored spintronics is another example this is an example of where some physical models highly physical models expressed in circuit form are being developed by supriyo Dada's team these models can be used by extending normal circuit concepts to spin voltages and spin currents they can then we hook together to simulate complicated experiments or devices you can download those from the need site this is an example of some work done in Z Hong Chen's lab where we're looking at the non-local voltages that are induced by the spin transport laterally in a sheet of graphene and you can see that you can represent this experiment with a complicated circuit the based on these elements that can be simulated in spice does a pretty good job of describing the experiment and allows you to pull out physical parameters like spin diffusion length and things like that at the same time more recently this group is also looking at building much more complicated systems to do information processing in new ways this particular work makes use of some probabilistic computing ideas with nano magnets to solve the Traveling Salesman problem and you can see a presentation on this work in the at this website that you can download another set of the work has to do with biomedical devices in biology this particular sketch indicates some work that is about to be published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences done by Ashraful arms group here at Purdue it uses a droplet based sensor which can as the droplet evaporates the concentration of the of the materials inside the droplet the ions or the salt solution or whatever it is increases through this technique you can beat the diffusion limit and get exquisite sensitivity this particular work is looking at a way to measure the conductance as the drop evaporates and use that to and for whether the cells inside the droplet or alive or dead and it produces an alternative label-free technique to do this kind of measurement which is very important and looking at things like food pathogens so that's an example of the kinds of ways that a deeply physical compact model can help advance fundamental research these are not models that you do when the work is all done their models that you do to help you understand the work that you're doing and to drive it in useful directions but what neat makes needs different is then taking the next step and taking that highly physical model and expressing it in a spice compatible compact circuit model framework that can be used to explore applications now to accomplish that second part of the mission which is really what makes needs different from a standard research center we are developing some infrastructure that facilitates the development and dissemination of packed circuit models like that and these are the four goals that we set for this side of our objectives for infrastructure goals and let me quickly go through these four goals and just tell you a little bit about what we're doing there the major tool development effort is something we call map model analysis and prototyping platform this is a MATLAB based platform being developed at Berkeley and it's a MATLAB environment in which you can write a compact model tested in a simple circuit simulation framework to do DC AC and transient simulations test and debug your models and for some of the problems that we deal with it may provide all of the circuit simulation that is needed but for others you may need to insert this in a real spice engine either standard or open-source spice engine or maybe someday commercial engines and we've already demonstrated the ability to take those MATLAB models and directly insert them as C code in the executable of an open-source spice programs ice which is being developed at Sandia National Laboratories one other part of this framework has to do with verilog a models Verilog a is the standard language that people write compact models in when you're working at the very fundamental level you're not a cop you don't do compact modeling for a living you might write a compact model from time to time if you're learning Verilog a your Verilog a script might have problems in it and what we have are finding is at a very convenient way to debug Verilog a models is to take the model automatically translate them back into a MATLAB model with a tool called vApp Verilog a to map and then you can run it in a familiar MATLAB environment and understand how it's converging how it performs and what the issues might be and we're finding that to be a very effective way for developing robust compact models so we see map having three different roles in electronics it facilitates the development of high quality compact models by people who don't do this routinely and regularly their folk is on more fundamental work it promotes the use of circuit simulation beyond traditional electrical engineering fields places where you may not have a spice environment handy or available to you easily and where you may not be used to routinely using SPICE now you have an open source MATLAB or octave platform that allows you to do these simulations we're finding that it's also proving to be useful for circuit simulation experts to people who develop new algorithms because it gives them access to the simulation engine that they can play with and tweak and refine as they're developing their algorithms now I also want to mention that in this new era that we're entering where we're dealing with an increasing diversity of technologies to solve problems map is also being developed as a multiphysics platform yet not only does electrical devices and circuits it's being developed to do optical and thermal and spin tronic and biochemical circuits as well each of them can talk to their to their neighbors in an electrical circuit or an optical circuit but the circuits in different domains can also communicate with each other so we think that that's going to be important in the new kinds of technologies that we're developing in the future a second tool that we've developed is something to help people who you originally developed to help people who occasionally right Verilog a models to help debug check their codes for syntax so you can run your mot your Verilog a model through VA lint it'll check the code for syntax pretty printed in denton tanned do things like that but more importantly it will actually test the model for adherence to best practices this is a recent paper written by several people who are experts in the field and are also closely involved with us in our in our advisory board and jg roy chowdhury our lead p I at Berkeley this is a paper that describes best practices for writing compact models VA lint checks for most of those best practices and alerts you as to whether you're following them or not following them so that's a useful tool to help us improve the quality of these comp models now we also aim to become a central repository a place where people can publish their models a place where people can come and find a wide variety of models to do that we've created a publishing tool so anyone can come to the website they can start a project they can build up their compact model publication with the model itself with the circuit benchmarks with the manual with the experimental data to calibrate the model with they can test it with VA lint and iterate until it passes and then after it's reviewed by a curator it's automatically published on our website it's assigned a digital object identifier and very soon you're going to be able to search for compact models just the way you now search for papers on the web so this is a useful tool we believe for the community that will help a larger number of people publish models and will help others come and find those models so if you come to our website you'll see a significant collection of models that are a growing set of models covering a very wide range of technologies and you can see what some of them are here right now we have 35 such models about twenty percent of them came from people not formally in the program and we hope to see that grow they've been downloaded over 10,000 times which is a factor of 10 growth in the last year and we're really on our way I think to becoming a useful resource for the community and that's our objective now another goal of this project is to help prepare our own students ourselves working engineers for this new era that we're entering and in this new era is going to require some very special people people who can bring together a broad range of technologies can add their own depth and expertise in their particular field and bring it all together to create an important new application or solve an important challenge the people that do this need a deep understanding of nano science and technology because that pervades everything we do they need a deep understanding of Electrical Engineering so they can bring an electrical engineers way of thinking about these problems to new fields they need a very broad understanding of technology in addition to that depth in EE but it can't be a shallow understanding it has to it has to have enough depth that they can do significant work with these new technologies which means they have to be able to quickly learn adapt and contribute to new projects and it requires more and more an understanding of Technology from end to end an understanding at the fundamental level but an understanding of what the system level demands in terms of the week of the requirements of that technology as well so to address that challenge the experiences that students get in this initiative help address part of that showers the other way that we're addressing that challenge is through something we call nanohub you and these courses are now offered for the first time through the EDX platform as well so we have 21 courses over 50,000 people have registered for them many universities many companies and people in many different countries this is an example of one of those courses this is a course by Supriya Dada that discusses a fundamental understanding of how current flows at the nano scale since most of the devices we work with these days are nano scale devices it was offered on EDX for the first its first offering and then pulled back to nanohub you where anyone could access it and take it at their own pace so these courses are attended are intended to be broadly accessible without a long string of prerequisites they're intended to bring new insights and understanding and approaches from what we're learning in nanoscience into engineering education and to practicing engineers and scientists they're short but they're intended to be deep starting points there's enough to get you started then you can learn what you need to learn for your project they're not broad shallow survey courses and they're all about new approaches and new ways of thinking about problems and we aim to deploy courses on this website that are not widely available elsewhere but for which there's a wide demand so visit nanohub you and you'll be able to see what's available there so all of these resources are available through our website needs nanohub org and if you go to the website you'll see a section where you'll see those 35 compact models you can download them you'll see a section of tools where you can access the map platform the VA lint tools the publishing platform and publish your own compact model there you'll see some training resources if you're a first-time compact model developer or you're new to that you'll see some some seminars and tutorials on the art and practice of developing compact models there's a section we call science two systems there's some more fundamental physics tools that back up the compact models there but there's also some system level scripts that begin with a compact model and put it in a framework that allows you to project the performance of a system they work under Stanford in their carbon nanotube electronics is being deployed there is our first case study and how you go about doing that and the education section focuses on the fundamentals of the science of these new technologies spintronics nanoelectronics activities like that the Nano of you is accessible through there so visit needs nanoha borg it is getting growing visibility as a useful resource for the community we hope not only to have it be a place where people come and download resources or view courses or seminars but a place where people publish their own compact models and contribute to that so as I said we are addressing these goals and what we're trying to do through this five year project is to try to put in place some resources some examples some case studies some tools and practices that will make it easier in the future for us to address these challenging problems with a broad range of technologies that require an understanding from a basic level to a to a system level and this you know causes us to think a little bit about where are we heading we very much think that the goal of this project was to set the state age for the way that will be doing research in the future so if you think about how research is done one model of research is this van over Bush model where you do work on basic research and don't without any direct thought of what it might be applied for and history shows that this oftentimes leads to radically new technologies so that's one way of doing it but there's another way instead of necessarily going from basic research to undefined applications you can also go from a very well-defined application and in the process do some very basic and fundamental research so this is a an excellent book by Donald Stokes who calls this past year's quadrant style of research after Louis Pasteur who set out to cure infectious diseases but in the process did some first-rate science I call this use inspired basic research the research itself is just as high quality but it's driven by solving an important problem not only do you solve an important problem if you're successful but you advance basic research as well so you have those two goals when you're doing this kind of research and you know there's a lot of books and talk about Bell Labs these days and what made it so great Bell Labs was a place that did both it had a lot of unfettered research and permitted people hide agree of freedom that's the first model but it also had some really important problems for the Bell System that needed to be solved and people found that very useful to focus on on real problems and that oftentimes led to some really outstanding Nobel prize-winning research so the kind of research that we would do in this style of research would be very much application driven it would be done by small teams of people people who are experts at the application and system level people who are experts at the device and materials level but all of which have an appreciation for that for the technology from one end to the other the goal would be to solve important problems that can only be solved with new breakthroughs in science another goal would be not just to solve the problem but also to advance basic materials and device science in the process contribute something that will help to solve new problems in the future these problems would be ambitious but they would be achievable by a small team in a few years so you think back to the transistor when Bell Labs recognized that the scientific base was there the time was right to invent a solid-state replacement for a vacuum tube an idea that had been patented in nineteen thirty or so it only took a small team of people a little over two years to do that so we're not looking for twenty year projects it's important to do 20 year projects but we're looking here to do things that are doable in 32 years five years by a small team of people the teams would be vertically integrated so it would give the people involved in these experience in working across levels of the hierarchy and the individual projects would each be solving a particular problem with a particular technology or set of technologies but you'd like to see them share a common set of approaches and maybe tools and we would very much like to see these projects employ this model driven approach that has been so successful and developed and refined over many years and electronics with compact models the deeply physical compact models being the bridge between the fundamental work and the application work and hopefully needs will have set the stage by making the development of these models much more easy to do and the quality of the models much higher with the resources it needs offers so we sort of see a landscape like this that might be possible lots of fundamental research is going on there seems to be a new breakthrough every day we have lots of important problems we would like to recognize where the connections are you know how can this particular problem make use of this advance in science and how can we put together teams that then can realize the promise of this new science in a real application now a lot of this is sort of like Bell Labs Bell Labs had a lot of unfettered research Bell Labs had a lot of important problems there's a need it seems for something in between some enabling infrastructure and that's something that needs has been trying to set the stage for this in a blur would provide tools the tools might be specialized and evolved for the particular problems that are being addressed it would add expertise it would disseminate the results to the broader community so that it could have higher impact and others could build on it or effectively it would provide the kind of educational resources that are not widely available there but that are needed for these new kinds of problems might support commercialization for taking the next step after projects become successful and just providing leadership support and synergy that would make this more than a collection of independent projects so that's the possibility that's there to create something that is analogous to Bell Labs but to do it in a much different time and environment and to do it in an academic environment but to try to bring that flavor of a great industrial research lab to academia so that's that's my summary I've tried to give you a little bit of quick understanding of why needs was established what we're trying to do where things stand in year four of this five-year project and some ideas and where we might be heading so I think it's a very exciting time to be an engineer electronics is undergoing a large transition but we have a very exciting future ahead of us I would encourage you to explore the presentations and posters that are available on the site it gives you much more much broader and more in-depth sense of the work going on and if you have questions feel free to email them to me at this address here thank you for listening
