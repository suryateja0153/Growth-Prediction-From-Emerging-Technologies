 gentlemen of six-string heaven here is my amp setup and Turan rig need anything I'm a cab it's got Celestine's in it I'm gonna plug amp she live from tough piece of kick powered by a nanotube solid stake it is 100 watts power and it is very loud hundred watts I've only had it on three the loudest which is just equipment at 30 watts with the aid of a normal foot switch becomes a four-channel line with boost so you just program each sound you want in here so I thought click this just goes to a clean sound reverb yeah it again it goes to my last to start channel so we have a vintage channel which is like a plexi we have a classic channel which is very much like a jcm800 and we have a modern which is quite saldanha wish so I'm going back an act of it a boost so very burst all right so what I'm doing is going straight into a Hendrix crybaby from there into the pitch black in a pitch black into mxr phase 90 everybody's good up an mxr face 95 I'll consider at the first 19 to a module module by TC Electronics super pedal I have that set on the bottom position with a bit of driving a little bit of boost tiny bit bass and a lot of trouble just to give it a bit of edge especially if you're using the vintage channel which is very plexi that goes back in there the input then effects end goes to the angel wing chorus just by Tom seduced fantastic anouk's time car which gives me a lovely long modulated delay with tails I'll switch it off and I'll still keep going over there into a react or van wah I've got that on a shortish sort of setting and that's all I need really to the nice doctors but when I'm with millennium I have this TC spark which gives me a volume boost so I could be heard over the other guitarist or pole by a fuel tank and their 16 arms cuz this is the 16 or Laney fat cap sounds very much like a fabric 12 most only tribute to our Lord with Celeste Ian's a Celestia pne's also running it on 16 arms and it sounds a bit I have enough a cap which is my marshal which I run at eight that's got brighter Sun so there you go see what it sounds like last preset you
