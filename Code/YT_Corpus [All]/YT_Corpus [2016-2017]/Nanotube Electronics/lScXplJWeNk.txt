 okay here's the setup you've got Tesla coil sat in the middle she's sat on the scale and if we can get a focus on the scale it's reading just over a kilogram I said it's up to go away one of the coils and then kind of ran it and strange things started to happen but I'll show that in a minute so the setup is we've got a coil there we've got the PI zero driver and then sat in the background is a laptop which controls a lot I'll check a detail of the link of the setup onto the video so you can get more details but for this particular one daddy's kind of irrelevant so I'm gonna lock off the camera on the stand and then I'm going to leave this running and entirely for the duration of the video okay so locked off the camera now gonna go and put some power into the coil and it's gonna go into bitten bursts of about 500 Hertz and we'll see what happens to the weight of the coil so as you can see every time there was power the coil and seemed to lose about 150 grams which at this low power level is about what I've seen okay I'm gonna put the camera back where it was so you can see the whole coil and just prove that there is absolutely no wires or anything over the top there's nothing supporting it nothing at all it is exactly what you're seeing in the camera so and just going to go and change a few things I'm going to stop the recording for now and we'll set up a tune and we'll see what it does then I have noticed that the scales appear to have a really bad return to zero error which isn't brilliant for demonstrating this effect unfortunately and wanted to use mechanical scales because obviously electronic ones would definitely give false readings so yeah I agree it's not the most detailed in scientific analysis and it's definitely not going to be any accurate readings from it and but as a proof of principle and it seems to work so of a quick play with a tune and you can go and watch the wait various as it plays
