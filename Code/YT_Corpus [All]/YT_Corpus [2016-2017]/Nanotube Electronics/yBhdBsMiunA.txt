 now there is no doubt that encryption is the lightning rod in the tech world today tech giant's must now consider not only how strong of encryption they can provide to their customers but also whether or not that encryption will bite them in the legal bite when the US federal government comes calling still in a story filled with fiery rhetoric it's nice to see most of the major players pulling together to say let's figure this all out all that is except Amazon which has to decided it's a lot easier just to remove encryption all together yesterday amazon announced the deprecation of full device encryption in fire OS five users of amazon fire devices now must choose to keep their device encryption along with fire OS four or decrypt their devices while upgrading to five there was a notable outcry after the announcement with several wondering if Amazon had sacrificed customer privacy on the altar of law enforcement overreach but Amazon claims that full device encryption was an enterprise feature and specifically an enterprise feature that nobody was using whatever the case if you plan on updating your fire you may want to reconsider what personal information you keep in the Amazon garden carbon dioxide batteries exhaling can charge your phone by using the concept of disillusion researchers were able to break apart carbon dioxide into its base elements or carbon and oxygen by using step or the solar thermal electrochemical process with a carbon they were able to generate carbon nanotubes which are flexible conductive stable and stronger than steel the oxygen by-product is channeled back to its jet to the generator to boost his combustion efficiency when incorporating carbon nanotubes into lithium-ion batteries by using them as the positive electrodes or anodes they were able to give more than 10 times power storage performance carbon nanotubes can also be used to other battery types infusing the nano fibers as positive electrodes in sodium iron batteries as well sodium ion batteries current usage is in electrical grids for low-cost large-scale applications infused with carbon nanotubes batteries showed no sign of fatigue after they were exposed to almost 10 weeks of continuous charging and discharging imagine a fossil fuel electrical power plant that could produce zero net carbon dioxide emissions
