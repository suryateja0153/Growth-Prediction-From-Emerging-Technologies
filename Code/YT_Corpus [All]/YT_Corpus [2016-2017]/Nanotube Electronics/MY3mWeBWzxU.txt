 these words contributes to the technological development of stretchable electronics which means electronic circuit that can stretch and relax inch and then cover any sort of surfaces the innovation is on the format of the material we've developed which is a hybrid material based on liquid metal and solid metallic alloys this film is composed of gold and gallium and this the two materials are intertwined on the form the continuous film that maintains its conductivity even when the material is stretched to a four times each length or it's stretched to millions of cycles this can use in every aspect of a smart skin we can integrate conventional electronics into assembly that can stretch and carry power we can use it in soft robotics wearable application smart garment we can build sensors that are able to be integrated into a Sinn Fein and the form but we can also use it to construct actuators to give tactile feedback
