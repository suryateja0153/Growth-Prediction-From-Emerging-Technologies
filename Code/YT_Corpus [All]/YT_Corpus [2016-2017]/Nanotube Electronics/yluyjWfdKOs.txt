 nano online simulation and more for nanotechnology p.m. you were here yesterday you heard part one of dr. House's presentation which was a nice general overview of black carbon nanotube technologies and why there are great interest in analog electronics a little bit about fabrication and characterization and I mentioned at that time that what impressed me about this group is the way it worked from a very fundamental level to building devices to doing circuits and system applications so we're going to hear about a different aspect of this work today and the aspect has to do with this multiscale simulation framework at your building will turn it over tomorrow yes welcome everybody and nicest year again for the second part of my presentation today I'm going to continue to talk about the high-frequency cavenaghi of transistors we are interested in and especially I will focusing on the multi sea and simulation framework for those of you who not attend it my presentation yesterday I summarized on this light and main finding clicks go so it quickly so we have seen that scene tease itself a very unique intrinsic electrical properties like the high-frequency capability the high device minuite we talked about this yesterday and we use we want to use these electrical properties on circuit level you want to build high frequency transistors with a very low distortion and we discussed the challenges we are faithless if you want to design and fabricate these transistors one of the most of you issues today is in realizing these multitude transistors and a mass production that process is to get rid of the metallic tubes depending on the process you use you get different numbers of metallic tubes in a channel five percent angles and up to thirty percent and this is the typical transfer characteristic of a multitude transistor and you see you cannot switch off this n type transistor due to metallic tubes we have but still you can build applications was such a transistor because if you're interested in low noise amplifier it's working at it it's working at a single by respond here maybe where we have to peek GM and it's working fine so we don't care about that we do not have to switch off the transistor for specific applications and we are working hard to get rid of the magnetic tubes but it's really difficult to do this in a mass production like process the other subject I discussed with you was the compact model we have it's called see cam it's a seeing physics-based compact model and we can use this compact model not only to fit the characteristics of an existing technology you can also make some projections with this compact model you can project how a circuit will perform for future technology node which may be has much less imperfections with a lower number of metallic tubes producing it a compact model and we have something like this today I'm going to talk about the multi-scale simulation framework and in the Center for advancing electronics trace and I'm a research group leader in this field and my responsibility is to push forward the martyrs gay simulation framework for one-dimensional electronics together with my group what I want to talk about this the falling today I have prepared too many topics as always but within 45 minutes I have today I will present only selected topics and I really like to cover the following things I want to talk with you about the wall of modeling in designing seen T transistors I want to show you some examples of our multi skills the Malaysian framework and these examples are how can we build transistors very long transistors which possess the high device linearity we hope to get finally in the future we will see that if you are talking about the device linearity we have to talk about the context and we really have to understand the contact physics and this will be another example of how artists k simulation bemberg here we use a domestic simulations and simulations at a continuous level trying to stand to all of the contacts and i hope that i will have time to discuss with you all the time dependent transport phenomena in CNT vets where we have to solve the time dependent Schrodinger equation and some backup topics for poor Dolph line discussions so I will be here until tomorrow so we have some time if you're interested me if you're interested in to talk about this contact me after the presentation so we can talk about the band structure effects the effect on them on transport we can talk about how to include Bend Bend tunneling in our way to solve the Schrodinger equation it's a different way to solve it we can discuss the modeling of defects and functionalization of CNT efforts and we can also discuss electro-thermal ethics and CMT that is very interesting topic since early I do not have time to go through them here in this clock let's jump to the first subject of this presentation do all of modeling for designing ct-based transistors we have discussed yesterday the subjects which defines the properties of the transistors so we have to talk to about the intrinsic properties of the same character material you are using you have to have a look at a channel morphology because this determines the channel resistance and that's the application you can use for us you have to discuss I have to consider the device architecture because this defines the gate control and the first of the capacitances you have so there you have we are talking about high frequency capability of the structure and we have to discuss the end of his properties of the different materials for those of you who did not have time yesterday to attend the first part of my presentation I will summarize again the most important as electic unique intrinsic properties of a scientist so zine tees can be the metallica same interacting depending on this crystal structure of the tube on it reality you can have Co band gap to Isis but you can also get devices which have a band get very close to the Bengal of silicon the typical diameter you have in the CMT's is in between 0.5 to three nano meters so they're really small dimensions will be small and all the electrons which are flowing through the CNT can only flow in one direction they cannot flow right right or left they only can flow in one direction so we have real one dimensional transport and to to this one dimensional transport we have a very low scattering probability that we have very low signal trends at times so channel which is very good for high frequency applications and all the clothes related to the one dimensional transport is the linearity you can you can derive on physics some equations by doing some approximations that these devices can be linear what else zine T's can carry a very high current up to 25 mar cramp they have very low intrinsic capacitances and to to prevent structure of the CNT you can get high carrier velocities up to the family lhasa t of caffeine and if you summarize all these properties we can claim at C&T s RL sweded for high frequency applications where low distortion is mandatory the next point i want to discuss with you are the interface properties yesterday I talked a lot about the oxide interface traps leading to his terraces and the transfer characteristics today I'm not going to repeat this because today we will focus on the contact and the contact physics here we see the contact resistance over the embedding lengths so what is the embedding things you have to see in T we have the metal and the embedded links describes how far the tube is embedded into the metal if you change the embedding things you change the contact resistance so if you go to very small embedding length we get a very high contact resistance compared to a CNT because it's deeply embedded into the content and receive depending on the metal you use you get totally different contact resistance is in totally different behavior the physics behind us is very complex and so far not understood completely and we will work on this and one part of the physics i will explain you later at least our point of view so we have seen the transistor properties are affected by the intrinsic properties of the material we are using as a channel material in this case we are using CNTs you have to consider channel morphology we discussed about this yesterday as well as the lights architecture and we have to consider the interface properties the technology challenges to obtain and provide access to the unique intrinsic properties we have in fabricated devices and you want to use lies them for applications and today I want to add another claim about Cindy beds and device modeling so we say that if we want to be successful here we have to use device modeling insulation to support the technology or development and to optimize the device behavior and if you are going to simulate seen T vets you have to consider the intrinsic properties you have to include in our simulations the channel morphology the device architecture it's very important and also the interface properties so we have to find models which fits quite well to the interface properties we see in the experiments now let's talk about the multiscale simulation framework and if I say multi-scale I'm referring to this picture here to this very simplified picture at the lowest level with the highest physical rigor we have the atomistic simulations then we can go out one level and abstraction and we come to Continuum's level where we have the TCAP models and one further step in the abstraction level are the german level where we are working with the compact models so electrical engineers are working typically here at these two levels and physicists are working to clear I know there are some exceptions also in this room but typically all of that electric engines I'm working we need ticket models which are very fast the problem is that the issue the challenges that the gap in between the different levels is really large and we need to find ways to purge the gap between atomistic simulations and TCAP models it is very challenging and this is what we are trying to do in my group we are working together physicists and chemists electrical engineers and it's very hard to to speak the same language currently we are focusing on three different topics we are focusing in my group in on the transport itself you have different transport models we are focusing on the modeling of defects and functionalization and many people are working in the contact model now a motor skills simulation framework we have different simulators IV able at different abstraction levels so we have quantum based simulation methods semiclassical simulation methods we have methods working into atomistic ray and methods which are well known to be used for continuance description my working on this we found out that all the standard models which are available at TKE at level four contacts for describing defects feel if you want to apply them to a cnc fence so we need new model formulations we have to develop them and we are going to develop them but we need somehow an inspiration verification of the models we are developing here and we hope that they get this inspiration verification by optimistic simulations the other way they get seven situations are the experiments and here in this torque auto focus on the edge mystic simulations as a base for development of the new models we need a ticket level global goal is to combine the tools we have in my group and the knowledge we have within one framework was a well-defined interfaces let's talk about first application now I'm going to suggest you one way to optimize CNT heads towards high linearity for those of you who missed my talk yesterday I will previous summarize what I mean was your eyes linearity he I sketched the transfer characteristic and related transconductance of a single tube seen T fit and I sketched a transfer characters in such a way that we have a bias region where we have a linear relationship which in the output current and input voltage and once we see it transistor having this property a linear relationship we say that this device is linear sometimes very difficult to decide of Selena are not that's why we are used to have a look at the transconductance transconductance is derivative of the transfer characteristic and if we have a linear relationship here we have a flat punting accents yeah yesterday I spent quite some time to explain you in to motivate you why device linearity is essential and communication systems because it can provide much higher data rates at the lower power consumption compared to the technologies we have this is the motivation by working on this we are looking in the center directly at this application we want to build transistors and you are doing this for high frequency applications and we hope that we find a way to realize also the high linearity in these transistors several years ago there was one publication by Baumgarten 2007 talking about the inherent linearity of carbon nanotubes that's in this publication he collected his ideas or he discussed his ideas about inherent linearity and the conditions you need to get this linearity and zine cheifetz sincerely these conditions are really unrealistic to get in realistic devices and fabricated devices that's why we decided to work on this to find a way to get linearity in CNT pads on a realistic conditions and this is what I'm going to talk about today the linearity conditions you can find typically in the literature are unique ohmic contacts you need singles up and transport you need ballistic transport and you have to work in the quantum capacitance limit if you do so you can simply revive from the landowner equation that the transconductance looks like this you have a flat trans conductance and this is exactly what we want to have but in reality we are faced with some constraints we always have short colac contacts you always have Maltese up and transport you can ignore the setting of the seconds are penned we have non ballistic transport if you are talking about long channels and the corner capacity limit is hardly achievable and the typical transconductance looks like this here there is no flat region anymore due to optical phonons gathering the quran's conductance pre-exam so what can we do it's really possible to get linearity at transistor level for a realistic technology and dispose the question and to answer this question we employ the semi-classical trends of power why semi-classical because we want to show for our transistors which have length of 800 nanometers we have a channeling links of 800 nanometers that we can already provide linearity also for these transistors and if we want to optimize these transistors we have to use the semi-classical transport model what else we have to consider we have to consider device architecture teachers we will see that the electrostatics plays also a significant wall we are talking about the linearity but this is a typical local back gate structure you are looking at in in the technology and the distance between source and drain is about 800 nanometers but we also have to consider none effect we have to consider that a current is flowing through three different materials the current us rooms with a metal contact it's learn through the CNT in the channel but underneath the channel and underneath the contacts we have the metal coated huge portions and due to the interaction between the metal and is unity underneath this metal coda to portion have totally different properties compared to the properties the scene t-f here so the current is flowing from the metal into the metal coda to portion and then into the channel typically the first interface between the metal and the CNT is not considered in simulations because there's a bias independent interface you can include the series resistance to reduce in the face if it's really necessary later than in in the compact one in the numerical device simulation we try to restrict the simulation to domain to reduce the simulation time that's fine we are looking at a second interface between the metal coated and uncoated to portion this is the most important in the face because this is pious dependent and we will see we will see soon that here we have sounds like a Schottky barrier and this Schottky barrier is cute refinishing fields of the gate also bias dependent and you have to include it in this relations and how do we include Schottky bears and talents which are key barriers and the same classical transport model they're doing this by approximating the tunneling current was the wpp velvet it's very simple method to include it but it works for those of you who have not seen a boltzmann equation before this is a standard way to write down Boltzmann equation the important part is or the porn variables are the distribution functional from the distribution function is a solution variable you can get all the important quantities like electron density current density and so on this is the crew velocity we have this depends on a band structure for sure this is the electrical field we have and this is the collision operator which describes the scattering and all the scattering processes in this approach considered with a symbol mean free path model this is scattering read this is the mean free path of the different models we have so we included acoustic an optical phonon scattering emission absorption and also service point of fallen scattering this is the model you are using and the Boltzmann equation is solved with the help of a multi-column effort to use the amount of simulation time be in a first step we used a very simplified structure this is shown here we used a gate all around structure for simulating the device because for optimizing device you do not only have two single 81 sherman tree or ten or hundred we have to submit thousands different geometries to get the optimal value for the different parameters we have that's why we decide in the first step two is a very simplified structure the gate is about 5 400 nanometer long the spacers I recall this region here spaces the space in between the gate and the source and the gate and drain ah together also form an army alone we are simulating a 23-0 tube and the scattering parameters we are using the typical scaring paid scattering parameters you can find literature for CMT so I acoustic Poland scattering is about 1 micrometer long in free path optical phonons gathering 50 50 nanometer and interestingly the optical phone on energy is very high 160 million leaked one wall what else we have we adjusted the gate oxide thickness to 20 nanometer and we did it intentionally to work out of the chronic capacity limits and we will change the short very height as you will see soon in this slide what do you see here you see the transconductance over vs. gate voltage at one wall vs four different Schottky barrier heights so this is a negative Schottky barrier height this is a very high struck you Barry this is minus 0.2 this is plus 0.2 and we see one increasing the Schottky barrier height we come to a point where we have a nice flat trans conductance here it isn't exactly 40 point 11 electron Walt this is good this is what we want to have so we need to find a way to a chance to material parameters the contact parameters in the techno Archie which delivers us such a Schottky barrier height but if you are talking about high frequency applications you also have to talk about the high frequency linearity and in this you have for this you have to analyze also the gate capacitance so this is the capacitance due to the mobile charges and only if you have a flat gate capacitance you get also high frequency linearity and we see that if you increase the Schottky barrier height we get exactly for the same Schottky barrier height of 0 and 11 electron world at almost flat and gate capacitance the small riddles you see here are two two optical phonon scattering and in a multi tube transistor to the different realities you have you get rid of these rebels there so we have seen an improved linearity is possible for moderate Schottky barrier height without meeting the linearity at the conditions mentioned literature so we do not need Oh mcclare contacts we do not need ballistic transport you do not need singles up and transport and we do not have to work in a chronic capacity limit at least in theory it's working on a realistic conditions now it's the task for the technology guys to work in this to realize this but we have seen this is very simplified picture of the contact here we played only with the cut yeah yes yes it's the total capacitance yes due to the mobile charges because the number of mobile charges inject depends on the Schottky barrier you have the more carriers who have the highest capacitance no no it's strongly related also to scattering hmm yes yes because you plug 2 to the shopkeeper here you plug some of the carrier's which could be injected by they are not injected because they are blocked by the shopkeeper here for example Harry quasi-static approximation success curate along you wait long enough yes and you see in this very simple picture we only change the Schottky barrier height visit by this is oversimplified really have to understand the physics and for this here they have a look at a quantum based picture to understand the contact in a better way this application number two let's talk about the role of the contacts again the typical structure we want to simulate it something like this you have to solve it for some equation always save consistently with our transport models this is done all the neck window ballistic picture we have to consider the three different materials very current flows through so we have two metal we have two metal coda to portion any CNT itself and now in a corner ballistic picture you describe the current flow by the Schrodinger equation so this is the typical way to write on Schrodinger equation and the solution variable here are the wave function so we directly solve for the wave functions one of the most important parameters we have in the Schrodinger equation is the energy dependent effective mass it's the effective potential where the electrons are moving through and it's injection energy along the scenes you and based on the wave functions we calculate the charges and the current and the charges go into the three-dimensional Poisson equation because they've consistently consider their electrostatics if you are talking about differential equations we always have to call about the boundary conditions how we solve it and if you're interested in two solve the Schrodinger equation for the current we have to apply open boundary conditions okay one well when a known method to do this is the Cutie bear method the quantum transmitting bowel and methods and to understand the rest of our presentation I have to go into the details now of the QT am in the queue dbm method you assume that you have the channel in the channel you have a spatial dependent conduction right now and outside of the channel you have some contact regions and in the contact regions you have a flat potential this is one assumption of the Cutie bear method the good point is if you assume here flat potentials that the solution of the Schrodinger equation is snow and at least in these parts in these parts is illusion of the Schrodinger equation our plane waves and these plane waves are listed here and one of the most important parameters for plane waves is the wave vector if we want to calculate the charge as Anna current with this picture you have to inject at different energies plane waves but it's not a good idea to inject at each energy was the same K value it's unrealistic so we need somehow a relation between energy and gay while you so we need a dispersion relation and for some reason I call us QT p.m. dispersion relation villainous house is somehow artificial this dispersion relation the propagation of the plane waves you inject into your channel Arden solved by the solution of the Schrodinger equation itself but the most important part they have to understand the dis ponders that we need a huge event dispersion relation to relate the injection energy to the cable youth we use for describing a plane waves we are injecting to calculate the charge is Anna current i have given you here then the equations we are using the charges inside transit staff consists of electrons and holes and we divide them with charge no two or three level everything which is below to charge on truly level out of holes everything was just above the charge country level other electrons this picture is important if you are talking about been to been telling but important point knows if you have a look at the equations we see that the charge depends on the absolute square value of the wave functions but it depends also a density of states of the contact not of the CNT of the contact regions and on a ferry function the ideas in the ballistic picture that you have your distribution you inject your distribution from the context and in a ballistic way if you have to not have any scattering the distribution from the contact remains the absolute screamer value of the wave function describes and reflections by potential barriers or interferences any density of states it comes from the context the current is calculated in this approach based on the landowner formalism the important point is that we needed the transmission probability and if transmission probability and this wave function picture is calculated based on this equation you see again the absolute square value of the wave function evaluated at the end of the channel and some parameters the effective mass from the contacts and you related very factors from the context so from school and if you are insulated in the channel the charge should be 0 young yeah yes but I don't know if airily get a sponsor if you have an insulator the the waves will penetrate by the exponential decaying so close to the context you have some carriers to the exponential decaying of the wave function but in the middle of the channel you do not have any carriers then we you d it's a because you have to you have to consider the injection from the source and from the train but the important point is if you have a look if you want to calculate the charge and the current in the scene t we need two parameters from the contacts you need a density of states in the contacts the effective mass and the K values so to summarize again we need for this picture if you really want to solve effective mass equation reading a creation with a q-tip am method we need to describe the dispersion relation in the channel region it's on a problem you can use a fungus in TV needed effective mass and effective potential where the electrons are moving through but we need also for the contact regions the two degree and dispersion relation and related the answer of states and effective mass but in the contacts and due to the interaction between the metal and is unity itself these parameters can be totally different from these parameters you'll see this in the next pictures so we need somehow to extend the classical beauty p.m. method by more of a sophisticated model and we call this hetero Junction contact model to conclude that the different effects this is a zoom in into the sauce contact so we have it is a source contact this is the scene t portion underneath and this is a scene t in the channel due to the strong interaction between the metal here and the CNT their electronic properties of the scene t portion here can change totally you can get at all the different density of states he can get a total different band gap due to the interaction strengths between the metal and this any scene t here and if you now have a look at a simplified bender a cram directly at this interface we see that we have a connection of two different materials with two different band gaps we have a small band gap material this is the sea tee underneath the metal and a large band gap material and this looks like a heterojunction known for 35 materials or Ziggy hpts that's why we call this a prolonged eye contact model so all the electrons unchecked it from here to download it CT and the potential step we have here in between the small band gap and large band gap you eyes is a Schottky lack barrier I always refer to if you use another metal you can have a totally different than the actual strengths do we get in totally different band gap effective band gap and a totally different density of states and we have to adjust all the contact parameters from the Cutie bear method to this picture but so parts only in the idea of electrical engineers how to model this and now it's we are going to verify this with some atomistic simulations in our colleagues have done the following they have simulated a 9 nanometer long cello the CNT itself is a little bit longer because here we simulate the embedding of the CNT into palladium atoms well you have to source contact the Train contact and hit a channel by a bonito DFT calculations we calculated a equilibrium density of states and this is shown in a white hand side blue color means you have no States red color means we have a lot of states so if you have a look directly into the channel PC we have band gap what we expect to have for for intrinsic CNT yep you have no States but if you are coming closer to the contacts we see that band gap shrinks down tryna learn the splitter rear i divided the density of states here in 2-3 cross section the first cross section here is far and local contacts and we see that we almost have in each energy region a density of states so it's metallic like let me be compared if you compare to the density of states of an intrinsic CNT we see that the band gap is totally filled with sensi of states if you are coming closer to the interface we see that something happens here the band gap shrinks if you compared to the one we have in the channel so we have a small effective band gap compared to one of their intrinsic tube and we get some more states here in the intrinsic bank and in the channel itself we have no bank and no states with an event the upon point knows that this is the bottleneck all the electrons have to flow through this bottleneck here so we have to understand and describe the density of states and the physics here this point this is the interesting part and if you do atomistic saw relations only for a system consisting of the scene t surrounded by metal you get only like this this is not helpful who this reason we really have to solve a transistor like structure to get more information about directly about this interface yet and now let's talk about how we can adjust our queue dbm model to these simulation results what we see here is the density of states again from the bubble neck the complete curve is an intrinsically the entity of states of the CNT we are using and the right one is the analytic approximation we use please make sure that we have done the fit close to the family level because all the electrons are injected very close to the family that's why it's very important to get a good fit here what happens here above doesn't play any role for applications we have a mind here yeah that's it we we adjusted all the different parameters suit is the important point hours from DFT calculations you only get a density of states but for Q dbm we need a dispersion relation and issues challenges how we can get from density of states of band structure the other world around is unique if you have a band structure you can calculate a unique density of states to it but if you have a density of states you have so many different ways to calculate a band structure which delivers the same battery of states that's a problem you have since I only with the DFT calculations we are using here because we have a hater attraction different materials we are unable to calculate band structure so we have to do something with the density of states and we make the assumption that we have only that we are injecting from a single band and it's working to get a good qpm dispersion relation which we can work now and here we see here you see some external data again from Franklin for a nine nanami long trend system we adjusted the parameters of our similar than saturate they be good that you get a good agreement to the experimental results if you have a medium interaction strengths between the contact metal and CNT if we change the material if you change the contact if you change in the action strength to a weak interaction strength or strong interaction strength you see that we get totally different behavior especially if we have a look at transconductance because this is what we want to optimize his transistors not showing a linear characteristic almost linear and you see depending on the interaction strength depending on the metal you use to get totally different shape of a transconductance what we are doing right now these are the first results i'm going to show you here but we are doing right now is here investigating much more materials much more medals for analyzing this and we are also going to study the impact of the embed innings so far we assume that embed innings of where we are alone in this malaysian infinitus you lo infinito but it takes some quiet in some time all these simulations to get the data yeah yes and yeah it's a little bit more complicated because we need an energy-dependent effective mass to have a good fit for for the density of states here with a person record formula I can show you later this formula little bit complicated the smaller and it's only empirical bayes it's no physics inside it's only to get a good agreement with a different density of states we have well that's the only way we see at the moment to get a good agreement for set realistic simulation results but we are working on this yeah and it's all an investigation none of these are no final besides I'm showing you this is the way we are going in yes what we are what we are doing is we have a look at the density of states in this case we try to get some inspiration about the Schottky barrier height about the parameters we need to model our head or Junction contacts yes this is an honest that we have to go them hmm we use a simplified version of the heterojunction contact model also for the injection of the electrons on our balls once over the way we inject the carrier's depends somehow on this model here it's a Schottky barrier height and it's also the potential step height we include all the new boltzmann simulation it's only the from where we inject the carrier's if you are considering we are not talking about ohmic like contacts in the solution of the reports on equation we are talking about shutting our contacts and this gives us a possibility to play with these parameters also in the same in classical picture to you density of success you the dispersion does it look good yeah I can show you later I have never seen this slide here because too much material but I have it in another presentation it's not so far away from the density of the air from the dispersion relation of CNT hmm but as I as I told you before it's not a unique solution it's not a good way to do this buts the only way we see it at the moment and I maybe you have some more inspiration on how we can solve this problem to come from density of states to could you PM boundary conditions because they approach itself using the Schrodinger equation and to solve for the wave functions it's in it's interesting to follow to do one more reason i want to show you now it's it's difficult yeah we have implemented method where we can say we want to have three bands one band two bands and I Grodin later it gives us a different European dispersion relation so we are able to inject from different sup ends also but it's so difficult to decide if it's correct or not that's why we decided for the moment to use a single serpent approximation but by the hope was that I can get some inspiration from you also because at least the person sitting here working with Nemo and a lot of experience was modeling dancing the good point is why I want to work with the effective mass schrodinger equation and the q-tip and boundary conditions us that we can easily solve the time dependent Schrodinger equation because if you are talking about high frequency characteristics we also have to analyze by simulation high frequency capability and now we can say to me and let's have a look at a crisis that approximation let's take all the value of the data from the quasi-static approximation it's working quite nicely for very low frequencies but if you're interested in very high frequencies you get non cross aesthetic effects which can be only reflected and calculated by a time-dependent approach and especially if you are talking about compact modeling is also one another job what we have to do is here interested in the charge petitioning the charge you have in a channel who acts differently and have flows into the tunnels differently depending on the excitation you have and you have to understand this very well if you want to build high frequency components so let's talk about in the last two minutes about the time-dependent transport phenomena you want to analyze so this is only a small motivation why we want to use it to most important point is that all the high frequency characteristics are characterized by the admittance matrix or as my friend so we need a wire your s matrix calculated based on the data we get from our approach so as I told you before you can extract the wire matrix admittance matrix from quasi-static calculations or from time dependence relations but you can only use time-dependent simulations to get a correct positioning of the charge and to have a to study non-causal side effects so we solve the time-dependent effective mass Schrodinger equation we save consistently solve it was a sweet dimensional Poisson equation to consider the and the architecture of the CNT fed and all the initial values are calculated based on a time-independent schrodinger equation if you want to do this you are faced with many challenges first of all you need a stable time-dependent numerical solution in this case we use crank nicolson fine and different scheme to do this it works quite nicely for our problem then have them have in mind that we are solving the propagation of waves and if waves are coming to the simulation domain boundary you can get artificial affections of the wave back into the channel and this is what you do not want to have so you have to make sure that the waves are not artificially reflected at Stone Age domain boundaries and we use a method which works quite nicely based on a discrete bounding bounding discreet transparent boundary conditions proposed by Arnold the third channel is that we have to include a contact physics we need special dependent effective masses and so on and the next challenge and this very interesting if you're interested in the Y parameters and edmonton's matrix you do not only have to excite the transistor at the gate the time-dependent signals indicate you also have to apply time-dependent signals at train and so far I haven't seen any paper who used the nhf everton preserving the Schrodinger equation ready applied a time-dependent signal at a train but is this mentor if you really want to understand the high-frequency behavior what we have done is we applied a voltage step at the gate and the train and used for a decomposition to extract the parameters we are interested in over frequency and because I'm electrical engineer I really like to map all the different Y parameters to an equivalent circuit because from an equivalent circuit I can much more easier identify interpret the results and this is what I'm going to show you now at moment this is the transconductance calculated from time dependent Schrodinger solution this is the frequency the frequency is quite high because it was a very short not a to be simulated TN and you see three different curves the Queen curve is the quasi-static approximation the circles are the symbols are the solutions from the numerical device simulation from the time dependent Schrodinger equation and the wrongs line is our coolant circuit and you see it if you are coming close to peak ft it's around here pft you get non cause aesthetic efforts you see an increase of the transconductance we are going to higher frequencies and this behavior is well known for MOSFETs it's nothing special for C&T fence but have in mind MOSFETs are semi classical devices you have a lot of scattering inside here we are so loving we are solving the Schrodinger equation so we are talking about quantum ballistic ethics and they are showing exactly the same behavior it's interesting at least from my point of view now we have included transparent boundary conditions or all the waves are not artificially reflect so they are going out hey yeah for sure we get some reflections yeah but there are not artificial reflections there it's 2 to the max we have if you do not really care about the the interfaces at a simulation domain you get reflections without any reasons only two to numerix hey you have to do it right but there are many many different ways to do it wrong and I propose you a way to do it wide in a good way maybe you can discuss this offline I have to show you something just for this to explain you what I mean we don't know at the moment because we use them on the column method to solve the Boltzmann equation and to extract yeah but we do not have to chill the for doing this that's a problem you do not have all the tools we need to answer all the interesting questions that's why we are searching for collaboration partners who have the tools and who can answer these questions and this is the last example i want to show you this is the output conductance it's also frequency-dependent pcs amo and inductive behavior and if you and this because the output conductance is going up and down again hmmm and this inductive behavior was attributed to a so called kinetic inductance from Peter Berg and you can include this behavior simply an equivalent circuit by adding an inductor in the equivalent circuit the main point is that this is also not unique to see in T that you can also see it from many different other devices at lower frequencies for sure but it's not unique because it simply describes the inertia of the carriers to the electric field we have so what we want to do is we want to ensure you want to study the impact of scattering on all the different phenomena but so far we are not able to do this children missing tools you have let me summarize it quickly so we have seen again CNTs have very good intrinsic unique properties we want to make use of them for high frequency low distortion applications we have seen that the contact physics is really difficult and especially if you want to preach between different abstraction levels if you come from atomistic simulations and you want to use ticket simulations you have to do something and everybody is invited to join our activities to establish a multi-scale simulation framework for sentience of a Wandy electronics and you want to go the conventional way from atomistic simulations to tcat models because we expect that for most applications you need very fast models you do not want to wait one day to get one bias point you want to get it bias point within minute within one second because if you have the task to optimize devices we have to perform sales and send sources of difference of relations and this must be very fast once again I didn't get yes yes why is simply because if you're interested in for example the output conductance the frequency depends of the output conductance you have to apply a time-dependent signal on the train device is affected by the dream hm van structure doesn't change then so if you don't have reflections now in line because of 10 and so if you can only change or catalysis then it will be you change occupants is because of something that made it through the channel for those electrons are usually going in parallel way compromise they are returning and accept your coffee have some users scheduling or something and which takes a portion of those electrons amazed with advice for example if you have a very low train voltage you have a second pair we are all set a train site if you know apply a sinusoidal signal its train you move up and move down Schottky barrier and so do the electrons within the channel can leave or cannot leave through the train and you can make this very fast they unable to leave because they always see the barrier and especially if you are interested in the divine matrix and edmonton's matrix which is very typical tool to describe the high-frequency behavior of transistors to pole matrix you need to excited train and Kate why it's very interesting question I I had a very long discussion of a web viewer of the paper very of our manuscript we publish this two years ago and we had a half year long discussion with the reviewer because the river was coming from the semi-classical simulation and we had our ballistic simulations and we see the same phenomena and he asked us why and I asked him why do his year than the same classic resignation he has no answer we have Lanza it's it's subject of research gettin to sleep um hmm but it's very interesting and we are working on this and it's really difficult to explain it in in one second why we see this especially because we see this not this GM also for MOSFETs for semi-classical transport destructive are you change the sea Imogen what is the time is scale in your simulation for supervision once again time scale in which type of CD mission CD measurement no I did and now I know what you mean you mean the the gate capacitance this is taken from the time-independent schrodinger equation or Boltzmann equation it's some independent so we are working the quasi-static regime and steady state of course you use it no the current different yeah the definitive SSS but it will wait around enough huh will they cut a small college charge of the China I cannot sketch it here especially for seeing tibbetts if you have a Schottky barrier you plug the injection of the electrons at lower levels of the Schottky barrier so behind the short we are in the channel there's nothing at the moment now we inject carriers huh they will go into the channel he will be scattered but the optical phone and energy is 160 mlh1 world so they champ by 160 ml x 1 mode and if you have the conduction band very low heat jump again by 160 million volt so we get zapped channels in your conduction heads so will not never get the equilibrium distribution within the channel even if you wait as long as you want so if you like energy was much lower this dependency will go away yes so you do not see these subchannels anymore but especially for scientists to the very high optical phone and energy you have these subchannels and a totally different behavior of the gate capacitance but you need both the Schottky barrier which blocks the carriers at lower energies so you have free space here and then you have there are high optical phone on energy which leads to the subtitles ok this question relates maybe toward a talk I gave yesterday huh so it's da methods known to fabricate seeing t-birds in such a way that you have control on the CRO of the cnts so it can show them that you want to have them if you use a cvd price process by you yeah they exist in different technologies and so far if you do not know which technology is the best one so we are following two different reporters we have to cvd based process they be directly Cronus ents where we want to have them and you use the PPS process direct freezers very and deposit pre-sorted cnts in a channel of everyone to have them that different methods are vehicle yes yes yeah it's a really good question so far there's no physics based model for the charges available if you have rocky areas there's no model available in the literature and also we cannot provide a model so far we are working on this but at the moment we do not have a compaq well what we have is we have impure basic equations with which we can people use all the different characteristics but the combination charge on the channel and shopkeeper area it's so difficult to solve in a compact model it's hard to do this well here's one typical approach you can find little choice a so-called so Debye approximation and this is a mixture of both they assume ballistic transport but at the same way also semi-classical transport and it try to motivate its arm but it's not working if you compared with numerical device simulations you see that this approach Soderberg approach so go back approximation fails to predict the correct charges and capacitances 25 yes hmm this 125 figure live set on the right there is the appendage osculating as an armed resource complex hmm this is not a real band edge you are not able to calculate based on a method PR using the band structure and you're not able to calculate band edges what you see is an effective penned calculated based on a density of states so what we have done is we integrate along this axis and lambda energy axis and when there's no more contribution to the integral you say here's effective pant yep it's only in its it's due to the structure of the density of states you see here so you see some oscillations and the density of states also and this leads to the oscillation then in depends but these are only effective friends no no don't don't take these effective pens too serious at the moment well it's only way to visualize it and to compared with the qtp and boundary conditions where we have these bands I have to have look I can say truly later in our meeting us could PCB 2k all right I have to look at this constant gene that you are looking for a yes or a no look this is very important for analog circuits because it will not disturb the signal this
