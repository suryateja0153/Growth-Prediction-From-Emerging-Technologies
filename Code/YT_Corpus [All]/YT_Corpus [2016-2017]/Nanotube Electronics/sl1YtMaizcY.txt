 Nanotechnology has had a huge impact on electronics and information technology when I was in high school a computer or computer lab took up a whole room and basically it was one big computer that had very limited capabilities. It was only able to do what may be a cheap calculator can do nowadays. Since that time devices keep getting smaller and smaller and more and more powerful and now we've reached the point where the electronics inside your laptop or in your iphone have components that are on the nanometer scale, 10 nm gate length and what this means is that were able to do more and more things with smaller and smaller devices so we have things like the electronic watches something just out of science fiction just a few years ago and also the ipads ipods all relying on flash memory which is extremely light very small and very capable. Also nanotechnologies open the pathway for new types of electronic devices. One example is the magnetic tunnel junctions where you can get non-volatile memory by having spin-states transport between nanometer-scale tunneling and magnetic contacts
