 nan-oh online simulation and more for nanotechnology okay so hello everyone I'm mark lundström and I'm going to be talking today about how we understand the physics of these very small transistors were making these days and before I begin I'd like to thank Rodolfo for inviting me to give this presentation to the I Triple E mini colloquium in Mexico City and for permitting me to do it this way since I'll be home giving a final exam while you're having this colloquium now let me also point out that I'm doing this in front of a live class so this is a good opportunity for me to wrap up the course in semiconductor physics that I've been teaching this semester and what I hope you'll get out of this lecture is an understanding that these very small transistors that we're building these days are very relatively easy to understand they're not so complicated so if you're an engineer working on it I hope you find it useful if you're someone who teaches this material I hope you decide that this is the way it should be taught it's not yet in the textbooks okay so let's dive into it so who is this fellow lillienfield some of my students think I'm old enough that I knew him actually I don't but he patented you know this idea of a field effect transistor is it's a reasonable thing to do back in the early 20s when people were just developing vacuum tube technology people came up with this idea that this would be a good way to make a transistor you know two contacts in a gate field this is actually a mesfet it's not a MOSFET but he patented a MOSFET a little bit later now I'm told when I read you know go on Wikipedia and read the history of the transistors that they were never able to build any of these and that's why vacuum tubes became the main electronic device for a long time actually I'm not so sure that's true so let me tell you a little story I was basically saying this many years ago when I was teaching EE 305 or beginning semiconductor of course here at Purdue and I said well you know it's a nice idea too bad they couldn't build it and then after class a student came up to me and he said what do you mean they couldn't build them said I said well that's my understanding he said well you know I live in California I forget where he said my neighbor is a fellow named Heil he's old German fellow and he tells me they work just fine but apparently they didn't work fine enough to beat out vacuum tubes and this was really this was the transistor that Bell Labs tried to make after World War two because of all the problems with vacuum tubes consuming too much power and burning out all that time they didn't make it actually they tried to patent the concept and somebody pointed out it's been patented long ago they stumbled across this bipolar transistor just by accident and that became the first practical device but a few years later Bell Labs did succeed they learned that if you oxidize silicon and passivate the dangling bonds you can actually make one of these devices and this fellow atella and don khong made the first one in 1959 and and they've just gotten better and better and better ever since and it's really created the modern world that we know did they were making 22 nanometer transistors this is the cross-section of a FinFET you know the latest device in Carnation not a planar device but where the channel is actually a thin thin the silicon and the gauge wraps around the thin to try to control the two-dimensional electrostatics a little bit better so we've gone a long ways and the point of all of this is to try to understand how these devices work just to calibrate you you know in some history so that students understand how rapidly things change before you know you'll be my age and you look back and how crude things were when you were in school my first job was to do n channel MOS process development for hewlett-packard I started in 1974 we made a 5 micron process 5 microns is 5000 nanometers this was really state-of-the-art at the time it was really difficult to do all of the things that are in textbooks now we were discovering for the first time and we ended up doing it this is a plot of Moore's law which is a number of transistors per chip as a function of time here's my first job and if you plot this on a log plot that's been doubling every technology generation for 40 or 50 years and it will go for a few more and each technology generation doubles the number of transistors on a chip which is a measure of the power of the electronic system so every time it doubles you know you double everything you've done for the previous 50 years so the implications are a really enormous and we don't know how far we can go we'll probably get to 10 nanometers for sure the question is how far below 10 nanometers the challenge is can we get to 5 and how will those devices work so we want to talk about how MOSFETs operate here's a simple circuit schematic for an n-channel enhancement mode MOSFET some of these devices have a fourth terminal that's the body contact some of them don't like a FinFET and the basic idea is we apply a voltage between the drain and the source and we apply a voltage between the gate and the source the gate to source voltage controls the current that flows between the drain and the source and we control the current and we have a transistor the IV characteristics look something like this if you have a device that looks like that you can make useful electronic devices it has two regions of interest that we can focus on one is a region of small drain voltage where the current is proportional to voltage looks like a resistor but the value of the resistance is gate voltage dependent the other region the current tries to saturate that doesn't quite saturate the current here is more like a gate voltage dependent current source it's more or less independent of the voltage across the two terminals but it's magnitude is determined by how much will put on the gate so that's how a transistor operates and the way we teach it in beginning semiconductor is very much the way people first did this in the 1960s and 70s and figured it all out and it's still the way we think about transistors I'm gonna argue that it's not quite right anymore they got a lot of things right but they didn't get they couldn't possibly foresee how far this would go so let's look down in that low voltage regime you know how do we think about the MOSFET IB characteristics all right it's very easy we apply a gate voltage that's bigger than the threshold voltage that induces a channel of n-type electrons we get some negative charge in the channel charge is just capacitance times voltage but we have to have at least the threshold voltage to get any significant charge so we have that simple relation for the charge in the channel so if I want to know what the current is well it's proportional to the width of the MOSFET coming out of the page and then its charge times velocity more charge more current that's other charge moves more current okay we know what the charge is we just have to figure out what the velocity is in this region we apply a small voltage across the channel highly conductive channel the voltage just drops linearly it's just like a resistor the electric the velocity is mobility times electric field the electric field is just pointing from the drain to the source so it's negative and it's just the voltage across the two terminals divided by the length of the channel plug that all in and we get this classic textbook expression for the IV characteristic of a MOSFET in the linear regime I'm easy to do okay now if we apply a large voltage we have to be a little more careful because what we're what we've been doing at low voltage is we say the velocity is proportional to the electric field that works as long as the electric field is not too big so one of the things we learned at the beginning of a course like this in semiconductor physics is that if you apply a very large electric field the carriers get a lot of energy they scatter a lot and you just can't push them to go any faster so the velocity saturates in silicon 10 to the 7th centimeters per second you know now the question is you know this occurs when the vote when the electric field is about 10 kilovolts per centimeter how high are the electric fields in these nano scale MOSFETs well we have a drain voltage of about a volt we have a channel length of roughly 20 nanometers that's an electric field of 500,000 volts per centimeter all right five hundred kilovolts per centimeter so we're way out here right the velocity should be totally saturated okay so if we assume that it is we can devise and I a expression for the current in the high drain voltage regime so we'll assume the electric field is very big everywhere in the channel the current is still proportional to charge times velocity the charge at the beginning of the channel is - SI ox VG minus VT the velocity is saturated everywhere because the electric field is big everywhere so it's even easier than the first case you know nice simple expression for the current in the saturated regime it just goes is proportional to the saturated velocity and proportional to B G minus VT and if you see a transistor like this and if you see the current increasing as VG minus VT to the first power just linearly with the gate overdrive the amount of voltage above the threshold you say ah-ha this is a velocity saturated MOSFET right so I know what I'm dealing with okay all right so these are the textbook expressions right everything is nice okay all right but let's look at the physics inside one of the things that we spent a lot of time doing over the past 20 years or more as the transistors get smaller and smaller we have to go back and rethink the assumptions that we began with and one of the assumptions is is velocity mobility times electric field well in these very small devices we can do computer simulations so these are computer simulations done at IBM in 1992 and in 1992 this is a 30 nanometer channel-length MOSFET that was me nobody ever thought we would make 30 nanometer 30 nanometer channel-length MOSFETs they thought you know this is just some kind of academic exercise now we have them smaller in manufacturing and every dot there is an electron that's being tracked through the device by the computer as its accelerated by the electric field as it scatters by emitting a lattice vibration or bounces off of an ionized impurity goes off in some random direction it's accelerated by the electric field again and either comes back out the source where it came in or goes out the drain and contributes to the drain current so you run hundreds of thousands of those and average the results and if I average the results I can look at anywhere in the channel and I can say what's the average velocity of all of those electrons okay and this is what the average velocity versus position looks like you know it slow down here in the source it slow in the drain and it pops up and is really high in the channel okay if you look at these numbers you can see remember and one of the things we teach students in these kinds of courses if the slope of the energy band diagram is proportional to the electric field the electric field is highest near the drain here if the velocity is going to saturate anywhere it's going to saturate near the drain but look at what's happening here the saturated velocity 10 to the seventh centimeters per second the electrons are going faster than that over the entire channel right they don't know anything about velocity overshoot or velocity saturation the velocity is overshooting we say the reason it's happening is because you know large bulk piece of silicon you can wait a long time and get a lot of scattering and the velocity finally comes down and saturates in a very short you know an electron comes in from the source and zips across and before it's had a chance to scatter more than once or twice it's out the drain we say the transport is quasi ballistic look at this is energy versus position most of them are just streaming across at high energy you know near equilibrium most of the electrons are down at the bottom of the conduction band you know they're way up there they don't have a chance to scatter enough to come down so this velocity overshoot is something that people spend a lot of time trying to understand it's been experimentally verified and a number of different experiments we know that it occurs and one of the mystery is mysteries is if the velocity cetera does not saturate why do the IV characteristics of the moths that look like the velocity saturation MOSFETs some the physics seems to be all wrong you know how come it works okay so we can devise this simple two-piece approximation when you're developing the IV characteristics of the MOSFET the complicated thing is to get a full curve that goes from small drain voltage to large drain voltage but as we've seen it's easy to do the small drain voltage and it's easy to do the high drain voltage if we could just connect the two smoothly we'd have our IV characteristic so we could do that with a two-piece approximation we could say the first expression and the second thick special intercept that some voltage will call that VD set if the drain voltage is less than VD set we use the first expression if it's bigger than VD set we use the second expression if we're a little more careful we can smooth that out so that it behaves reasonably and not abruptly and we'll smooth it out so that vdsat is the range over where it makes this transition from linear to saturation okay so how do we do that all right not so hard this is the expression that we developed in the linear regime just rewrite it a little bit capacitance times voltage is charged if I move the mobility the drain voltage and the channel length around I can put those together as mobility times electric field that's just a velocity so another way to write this is the linear current is charge of linear current per width is minus the charge times the average velocity the average velocity is just mu times the electric field okay okay so at high BTS we could do the same thing it's even easier si ox VG minus VT is charge and V set is the velocity so again the current per unit width is just minus charge times the average velocity the average velocity is just the saturated velocity okay so the current is always charged times average velocity we just have to make the average velocity to go smoothly from what it is under low VDS to under high BTS and we've got a nice curve so how do we do that no turns out it's pretty easy to do so you would guess whichever one of those two velocities is the slower that's going to be the important one that's going to limit the current so we just compare the two velocities if the linear velocity is slower it means we have a small electric field and not going very fast that's the one we'll use if the linear velocity is higher than the saturation velocity we say that doesn't make any sense we'll use the saturation velocity so if you take one over the average velocity and have it one over the low VDS velocity plus one over the high BTS velocity whichever one is smaller will matter right the other one will be insignificant but it will go smoothly so you get an expression that looks like this and it will smoothly go from one to the other and you could lump some terms together and you'll get the VD set that we had before okay all right so we can write the average velocity is saturation function times V set and that saturation function now will make it just a little more complicated because if we give ourselves just a little more flexibility we can fit any transistor and so this makes it a little bit empirical so we'll just take that and we'll we'll raise VV / BD set to some power beta and we'll raise the whole thing to a power 1 over beta people find that's that's empirical it's reasonable but it's empirical you do that in almost any transistor you can fit beautifully by adjusting beta just a little bit ok so here's what we have you know we could look very quickly just take that expression look at what happens for small VD f BD set small VD much less than the saturation voltage it just gives us this expression and if I put that expression multiply it by V set put in the values I had for V set you know we'll just end up with the average velocities mu times the electric field just what it's supposed to be when V is small you go through the same thing when V is high and you'll find that that saturation function goes to 1 the average velocity goes to be fat so it just it works right it's easy to work ok so here's a model and this is now a model that has been developed recently by some of my colleagues at MIT so it'd call it the virtual source model I'll explain why it's called virtual source later but we just write the current this charge times velocity the charge we can get from C ox VG minus VT or we could be more careful we know below threshold there's a little bit of charge that's leakage means we have to be a little more careful use the exact solution or something but we can do that the average velocity is just this empirical saturation function times V set we just have to tweak the parameter beta a little bit then vdsat we know so that's a model that works really really well still and so I've just gone through the five parts of that MA there are only a few parameters in this model and they all have a clear physical meaning except this little empirical parameter there it's not quite clear what that is so it's a semi empirical model that empirical parameter it doesn't vary very much it's between 1.4 and 1.8 and you can fit any decent transistor okay so now what we're going to find is that we can fit any transistor if we do two things when you get to very very short channel links if you understand a little bit about transport you say mobility doesn't really mean anything that you know when you're a quasi ballistic it loses its physical meaning that's okay we're going to use the mobility but we're going to just replace it by some parameter that we're going to tweak now it's empirical again we're going to call it an apparent mobility because that's not clear what mobility means in 20 nanometer channels and this saturation velocity they said we know that it's it's not ten to the seventh it's not the high field saturation velocity in the bulk so we're just going to give it another name we'll call it the injection velocity and these will be two empirical parameters that will adjust so it's not bad you know we have this empirical parameter here which just gives us a smooth transition from one to another we take the textbook expressions that were developed in the 1960s and 1970s and we just say well we're just going to adjust the mobility and the saturation velocity a little bit it turns out you don't have to adjust them very much and if you do that boy you just get beautiful fits to nanoscale transistors you know the most recent ones that I could find were 32 nanometer technology but you know my guess is it's going to work fine 214 nanometers it might even work to ten nanometers or so okay so something is going on here this very simple model based on concepts that we don't believe should be valid anymore still seems to describe transistors we just tweak the parameters a little bit so the question is what's going on and are there any physical is there a physical interpretation to these parameters or are they just empirical fits and what I'm going to try to convince you is that there's they're not just empirical fits they have a clear physical reason and there's a very good reason you know these people that develop these models in the nineteen sixties and seventies they were really really good I mean they they didn't have computer simulations to guide them they really figured out how these devices work and they did it in a way that we can still use the basic theory with just a few tweaks okay so these are the questions that I'm going to deal with in the rest of the talk you know why do these models that shouldn't work still work beautifully the IV characteristics of a small transistor says that the velocity saturates but that doesn't seem to make physical sense they just can't scatter enough what are the meanings of these things apparent mobility and injection and velocity that we have to empirically tweak a little bit to get these beautiful bits and I'll say almost nothing about things might change below 10 nanometers I don't know we thought things would change below 100 nanometers it turns out they didn't change very much but things might change below 10 nanometers I'll say just a little bit about that okay so I'll go more quickly that's a long introduction but these are the things that I want to go through you with first of all is a very simple physical picture of how a transistor works and if you understand this the rest of it is not so bad so here's an energy band diagram or here's a cross-section of a MOSFET from a few years ago and we've been discussing in my class here that the first thing you want to do to understand the device is to draw its energy band diagram so we're going to draw an energy band diagram from the source across the channel and out to dream and see what it looks like so if we do that it's easy to do the source is n-type actually it's heavily doped so the Fermi level it's degenerate the Fermi level is way above the bottom the conduction band same for the drain the channel is p-type I'm not showing the valence band down here but the Fermi level is much closer to the valence band than it is to the collection to the conduction band so that's what the energy band diagram looks like in equilibrium I'm assuming I have a low gate voltage and I'm assuming there's no voltage applied between the drain and the source so I'm in equilibrium there's just one Fermi level and an electron can't flow because there's this big energy barrier that stops it from flowing from the source to the drain right it's suck current current is zero but we remember that if we start applying some biases that potential energy is minus Q times electrostatic potential so if I apply a positive potential I can lower energies that's how we make a transistor so let's keep the gate voltage low but let's raise the drain voltage high if I raise the drain voltage high I'm going to pull the conduction band down I'm also going to pull now I've got quasi fermi-levels because I'm out of equilibrium I'm gonna pull the Fermi level in the drain or actually the quasi fermi-level in the drain down also I'm gonna lower the energy of both so if we do that we just pull everything in the drain down but if I have designed the MOSFET properly if I paid a lot of attention to to the electrostatics and short channel effects and this is difficult to do then the barrier that stops the current from flowing has not changed it's still the potential on the gate that controls that barrier height even though we put a maybe a volt here on the drain that lower potential there wants to pull this barrier down but if I design things right the gate is going to hold it up right that's why people are going to FinFETs now surround the channel with a gate make have the gate control that potential energy barrier that's a big challenge for transistor designers so this device is off now I have a large voltage between the drain and the source but the electrons and the source can't go anywhere so if I want to turn it on I just apply a high Gate voltage in addition to the high drain voltage now that's going to pull the potential in the channel down it'll lower that barrier of a little barrier electrons and the source can hop over it flow out the drain and current flows so the device is on No so that's that's really how transistors operate sometimes when you do the math for these IV characteristics you know you this charge C ox VG minus VT you don't appreciate what's actually going on where's that charge coming from its electrons hopping over the barrier getting in the channel that's where that charge is coming from so we you know if we look at the IV characteristics down here for low drain to source voltage you know they look like this here's the conduction band and the source the conduction band and the drain is just a little bit lower we take the gate voltage and we make it higher and we pushed the potential in the channel down once I've turned it on we have more or less a constant slope constant slope means constant electric field it's just VDS divided by L if I look up here at high voltage at high drain voltage we pulled the potential energy down we still have a barrier you know these are actual simulations of all the 2d electrostatics and everything this is how it really works and you know push the barrier down now current can flow and you can see that it doesn't really matter if electrons hop over this barrier it doesn't really matter what the drain voltage is anymore they're just gonna flow downhill and out the drain you make the drain voltage higher they flow down a bigger hill and out the drain but it doesn't really change the current that's why the current saturates alright you don't have to worry about pinch off and all this stuff that's really hard to understand and probably is not right anyway you know it's really simple when you look at energy band diagrams so to understand transistors there are two things that we need to understand one is the electrostatics of how you manipulate these potential energy barriers that's what gives the transistor its IV characteristic that's what gives it that shape that circle designers can use and do good things with that's what the people in the 60s got right and our understanding of that has just been refined more and more and more and we understand that really well okay the second thing is transport once the electrons hop over the barrier and flow how fast do they flow okay that's where things can get complicated do they flow by drift diffusion do they flow by velocity overshoot do they flow quantum mechanically we're worrying about these things more and more here's a simulation of electrons flowing in a device under on state conditions red means there's a high electron density you're seeing electrons come in you're seeing some of them tunnel underneath the barrier now that's bad we're supposed to be turning devices on and off with the barrier if they can tunnel right through the barrier it's gonna make it hard you can see some of them reflecting and we're setting up interference patterns this is going to be the big challenge below 10 nanometers can you still make useful transistors when quantum mechanics says everything wants to tunnel right from the source to the drain but for 10 nanometers or above we can think about this classically and it's pretty easy to understand okay so now the heart of the talk here I'm going to talk about how we would think about transistors so if you today if somebody had discovered a 20 nanometer transistor and invented it for the first time and we didn't have this 50 years of history and how we originally did it when transistors were big you know we would develop an IV theory along completely different lines now it would never occur to anyone to use a drift diffusion equation for something so small so how would you think about this MOSFET if it was just a nano device that somebody out at the Brooke Center had invented last week and you had to analyze it you do it in a much different way so I want to talk about how you would think about nano devices and then we'll map that onto a MOSFET so this is what we think about it um there is an approach to transport if you've taken professor Dada's course here you've heard about it if you haven't you you should take his course it's called the land our approach it's a different way to think about how electrons move in small devices so the picture is that we have a heavily doped source it's near equilibrium lots of scattering we can hardly ever perturb it from equilibrium so the electrons in that source are described by a Fermi function with a Fermi level or quasi Fermi level that's well-defined we have another contact in the drain it's in equilibrium too it's heavily doped but it might have a different Fermi level or in we'd say different quasi Fermi level and then we have our little device inside this is our nano MOSFET and we're going to characterize that device not with a mobility because mobility really doesn't make sense at this length scale we're going to characterize it by two parameters one is the number of channels for current to flow and another is the transmission and there's a very simple expression that I'm not going to derive but if you but you know if you're going to work in this field you'll want to understand this equation I and it says that the current is proportional to some fundamental constants times T T is just a number between zero and one it's the probability that if an electron comes in from the source it'll transmit across and go out to dream it's not a wave we're thinking about particles so it has no phase it's just a number between 0 and 1 if it's 0.5 it means half of the electrons that come in back scatter and go back to the source they don't get get through M is the number of channels you know something like a density of states but not quite like it's the number of channels that can carry current flow and you think about it as i-65 two-lane highway to Chicago there are two channels thinking carry cars to Chicago there are two channels that can carry him back same thing here if you have a band structure you can figure out how many channels there are four electrons to flow in and then it depends there has to be a bias applied per current to flow there has to be a difference in the Fermi functions between these two contacts otherwise they are just as likely to come from the source and go out the drain as they are from to come from the drain and go out to source they be completely symmetrical so it depends on the difference between the Fermi functions in those two contacts okay so we haven't derived it but it should look plausible okay so I think about this as the drift diffusion equation for the 21st century this is the equation we should start with when we talk about semiconductor physics because you can derive the drift diffusion equation from this okay but if you try to analyze an N on MOSFET with a drift diffusion equation you just confuse yourself you know because you don't know how to map those concepts onto this nano device this was made for those nano devices too everything is clear when you start with this so we have this expression F 1 and F 2 are near equilibrium theory functions it's just that we might have one Fermi level in the source we might have another Fermi level in the drain it'll be different from the Fermi level in the source if we apply a voltage and lower it right that's all you can and as I said you can apply this to a big semiconductor and you get something that looks familiar to us just to drift diffusion equation but don't go backwards don't try to take this and apply it to a nano device right that's hopeless you'll probably get it wrong right okay so if you want to know more about this you know you should read professor Dada's book or take one of those take its course or you can read my book which this is just a little more applied and tries it professor got it talks about this from a very fundamental perspective in my book I try to apply it more to problems that we might face as engineers but as I said if you're gonna work in this field you should make it your business to learn something about this and it's also really really interesting okay so let's try to have a look at our nano device under small drain bias what if we apply a small drain so I'm going to do the same thing I did with the 1960s textbook version first look at small voltage then look at large voltage okay small voltage we start with this land our expression we're going to apply a small voltage so the Fermi level in this drain is just a little different from the Fermi level in the source alright now I have to do a little bit of math but it looked plausible f1 minus f2 I could write that as Fermi function in the source minus Fermi function in the drain divided by Q times the voltage and multiplied by 2 Q times the voltage alright I haven't done anything voltage lowers Fermi level so when I take apply a positive voltage to the drain I lower the Fermi level in a drain that goes negative so this I can recognize as the derivative of the Fermi function with respect to the Fermi energy alright so just a little bit of f1 minus f2 is related to a derivative of a Fermi function okay then just a little more algebra you can see that the only difference in this formula between the Fermi level and the Fermi and the energy is a minus sign so I could replace the F naught the EF with minus DF not the e okay now I have a classic expression if we we plug that into the current expression we're going to find that F 1 minus F 2 is a derivative of a Fermi function times the applied voltage this should be the drain voltage here okay so if I take divide the current by voltage I get conductance and I get an expression you read physics books cells take physics books and things you'll find in expressions like this for the conductance of a small for the conductance of any frequently it won't be expressed in terms of T and M that's the Landauer terminology if we go to zero Kelvin which we don't usually do with engineers working on MOSFETs but if you were to do that physicists like to do that right you can find some really interesting fundamental physics remember the Fermi function changes from 1 to 0 at around the Fermi energy if you go to T equals 0 it changes very abruptly at the Fermi energy that derivative becomes a delta function it's easy to integrate a delta function so what happens is this is a delta function centered at the Fermi energy and that means when I do that integral I get this beautiful expression that the conductance of a small conductor is some fundamental constants times the probability that an electron entering at the Fermi energy will make it across times a number of channels that it can travel in okay so this is a well-established experimental fact now you know you know so back back in the late 80s Early 90s physicists were looking at this doing experiments at 4 degrees Kelvin so that they could reduce scattering and transmission T would be close to 1 so it would be ballistic and what they did is they had a thin sheet of 2 D conductor this is a resistor here's a source here's the drain here's the channel and they had a way to electrically vary the width of the channel they did it with Schottky barriers they just reversed biased it and depleted it so they could electrically control the width classically we expect a conductor if you make it twice as wide you'll get twice as much conductance it's just like having two resistors in parallel what they observed when they did that was that the conductance increased in steps as they change this voltage and increase the width it didn't increase smoothly it increased in steps and those steps were 2q squared over H just what the theory says that should be so this is called the quantum of conductance so there are two things one is that conductance is quantized you can't make a resistor and get any resistance that you want you can only get certain multiples of this quantized conductance now if the resistor is a big one you don't notice that but if the resistor is a small one you notice it to it the other is no matter how short the resistor so we always think of the resistance being proportional to the length no matter how short it is its resistance its conductance can only can never be higher than this the transmission will just be 1 as it gets shorter and shorter there's more and more probability and electron will go from the source to the drain once the transmission is 1 it can't get any higher so now you keep making it shorter and shorter the resistance doesn't get any smaller a conductance doesn't get any higher people have actually I understand taking probes and put them down and a hydrogen molecule which is about as short as you can get that measured its resistance it's 1 over 2 Q squared over H right so this is some very interesting and fundamental physics that you know 25 years ago or so we thought well this is interesting for physicists who are working at 4 degrees Kelvin now this is relevant for room temperature MOSFETs you can measure that these days at room temperature and if you're doing careful characterization of the MOSFETs you're you worried about this now the fact that the conductance is quantized and that the the channel resistance of a MOSFET has a lower limit you make it shorter it's not going to get any lower okay so that's the approach we're going to use when we do the MOSFET in the linear regime when we do the MOSFET under high drain voltage that's even easier we go back to our fundamental expression what's important is the difference in the Fermi functions between the two contexts the Fermi functions are different because the Fermi level is different if I apply a large voltage the Fermi level in the drain is way lower than the Fermi level in the source it means that f1 is much much greater than f2 and we just ignore - its negligible so we have a simple expression we just have to work out that integral okay now we can do a MOSFET the way if somebody were encountering a MOSFET for the first time today 20 nanometer channel length and they had to analyze it this is probably how they would think to do it all right I know how to treat nano devices I'll treat my nano MOSFET this way so we have an IV characteristic looks look down here f1 and f2 are just a little bit different because we've applied a small drain voltage you know both of them are close to the equilibrium Fermi function so the current is just a conductance times voltage and we want to compute the conductance okay a little bit of math I'll go through it quickly because just so you get the gist of it you know you can fill in details later if you're interested here's our expression that we developed for small drain voltage now I need to know the number of channels well you can figure that out read my book it's not expensive right you know if you know the band structure you can figure it out let's assume it's ballistic let's assume that it's so short that every electron that comes in from the source goes out to drink let's assume we shouldn't do this but let's do it anyway let's assume that we can approximate the Fermi function by a Maxwell Boltzmann distribution because it makes life a little easier and traditional MOS theory is usually done that way then we can compare to the traditional answers and we can always go back you know then we don't have fermi-dirac integrals to worry about okay so the carrier density is just related exponentially to the difference between the Fermi energy and the conduction band these are 2d carriers in the inversion layer so we have a 2d effective density of states you know we know all about that okay so we we just do the math we do the derivative of the of the Fermi function in the Maxwell Boltzmann limit we plug everything in it's an integral alright you know we wish it were a little easier but it's not that difficult you do it you know look at your integral table and Wikipedia work out the integral and we get an expression that looks like this I should point out this way let's see Q times the carrier density per square centimeter is just the inversion level charge the amount of charge we have depends on the gate voltage so now it's starting to look a little more like a MOSFET and this collection of constants here turns out to be just the average thermal velocity of electrons randomly moving around inside a semiconductor V sub T is the thermal velocity okay so we have this expression just like we did before it doesn't really look like the textbook expression but it's not too bad it looks a little different we'll discuss how it relates to that classic 1960s expression in a minute but we've got an expression this describes a ballistic MOSFET okay let's do the other region so here we're at high drain bias we take our expression we ignore f2 because we applied a large bias we just have to work out this integral okay so we work out this integral we know the same number of channels assume its ballistic again assume Maxwell Boltzmann statistics the collection of constants here this turns out to be the average velocity that thermal equilibrium electrons are moving in the plus X direction though the total average velocity is zero but if you just look at the average of those moving in the positive direction it's some finite value right and and here's our expression for the electron density okay plug everything in do the math and we find that the current is charge times velocity but the velocity is this thermal velocity so we'll have to talk about that a little bit so we've done that okay so we have a ballistic MOSFET we have expressions they look different from the classic MOSFET expressions but I'll show you that they're really not so different we have one for the high VDS this looks very similar it's just that why have we replaced this high field saturation velocity with the thermal equilibrium ASSA t-that electrons are moving around with alright this seems kind of mysterious why and why is that happening just came out of the math but there must be some physical reason for it okay so you plot the IV characteristics you know back when people first started looking at this this surprise an awful lot of people you know it's a ballistic MOSFET you know this is just some different kind of thing you plot the IV characteristics it looks like any MOSFET the reason it does is the I the shape of the IV characteristics comes from pushing those energy barriers up and down just the magnitude of the current changes that's all right so the IV characteristics look like the same we have these expressions for the linear regime but now we understand that no matter how short we make the channel we can't change this slope we're not going to make the resistance any smaller because it's ballistic there's no channel length in this expression and we have the expression for the on current that we have to understand a little more okay so we would call that the ballistic on current and notice if you do this you'll notice that the current increases of linearly with gate voltage it looks like the velocity is saturating but the way we understand velocity saturation under high fields is it's caused by a lot of scattering but we took all the scattering out of the analysis we said that the probability that it will transmit from source to drain is 1 there's no scattering to bounce it back and return it to the source so how can the velocity be saturating when there's no scattering to cause it to saturate well that turns out to have an inter alia answer so these are simulations so this is an energy band diagram under high Gate voltage so the barrier is low and we just keep increasing the the drain voltage so we pull the conduction band in to drain down more and more and for some reason the velocity saturates again but let's let's see let's look here at the top of this energy barrier this turns out to be the go place this is what people call the virtual source that's why that model is called the virtual source level this is what we call the beginning of the of the channel it's really what acts like the source not this big heavily doped region back here the charge here if the transistor designer has done his or her job well the charge here is C ox VG minus VT just like it is in a classic MOS MOSFET even though this thing is really small than the electrostatics is 2-dimensional if you've done things right the charge is C ox VG minus VT so then the question is what is the velocity their charge times velocity is current now if you look inside a semiconductor at equilibrium you'll see electrons bouncing around in random thermal motion they will be distributed in a maxwellian distribution of velocities so this is the X velocity this is the Y velocity the XY plane is the plane of the channel and just like an ideal gas the gas particles bounce around scatter off of each other randomly and they're distributed in a maxwellian velocity distribution that's what this is a maxwellian velocity distribution okay but it's kind of interesting maxwellian velocity distributions are produced when you have a lot of scattering so that everything comes to equilibrium then you get a maxwellian velocity distribution there is no scattering here how can we get a maxwellian velocity distribution when we apply the zero volts between the drain and the source the answer is very interesting we're assuming that this source is a very big region with lots of scattering there is a maxwellian velocity distribution there same thing for the drain the positive half of those electrons can hop over the barrier and get into the channel the positive half all of the positive x velocities in this came from the source the negative half the drain they're also distributed in a maxwellian velocity distribution the negative velocity ones can get into the channel and come back here then negative half of this came from the drain so scattering did produce this equilibrium distribution but it was scattering and the source that produced the positive half that was scattering in the drain that produced the negative half okay now you apply a little bit of gate voltage or drain voltage you lower the Fermi and you lower the Fermi energy you lower the conduction band of the drain okay no problem the positive half can still come in it's just like it was before okay the negative half though has to hop over a big bigger barrier to get here to the virtual source that means fewer of them are going to be able to hop over the negative half is smaller that means the average velocity now is bigger than zero current is flowing right you apply a larger drain voltage even larger you've got an even smaller negative half because there's an even bigger barrier you apply an even larger one and now no electrons from the drain can hop over and get into the channel you only have the positive half that came in here the average velocity of that positive half is the thermal equilibrium velocity that they were zipping around in the source and they just hopped over that barrier and came in that's the biggest that the velocity can be the velocity has now saturated because it can't get any bigger now because you only you only have the positive half coming over the same barrier but the velocity has not saturated where the textbooks say it would saturate it's not saturated in the drain end where the electric field is high it's saturated at the top of the barrier or the slope is zero it's saturating where the electric field is zero because of this mechanism all right so that's really interesting so the early transistor pioneers had it right the velocity is saturating in these devices it's just it's saturating for a completely different reason than it was 40 years ago but it's still saturating and that's why the characteristics still look good so that explains you know several years ago everybody was focused on this thinking wow this is wonderful we make transistors shorter and shorter the velocity just gets higher and higher well it turns out that if you make the drain voltage bigger and bigger the velocity at this point saturates it doesn't get higher and higher now it's bigger than 1 times 10 to the seventh so that has to do with Fermi Dirac statistics and things like that you know that's why it's it's bigger than 10 to the seventh it's the thermal velocity with Fermi direct statistics right okay so just very quickly you look at this and you say does this have any relevance to modern transistors so just compute this ballistic theory that's those are the red lines compared with measured characteristics what you typically find these days in a silicon mosfet that the devices operate at about half of the ballistic limit they give you half of the current that you would get if you had no scattering in the channel and the transmission is one that's actually pretty close ok it's actually 20% down here but it's 60 percent up there all right so that's where we are in MOSFETs it's actually interesting we've been there for about you know for about 15 years you think well if I make the channel shorter I should get closer to the ballistic limit because there'll be more chance they can go across and not scatter that's true but if you just make the channel shorter you won't make it your transistor won't be very good then you'll go back and you'll raise the channel doping and you'll control the - the electrostatics and do everything that you need to do in order to make the transistor behave properly and you'll find you're back to 50 percent that's where people have been stuck they haven't found a way to get past that there are transistors however that operate essentially at the ballistic limit if you look at 3-5 transistors made on high mobility semiconductors and you do the same kind of comparison between the ballistic theory and the measured characteristic you can see that a transistor like that operates almost estable stink limit you know nothing like what a textbook would say it operates it so these things can become very very important okay so if we're gonna understand this I need to say a little bit about scattering so scattering is where things get complicated all right then when I teach a course EE 656 if you're interested in this you can find it on the web or you can take the course and you can learn all these details about scattering but the concepts that we need are relatively simple let's think about our channel as being a slab of material of some length L some electrons are coming in from the source let's say the magnitude is 1 what we want to know is the fraction of them that come out the other side and that fraction is T a number between 0 and 1 and you can see you know there's a very simple expression and you can see that this works if the channel length is much less than the average distance between scattering events this expression is going to go to 1 right makes physical sense if the channel length is much longer in the average distance between scattering events this is going to get very small there'll be many opportunities to scatter and turn around all right it's actually better than that it's not just empirical ad hoc then you can actually derive it and it works really well in practice okay so this critical parameter is the average distance between scattering events okay so we want to get this in our theory so that we can treat MOSFETs that operate when there's a little bit of scattering you might think that well all we have to do is to multiply the expressions we got before by this number between 0 & 1 turns out it's a little more complicated down here in the linear regime that's all you have to do you just multiply it by the transmission if you can figure out the transmission you're home free up here at the high drain voltage it's a little more complicated you don't multiply it by T you multiply it by T divided by 2 minus T all right that's a little mysterious but let me do this very quick because if you don't follow it that's okay but you sort of get the gist of why it why it happens the charge at the top of the barrier current is charge times velocity so if I want the charge it's the ballistic current that's injected divided by the ballistic velocity there's this width I have to worry about too so that would be the amount of charge under ballistic conditions when I'm not ballistic then I have a stream I have some carriers with positive velocities I have some carriers with negative velocities I have to add the two up in order to get all of the charge this is the stream with positive velocities if T of them are transmitted across and 1 minus T come back in the other direction so this is a stream of electrons in the negative velocity they travel at the same thermal velocity so I can get the total charge okay now when I have scattering I'm going to inject some fixed amount I'm going to inject some amount I plus into and the key thing here now is that the key thing is mos electrostatics if I've designed my transistor properly charge is C ox VG minus VT it doesn't matter whether it's ballistic or whether it's diffusive that's just electrostatics so I equate the ballistic expression to the expression with scattering and what I'm going to find is that when I have scattering I'll inject fewer electrons because I'm going to get some charge from the contributed from than the ones with negative electrons so when I maintain that when I say that the charge always has to be given by mos electrostatics whether they're scattering or not that's where this 2 minus T comes in and then what goes out is T times what came in so now I've got my T over 2 minus T so the point just is that you have to understand mos electrostatics in order to get this expression right and that becomes important that high drain voltages now one of the things that you'll find is that if you compute the transmission at low drain bias it's about 20% if you compute the transmission under high drain bias you'll find that it's much bigger about 70% of them go across in a silicon mosfet that's a little mysterious higher voltages should give the carrier's more energy they should be more likely to scatter if anything it should be less ballistic under high bias than under low bias but that's not what you find when you when you analyze major data and how do we understand that so this is the way I understand it here's our energy band diagram under low drain by low drain bias we have an expression for transmission main free path divided by mean free path plus channel length if an electron that comes in if it scatters anywhere inside that channel it has a chance to turn around and go back out the source and not give us any drain current now what happens if you apply a high drain bias you pull everything down right the gate tries to hold it up okay now we have a short region here right around the virtual source the top of the barrier if electrons scatter there they can return to the drain if electrons hop over that and start going down the electric field it doesn't matter if they scatter anymore it's your relevant the electric field is so strong it'll turn them around and sweep them out it's like the collector of a bipolar transistor it's just going to sweep everything out the only scattering that matters is the scattering that occurs in this thin short low field region right near the beginning of the channel so the way we understand that is just that the region that controls the current is just a tiny fraction of the channel length and that means even though the mean free path hasn't changed that length has changed so the probability that they'll transmit is much much higher so this region is a bottleneck for current flow okay so we're almost there so I want to pull this all together you know I'm not going to be able to say much about what happens below 10 nanometers because that's a current research and Technology challenge but we've seen how you would think about this device as a nano device it looks quite a bit different from except for the electrostatics it looks quite a bit different from the traditional way that is in every textbook but I want to try to connect those now and you'll see that they're not so different and we want to try to end the process understand why we can still use these models from 1960s and just make a couple of tweaks and they still work beautifully again alright so here's the expression that we've developed you know there's no mobility or anything it looks completely different but we know that the transmission is related to mean free path and I have to pull out a little transport Theory the diffusion coefficient is also reported related to mean free path they may remember what the units of diffusion coefficient are centimeters squared per second so actually you can show with some transport theory that diffusion is random thermal motion so it's the thermal velocity times the mean free path / - that's the diffusion coefficient if I've got the diffusion coefficient the Einstein relation gives me the mobility I just do a little bit of math and I rewrite this trying to get the mobility into it and if you do that something really interesting works out you lump everything together and there are there are some terms that we can lump together and we can call the apparent mobility and there is this rule that we've seen before it looks like Mathiason z-- rule it looks like we're adding two different mechanisms and one is the real mobility this is our the effective mobility of electrons in the channel and the other one is something that we call the ballistic mobility and what is that ballistic mobility well when you lump all of these parameters together it's not surprising that the mobility depends on the average distance between scattering events all right that makes physical sense the more scattering the less that distance is the smaller the mobility is that makes perfect sense that's a real mobility this ballistic mobility you just replace the actual mean free path by the channel length now when electrons travel ballistically from the source to the drain they scatter a lot in the source they zip across the channel and they don't scatter they scatter a lot in the drain as soon as they get there so the average distance between scattering events when it's ballistic and the channel is the channel length so that's what this ballistic mobility is you take this expression you get our ballistic Theory everything works out beautifully you just have to replace the real mobility by this apparent mobility and there's it's not empirical there's good physics behind it right people measure this these days how about high VDS same kind of thing this expression looks quite a bit different we've seen that under saturation conditions P is mean free path over mean free path divided by the length of this bottleneck regime we also have the diffusion coefficient rewrite this a little bit and we find that the saturation current is charge times velocity and the velocity is given by an expression like that and let's see if we can make sense out of that that average velocity is 1 over the thermal velocity this is what they get injected at from the source this is what they would travel across if its ballistic V over L T has the units of centimeters squared per second L is centimeters this is a velocity this is the average velocity that electrons are diffusing across a region of length L that's how we interpret it so what this expression says is that the velocity up here at the virtual source is the slower of two velocities if electrons electrons have to diffuse across that then that's the velocity if this velocity gets bigger than the thermal velocity then we say that doesn't make any sense diffusion is random thermal motion you can't diffuse faster than the thermal velocity then it's the thermal velocity that limits us right that's the ballistic limit so the picture is that under high drain bias the current isn't the drift current it's a diffusion current this bottleneck region looks just like the base of a bipolar transistor electrons get injected to this region they have to diffuse across once they get across they see the high field part of the channel which is just like the collector of a bipolar transistor sweeps it across this is a really useful way to think about these small devices and it's not a new idea but not many people that paid attention to it you know this fellow Ed Johnson back in 1973 pointed out we think about a MOSFET and a bipolar transistor as being two different devices draw the energy band diagram it's really the same device right okay so we have these expressions and we see that we can easily take these expressions and convert them into proper expressions that are physically valid there's actually it turns out there are two ways that you can compute the tradition you can correct the traditional expression just by rearranging the math you can either replace the channel length by channel length plus one mean free path then as your channel length goes to zero you don't have to worry about things blowing up it goes to the proper ballistic limit or you can replace the mobility by this expression involving the apparent mobility and you know we have a physical interpretation of what this velocity and VSAT is it's just the velocity that they're getting across the bottleneck we Jeanette and it can't ever be faster than the ballistic then the thermal diffusion velocity they get injected at the source if they don't scatter they can't get passed out of velocity that's any higher than that okay so that's pretty much the picture and it's really relatively simple but I want to talk about some some of you will go out and do technology development and you'll see if you can push the technology to five nanometers you know people have done that you know we thought we thought we'd never get below 100 it was impossible right the right students graduated they went out and figured out a way to do it you guys will figure out a way to get below 10 nanometers right but what's the challenge so the challenge is this these are quantum mechanical calculations so here's the conduction band profile and this is energy and this is the magnitude of the current red means lots of current flowing so this is a device that's supposed to be off 13 nanometer channeling you can see where the current is flowing over the top of the barrier this is the way a transistor is supposed to work push the barrier down more current will flow over the top you'll get more current you go to 10 nanometers you can start to see a little bit of tunneling but it's not too bad 10 nanometers the picture I outline still works just fine you go to 7 nanometers and now you start to worry it seems to be quite a bit of it tunneling underneath you go to 4 nanometers it doesn't even the electrons don't know there's a barrier there they just tunnel right through it this is gonna be a problem you know can you do anything about it you know well maybe now I'll just point out my colleague Gerhard Klimek as a student sumitra who's trying to figure out if you can do better and these are energy band diagrams and I'll just quickly point out the punch line for his his work depending on what orientation you use for the channel and what strain you put in the silicon the channel you can get different effective masses remember tunneling a light mass tunnels very effectively a heavy mass doesn't if you can arrange things so that you make the silicon effective mass heavier it'll be harder to tunnel and that's what he's showing here if you do things with orientation and strain just right you can get most of the current to go over the top of the and you can make a vibe nanometre channeling that works like a transistor is supposed to work so there's hope all right it's not going to be easy but what there's hope okay so just to summarize you know this is it this is what you should take away from this lecture here's how we think about how a small transistor works we have this energy band diagram we focus on the top of the barrier or the virtual source there we know that the current is charge times velocity the charge is just given by classic MOS theory if you design the transistor properly which is really really hard right this is why people are doing FinFETs right now this region if it's designed properly is strongly controlled by the gate but weakly controlled by the drain you add drain voltage you pull the energy down here hopefully you don't pull the barrier down then you've got a good transistor and the current is saturated so if if if it's a well tempered MOSFET then the energy barrier is mostly controlled by the gate and then there's this bottleneck this little region here so the magnitude of the current is controlled by can electrons get across that bottleneck without scattering and turning around and going back to the source and we've explained why this model works so beautifully why we just have to take the traditional model of many years ago replace the mobility by an apparent mobility reinterpret what this saturation velocity is and we've got we're not just doing ad hoc curve fitting right it's based on sound physical principles and it all makes a good deal of sense so I've tried to you know explain that understanding MOSFETs really maybe the most important part is electrostatics the hardest part to understand is transport but we described how if you use this land our approach you can get a simple clear physical approach to understanding that not too difficult what happens below 10 nanometers is still uncharted territory you know things seem to be getting more complicated we'll have to figure out how to handle that if we want to keep Moore's law going for another 20 years okay so if there are questions I'll be happy to take them this talk is going to be available as soon as we get done with the production on nanohub and if you really want to know how this all works out carefully take my short course if you wait a few weeks it's gonna be free if you sign up tomorrow you have to pay $30 but it's well worth $30 oh okay so thanks for listening and this sort of for my class here at Purdue you know this is this kind of wraps up the picture of MOS what it is that we've been talking about all along and I hope for the audience in Mexico that this convinces you that there's a simple clear physical way to think about these devices and if you have any questions please ask thank you
