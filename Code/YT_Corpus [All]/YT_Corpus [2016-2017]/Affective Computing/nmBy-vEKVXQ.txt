 roslyn thank you so much for having a conversation with me pleasure pleasure TV so you are at MIT where you are the founder and director of the affective computing research group that's right so why don't you tell me about what affective computing is yeah affective computing is computing that relates to arises from or deliberately influences emotion we've been inventing different kinds of technology to help people measure and communicate effective information things like if a person is interested or bored pleased or displeased engaged or disengaged so what does it mean for a technology to read emotions in a human being give me a both give me an example both of what the technology does and how people use it yes one example is when people are using a computer and it has a built-in camera if they choose to opt in they can turn on the camera and have it watch them watching other content and through that you can communicate with your face things like where some content made you laugh where you actually look like you were interested and what the video was saying or where you're and a lot of political videos we found people smirk people watching political videos or yeah do a lot of smirking yeah we originally were looking for smiles and frowns and then we realized a lot of the most interesting facial expressions where skepticism I'm afraid yeah I'm someone who does a certain amount of cable television where you're talking about politics and when when other people are talking I'm always afraid that my face is lapsing into some sort of unpleasantly skeptical expression and it sounds like probably is there are people who are leaky who expressed pretty much outwardly what they're feeling in early and then there are people who may choose not to express that we are all free to hide it we also make are we free to hide it I mean ten people how effective are people at controlling their facial emotions or their facial expression there's a there's a great variety of ability there there are some people who are not effective at all and there are others who have a great poker face and you do tests where you ask people to control their emotions while there I do not focus on people's cases where they're trying to hide emotions I usually focus on cases where people want to communicate and maybe they're being misunderstood are we have chosen to focus the technology on cases where it can we can see a clear usage where it can help people and usually that's not trying to extract things from people who want to hide it right okay so you're not giving it to interrogation or Danny we are not there are you so much for the visit by technology so but so your uses so tell me about the uses then what what arts and what are the applications that essentially help people who aren't being understood how does that work well one of them has actually evolved from I'm wearing some unusual wristbands here that have we started working with people who had limited language abilities especially people in the autism spectrum but all of us at some point were unable to speak or we may become sick and unable to speak and we realized many of these individuals we're experiencing a lot of stress and feelings that were being misinterpreted based on how people viewed them on the outside and by putting on a sensor that could measure more of what was going on inside them we could communicate to the observer that the child was actually you know maybe he looked mellow laying on the floor like he was just being lazy bum but in fact he's so stressed that if you bother him right now he might become injurious to himself or others whereas if you let him you know get the comfort of the deep pressure of the floor maybe that's the best thing from right now and he'll calm down so what kind of things are are being measured that and that's situation by the wristbands right so this one is measuring a thing called skin conductance it's an electrical change in the skin that's its generated when you sweat but it's also generated very suddenly by changes in the deep emotion centers of your brain especially the parts that get activated with fight or flight when something is makes you anxious or you might feel like it really matters a lot and it's not under your control so it's kind of mildly threatening or majorly threatening those things can activate these regions in the brain which sends signals to your pseudo motor nerve system which can cause you to sweat but even before you sweat it can cause electrical changes that we sense interesting and so this is in a sense these are forms of wearable computing exactly these are examples of wearable computing and I know that some of your work it's not just autism you've done work related to depression as well and so how you know how does that because I think people think of depression as such an inward interior state and I'm wondering both citizen how if you sort of are trying to measure it what kind of measurements you use but then also what are the applications of your work for either people struggling with depression or people trying to help them right we're doing a lot of fundamental research on what the body's changes are during depression right now both before the person becomes depressed and after your projects on both one of the things that led us to that work originally I thought was oh you're depressed you're just not moving much you know or you're just not very emotionally activated and some of it is a suppression of expression and a suppression of activity but also we've learned there can be imbalances deep in the brain and now we are doing some basic studies as to how those show up in some of the signals we measure in different parts of the body one of the biggest surprises we found was when one of our non-speaking children was having a signal that was huge on one side and not the other and I couldn't forgot what caused that like how could you be emotionally excited on one side and not the other like I thought our sensors were broken and after debugging everything and realizing it wasn't the sensors I learned that the child had just had a grand mal seizure and that explained what was going on and then we started to learn about seizures being little bursts of electrical activity in different parts of the brain sometimes they spread to the whole brain but when they're localized they can send signals that show up in only one the body and as we traced that down we learned that certain regions when / activated or under activated could show up as things like your right side being aroused in your left side not and that now is those findings are being used to build seizure detectors and also to issue alerts that could help people prevent dangerous States from going unattended and also we're looking at early signs of depression and also as people get treatment and start to heal and come out of depression do these patterns shift to more normal patterns so both both people who are already patients and people who are I guess in at-risk populations would wear these devices basically in the long run as sort of monitoring for themselves or their doctors right right in fact this is a place are you actually is that yeah but this one it also doubles as a wristwatch this is the impact I was going to say it's the apple you know it's the Apple watch I think that's better so much yeah thank you I wouldn't I wouldn't expect that it's cheaper but maybe it is less expensive than the Apple is well then your technology must be well on its way we're working on it yeah yeah this is a prototype
