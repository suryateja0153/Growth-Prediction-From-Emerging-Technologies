 that the title my tattoo is empathy and the subtitles effective in the community event were boring as he attention on the award I'm one of the founder of the you or the RoboCup and also work out of course professor of the author University during graduate school engineering and the erotic project I former perdida over the editor project and also named I have the API of the jsps the aim and so on but also i am a pool with the bow remember sorry what's happened here hey looks like this one's down down okay so anyhow so where i'm a board member was a japanese society of the baby science so so many people asking me why you read to the baby the my answer is a very very strong because we like to make the robot more intentioned but what's the indigents that's a big big mystery how the baby became intelligent so therefore a you know we like the attacker in order this program and instead we like to you know by utilizing the robots or some come to simulation we like to address that this issue the mystery of the intelligence held at the baby became they know the intention or something and the next red is s acknowledgement oh my colleague because all the time i forget is that to show the suns right of the acknowledgement of the micro wreck therefore especially today i have more than 100 destroyed i have to hurry up please follow me and next layer is also the lava kappa petrol vocab so where are you see are the left mouse it was held in hefei in china and we have our whole hundred teams and ugly we have more teams better due to the limited of the time on the space so we're almost 400 teams around the world and how of them comes from the junior junior means from elementary school to the high school students gathered the assembled robot their robots and the competition is a sucker and also or the rescue and dance and so on so they really enjoy the games and also where we share some kind of spirit of the logo cap the robocup stupid all the time challenge so well this year we have some special warm as i will show you the video but still not yet okay three years ago we get a champion out my team had got a champion the human league and also we get some revision cap the riveter is a big sponsor they offer the same rhythm cap is a the copies of the battle has two crystal and I it almost any sane man in the same thing there are pointed to video doors okay almost a teleporting 22 million dollars and so were we we had some insurance because actually we get one year and then we asked our president 2 2 2 20 to display this one and the insurance company said that okay their point two billion million dürer's cost very much therefore our university k baad zeppelin better just 0.02 million dollars that is amia human so to me to win japanese yen oh we're 0 ry 18 st. hypothermia or something yes yes the box of the riveter it's only one box there for the if they mentioned and how not yet Wow oh I it's okay oh it's a good news so next slide is just a video clips so okay Kareem Kareem okay so oh ok ok ok i hope that I'd wrong one hour getting my talk ok how this shows the universe and how the number of our team is increasing so we stayed in 1997 in connection with a check I conferences are international judge conference of AR and that time just only 40 teams and almost them are the simulation not real Robert Horry Lilavati is a bitter sighs and samosa totally nine teams but now almost 400 teams around as I mentioned the due to the limit of the time on the space so all you just accepted a room who had the teams and half of them is a junior it's a mini junior participant and two years ago we get the champion out of the Human League side and the Human League and regretted that this one the ROI baton card ok I have liked to shoot some video clips so the every single autonomous this is an emitter it was here in the Netherlands and the Queen this is s okay you can see it all the only direction buren system and loop shoot oh all the time challenge the local team so short setting so this is a mirror sideways every single turn on us and the decision or the rescue league so only in this league is at elevation because you know to rescue their you know victims in 72 hours it's just the third a serious issues therefore retainer Julio Thomas is kind of the universe drink therefore the kind of black teller position but only the sensory information can scrub the robot on site so nowadays you know that the wrong was on the motor type robots for active the scary the same size of the disaster situations and like this room and this is in a sponsor the way the first the best is a company to produce some kind of action master or some kind of part of the robot robot robot parts and then the competition is supported by the first company and then they then border some industry reports and carry on something this is small sad League also this user you are so remote sensing so TV camera is from the ceiling and the capture the whole field and then localize the robots and the ball and some sort of the teamwork this is the simulation ok so we're this way get the ball speed is very very quick therefore sometimes difficult to follow this is the human wig is now we have this is a standard platform rig so with the hard way the same and the software is just competitions before we use to the acai ivory ok so we're very very unstable that's a French company I would do belong now it's a pepper is very harmless but anyhow the French company therefore are still the hard way not so stable or the above the e team prepared their own robots yeah so we are very serious not just praying well so a serious application one of the application is a daily life application so needed RoboCup at the home so the mission is to identify the person and also the conversation with people to assist some kind of the physical task and so on so this time it is just the Kerala is something or you know water brain and then some composition with people so anyhow so this is a one of the application of the RoboCup okay okay so this is from the website this summer school I copy this one and i found an we is missing oh yeah I Willis obviously something is missing so I put it anyhow so we are using the notion of awareness in the world sense we somehow they are blah blah blah blah and then so the reverse include the neuroscience going to science artificial intelligence to thrive and robotics so today I'm going to talk about to robotics so what does it mean the robotic limb I talk so why had the idea that so that design theory so we're existing this spring of the science try to understand the phenomena work many are in order packed then the based on the explanation observe and analyze enlarge something so we have the term death and theories that some conservative approach it to the cognitive our cognitive issues by you turn the brochure and where robots and second point is we focusing on the debate aspect do not give an a priori better obtaining through the running and the riv the process as much as possible because you know so many routes to research almost robotically researcher designer designed almost everything how to do or what to do was anything but we focusing on the specially there as i mentioned i value no remember the baby side there for the big mystery they have the baby yet therefore we focus on the main process of this one and also the robot has tools the for studying the humans d habits and the Mayans the before we have been trying to build apps the robots and embed to the computer module and develop I the motor or something but nowadays still there are many many more mysteries on the human science therefore we try to utilize the robot as a tool to study the you know humans behavior and the minds and the special focus on the cognitive in the effective issues or towards empathy so this is dino ultra demo talk the first I approximately no creativity of robotics and it's residential empathy and today the time is limited therefore I just show you some two examples of our studies okay the after that diverse so there are many the newborn baby rounded different behaviors for example the hips months so they have shown to some handle Riegert behavior it's just hum triggered just look at the hand okay and this from shows in with a learning target for the from the viewpoint internal products so handle regal correspondence in a world and the inverse models of the hand as you can see that if we specify the angle here and here and here you can specify the final posture and this is a forward kinematics and if you try to cap cap catch the disc up and what kind of angle here and here and here this is the inverse so at the hips mouse baby they'll and the energies can do with the warden the inverse models of the hand well wing it that as a ways so for adults you know the bigger information antec during commercial all together but at this man okay so the baby is still not integrated this one therefore they try to integrate the visual information and technique mention or drop the object that I know rate of some kind of the physics and also were a heated objects something something attends mass the imitator movements the imitations is a very very important add just one year okay they have shown they showed some pretended behavior ryka like this one and this one this is a kind of some mental simulations so it's very very amazing so we give up to design the robot we can then that these kind of behavior just one year because there are big big mysteries how the baby grown up okay therefore but someone says that okay this is a gene the gene the nature side is at qantas everything but as you know nowadays the nature side at the nitrous I'd closely related to each other in different levels so the question is for us is that the balance between the nature to what extent we embedded already beforehand and to what extent we expect from the running and the developers that is a sum one of the issues for us so we advocating some point in the robotics many years ago this is the first paper we perish 2001 so the 14 years ago in these guys you know this guy professor here Oct grow this very famous to die of the Android his Android and the soq yash and he is not so famous and also these guys the row pfeiffer that you sang Guinea and my old friend and these young guys this is a 2003 and the six years ago we had published they know the paper the co-editor robotics from the ITB transactions Amed the first issue to for us to be review with these are you know form or other group members of these guys and this year we had some development proposed the book the textbook of Roma deed to god this guy is in well under control as she is a his early Italian better hehe UK he's all the time of suffering from the food all the time in the England he all the time finds the Italian food any and this guy is as a psychologist so it's a sort of the Good Book of the developerworks but mainly focus on Zeno the governor psychology and robotics okay so we have been advocating our cognitive and robotics for many as more than 20 years so the main are the aims at understand the humanity haber process by synthetic organs of approaches aerating robots and separations the core idea is a physical embodiment and social interaction they are enabling which equation structuring through the interaction with the environment including as a agent what is this Carrie environment it's not a new world actually the lodgers power this is a very human events together with a split brain Nobel winner he had already mentioned before one year before my past year nineteen nineteen fifty two men years ago to invest and demand begin with the parents of the boat activities and the derives underlying mental structure from them so he has already mentioned the importance of the physical environment but because you know he mentioned about some biological system but we had like to have some analogy to the inward the artificial system to about the social interaction I prefer to refer to this guy the young philosopher ah da da da real album Nora the title is out of our heads so the mind cannot be understood except in terms of their interaction of the whole organisms within in 10 externally and Brandon especially the social environment or because this guy is a frost for he has not mentioned anything about the design but he has a very very suggestion good suggestion out overhead in Japan a professor cono cono titia testicle I forget his name but he also he mentioned oh koo koo roo akala DiNozzo Tanya so that a very good clear the suggestion because you know also tied the brain science tried to reduce some kind of the mechanism mind into the brain but one single brain is not what for example we send the one robot to the moon with something and there we try to ask this robot to do something oh the disorderly one robot he does not hear what she does not need to emerge the mind but we send 10 robots were one more person so this robot has to have communicate has to communicate with the person in that case just some chance to emerge as some sort of the mind there were the interaction is very very important to emerge such a kind of single therefore this book does not mention anything about design but this book suggests as we have to think about some mechanism underlying mechanism fundamental mechanism to emerge through the interruption to avoid something just as an our point so the approach of the coming to develop robotics CDL in short that's in connection with the computer modem and a some verified something but also that the parties that offered the new means of the data to now him and the minute process the mutual hit back with a and B so this is the parties you know I mentioned that robot as a tool was similarly so providing his robot as a lover of reproduction tool and the experiment the actually this is some family of the my former project two thousand from 2005 2011 so jay is there a lot or my project and we started some kind of heated simulations so University of Tokyo the professor Yasukuni she's group and also some are the running of the the motor skills with artificial masters as you know what sample the Honda oshtemo is just electric motors we win we like this one may be in the video you can see that some other ashimmel is learning this one but it's very very noisy as electric motors a high gear so words no you know the very system is like a complete movement like this one but for honda Shima it's very difficult because you know very high higher in the waters there for me I mean like this one but in this club is that is a massive so like as a like a massive system is the powered by air so words like kind of some at some you know some sort of delicate movements the motor skills running here and also some kind of the quality issues and also some some social interaction of the inner boca limitations or the joint attention staff and so on about the during the attention staff maybe the second speaker of the UT Naga you mentioned that at this one something
