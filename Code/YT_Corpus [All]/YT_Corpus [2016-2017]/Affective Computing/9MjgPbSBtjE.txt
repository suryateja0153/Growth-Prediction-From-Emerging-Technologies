 so the topic we looked at today was effective computing which is where computers are able to read our emotions and give us notifications base of them and give us different responses based on our emotions I think this is definitely an interesting topic to look into and I think the potential of it is pretty it's pretty great I found it quite interesting though that when they were talking about emotions in general these most of the motions they they go across all cultures so this actually creates a very broad reach for this technology where it can have an immediate impact in almost every culture because our emotional responses are pretty general across the board I think this panel was was interesting and I really enjoyed watching it and I think it went into some issues with this technology that we had talked about previously as far as privacy and security specifically can and rayna went into went into this issue and raina discuss their that they asked their users for for permission or did you take these videos for facial recognition and for facial analysis in order to get these emotional feedbacks from ads and other applications that they have so they do want permission from the users and in certain cases they don't require that if the user doesn't want that can the kind of equate that equated the whole situation to credit card uses our usage on the Internet where you know we we know that it's vulnerable on the internet we know there's many hacks that have happened in the news yeah we still have our credit cards on the Internet so in this case the benefit out raise the risk and so if the benefit of this effective computing out raised the wrist that that is that wasn't good trade-off for the user Rana also went into saying where it's important to educate the user on what the potential of this data is she said for the most part once it's once the data is generated there's really no danger for the user as far as facial anything it which is just data where they're not really concerned about the identity of the user another thing that one of the big points that i got from from this panel was that you know we as humans are very good at reading the emotions of others you know we as humans are very interpersonal we want to communicate with others we want to have community that's just who we are as humans and while others are better at it than some we already kind of want that community in that kind of those connections and so we are get a reading emotions of others generally but we actually are not good at reading our own emotions um for the most part and so that's kind of where I think the potential of this technology is Mary went into this where she talked about you know this technology can give us notification saying you know hey you're stressed this week more so than you were last week you know what's wrong I think this technology is it's great i think the potential of it's amazing i think though it should lead us to reflection once we get these notifications instead of being a substitute for reflection i think if the technology is just trying to make us happy all the time I don't think that's necessarily what we need us humans i think there's there are times as humans where we do need to feel emotions we need to feel happy we need feel sad need to feel angry these what it is to be human and so I don't think if this technology pacifiers our emotions I don't like that I think it leads to reflection I think that's the best thing I think you know if I get a notification hey Tully your stress this week what's you know what's happening I can think about is ego you know I I did this this this this week maybe I shouldn't knew that and lead to my own personal reflection rather than having to rely on the technology to make me happy again but in general I think this technology definitely has a lot of potential and as you know i think it will go as far as as the users allow it to go if the body and is great we'll see this technology all over the place I don't foresee it being everywhere maybe but I do think in little aspects I think we'll see it maybe it like in with the notifications I think that's definitely the next place will see the state ology all right thank you
