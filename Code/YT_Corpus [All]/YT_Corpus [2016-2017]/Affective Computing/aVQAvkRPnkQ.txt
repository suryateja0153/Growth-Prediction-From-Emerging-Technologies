 wireless mobile technologies are bringing better health and learning to our brothers and sisters and very poor and rural communities but they're also allowing terrorists to make a phone call and detonate a bomb I think vaccines make our world better but they've also inadvertently killed people technology does not ultimately save our lives even if it lengthens our life we're all going to die I'd love to invent a technology that provides world peace there's a big problem but what technology could prevent evil people from seeking power and domination over others now my team here builds technology that detects and analyzes emotion maybe we could help people regulate emotion or maybe we could rid the world of war prompting emotions like anger imagine but once again we have to question that we have imperfect knowledge for example what we think of as bad emotions are not all bad I don't know how many of you were here at commencement years ago when Lee Iacocca spoke at MIT graduation it was a really gorgeous sunny day the grass was green the sky was blue the students were so happy to finally be graduating the parents were so happy to finally not have to pay bills the flowers were blooming and Lee Iacocca got up at the podium and he banged his fist on I can't do it as loud as he did there maybe had the microphone on the podium and he said you must get angry you must get angry and he told all the graduates you must get angry and they're kind of like looking at each other like who hired this guy to wreck our day you know um but why was he saying this because because anger is not all bad right well we think you have sometimes as bad with our imperfect knowledge can be good anger is a great motivator it prompts you to stop putting up with a lot of the garbage out there and make something that is better a technology that got rid of anger would also get rid of much of the good changes in our world it would not save the world what are sources of hope beyond technology what does it mean to save the world really I mean more specific what does it mean to even save one person you or me here at MIT we look to knowledge and great achievements to save oneself to make a better world but is that enough I don't think it is
