 today we're going to look at another type of computer interaction which is to look at computers for communication and there's a phrase for this has been around the literature for ages called computer mediated communication also known as CMC when it gets discussed and let's just take a look very briefly at some of the concepts to help target your reading when you're looking at chapter 4 in particular around engaging with emotional computing affective computing and so on so if we take a look right here in the middle of a computer mediated communication how can we situate that well there are a bunch of things that computer based communications allow to happen that are difficult when face-to-face but seem to have particular value when we have these opportunities and how we use these opportunities also says a lot about us as a culture but let's just review a little bit here it said we have this notion that we're talking about last time when looking at cognition about types of interaction and I asked the question it is all interaction really some form of externalized cognition or interaction design interface types really some form of internalized cognition in which if you may recall when something is a externalized cognition we're using a device to do something for us that we don't want to necessarily hold in our brain whether that's writing a document or particularly things like to-do lists or remembering how long something is going on for actually being able to forget how long we're doing something because an alarm is going to remind us that we can think of in terms of tasks support for externalize cognition the other thing that we can look at is the interaction devices actually help us to carry out processes and I guess you could look at word processing as a type of process but also where we have to deliver something so a process might be going shopping or actually completing a game or engaging with a game where we are focusing in different degrees on how to engage with the system to complete a particular task so what you're probably seeing here is that some tasks blend so there's the notion of something that's an externalized cognition thing where i don't want to forget to remember the milk so I've got a reminder for that but I also have this shopping tasks that I'd like to do but what you probably notice is that these other tasks like going shopping as opposed to simply picking up milk if you want to shop at a particular store there's a particular way of doing that and so or playing a game there's a particular way to play a game so that the system is reflecting the constraints of those other types of engagement so and another blending we might have here is the next type that we're looking at here which is this notion of columns technology where the computer is actually helping us to connect with other people and how it mediates that communication and again we get the word media and mediation are not unrelated to look at what does the computer bring to this when we have this kind of interaction supported communication well some of the things that it certainly does is to enable us to think about time within communications so on the one hand we have synchronous and on the other is asynchronous so when something is synchronous it's happening together you have synchronize your watches you're doing something on some look whereas an asynchronous means that things can happen out of time so you can think of classic examples of communication that enable this is anything from somebody leaving somebody a message on their phone to using email email is the mainstream asynchronous communication device interestingly that when we're in an office environment and we're sending people messages who are right down the hall from us we're not just using that because it's asynchronous because we will just go and talk with them or they'll email us right back so the asynchrony is very very brief almost to the point where it's synchronous communication but the email the fact that we you an email instead of just talking about it what could be going on there that's a nice exercise let me encourage you to think about is why use email if you can just talk to the person what are some of the affordances that the email thing gives you that email digital letter gives you now another question to think about within community computer media communication is this sense of what happens to time when you're online well some folks say it disappears and that's good to think about but also what happens to space so if you have this notion of asynchronous communication not only do you not have to be somewhere in the same time but you don't have to be there at the same place and there are certain advantages and disadvantages to that if we look at some of these examples of online communication tools everything from Twitter Skype is more synchronous communication but as your textbook talks about if you look at something like Skype is that when we're communicating we use certain cues when we're in a synchronous environment from tokens where that could be even a glance where we look at somebody and we wave to them we say it's your turn to come into the conversation we can have awareness of somebody's body language these notions of subtle cues whether when it's sharing the space or talking over it how you wish to engage with somebody all those kinds of cues are really easily there when we're in person with somebody but as soon as we step away from being in person with somebody even when using the screen like we're looking at the Skype call here and supposedly seeing everybody's happy faces when talking online is this is fantastic now all of a sudden all that problem is is solved about missing these cues except for the fact that of course all you see is somebody from the neck up and everybody's in front of you at the same time so there are some potential challenges to being able to create a truly powerful synchronous environment does that mean that the best communication done by computers is actually asynchronous where you don't have to manage that messy whole body human problem and there have been tons of explorations of this recently which the text speaks to a little bit one of my favorite examples not necessarily my favorite apps but a favorite example of how you can reduce communication online is something like yo where all you're doing is finding a friend and you hit the button and it sends the word yo a question about that might be well what's that doing why would that be satisfactory to us and there is some anthropologists who suggest that this kind of communication brief touches of somebody is serves the same function as as picking fleas off monkeys these the social grooming is a way of saying I care about you I'm aware of you it's not necessarily because you're you actually need to take a bath in a monkey or a world but that contact is a socially acceptable form of staying in touch and we are very keen to stay in touch with our own tribe and to find as we do on Facebook are the members of our tribe or to expand our tribal membership the network like crazy and there's some very interesting books I'm gonna add that to here is this notion of what a network is and also what net working is in terms of us as humans and our sense of survival and safety and why different types of communication work so one thing you might want to take a look at if you look at snapchat is compare a snapchat to Facebook to Twitter in order to look at concepts like synchrony and asynchrony and how they're being used and what is important about the way they foreground any aspect of their communication so yo simply says yo and all you can do is say yo back what's the value of that why is that useful similarly snapchat the communications are ephemeral nothing lasts compare that with email what are the differences what are the pros and cons of each of them how do they take advantage of space and one of my recent concepts around here in terms of communication is that a lot of this online communication takes a lot of the skills practice out of how to communicate with people one-to-one communicating with each other in the real environment something that geeks are famous for not being able to do which is just not true it's again it's a skills-based thing is that it's tough we're designed to do it we have to do we have a lot of hormones related to our performance to be in a group everything from the hormones that make us happy and feel satisfied to the ones that make us feel better when we're being hugged oxytocin is a great example of that so quick ease to think about again is recommended is to put a bunch of these different kinds of computer meated communication tools together look at what their interaction is supporting again with yo there's one very restricted interaction does it in a colorful way what is potentially going on there in terms of what communication actually means because communication might mean I want to get information to you versus I'd like to hang on to you and tell you that I'm here or similarly have you tell me that you're around and the tribe is safe that I'm happy and I can do this assignment so those are a few of the things to think about again around the importance of looking at the role of interaction types not just as externalized cognition or as process support but as mediating communication and what the pros and cons are of each so for instance some people say by using GPS we're losing our ability to navigate in space a question might be if we are relying tremendously on these kinds of non-physical atemporal non synchronous ways of communicating are we losing very important skills that were designed to use for our thriving and survival to to be effective human beings and you might ask yourself what's that bag of sugar doing why is she comparing being online a lot to do our communications with sugar how could they possibly go together maybe we'll take a look at that next time in the meanwhile hope that is helpful to you and again this connects with chapter four and if you have questions put them on the wiki I'll look forward to seeing them and if you want to join me over here on Twitter it's at MC pH oo and cool thank you very much for tuning in and I look forward to your thoughts bye now
