 hey guys this is following up on my previous video about the research of Elaine Howard Eklund there's a link to the video on the screen now I'm sure you've heard atheists mentioned the 1998 survey of members of National Academy of Sciences that found 93 percent of respondents identified as having no religion this is a very important talking point for atheists and they use this survey to infer that studying science causes atheism of course that's a logically invalid inference and if you even try to ask them what it is these scientists learn that causes them to be atheist the atheists who cite the study get very cagey because they know they'll incur a burden of proof they can't possibly sustain the research of Elaine Howard Eckland has at every turn undermine the narrative of science leading to atheism a study she conducted late last year the first worldwide survey of the religious views of scientists found that the religious attitudes of scientists vary drastically across cultures I quote more than half of scientists in India Italy Taiwan and Turkey self-identify as religious Eckland said and is striking that approximately twice as many convinced atheists exist in the general population of Hong Kong for example 55% compared with the scientific community in this region 26% the researchers did find that scientists are generally less religious than the given general population however there are exceptions to this 39 percent of scientists in Hong Kong identify as religious compared with 20% of the general population of Hong Kong and 54% of scientists in taiwan identify as religious compared with 44% of the general population of taiwan Eglin noted that such patterns challenge long-standing assumptions about the irreligious character of scientists around the world so here we see that in several countries scientists are actually more religious than the general population this in addition to the fact that many of Western civilization's greatest scientific minds were devoutly religious themselves not only is inferring causation from correlational logical fallacy the correlation between the practice of science and error isn't even reliable again and again the atheist favorite narrative crumbles under critical scrutiny
