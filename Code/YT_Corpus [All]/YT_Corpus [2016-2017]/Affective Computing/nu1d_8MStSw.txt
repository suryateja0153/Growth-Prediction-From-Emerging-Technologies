 it's always difficult to talk after lunch everyday we'll stay up there was a nice coffee making outside actually I I'm very happy to be here because I usually get to talk at medical conferences and they want to know about the science and the papers that we did and all the data collection and since it's sort of up this is a product company and these are product conference I wanted to tell a story there it's a bit different so a story about the products that we do Adam Pataca and also the the company itself I'm a product guy by by training I'm the design and I like products a lot and the company's a bit like a product and sometimes you have different versions you do iterations you have different features you have a lot of bugs especially at the beginning and you try to make it better and at the same time you also make products along alongside that and so I wanted to tell you the story from the perspective of our of our releases in terms of company this is what we do today we do products for monitoring neurological diseases we the product that we have here it's called embrace it's our latest product it's used for monitoring epilepsy which is a very big problem in the neurology area and we're helping to get this patient of a better lifestyle and live better I'll tell you how we started we didn't really start here and this is the first iteration of the company we started in some time in late 2011 and in 2012 tea was this was our team very very small there was me there was Simona Marita the the computer science focused on affective computing which is a science that looks at the physiological signals so the signals from the body and how they can help understand human behavior there was Alberto which is also in the room he also speaks polish by the way so that you don't have to worry about English and is very talented mobile developer then we had a van biomedical engineer and danyele electrical engineer so we we were very complete and we we were very optimistic and the the idea of the company was to monitor emotional states so we wanted to do devices and sensors and software to and and to understand what people were going through in daily life we always said that the company was a data company so they we were only focused on data collection and analytics and that's what we try to do so we did our our first product and actually the product what was this one so he was a mobile phone and collecting the data from a device any device at least that's what what was our idea at the time and we we monitor stress through their sensors and algorithms that we are developed and then you could you could look at it this was for companies for monitoring wellness in the in the workplace so this was like we had a lot of ideas about this was a very cool product we used it ourselves and to do this we needed a device and our ID at the time this was 2012 that other companies would come along and do a much better job so we didn't worry we didn't need to worry about doing sensors and in a lot of fancy software because there were other better companies we just needed to focus on on data collection instead and so we we just developed a crappy prototype and then the crappy prototype was less crap in we it was decent at one point and so there was the almost decent version so there was our idea for the processor we went we went out I mean I went out and I tried to sell it to everybody and it didn't work at all so the the company was basically failing at that point and we were running out of money and and we thought what the hell are we going to do that the product is supercool but nobody seems to want to pay for that the thing is that for developing the algorithms we had to develop software and sensors they were very useful so this was these were our internal tools so we had the device we we could do data collection in real time from the phone I think we were the first ever to use ble with a wearable device with all row data streaming directly to the phone into the cloud it was very cool and I know we had a cloud system that we have built to do the analytics collect the data and and so what happened was that while we were running out of money we it turned out that the work that we had done for ourselves was useful also for other researchers and so there's a lot of people doing research on human behavior many different clinical applications in hospitals universities pharma companies car companies insurance companies and nobody had something like this so there's something like this and the other alternatives were a lot less clunkier and so we we sort of started to sell that just because we didn't have any other option left basically and it actually went very well so we sell basically the device which was the biggest point it was a set of multi sensor device the data quality was very high compared to any other wearable there was and that is available actually and we also provided all the raw data so we didn't do like the closed API we had an open API you could download all the raw data because it was a research tool I mean we had done it for ourselves and so that went very well I mean we started selling it for more than $1,000 per device and we we gained a lot of clients very quickly and of course we we get to see the the next iteration so we we thought okay maybe that data first concept is not like the best we'll try focus on the outdoor and software because that's very important so at the time we were this was like sometimes around late 2013 we're sending a lot of devices and one of our clients was the most famous scientist in the field she was called Rosalind Picard and she's a professor at MIT Media Lab she invented the field of affective computing which is the actually the subject that we had studied ourselves so sort of a sort of a hero in the field and she done a lot of studies one of the most famous was studying kids with autism and so these kids cannot communicate so they they wanted to put sensors on on their bodies to understand their emotional state in real time so the teachers and parents could understand what's going on so during one experiment one of the students during Christmastime borrowed two sensors to bring to bring home to monitor his little brother which I'd autism as well and it turned out that some of the signals were not working very well and when Rosalie looked at the data later on she found out that the kid had a seizure during the monitoring and there was the reason why the sensor seemed to not be working in reality they were working very well they just found out that there was a way using the sensors they would we have that they could be used to detect epileptic seizures in real time which wasn't really possible at the time so more research went on and we decided rose in sorry we'd still sensitive okay we decided to join forces she had done a lot of this working we had all the technology the sensors and the and the software ready so we decided that joining forces we could go much faster and help people that are suffering from from these diseases and by the way appear EPS is one of the world's most common brain diseases and it's rising actually and it it affects 65 million people total and not only that but in terms of social costs it's a very high number as well this is a graph of neurological diseases that cause death and epilepsy is number two but the problem is that is the only one among this ones that affects kid kids disproportionately so most of the other conditions they may affect older people so we we thought that we had like a reason to be working very hard on this problem and by the way most of the researchers believe that the condition that leads to death in epilepsy is mostly preventable so we could have a way maybe to contribute to this problem and this was the team at the time so we're growing a little bit we had we also hired a designer which is also in the room so we we were still very small compared to all we were trying to do but we were very very passionate so we we our new plan was sort of okay we'll get the sensor done very well we let the software down very well and and we also have the help of understanding the what the data means so look sort of the latex on the data that was already available so we started with the first one this was the normal version it wasn't like crappy anymore the device was slightly better this was the research version and we we had many clients we have like over 300 clients now they like old like basically the top hospitals top universities top pharma companies they did a lot of people use this device to do all sorts of different things so we had sort of established a reputation of doing a good job on the data collection although I mean we hadn't planned to at the beginning so this is what the device does in a nutshell I I don't have many graphs like this I promise mmm this is the autonomic nervous system is sort of the autopilot for the body and it has two branches it has the sympathetic and the parasympathetic and so with the sensors that we developed in our research device we we can monitor both branches we have signals that monitor both branches in real life and in real time so it's very useful if you want to conduct research there wasn't really possible before so a lot of what what happens today medicine is based on research that was done in the hospital you cannot study depression in a hospital room of course you have to study it in real life but the only option that you have is to ask people what's going on and you don't have continuous data you don't have reliable data you don't have exactly data sometimes you don't even have data at all so the idea that you can have for the first time objective data on the nervous system in real time and and outside of the official was very interesting for many different applications and this is what we was done for epilepsy specifically it's like a specific example and so this is one of the couple of the sensors that we use and just a one going to the details because it's not the most fun part but we we have a way to detect seizures in real time much better than all the other technologies available just because of the sensors that we have so we we do it's a mix of the sensors and the signal processes that goes behind it and so we sort of arrived to a point that we had good sensors we had a good algorithm and we we were missing something because one of the things that we wanted to always do in the company was to provide a nice experience to people a lot of times in the in medical technology you have these very crappy devices actually very big they did I mean they're just unbearable and just because people are suffering and they have a difficult disease disease most companies think they don't deserve a first-class design quality they just give like this works that's it I mean you don't need any any good experience you don't need any any good design so we we didn't really agree on that and actually was the opposite I mean in my opinion I strongly believe that if someone is suffering he should have better stuff that the ones that are not suffering and for some strange reason is is the other way around so we wanted to design the first medical device that wasn't only working well but was also nice to wear and people could feel proud of it and so we developed this device which is much smaller than the stuff you've seen so far and we call it the embrace we designed it so the kids could wear it and it would be cool we also have the the adult version and we we did a lot of work to take the technology that we are developed and shrink it into a very small form factor so we wanted to go a step further the sort of the adware that we had developed so far so well in sort of the first iteration of the company hardware were just a means to the end anyway it was okay as it was in in the second iteration we really wanted to make a good a like a very high quality product so we did although I mean I'll show you in a bit it was very very painful but we were able to stick some of the same sensors that we had in the in the research device and this is what it looks like it's also a result the device itself so it's not only a medical quality device I'll show you in a minute what what it actually does and but we can also collect raw data so that researchers and physicians can use it for further research so is there only like a closed product like many other that happened to be just evolved proprietary tools but we wanted to share the data and help the community getting more knowledge on decent some other diseases as well so what what it actually does is very simple this is one of the apps that we have it's called the alert app so the device is the seizure is happening on another unusual event and it detects it sends the data to the smartphone in real time and then the smartphone's alerts a mom the doctor a caregiver that is taking care of this person in in real time and the system is very cool with I mean birth to year can tell you all about it it was a hellish work to make it work reliably as they say the last 2% is the them is the most important part and sometimes in in the end details that you need to make a product like this table you have all the drama that you didn't have in the in the previous part the second app that we wanted to make is a it's a little different so we wanted to have a diary for people to understand their daily behavior this is also useful for people they don't have epilepsy but in the case of epilepsy people that have sleep disorders they have a lot of stress they don't do a lot of physical activity can be affected in a ralph a long-term I mean most of us in the room are very healthy so nothing happens to us if we go clubbing for two nights in a row and like go to the University like or to work the next day if someone has epilepsy this can turn into a cluster of seizures and so their system is much more delicate so what we wanted to build is a sort of a forecasting system like for weather so it's a machine learning based system that sees sleep quality stress physical activity and then also sees the unusual events like the seizures so we build a personalized model based only on each patient so that we can try to forecast when this next event is going to happen and of course this get back and gets better over time and at the moment the system is still pretty simple because we we mostly want to track simple events but it will get very sophisticated and this is something that the industry has never has never had so the most researchers in the field they never add this kind of data so it's very exciting to be able to see what happens we with all this data collection the third app which is not an app but it's just a boring graph instead it's probably even cooler because it turns out that being able to control your body also gets to better health we're sort of aware that you can you can use meditation yoga and other activities to calm yourself and it turns out that the brain is very sophisticated and so this is a graph that was done with people that have epilepsy and you lead up biofeedback exercise biofeedback therapy so it means that you see the result from your body so the signals you sort of see you're about in real time on the screen and you learn to control that over time so you can think about it as a breathing exercise for example that you see the the breathing flow and then you learn to relax some people just breathe too fast and you just need to go to go slower so these these experiments were done on people with epilepsy and with this biofeedback therapy and they found that it could reduce seizures by over 50% on average which is staggering considering that it's like you're you're calming your brain in a sense for real and they could measure it so it's very exciting so one of the next exciting steps for like products like this is to be able to build an app they can actually do that daily for four people and instead of having to go like to a very expensive therapist that charge you a lot of money and you have to cue a lot we launched the device on a crowdfunding campaign we wanted to do something different again because usually you know medical devices they charge like two thousand dollars just because they can and they they don't care I mean in the end the product is good and there's not a lot a lot of other opportunities so it's it's okay in an economic sense that you charge a lot of money but we wanted to give the possibility of people that have no financial means to access the new technology so we did a campaign with the Epilepsy Foundation and we decided that for each device that was sold we we would donate one with a kid they couldn't afford it so that at least we will use some of the money from the early adopters and private donors to help people that have lesser financial means anyone very well we sold over 60,000 units and 6000 units sorry and so we were pretty happy about it we are actually starting to deliver it now we we were pretty late as any decent crowdfunding campaign actually a I'll tell you why we were late so this is the product inside it looks very cute and simple from the outside but not so much the same and when you open it up and we had to do a lot of work to make things very very very small and there was quite I mean if you think that it we started the company thinking we do not an agro company we just do like we just do algorithms we when we went pretty far along and but it was very difficult because one of our main points was to be able to give up a small looking device to the people that would be proud to wearing it and but this turned out to be somewhat difficult in in the production phase so we had to do a lot of testing because this is a and it's not like other consumer devices I mean you you need to be reliable all the time it needs to send an important message so it's better if it better be connected to the phone all the time and you better know when things are not working so we have to do a lot of testing so that we could make sure that the product is reliable and we of course we did used some we had the help of some very tough users if you ever need to develop some hardware and want to find good testing opportunities you like go with kids you won't go wrong they they don't give they don't give a damn about like like delicacy it's like expensive or not they just mash it all around so it's pretty pretty effective and we also did a lot of testing to see if it's working in all conditions that they're going to be used in one thing that sort of product people engineers don't think about is how sort of normal people behave and they sometimes behave very differently and they don't even care that much about technology I mean why should they actually I mean it's just the technology should work and get out of the way I mean it shouldn't be looked around for and so this is a the some of the production we made a few iterations of the device and we were I said as I said sort of late for now we are six months late in the delivery is not as bad as other crowdfunding campaigns but it was a very bad nonetheless because of the users that we were selling to we're now selling to early adopters or people that can stay without the latest gadget for another month in probably warning they won't even remember I don't even remember like all the crowdfunding campaigns I've subscribed to that I didn't receive the product for but in our case was a little different and and we were late because we had to spend a lot of time or reliability and testing that you can just cannot just anticipate I mean things happen and you have to sort of take a look and the I guess the most interesting thing they learned from integration standpoint is that it's very cool to say that you do a product end-to-end because we do it I mean we do everything in the company from the sensor design production the software design the testing all the data collection all the data algorithms and it's it's good because you can control all the experience and if something is not working on one side you can you can fixing it on the other but on the other end you cannot blame anyone else when something doesn't work so you the thing is that a product like this is very complex you have a lot of moving parts you have all the parts in the armory of the sensors you have the Bluetooth antenna you have the cloud system the software apps then you have different mobile phones then you have the data collection protocols you have the algorithms that are changing and and you want to provide always the same experience but you want to improve the product so the so the crazy thing is that when you move one part on one side it sometimes breaks things in most of the other parts that you don't even realize and it takes you sometimes to to fix it that sometimes even to realize what was broken so you you have to pay a lot of attention to new things that you're putting in place and now you're controlling the flow and this was a big change from our earlier days as a like normal startup company we still start a company but we're sort of wiser now that you cannot just do things and just push them out I mean sometimes you have to pay attention and do things carefully so we one of the challenges is in this new iteration of the company is to try to make things very fast and very agile in a very gel way at the same time making sure that the product is bulletproof so it's a very very tricky balance and even within the team we have I'd say note fights but of course they're there there's different souls in the convent like the people who are like the startup people just want to go as fast as possible like myself for example and and and the people who actually see the problems and have to fix them and they're sort of the less reckless ones that want the product to be to be as safe as possible even if it takes longer so it's it's a good it's a very good compromise and it's an interesting exercising try to make a product and push it forward and and of course this was much more difficult than anything we had we're built before so now we are we're almost over we are starting to ship the products and we have a great feedback from the users at the very happy we wish that we can make more much faster but of course it takes longer because of the things that they just explained and we're sort of looking at the next iteration of the company which is again as you can see the titles of the iterations are more wishful than actual reality but sort of the platform stage so once you have the we've done a lot of work in the hardware software and algorithms you've built some tools that are useful not only to you but also to other people they're doing something differently so if you're if you're trying to make something useful for people that are suffering you should also open up some of the of that stuff so the this is what the list the latest stage looks like and we're actually growing the team of course actually if you're interested you can take a look we're missing still a lot of people because the things they're getting bit more complicated and we're before so we were trying to hire as much as we can and so what we're looking at now is to help people do things with the things that we've done so we I mean the core of the company still to study human behavior in in daily life and we have a lot of ideas of things that have not been really looked at in the past that we can take a look at and and provide a good experience but of course we can I mean I'm gonna show you some of these these are some of the medical applications that would be of interest for us and I think there are interesting for just because of the populations that are suffering with these diseases so there's autism and sleep disorders anxiety disorders and pain disorders and many other things so these are sort of the medical applications there's also some interesting consumer applications that are fun like gaming for example I mean I cannot tell you too much about it but I mean you can guess from the image I guess and also education and and other things that are more on the consumer side of things and of course the company won't be able like never to do all those all of these things I mean it's it's really good if we can make one pretty well and but at the same time we we want to our philosophy is always to collaborate with people that are doing interesting things and also to open up some of the tools that we build so we we still sell our research device which with a complete open API that people can use and do their own applications we try to support people that are trying to build software on top of all we've done and we're even looking at using our algorithms to support more applications so we're trying to help things go faster we can and I think one of the I mean at least for me which sort of goes circle to where we started we we started a company trying to look at emotional responses and you want behavior in general because it's something that is very poorly understood even today and we sort of derailed along the way on something that it's much more specific and and probably less complicated in a sense I mean then in this application but we well I what I think is something cool to look at for the future is sort of a way to take these signals and understand out which of you is is feeling and being able to share the experience and in a sense the first product that we did sort of distress monitoring the idea was that if in a small office am i doing okay yeah alarm sort of in a small office you you have people that are working together and they influence each other with their behavior in their emotions and and the same goes into the family in a couple actually you can imagine like girlfriends and boyfriends so like very complicated system as well so we one thing that could be possible in in the future with this device probably maybe with a with a follow-on model is be able to share this experience and trying to understand more about ourselves and so that's sort of what we're looking at in the very very far away future knows and but in the meantime we're working on something that is helping people having a better lifestyle today and that's it thanks a lot thank you Matt oh you have any questions sure I have the first one I need to start that I do adore the way you you talk about the medical market and the way how you try to price to set the price for the for the stool and I also read that you are helping the families and people who are not you know struggling with having enough money to buy these devices it's really great but in your presentation you mentioned something about forecasting such an event and isn't like self-fulfilling prophecy like if you know that it's going to happen in a couple of hours how it goes not really sometimes it does some people have auras so they sort of have a feeling that something is gonna happen within 10 seconds what what is difficult and what we're trying to do is and there then your patterns over time so the I think we were the first ones doing we're about the trucks months of data I mean for example on myself I probably have ears data continuous data so you see the trends even in I mean stress or sleep disorders you see the transient seasons different nights over ears when you're growing older what you're eating I mean it's very interesting medicine has never had something like that I mean medicine is organized you you go to the doctor it tracks you like once a year I mean the stress there's a like a stress measure that you go to the doctor like randomly like every three months let's say it doesn't matter that you might have had a car accident before going to the doctor and then your stress might be affected but it just tracks you in that in that point blood pressure is the same I mean oh they'll you do you know what happened before or what is gonna happen after so the idea that you don't have continuous data is it's it's a big problem so it turns out that when you have continuous data sometimes you can see patterns that are impossible to see for any patient any physician any machine today and this is what looks like can happen in some areas for some patients for epilepsy like weather forecasts basically like sure I mean you know if something is gonna happen in ten minutes because you look at the clouds but what if you can know it two days in advance or even several hours you can organize yourself and so this is for in this specific case but it will be possible I think even for for other areas I also notice that you touch the device and it's start to do something ya know because it's actually watch because you can you can touch it and it shows you the the time so it's 4:30 it's like one one light for the hours one for the minutes so that people don't know that you're okay like doing something we are yes be anyway but the first question there and the second few me okay so thank you for your presentation and my my first question is what kind of machine learning algorithms or technologies are you using and the second question is what's the battery life of such devices and what is your approach to the fact that they need to be charged from time to time and and the user has to get rid of this device of his hand yeah unfortunately you have to recharge them that's still probably the the sucker of the technology we our research device last two days in a row with all the raw data collection and the embrace at the moment it's a little over a day it was still in the testing phase but the goal is to have it four or five days I mean you can switch sensors on and off so you can go further but the idea is to have like sort of a week in terms of which sort of a good unit of time it is not slow to recharge so you can actually take it out while you're having a shower for example so you can like recharge it every day a little bit but yeah the goal is to have it for for a week and the machine learning we are I mean if one we can talk later a little bit if you're interested we use at the moment mainly the data sets that we collected in the hospital because it's a I mean it's not like classic machine learning that you can it's it's tricky to be sure that an event is a seizure so you have to do it in the hospital with a gold standard which is a nitrogen flow gram with video and then you basically train the classifier with the data set and then you put it into the wild and it's sort of the tricky part for the machine learning is that people are not sure that they're having a seizure sometimes an event that looks like it could be a seizure is not so people believe it is but the algorithm which is usually more reliable say it's not but all you trust and so the do you trust the parents that are looking at the kid which doesn't look like it's doing well or you trust the algorithm the algorithm is a sensitivity of 96% and the lowest false positive rate in the industry so it's basically the best that's available but still it can miss something so it's sort of tricky to apply like pure like the by-the-book machine learning to to this specific case okay thank you I have many questions I really like your talk and I would like to know apart from the Kickstarter campaign did you have investors coming from outside how long did it take to take the big investment and also since I work in a fabrication laboratory and we do we make the prototypes for wearable companies do you have like specialist in wearables or you have in-house laboratory you send the PCB outside however so on the on the funding side we we had a only a seed round a couple of years after we started a company we had two millions in a seed round from private investors and then we had revenues from the products so the company is basically profitable which is very good for a start-up I guess because there's only one way to buy independence from from investors is that if you don't need the money desperately then in your in a much better position to decide to do things for the long term instead of having to do things for the short term or just to do what investors think it's the right thing to do which is not always the right thing to do and the second the second question was on the on the production we we did the first devices we sort of did it ourselves we did the PCB outside with supply sterno suppliers and we had to change a lot of them because people are I mean to find good quality and suppliers is very difficult so we have to change many suppliers we did 3d printing in the first devices we then did went to sort of a more industrialized system with injection molding for the latest research device and we also do over molding so I mean got quite complicated because of the design you had like wires running inside the plastics so we had to go to a very specialist production we do the production in Korea and which you have basically a few places in the world to do small electronics like mobile grade dimensions and for the embrace having there was like another option that to go either to China but not a big company I mean we cannot command a million million units right away so we had to go to Korea because they they work with smaller companies as well and yeah so now we have like oh like an industrial process we sort of over time we sort of build the expertise and yeah sort of like growing as we go we did our own acceleration like kicks in the bath for mine was pretty useful I material nice talk I already knew the product I'm very interested in our wearables can help specially on anxiety disorders ADHD and and depression one thing that I realized is like this is the I make many investigations in these kind of variables in this kind of technology yours appears to be one of the most reliable and the most interesting one but there is a lot of data talking and what the data gathering it's essential to create insights and so on but when you think about that you are moving into new ground for example curing or tackling problems like anxiety and depression and sleep disorders and so on are you guys thinking about also to cooperate with some sort of therapy as a sort of behavior behavioral software that helps the person to actually change the behavior becoming more aware and not just collecting data which is valuable I'm not saying that is not valuable but like are you guys planning that this next step as well yeah I think I mean for some of these conditions the way I mean what we're useful for is just providing tools and instruments for other other people's work I'll tell you an example in autism for example there's a lot of I mean what one belief about autism is there like one disease like very monolithic that was the sort of the historical perception and now they discovered that basically every kid is different I mean you cannot there's no like one type of autism there's a spectrum that it's very very granular so you cannot expect a therapy to work on one kid and they work the same on the other so the only way that you have is to have professionals hospitals researchers teachers parents they sort of take the tools and understand what the me the right mix is for their for their kid for example so in this way of course we couldn't expect to solve the problem ourselves there would be I mean I mean even being like a reckless therapy but we were not you know that's stupid so we or naive I mean of course the but I mean you can think you can like solve all the problems but most of the times with these complex situations you need to know what you can do best and help other people do their be successful in the work so it's a it's very different for each of the conditions overall you sort of never add the way the the possibility of collecting data continuously and objectively and without people realizing that you're collecting the data because you forget about it so these are sort of a new frontier and but at the same time I mean you need to collect data understand but in many different conditions there's many different ways that you can approach the problem so we're we work with a lot of hospitals a lot of researchers sometimes we provide the hardware we don't do any software sometimes we do the software sometimes we do everything and they just do the therapy at the end and so it's I mean it depends on the application I think our goal is just to help the system get better with the things that we've done so whatever that is I mean we figure it out as we go thank you okay hi Matteo yeah thank you for the talk you kind of answered my question in one of the previous answers but you said about getting the manufacturers and suppliers you mentioned that you have some partners in Korea companies that work with you but I'm more wondering about like Roots the beginning when you were the smaller company how did you approach the prototyping did you have some companies that you work then like to create the hardware to test on it or did you do it on your own using some is there like a path that a small team of developers and hardware guys can go through - yeah I guess we were fairly lucky because the the funding team we could I mean in in a very small scale we could cover although all the parts that we needed so we I mean I doubt digital fabrication is called the Semana done robotics and during during his PhD then you know I was an electrical engineer it was part-time at the time so we sort of sort of knew our way around you know in a very small capacity and you sort of I guess what do you try to do is talk to people did you know are very smart so they wouldn't Rock you might recommend you like stupid stuff or introduce you to useless people although that happens anyway I mean but you sort of like try to do the selection well so you try to like sample contacts and your network it helps if you're aware at least even if you cannot do the job yourself even if you can just study the problem and have an understanding you can have a better interaction with the supplier that doesn't necessarily prevent you from getting screwed big-time many times so that happened was of course as well I think we changed probably seven or eight PCB suppliers over the years we went from the like very clueless to the very professional same with all the other processes you sort of like have to try you stumbled like then you try to come but yeah and one other thing that I sort of our approach has been when there was something complicated that we needed done and we didn't know how to do it we would hire someone very good I mean we try to find some very good and there we try to learn as much as possible and then to internalize the expertise over time and so that we because when you I mean suppliers are very useful and sometimes we I mean you work with great people the thing is that interacting with different companies slows you down so if you can control the system as much as possible you go much faster and so that's sort of the guiding principle sometimes you just have to work with me I mean you cannot do the pcbs yourself last chance for asking a question talk too much yeah then if no thank you much for a great talk then there are sweets from organizer no be careful I'm trying to lose weight take your wrist off I'm training for a triathlon and I am like super sweet - is taking wrist off while eating I probably finish it by tonight good estimate thanks a lot
