 journalism postures and pretends to represent the first draft of history but really it's more like a first draft of a first draft or the first draft it's incredibly immediate and in the now and so on but even living in that sort of immediate in the now realm if you just sort of leap from headline to headline around the world today if you don't understand religion you don't understand what's happening in the world right now and I could list many different examples I think Peters point about Christianity's growth in China for instance is an incredibly interesting somewhat under studied in part because China is still somewhat opaque to us phenomenon that as China goes through a period of potentially of political upheaval or not of people depending on what happens with the ongoing reforms or not reformed and so on the religious changes sort of our part of the substructure basically of whatever is going to happen in China over the next 40 or 50 years and I think Western observers may end up very surprised by the role that religion ends up ends up playing in that country but so that's that's sort of a long-term example but just to stick to the short term you know the we we basically have a world order in the West that is being disrupted right now across multiple fronts by conflicts and trends and patterns that are all intimately connected to religion and you can sort of draw a kind of triangle with one point in Moscow and another point in Germany and another point somewhere in the Middle East it'll be a slightly misshapen triangle agera not miss shapen but not an equilateral triangle and move from point to point just looking at everything from you know obviously the phenomenon of Isis the Islamic state at the heart of the Middle East to the sort of connected to that this ongoing sectarian conflicts in Syria that in turn are spilling over into Western Europe with mass migration patterns that likes which we haven't seen in a long time that are inevitably connected and leading to divisions that are rooted deeply in the differences between Christian and Islamic civilization ready and that even in allegedly secular Europe those differences are felt I think very powerfully and our sort of felt very powerfully in I mean it's it's interesting you can sort of dig you can see what's happening in Europe and sort of the political tension between the European leadership class and actual the actual European public as kind of an example of how Peters secular intelligentsia his secular leadership class doesn't necessarily understand the world that it's trying to govern and doesn't understand that world in ways that may be destructive to its ability to govern it and you know the reality of sort of the secular leadership in Europe right now and its inability to handle mass migration is that it is empowering political parties and political movements in Europe some of which are on the far left and are sort of notionally secular in that sense but many of which are on the far right and see themselves as sort of reviving Europe's Christian character so you have that kind of tangle I'm not sort of coming to a fine point here I'm just trying to sort of sketch out the tangle and then connect it to that tangle you have the sudden attempted re-emergence of mr. Putin's Russia which is of course a form of muscle flexing and power politics and so on that is in that sense secular but it is also connected on multiple fronts to differences between Western Christendom and Orthodox Russian civilization Putin has moved in some ways very skillfully to use a sort of partial revival religion in the former Soviet Union to cement his hold on power the Russian sort of movements towards the Near East and towards are connected to Russia's traditional vision of itself as a protector of fellow Christians against the ottoman turk originally putin's posture and rhetoric around Isis is an extension of that kind of rhetoric and so on and you know in all of these cases you can you can try and sort of abstract the religious element away and you can say well putin's just motivated by power in this sense and you know the young men of Isis just want to rape and pillage and do terrible things and the migrants going to Europe or in search of a better life and the people who are not necessarily being welcoming to the migrants aren't themselves you know the most devout of Christians and so on and I you know all that's true but it's still also true that there is a bright religious thread running through all of these stories and these stories would be very different absent the religious element the fact of the fact of Isis's presence in the Middle East is connected to chaos violent civil war and so on but the nature of Isis is defined by a particular interpretation of Islam right i mean you could imagine a different version of Isis that was barbaric and had some other organizing theory or no theory at all but the reality is to understand what the specific things Isis is doing it helps to understand why they think they are restoring a imaginary but in their minds purified form of Islam and so on so that's you know that that would just be the sort of Foreign Affairs headline version of of the case for the point I was making but then yeah beyond that I think it's just it's simply the case that if you if you step anywhere outside the richest most developed parts of the world you will find intense religious growth Latin America its Pentecostal in evangelical Africa its Islamic and Christian China its Christian South Asia it's all kinds of things so there's that and then even in the West itself the sort of even in the most secularized portions even in Northern Europe these sort of ghostly elements of religion are still there and people still people are not fully even the most secular people are very rarely fully secularized
