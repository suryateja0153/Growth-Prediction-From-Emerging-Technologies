 alright so I'm Gary Dixon I'm currently a visiting professor at Indiana University in the graphic design program while I simultaneously trying to work on toward my PhD in HCI so as Eric said this is a paper that he and I worked on came out of some research that's been conducting over the last couple of years so I want to just start out sort of addressing why why this interest in in methods and why this sort of flight why I'm here so I started a long time ago as a as a designer in the late 80s in fact so being a design practitioner I did that for many years and arguably did it well at some point finished my so I I transitioned slowly then from being a practitioner into being a design educator and that transition is feels like it's still sort of ongoing so from practitioner to educator and hopefully more and more of a researcher as I move forward so I have this deep abiding interest in the methods that designers use I care about how they use them why they use them and all these sorts of things so I like so I begin by talking a little bit about the study that we conducted that resulted in this paper we did sort of snowball sampling to find subjects to interview acquaintances of acquaintances we gathered about 11 subjects that we that were open to being interviewed we just we examined the methods that they developed and then we conducted interviews with those that were open to that and others preferred to respond in writing in form of a survey and then we would follow up with them and we created a sort of an ongoing dialogue where they would send us additional information we would talk with them about their concerns and whatnot and that's how the study proceeded now for the purposes of this paper we had to sort of define what methods are and what a successful method is and pretty much what Collin outlined as a definition of method is the same same definition that we are operating by it's a technique or a framework for thinking that supports the design process of a professional designer as far as success that's a harder one to identify rather than trying to quantify what a good method is to produce a good design we define success as methods that are spread broadly amongst practitioners so a method that is picked up by practitioners and that spreads through sort of the industry so as we did this we thought that we would interview some academics that developed methods and some practitioners that develop methods but what we found as we interviewed them they're really not very many of them identified themselves purely as an academic or as a practitioner but rather they all sort of fell within this continuum between academic and practitioner there were a few that were situated sort of right in the middle with one foot in both worlds and those were actually some of the more interesting conversations that we had so I'm going to just kind of go through some of the conversations that we had with with our with our subjects several of them spoke about sort of the origins of where their four methods come from the trends in methods and again it's Colin talked about the sort of explosion of books and encyclopedias that are out there and this particular subject commented that they felt that all these different methods were actually just founded on a few existing methods that people had taken combined unique ways some of our subjects spoke about why they develop new methods and in so from both ends of the scale in academia and in practice in practice most of the people that were developing methods we're doing so just because they're in the trenches trying to get their work done trying to do good work for their clients on the other hand in academia sometimes methods are developed purely as sort of a touch point for research and then we talked with some of them and some of them to spoke about what a successful method looks like and comments were made like if people are having fun using the methods and they're successful or if it's efficient and effective and enjoyable and then many of them spoke about what the what the methods are sort of made up of what are the elements that that go into creating a new method and and most of them talked about this way that they you know they'll see a method over here and a method over here and they and they see sort of an interesting way of combining different methods or even combining different technologies to use in there in the methods that they develop so the upshot of all of this sort of our contribution is that it seems that a lot of the people that we talked with we're not necessarily carrying out method development as a user centered design process even though most of those people would advocate a user-centered process in design work so we feel that maybe that maybe method design could benefit from adopting more core characteristics from user centered design that is you know rigorous extensive expert testing and doing that testing in actual context of use one of our subjects very aptly stated that method development is a meta design process in other words thinking about developing new methods should be thought of as a method is designed by a designer for designers to design with and just one last note I think the term method development is not maybe the best term i really i rly as I was going through all of this it struck me very very strongly that rather than set using method development if we instead think of same method design that's really what creating a new method is is we're designing something for designers to use that's it okay the time for some question anyone
