 [Music] there were a number of technologies that were shown from sort of bottom to top there were several new front hall technologies front hall is the technology that sort of allows you to separate the antenna from the thing that's sending the signals to the antenna so there were technologies that showed how to do that using Ethernet as opposed to just a solid fiber you can have an Ethernet network between the antenna and the thing driving the antenna new ways of doing the signaling across the actual antennas and that's very interesting to the focus group of course because while we're not involved in the radio side we are involved in the network and how to control the network so anything that puts a network between the antenna and the thing driving the antenna is is very interesting to us [Music] there were demonstrations of the software ization two or three demonstrations in this authorization one which showed a virtualization or containerization technology which is referred to as containers or docker containers which is a very lightweight form of isolating a piece of software where we showed for jeep completely isolated in these very very lightweight software containers we were able to bring up multiple 4G networks one demonstration showing the ability to bring up two new 4G slices and then be able to move the components around we were also able to demonstrate the creation of three different 5g slices within this architecture that had a seer and transport network and a data center so we were able to create and demonstrate ultra-low latency slice complete with you ease test you a big they're big they're not nice little things like this right now ultra low latency ultra high reliability and then the enhanced mobile broadband so the three basic slice types that are being discussed by 3gpp we showed an infrastructure able to actually create those we showed the ability to create non IP technologies within a slice information centric networking that was shown we showed the ability of the software ization system to react to events in the network and to take action and correct them without human intervention we also had an almost the entire afternoon or three sessions during the afternoon talking about next-generation application mechanisms within a slice that are not IP [Music] those are the some of the highlights it was a very exciting day people seemed pretty interested by these demonstrations those are all it all is in a great great week [Music] [Music]
