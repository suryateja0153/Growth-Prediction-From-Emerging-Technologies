 [MUSIC PLAYING] 5G is the future, and it will change the way the world works forever. T-Mobile will build a 5G network to make that future possible. The Un-carrier isn't just planning a localized urban 5G network. We're going nationwide, using airwaves that carry signal farther, so your 5G coverage doesn't stop at the edge of a carrier's 5G hotspot. T-Mobile is planning the first nationwide mobile 5G network. 5G will fuel radical mobile innovation that makes our lives simpler and becomes essential the second we experience it. We're planning for a 5G future that covers you from coast to coast and everywhere in between. So everything and everyone you care about can always be connected from anywhere. T-Mobile is bringing you the future of wireless. We won't stop.
