 if I say data is the next electricity as it going to flow to all your appliances and in your surroundings too 5G is the technology which have the vision of sort that it will address the networks in a way such that those are going to handle enormous applications which influence almost every part of our life same the way electricity does 5G is not about data connectivity only it about to make data a utility which going to lighten up every industry around our household streets vehicles transportation health education and so and so technology is continuously evolving and setting the disruption to rethink and re-imagine the new challenges we are ready today with high-performance computational power giving us freedom of abstraction and we are there with virtualization of our ideas re-imagination of network architecture or data centers some of such achievements have come up with names like cloud computing software defined networking virtual network functions etc these felicitations for abstraction are going to help us to create the infrastructure in a way to address our upcoming or foreseen challenges and that is where the zist of 5G lies for access of such infra we need multiple type of medium and techniques and there is a requirement for a large-scale convergence as the access in terms of access infrastructure radio for wireless access is being advancing with new spectrum and even spectrum re-farming is under way also technology is evolving xgnlab a research and knowledge wing of fundarc communication (www.xgnlab.com) industry has spoken
