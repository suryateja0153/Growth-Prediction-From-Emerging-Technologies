 hi i'm eduardo Polanco and this is a presentation on 5g communication I'm going to walk you through some of the research that's being done different ways that 5g communication is taking into account Wi-Fi and become more involved in indoor communication and then I'll discuss how this is going to impact us in our everyday lives and what the change from 40 to 5 G's going to be technology is constantly changing humanity has never seen a period of faster technology innovation than the past 60 years within this time period we have seen the birth of silicon transistors electronic computers the internet and cellular communication the goal of technology providers is to improve on the latest iteration improvement is measured in terms of how well the demand of consumers are met while still keeping costs within market constraints cellular communication is at the forefront of the modern computing revolution all emerging technologies depend on the wireless communication at some level the current standard for cellular communication is 4G which defines the fourth generation of technologies and devices used to meet that demand every generation of cellular communication technologies build on the accomplishments of the previous generations to deliver the next set of capabilities as 4G technology matures the focus of the telecommunications industry is on conceptualizing the future of wireless communication 5g is the next evolution of wireless communication the next generation of standards will not only regulates cellular communication but also indoor wireless communications such as Wi-Fi at the moment celery regulations are separate from Wi-Fi regulations but 5g intends to change that by considering usage of both outdoor and indoor mobile communications network usage the main challenge for 5g communications will be how to efficiently allow Trillian devices to communicate on the same network providing a better cellular network experience is about improving the system capacity which is best represented by the Shannon theory by analyzing this equation we can come to certain conclusions about how the system capacity see some can be improved upon when we increase certain parameters in the equation we arrive at a higher value for the system capacity increasing coverage has the challenge of how to reach indoor customers the indoor customers can be reached using a separately deployed set of stations that specifically target the needs of indoor customers then the next problem is increasing the channel supported by the network as technology improves we always gain more capability in terms of efficient use of the resources available the channels that can be used are mainly defined by the protocol used to communicate over the network the coverage issue is one of the principal challenges because one of the goals of the 5g evolution is to be smarter about how to reach customers reaching customers and doors doesn't have to be accomplished using the same antenna that reaches customers outdoors then door customers can be reached using a separately deployed set of stations that specifically target the needs of indoor customers the main distinction between indoor and outdoor is that the subscribers that are outside will be more mobile currently base stations that are made to cover vast areas and are limited in terms of how many users they can serve so in order to reach this division between what can be achieved and what needs to be achieved will be crucial for the network architects to provide a means to support more users the station's form the main link between the nodes and the network access to these base stations represent the first link between users and communication the 4G technology has made it possible to keep providing customers connected between towers so this next challenge is one of how to best position stations so that we can have more people connected coverage across large census is how we do things today but coverage of the same number of subscribers within a much smaller area is where 5g is going the debate of how to accomplish this revolves around what best solution is spatial densification can be done with more base stations that cover the same number of clients in a smaller area device-to-device communication or even reducing interference from devices that communication to the base station within a close proximity all of these solutions would be well suited to advance the progress but there isn't a clear winner the only clear concept is that the cost of deployment of this new hardware is considerable so this may not be feasible in the early stages of 5g deployment the coverage issue is one of the principal challenges because one of the goals of the 5g evolution is to be smarter about how to reach customers reaching customers indoors doesn't have to be accomplished using the same antenna that reaches customers outdoors the indoor customer can be reached using a separately deployed set of station that specifically target the needs of indoor customers the main distinction between indoor and outdoor is that the subscribers that are outside will be more mobile currently base stations are made to cover vast areas and are limited in terms of how many users they can serve so in order breach this division between what can be achieved and what needs to be achieved it will be crucial for the network architects to provide the means to support more users the stations formed the main link between nodes and the network access to these base stations represents the first link between users and the communication the 4G technology has made it possible to keep moving customers connected as they move between towers so this next challenge is one of how to best position stations so that we can have more people connected coverage across large distances is how we do things today by covering the same number of subscribers drivers within a smaller area is worth 5g is going the debate of how to accomplish this revolves around how to best accomplish this spatial densification can be done with the base although the hold devices already have a set number of channels this next generation presents the opportunity to come up with new improved method ologies in order to best serve subscribers most of the research does not focus on entirely reinventing the fundamental concepts of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing or OFDM multiple-input multiple-output our MIMO or system architecture evolution SAE instead the 5g research aims to build upon these technologies in order to push it to the limit massive MIMO lets more users connect to a network while providing a better experience currently massive user MIMO is deployed on Wi-Fi networks in order to accomplish better usability much of the research being conducted centers around millimeter wave communication where the goal is for new technology to achieve data connections at higher frequencies 5g will allow us to have pervasive community computing and use devices everywhere we go by having this capability the deployment of the Internet of Things will be assured the massive list of devices that can come online will have the means to connect and be expected to stay connected reliably 5g will not only let us be connected but it'll also allow it to be seamless current 4G allows us to enjoy all the adequate amount of bandwidth but for how long our society is forever connected to the ability to use mobile devices anywhere anytime for any data the spatial densification solution is to make use of macro cells and femtocells to provide differing levels of coverage this is in line with considering how to provide coverage to indoor subscribers in addition to mobile outdoor subscribers 5g will give us a means to redefine how we use the spectrum massive MIMO is the technology that is described as being useful for allowing many connected devices to connect to a network simultaneously by establishing better ways to deliver communication that does not consume much energy the ability to output data is improved when it takes less power to the lever data we can use the same power levels of today to deliver tomorrow's higher amounts of data and this is a great improvement although this doesn't describe an overall reduction it does describe maintaining levels in the face of massive growth which is achievement we are not quickly outgrowing our telecommunications network we cannot wait until we need to expand our network capabilities before making much needed improvements we know how to get there but we still have some work to get it done the theory has been laid out by the competing technologies have been resolved before it becomes clear what the best approach will be the future of our society relies on a successful deployment of 5g standard that will bring us a means to connect to the world at the right level of efficiency Hey I just walked you through some of the current things being worked on on 5g some of the challenges some of the things that are currently under development and things that are that they're trying to accomplish like the indoor communication in order to reach more customers in order to be able to keep people connected without losing them without having to have people on a different Wi-Fi network so that way they can always be connected to the same 5g network and how we're going to deal with having 7 trillion people connect it all together
