 okay when you're working with it could be they should just give us a sec so trying to take the bill that he could be run by building and technology on the offices of my shows enterprise work again strain of equities that is how an international web everywhere standard for exhaust working with device thank you industry at Ella system now trying to forget a complete rotation thanks together five keys yeah it's just as my other oh gee oh yeah it is but yes in regulating luck she needs laughter I application by the jetta sedan that database right so there were extremely high national education of the nature of the I'd like you've gotta hide em purcell virtual reality camera up to their space extremely high bandwidth if you're trying to buy 17 G's back very like you asked for mostly writing materials from cataract i began my your floral foam animations for the day the shield is away from work is so the lyrics is sharp very very hard reading process the rocky or in a factory dark so these actually like ignoring there were more dance partner Vanessa as much as the technology so those specific examples that yeah couldn't be achieved on yeah but you can go the long way the one now is the many Wilson level three did little to get ready to work it'll be 20 the same reason I Christina biggest if you are an operator they're building LC later now putting human by 20 megahertz to point 1 0 to 2 2011 22 why because it's just everything else of school it's got everything else is put on life than others yeah very very high frequency by da for 39 PP big operators that means you can find when you get there in a pipeline back 20 megahertz of spectrum you to get my unmarked as a band with this sense of challenge so you can get a very nice things only solid xican yeah sounds like you've got bit of a headache come out a bit device g into an area in stronger that isn't about in years wouldn't it make more sense to sue aminos easier said to sell would we handle sensitive scrappy to us reservist cloud still only come to Jesus wonderful years out of the Banshee is very special design copy Victor's you know our she's ready for the night and worked well to hear like the audience and well yeah would you agree to come here I'm folks to use that vibrate switch here you can reuse a special issue it's the London Irish Guards officiated at 23 teen n equals we need to wait oh my god anyone she has another school he leads it on together to get one gigabit per second Georgie need to update celebrant carriers stuck together things that you have to radio you can have one spurred by rather than a sinister technology yeah he said you got a base station already money more so trying to type 5 genius companies we launched on Sunday right with a bikie first 5g enter to any network solution so is the radio it's also the antennas animated way yeah nasty be providing blessing modification and fire chicken we're talking about line and for Nestle sure transport abilities though microwave yeah I p.m. pls revisa frosh loves the beautiful technology with itself devices in place make it on time deepankar going as we're talking pavia people the edge go in my earlier placed on time vice- enjoy a hard restart come on I Medusa in a free country now we eat BB except yes we're going to BK quality management silicone spatula transaction should they were mostly able to answer private coverage which is kind of adding some mobility capability ittf meantime we're all working on the proper 3gpp Winter Olympics next year or so you visit devices will be out a subset of three commercial devices so so so it's more testing technology in an area where there's lots of people using data yes so that you learn from the feelings their games and feed that into the device because you have you know when you build a device you start off with a prototype which is a miniaturised and then you convert from a large-scale prototype to an FPGA scale prototype which you see the form factor you go back to a lasik preyed upon okay but to have the async place like lead time to build a dress by which time you need a fairly tight specification and the volume to justify leave running into the process the industry always goes next generation ever it's not looking like looks like that and then looks like the proper thing okay and this is kind of helping the industry have a head start on the standards body specification understands that work where we are we're just trying to get a head start I tries to the same it's about the use cases so it's not give help working to develop the overall standard or view is 5g first so that's that's not one you've necessary just developed on two areas no no no no that the whole industry is working together is in party for 3 complete towards that specification than the published time scales basically mean that a specification you can use for the first standardized version 20 19 or 20 20 ok and then dice roll at the odd we're only in 2017 what do we do for two years we're going to use a an early mark immersion subsets of the standards and then broken as necessarily because when 4G was being rolled out of there was a level competition was in there between a few competing standards gorgey was the first one that the industry gather right there is a world specification for 4G there are two flavors in energy and actually both the users I never supported in our country's what has typically happened is the FD very German chose this priority in most markets particular the TV version welcome at it with their 3g implementation td-scdma Chinese fabulous reach DC a stimulus splint of China on the rest of the world with 50 bullets different portions of spectrum have different carats doing me see the spectrum digital dividend TV's bookshelf that works better the team first thing that happened was trying to 1 by C tonight d a slightly different version have you assess the impact you can even demonstrate the impact it has on driving okay and in simple 5g for driverless cars d we can show you a nice example where you have a car is connected by 4G and basically you can't control it remotely as a later you you think having a virtual reality camera Leela what as far as you can you this kind of was forging into assisted drive it was five team and then there were many examples with help with five key surgery we could give you what the if you just able we'll find you and bring huge step change ok so we're looking at cars which should connect into tell you when the fuel level is lower than he deserved it all the tires as one or then you go to the next level which is being able to platoon cars the food trucks together because they can communicate with each other this one can control this one right behind that one right the trials that were doing when you want a car that doesn't need a driver as in his controls by a control center promote me which is controlling not only your car but all the other cars around it ok I think I think that's it and this isn't any alc on out I think the only thing that I would add is that 5g you need to think of it not as a replacement for gene like 4g at the replacement of 3g concur as a long-term compliment time together 5g will be built initially in violence cases could be covering a factory environment working with autonomous vehicles in a nice to provide services pues que si and those islands I likely to be in cities the city because he looked very who would share the bad words side of that and the pathology we'll take you to several bigger bags of speed and take the layton sleep down far enough you can take your car being connected close since it provides service continuity outside the other reason for that question is very high spectrum recon Aunt Eller anybody's gonna breach of 2 300 meters and obviously though language we will see before and 5t by default in either these cases been progressing bill taps me on my place so I mean when the stand is always when they then they rolled out in passer with tend to focus on high density areas for us it's the easiest way to I mean when you say that it doesn't have great reach in rural areas will be more difficult than 4g to roll out 5g across 5g at the lower spectrum right okay okay got an inside to determine if you can get more data down the same spectrum with 5g you come with Georgie so it's more efficient adjusted by placing in the second place cities were suddenly then you could use they say a 5g point-to-point connection instead of putting a fiber hygiene using the network for the short distance reach 20 or 30 within the 200 meter radius circle govandi economics in the business case in the user case as well as the technology
