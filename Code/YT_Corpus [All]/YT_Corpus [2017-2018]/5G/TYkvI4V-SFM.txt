 [Music] Erikson's a demonstrable crackovia technology again Paris Paris post test out with focus novel technology central research and development crackovia for a special poster so today I'm going to show the first 5g demo in Poland and what that means is to show you what Eric's is capable of now and our ambitions are for the future in this demo we're showing how we can translate a localized requirement to a remote requirement using edge computing the reason why we can do that is 5g gives you that capability 5-t gives you that low latency it gives you that high bandwidth and it gives you that edge computing in network slicing aspect in this particular demo we're using 28 gigahertz and 800 megawatts megahertz worth of bandwidth that allows to get through puts up to six gigabits per second six gigabits per second gives you the high quality video it also gives you that high quality audio as well to make the whole experience a lot more immersive [Music] the edge computing is the most interesting aspect of is it takes all the intelligent and all the processing away from a localized requirement to the remote location and therefore your experience can be replicated owning the home where the shopping mile on the train in parks and field any way that you want and therefore your whole experience with 5g would be different will be personalized and it'll be available where you want it when you want it how you want it I'm very much looking forward to seeing what five you can provide there's a lot of things that we are doing already in 5g not only linked to gaming probably to performing arts to medicine transport manufacturing the end of lip listless we can provide a lot it's important that we have the collaboration is important we challenge what we're doing today and I think 5g will be so much different ornithology is for them [Music] you
