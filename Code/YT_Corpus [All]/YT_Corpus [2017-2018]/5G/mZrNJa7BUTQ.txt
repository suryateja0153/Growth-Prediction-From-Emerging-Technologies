 [Music] okay my name is Brian Zahn Stecker and my company's power rocks and due to the I guess massive nature of the topic and the limited nature at the time I think I want to give a couple disclaimers here first of all right actually this kind of reminds me my my wife and I eloped and and we we did our own vows and without going into detail on that one won't involved in mine one of them started with I had a nightmare the other day and I won't finish that story I can talked about that offline but it kind of reminds me of this too because this is such a big topic you probably want to get a lot of detail on this so I can tell you ahead of time you will be severely disappointed by this presentation so now that we got that out of the way so what we're talking about and I'm a power guy just to preface this all so I come from the server power world so I am NOT a long time cellular network person actually this is something I got into in the last year because of my interest in 5g because of the major power implications so keep in mind as I'm going through this there will be an emphasis all the time on the power implications and this is also an excerpt for this short talk today as an excerpt from a you know essentially a 1/2 day three hour workshop I put together on this that still is essentially an intro to this topic so for that reason a couple things are mostly in the slides also if you download them later to look over in detail but a couple things I'm going to glance over pretty quick just kind of make a quick point but I'm not going to dig into them to try and keep up with it so keep talking about time I'm yak and I'm not even into it so today let's say will be a very brief introduction of 5g for the most part if you don't know what things like 5g Sdn and NFV are you probably wouldn't be sitting here so again I will not be spending much time on that ditto and then of course the same thing with that we'll look at kind of a general characteristics of a telco datacenter today and then try and focus on which aspects will be most impacted in this speakers opinion by the the movement to to the well I say the promise of what 5g will be since what it actually will be is still a couple years out at least but but the takeaway here is it really is changing the landscape and again as I'm biased from a power perspective but changing something from a power perspective from both the the kind of what I call the power value chain from power plant to load as well as things like all the way down to you know distributed power on board power conversion has a you know a major impact to everything from hardware to software to application and whatnot so we said it'll be a power emphasis hopefully some conclusions and perhaps some time to discuss something so very quickly we just need to know why you know in terms of market motivation I just want to clue into a couple little things that are to me what will really you know signify the major shifts that will be associated with 5g so one key thing is just you know where the areas of growth right are typically in the regions that are not the the densest cities it's not it's not all there's a lot of talk about a accounting for densification but but really the major projections for growth right are in the areas where they don't already have existing networks we're living by your phone is is the only way you're connected to the world so things like India and sub-saharan Africa and these markets are actually projected to have the most growth and benefit the most from something like 5g and by the way guys just you know regardless of how the the summit makes the slides available there's I've everything here in every image everything is referenced in the back so there's nothing you can't get afterwards so just so you know so um what again this is just kind of realized that the point and the direction that that it's going in and in the regions right that we already have this type of high-speed penetration and projected in especially in North America and Western Europe so it's these other regions that are actually right for the most growth and therefore are going to have the you know I would say require the most foresight and thought into implementing these these newer architectures so what is 5g come from you don't want to spend too much time less my opinion it's kind of a perfect storm thing that and this is one of those stupid graphic things that you know you spend way more time on than you should so because of that I have to grow to ously take advantage of it so you know III saw it as like a perfect storm of things of technologies and opportunities and and markets so essentially you know you have your your Sdn your NFV your you know a software-defined virtualized everything certainly in the RF area with you know very high bandwidth centimeter millimeter-wave band stuff specific antenna beam forming you know slicing massive MIMO all these really cool things that we don't really have time to get into and and especially the RF stuff is a little bit out of the context of this discussion but certainly as everyone knows you know there's ever-growing pressure and demand driven by the consumer market for you know cheaper faster data which which leads to the you know all the way back down to the spectral the energy efficiency on that you know it not only has to be technically feasible but it obviously has to be financially viable and then the hot spot density is another really interesting aspect that I think drives a lot of the major paradigm shifts that will have to that are required to deliver on the promise of 5g so and and to me intelligent power management is always the key to everything so this is a common theme you'll hear me mention a couple times that you know just bumping up efficiency in power converter chin does not yield as nearly as much benefit as using your your watch in a smarter way and therefore you know I say enhanced power utilization so and of course there's the Q grafica it rains everything was worth it okay so for 5g again I'm not going to spend much time on this I think everyone's seen all this stuff in one form or another you know the high-level benefits right low latency high bandwidth everyone billion trillion devices will be connected and of course everyone has their own definition of this one thing just just to be clear on is you know especially the telco operators will tell you they have 5g what their plan is for it just just to bring a little reality to it right this as an example this one is I think this is Nokia's and you know they call it four and a half four point nine G the main point is you know it the actual standard isn't coming out to the you know 2019 2020 timeframe so that's what there's a lot of things that may be billed as 5g like or what I commonly refer to is the promise of 5g but actual 5g in terms of the standard isn't going to be there till this timeframe so things like you know even South Korea talking about the 2018 Winter Olympics Japan has saying they're going to have for their 2020 Summer Olympics you know as you you all likely know it you know even from just the time that the standard comes out then there's time to deploy this in a production manner so you know until that time frame between now and then everything is 5g ish or less while you hear things like 4.5 or 4.9 but just just to be clear just to like I said bring a little reality to the difference between you know the marketing term for that and the actual network is in time frame should be something you're aware of so what is 5g well really simply there it is right I think it speaks for itself and there's there's lots of different graphics like this but I mean the point is is there's a change in the traditional cell network today that has a you know a core network and a core telco data center you know some major backhaul in in front hall which goes to macro cell towers primarily that service a many users and in a larger area and and as and especially as Jeff segue to and in a great way thank you Jeff um and and also actual there's pretty good talk from from Nokia yesterday that really highlighted the idea of you know we're coming from this global cloud and we're coming down these levels like to talk about the fog is coming down a level I talked the other day where they claimed to bring you down into the mist so you know whatever even if you're now taking down into the the water vapor or whatever the point is you keep getting into a lower-level granular that gets you straight to the edge which eventually basically brings you to this or any other device like it so that that's why things like you know and I'll talk about this a little more in future slides here but things like you know it's not just it's not just something that things like mobile edge computing to serve these devices at the edge at the bandwidth and latency requirements it's an absolute necessity that that a lot of this processing is done at the edge and never find its way on to the core network and and for me that's an incredible opportunity and power utilization optimization so a really fundamental key characteristic of this 5g networks the idea of these hetnet right these heterogeneous networks where now it's not like all these operators have their own infrastructures and and you know services plugins whatever you want to call them is that now everyone has to play together nice in the sandbox that that a user a 5g user that's moving from small tower to small tower or small base station this male station that only supports a very you know especially it's a high bandwidth you know very high frequency type of stuff you know supports a very small limited range so they have to you know be able to pass them off from one or the other and that's why um you know whether it's densification which is represented by this darker color or even some of the you know non denser areas where they're a little more spread out a little more remote the point is there's huge going to be huge growth in small cells so a lot of this is shifting and and from macro cells to all these smaller cells and what that means is if the traffic you're shifting to it the the hall and the connection of the network is shifting to and therefore the power is also shifting in that direction so one theme that comes out of OCP and you're probably you know getting the point of what the hell does this have to do with OCP Brian mentioned it till now so certainly a theme that that behooves 5gm limitations very well is the idea of disaggregation right because that enables you to you know densify the the individual constituents of a system and then optimize them you know for the compute the memory of something is more for optimized for you know core Network routing versus edge buffering for instance and and of course the the other beauty of that is the ability to commoditize the solution and kind of level the playing field or in my my callous view as a power and hardware guys say really the idea is to mitigate Hardware into obscurity really and even software to some degree everything's open so that the app the user experience is the real product that people focus on so mobile edge computing even want to rehash just too much because you've heard a lot about it you'll hear a lot more is is certainly a a you know a large enabling portion especially things that you know a lot of statistics you see talking about projections on you know overall internet traffic whether it's today and the growth path is centered around streaming so you know doing things like having a enabling buffering at the edge of commonly things allows for a you know a much simpler faster experience for the user but it's more in the network itself because you know today we spend most of our power actually passing data around as opposed to say processing it or storing it what not so the more that's done to mitigate the movement of data the much greater overall efficiency from a power perspective that you're going to see Network wide right just to just on top of my head I mean today today a cell network is in something like I know sixty seventy percent of all the power consumed an entire network is in the base stations right and and that's mostly driven by the PA power the RFP a and that will dominate you know anywhere from seventy to ninety percent of the base stations power so focus on reducing and optimizing that yields the most benefit to the entire network power utilization and like I said there's a lot neater things in the RF area for reducing power consumption and optimizing that user experience but it's kind of outside today's scope so we're not going to really have time to get into that talk to me offline more about that also in the interest of time I'm going to really breathe over the Sdn NFV stuff they said I like this graphic write this it's pretty simple I think it's self-explanatory but but essentially you know we we know what virtualized software-defined solutions are right we take our simply we take our hardware we we pull it virtually and we slice it up as need be to optimize for our application same thing for whether we're talking about in the data center typically one of the Sdn context or for network functionality which is the the nfe portion ditto so for 5g you know is that nice is it is it a feature ad or as an app is it a necessity and in my opinion is an absolute necessity because if you want to you know not only handle the amount of users and the handoff between networks and then even to go a step further like Jeff was talking about things like you know network slicing in radio slicing and kind of network as a service it's going to require software control while monitoring and control on both a you know kind of localized and Network level working cohesively to to deliver that so again getting back to the the heterogeneous network theme of you know sharing from base station to base station and quickly handing off and still maintaining the bandwidth and latency specs are absolutely going to require the need of you know software and virtualized controlled solutions and particularly can see I like this graph because it kind of you know it says okay now we're opening up lots of doors for not just getting straight to the the Yui on the edge whether that's you know line-of-sight or Wi-Fi or even backhaul in front hall that can be Wireless or wired you know kind of explains that you want to have all your options and be able to be adaptive on-the-fly to what makes most sense based on the load the user profile and everything else so getting to the meat of it now the telco data center you know what really differentiates just from a typical data center well certainly you know DC distribution has been around for you know as long as there's been telco data centers actually on the on the show floor you know especially with my nose a talk about you know when Google came in last year and brought in the 48 volt rack concept and I see things now that you know talk about 48 volts like it's the newest greatest thing up you know a new revolutionary thing to come to data center power and it makes me chuckle a little because it's actually the the most legacy power distribution I think there is in in the datacenter world and that's of course I'm time to go into things like HVDC you know 380 volt or any number of other higher voltage DC standard implementations and all that and certainly there can be a level of robustness like the NEB standard that you know require a higher level of ruggedized hardware than your typical commodity data center solution so and and and as a power guy so my real emphasis in interest is where these watch being consumed and how can we assume them more intelligently so that's that concept again intelligent power management which we'll talk a little more and really this thing right here I think is that is the key to understanding the whole major difference in what I'm calling a paradigm shift I'm moving to 5g because you may say well 4G and LTE today does you know already implement things like Sdn and NFV and even some of the the more advanced RF techniques like beamforming and whatnot but but what what's really going to change is moving from these large macro base stations to requiring so many of these small cells right whether you call it macro cell nano cell I even in my research I even saw some stuff about an a doe cell right and so the point is is that each of these small cells now essentially needs to be its own telco datacenter right so even a small M down the smallest you know a basically a base station that that serves you know may only serve a a 10 meter diameter um but it can provide high speed data and has a nice beamforming array and whatnot still has to keep all that keeping with the the spirit of mobile edge computing it is going to have to you know try and keep as much of that as edge as possible and there's kind of a simple example given a second but that that's what's really going to drive a paradigm shift in power as well because you know you have a network today where you have a lot of core networking you have these macro base stations that you know may be on the order of you know one of the two kilowatts and now you're shifting that to a you know a heterogeneous network of many small cells that may be down to you know ends of watts or even less and so the question that you know that the simple question I would get on this is well what's more efficient right and say it's not that it's not really that easy to say because there's a whole lot of knobs involved here and you know if I said in an area where there's two macro cells serving you know a few hundred people versus 50 you know femtocells serving the same amount of people you know which is more power efficient you know small cells I have the ability to turn them on and off more dynamically which is ultimately the the most efficient thing is I'd like to say is something that's off but and there's you know you mitigate some of the hall which which consumes a lot of power as we discussed before so it's a multi-faceted issue it's more difficult to to assess even if there's incremental improvements in just the hardware itself along the way so um and again that it telco datacenter I'm not going to be labor you with you know the basics of what make up the data center here you know I mean you know that the main constituents that on the internal side the win the the you know the the long-haul connection and then the kind of the edge data center and these lines are graying but so we're 5g comes in and running a time here like said 4G LTE has already brought a lot of these characteristics but now to really kind of go all-in on these small cells is where it becomes most interesting in terms of the opportunity for improvement and optimization so you know I'm even waiting for something like you know small cell virtualization where we're essentially you know you take a group of these small cells or base stations and and virtualize that is they you know I mean Justin Alex we might call it a veer and today and you have to excuse my ignorance in this area like said cell network architectures are not my main area of expertise but the takeaway message is everything gets you no more virtualized and cut up at the that that's the going theme and so let's see we talked about mobile edge computing shifting utilization and buffering at the edge so how does this play into power this is the certainly the mobile edge confusion computing as the the absolute largest opportunity to save power for base station caching you know you when these things are smaller too you can have more specialized for specific tests so whether something's for video buffering or if it's just for you know buffering of control for the local heterogeneous network or optimization or routing and and I kind of think from a power perspective it's kind of a brilliant strategy of tricking the customer into paying the power bill you know anyone who runs involved in a data center knows that especially the more you know hyper scale and commoditize it is that the the power bill right certainly typically dominates the OP X and and to to a lot of degrees with commodity hardware that actually dominates the total TCO right even dwarfing the initial cost of the hardware itself so you know imagine that with mobile edge computing sounds great delivers on the the specs the promise of 5g the user is happy but do they realize now that with all the processing and everything that's done at the edge really all that compute and stuff that used to be done in that core data center is now being done on their phone so who's paying for the watts to to run the the processing and and the memory and the transport of all that well so in a way you've kind of tricked the consumer into footing some of the power bill that never has to make its way to your data center so interesting perspective and and I like to kind of I think sum it all up with the the case study what I call is grandma okay and this is more of a thought experiment and what it means to be you know power efficient now you know you you you have a grandma she's in her house you're not there she still lives on her own you wonder how she's doing you've taken advantage of every thing that you know the IOT devices and wearables and trackers and everything gives you and she's all wired up her house is wired up and you can track all of her health metrics or movements and everything so that you know you can feel confident is grandma okay when I'm not around okay so that's the fundamental question right now I wake up this morning I want to know grandma's okay now with all these devices and sensors and processing you know there's tons of data that can be generated and and processed and and pass to the cloud or whatever but fundamentally I just want to know is she okay right and so it's something much simpler right if everything is processed in her house by her devices and and and somewhere to the in there there's a consensus that can just report outwardly to me the only thing that has to be transmitted is a single bit right it can be as simple as that I mean I'm oversimplifying don't hit me on packet headers and you know things like that but but the point is if all I really want to know if she's okay or not you know I don't need to pass all that data up and process it and share it and store it forever if it's not fundamental to what I'm trying to accomplish so another interesting thing about all these moving migrating to many more smaller cells is that it actually gives a lot of energy independence it certainly enables the ability to use micro grids and other sources of power so you know if you don't require as much power to run your network or connect to the larger part of the network then that that kind of frees your ability on on the source of power you know redundancy in solutions for fault tolerance and by lowering your overall power consumption you know you also reduce things like you know like storage and holdup and other things that lead to redundancy cost and power waste and a separate area of interest in mind that I think marries nicely with this topic is energy harvesting once you get these move to these tiny cells that work up such low power requirements compared to the the the legacy macro towers and whatnot they actually become candidates but for other energy harvesting solutions that are not just you know large-scale PV systems and all that so speeding up here let's see we talked about disaggregation already and the ability to kind of bring a steady state like performance profile to you know fairly predictable dynamic loads which which went in when you're not using something you can put it to sleep so what I'm getting at is for the first time ever announcing right now is the introduction of the OCP telcos self small cell deployment and it's a time and before I see that the worried look on some of the OCP community leads faces so this is something I just made up it doesn't exist so don't get so excited but but the point is is if there's going to be this many cells and we want to keep in the nature of the the OCP spirit to standardize monetize something that are small and supposed to be completely ubiquitous and everywhere it seems like that would be a pretty interesting specification for you know something that operated in a OCP piece of you know complete system that I could hold in my hand and deploy so with that like I said there's a lot of agreement on what 5u should be but keep clear that it still has not come to fruition and we don't know what it really is for at least a couple more years the base station is becoming the data center that's the key takeaway the major paradigm shift here which therefore relates to power so intelligent power management also becomes really key to enabling those 5g networks by the ability to wisely control these things turn them off and and simply mitigate the movement of data where we don't need it so it also said virtualized software-defined everything is integral to this and as I keep tying things to power as I'm biased to I implore all of you who are involved in actually architecting these networks to keep that in mind from the power perspective so that you're architecting that well proactively ahead of time and not seeing it as a you know an issue you have to deal with once you have a deployed solution which is the common plight of any power engineers they'll tell you so with that thank you very much appreciate your attention and I don't know if we have any time for questions one or two otherwise feel free to come and talk to me and be around all day today thank you very much questions sir the monarchy update though I guess this box cost a lot of money well and so and again just to be clear I am NOT someone who architects these things are I I you know I see it as something that that is enabling and and required to meet some of the promise specs so for instance you know the handoff of you know of an active user and I'm still maintaining there in a millisecond or so latency going between heterogeneous cells and networks it is recording a software-defined virtualized function as I understand it I mean we said you you architect and tell me but all what my input comes in is seeing that it if this is the type of architecture and solutions that's implemented I can surely see the opportunity to impact power utilization like like for instance you know having a small cell that you can turn on and off in a matter of milliseconds and save that you know that that huge piece of the power pie from from the PA which is the the largest piece of the pie and the whole network versus a macro cell tower that you know may take minutes or hours or essentially is not turned off for that reason is you know is facilitated by Sdn and NFV and therefore leads to an opportunity for major savings and power utilization to answer your question yeah yeah ok we'll talk more later what else alright thank you very much again [Music]
