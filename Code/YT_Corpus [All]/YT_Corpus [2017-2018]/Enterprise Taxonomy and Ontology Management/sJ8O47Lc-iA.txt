 and I decapitated slightly while our last speaker still uses the the last model of the Mayflower iPhone our next speaker is abreast of the latest technologies and on into that but the experience that goes with the frantic change of technologies he's part of the IT Crowd that is taking over this Congress very rapidly and I'm glad because I'm part of it too his name is Christopher Marcum and he's going to talk to us about apply temperance a baseline study of deterministic factors of digital fluency first I'd like to say thank you dr. Redpath for inviting me here this is my first time here and I appreciate the casual I have to wear a suit every day and so it's nice to get back into jeans and and unbutton the shirt so before I dive right into the paper and into the research three things one I'll give you a little bit of background about me my vocation a little bit of testimony and then and then to the history of my institution the organizational structure and culture and then three the research methodology so I'll actually start reversed the research methodology is a qualitative ontology an interpretivist epistemology via case study methodology and so I thought that that was most appropriate for the study of this research because it focuses primarily on virtue and human action and how virtue can be supplied to human action in an organizational setting the history and this would be to going in Reverse remember the history of the organization as well as the structure and the culture SUNY Empire State College for those you that are from New York SUNY stands for the State University System of New York so we're public but SUNY Empire State College was founded in 1971 by Ernest Boyer Ernest Boyer I'm not a New Yorker I don't know much about him but I know that he was a high-powered politician he had done a lot of good work in his time and decided to partner with some constituencies to found a institution that specialized in the reverse of economies of scale individualized learning teaching and learning mentorship and the pedagogy and andragogy discipline so we still have that in our institutional structure and culture we still have a lot of one-on-one mentorship but the institution has grown we've grown rapidly we're the only institution in the SUNY system among 64 institutions that actually operates across the entire state of New York and internationally we have 35 locations across the state of New York seven international and 20,000 students roughly and about a third of those are either full-time or partially online and so that makes for a very diverse culture both administrators faculty and students our culture is very diverse which feeds into the the IOT changes in digital fluency and digital literacy that I'm disseminating out here today so you know a student a faculty or a staff member in Buffalo New York could have very different technology administrative or organizational requirements than a student faculty or staff in Long Island Staten Island one of the bureau's Hudson Valley or upstate New York all the way up to Plattsburgh I'm the administrative offices are based on a Saratoga Springs that's where I live and work and I was recruited to the institution basically to hit the ground running because the institution was in desperate need of change for very combinatorial reasons and so I was part of that change a change agent if you will that has seems to be my brand and most of the institutions in my career I'm on my sixth strategic plan in my career yeah authentic strategic plan I've either written it myself or executed upon it or reported out on it or all three and so I'm very very proud to have been blessed with with that and so i I've been an executive leadership since I was very young I started off in the military now number one I started off in the military age 17 I joined as a technical engineer so it was a quasi civil and technology engineer could you pass this up and I worked my way up to the officers ranks and then I spent about seven years and in banking and finance in working and executive leadership there achieved my first vice presidency at age 23 and then I got in the Higher Education I pursued degrees and Technology Business and Economics and I started in the classroom as an adjunct professor and and then moved my moved into a a Dean position I was a Dean of faculty as well as the chair of an IT division and then I spent some time at a Military College as a Dean of online learning and actually was the chief leader behind the startup of their first ever online program online learning programs had building structural design the technologies and the business processes associated with as well as director of educational technologies and from there I moved into Southern Polytechnic State University which was a very guchi Polytechnic students would hack you they would hack our systems it was that kind of an institution so that was a lot of fun though and I oversaw from an IT standpoint the merger acquisition in the public sector terms the consolidation between it and a public another public pure institution and then from there I went down to the largest landmass for a particular city in the country Jacksonville Florida most people don't know that it's huge for a city it's the largest landmass in the United States and oversaw a huge wide area network their wide area network is technology term for an operation of IT and with CIO their chief information officer for their IT division and then now I I'm here at SUNY Empire State College so that's my story and I always find it customary and appropriate whenever I give presentations especially at new-new conferences to to share a little bit about about me so you know this is mostly an applied research paper here I it's at the culmination of a year and a half worth of work and study and so about a year and a half ago I brought with me a third party to this institution called pink elephant and pink elephants is just the third party institution I know John is familiar with pink elephant being NIT and I brought them with me to help provide some training on the theoretical principles and psychological leanings of organizational change management to instantiate that into the human capital and I had done this before at a prior institution and so you know you make your rookie mistakes always the first time and I saw an opportunity I didn't just see an opportunity to improve upon process improvement but an opportunity to improve on the human element and knowing that I would be implementing a vast array of IOT devices Internet of Things and new technologies and business processes I said why don't I take advantage of this opportunity and and try to instill some virtue and through conversations with dr. Redpath wild back I said why I can certainly you know present a paper on temperance I've been doing some things here in the past in my institution and decided to to actually design some research around it and I present the findings from the surveys as well so the role of the CIO which you have to understand the role of the CIO in in industry whether it's higher education business and industry or state or local government or even federal government has has changed so in decades past you saw the rise of the CIO you saw the rise of the CFO in the early 90s during a lot of mergers acquisitions it always was what particular Wheel of Time would elevate that that c-level position and then in the late 90s you saw human resource needs and organizational psychology became the new fad it was the new craze and then you know we were looking at secularists we're trying to look at you know tell us in their own way you know the Hawthorne studies and purpose and so you saw the rise of the CH o of the chief human resource officer its it is the CIOs time or the CTO if you will in in business and industry and executive leadership business process is becoming workflow ontologically if you will and so technology leaders that understand the value proposition of technology to business operations to human operations are becoming highly sought after and so understanding those relationships and how to make those relationships possible is of paramount importance and so a couple key terms I listed them on the first page there there's something known as the Internet of Things and you can read the definition right below for those of you that aren't familiar with IOT you could go on Google you could go on YouTube type in Internet of Things and watch a couple videos on it read you know what the prevailing wisdom is on the definition but the term here the Internet of Things refers to the interconnection of computing devices embedded in everyday objects via the Internet enabling human beings to send and receive data from each other the world systems and social phenomena so an example of that would be your cell phones that you have my I watched and I'm wearing here I get updates from social media from the news I can actually talk when I'm driving just right through my own concerts I called my Dick Tracy watch but I'm also unconnected right I'm also I'm pushing out information I'm not just consuming data I'm creating data through these devices and so are millions and millions of other people through all their devices these devices know about you they read through analytics you know what you like what your interests are and so you know there are some secular philosophers like David Chalmers that would you know go so far as I say we're pushing our consciousness out there and these things are becoming animated and alive in and of themselves I don't go that far i i've been something about peeping thomas i heard that term earlier so thankfully for that influence however minimal i would not say that there's imagination or or anything like that in these devices but the internet things is growing it's becoming more pervasive becoming a part of how we live and how we interact our culture and it's changing things and so we don't it's kind of like the cloud right you ask seven different IT leaders what the cloud is and they'll give you seven different answers you could say the same thing with the Internet of Things and so digital fluency and digital literacy are also some important terms here digital literacy is what it sounds it's in layman's terms I would say it would be the understanding of digital things and digital concepts and how they apply digital fluency is knowing how to do that how to apply these things how to integrate them in your work life in your personal life in your in your moral life right if you want to use technology to evangelize the gospel if you want to use technology to fulfill the greatest commandment how do you do that if you know how step one all right step two would be digital fluency how do you do those things and then organizational change management its abbreviation is ocm is a formal discipline that company and health and I reference that I brought in to help instantiate that organizational change management knowledge they really they take an organizational psychology view and they talk about it as if there's a grieving process to change and how you unfreeze an institution or an organization you move it and then you refreeze it and how we go about that process well in a set and I mean this loosely in an almost a kidding way I hijack that I I knew the material I knew the terms they'd be teaching i sat in on two sessions of that with stakeholders across the entire institution were brought in from all over the state or the world I think we had some international presence as well and we had two sessions of about 30 participants and I would occasionally interject with appeals to temperance and the negating the desire to retaliate against the project or the processes or the changes that we were bringing to the classroom bringing to their daily lives you know these people spend nine ten eleven sometimes twelve hours of their day in and out in this place they spend more time in this place working than they do with their own family at time so it's important that we manage change in a way that respects virtue and tries to instill virtue and so as a Christian leader without you know standing on you know in front of the entire audience and saying you know Jesus Christ is the way the truth and the life I was merely appealing to virtue by bringing up concepts such as temperance and and restraint appealing to temperance and talking about virtue and and and not getting to the point where the change would bring social malaise or social social ills within the organization it was very well received from my perspective within and then I'll talk a little bit about that in the conclusions and findings and so another key term here is data information knowledge and wisdom or aka the data transformation process this is standard Information Systems Theory stuff or data science stuff and John's nodding he gets it there's a few IT individuals in here that know yeah pardon yeah sure sure you know and so what it is is you can think of it like something we all know we all get gasoline at the gas station or we use it to fill our our our tools at the home and so what does it start off as my economists a fellow economist in their own might say okay we're all material in the production process right so data is the raw crude oil and then you transform it and you transform it into something meaningful why there's no meaning in the data and there's no meaning and technology itself you have to give it the meaning and so we transform data to information and that and then and then from there it is later transformed to knowledge and then from knowledge to wisdom so information is it's meaningful that means you can use it for something you can do something with it knowledge is typically embedded within other technology systems meaning it tells you what to do with that information so management by the middle management or upper management even seeing leadership might say okay I have knowledge on my organization on the people within my organization what can I do with that now or what what should I be doing with that knowledge you may it might communicate to me what I need to do what my next step is and then wisdom is um some might disagree that's fine but many won't well many would agree with me on this that wisdom is still yet to be defined I know there are some folks at MIT that are defining wisdom there are some that speculated as artificial intelligence I wouldn't go so far that's my personal opinion but I my assertion is that through the data transfer may and process within organizations as that the definition of wisdom as we understand the data transformation process today requires a perspective on virtue requires some at least part of it some ontology it's relationships to other things is-is-is virtue and if not then you have chaos and I see this in various points in times and for instance I had mentioned the other day creating a data dictionary so that the institution could better operate and and and communicate with with one another if there isn't an agreement on standard data definitions if the ontology x' are not engineered precisely and where there's unity and the diversity it can create four inefficiencies in the organization which can lead to human resource issues it can lead to anxiety in the workplace which can lead to a lack of virtue and so my my assertion is that wisdom represents combinatorial attributes or relationships ontology here and one of those being being ethics namely virtue and so that is essentially my verbal representation of the introduction the the study I is backed by an exhaustive literature review I call this a baseline study for a reason because in my pursuit of other literature to find out if anybody else had been pursuing a cool approach to this I didn't find precisely this kind of a study so I don't think there is one out there this might be the first of its kind but I did find and I'm very happy to report out that there were some individuals at some Jesuit universities and other Catholic research foundations that had been taking a look at this as it applies to information systems design information systems this technology as well as cyber security or information security and assurance initiatives and so I have those sources quoted throughout and then the the the reference lists at the very end going back to the methodology I had said this is a qualitative ontology and interpretivist epistemology and a case study methodology and the reason for that is because well there number of reasons but one of the reasons it is an interpretivist epistemology and qualitative ontology is because I I provided a survey both internally and externally to the organization so the survey to the participants in the organizational change management initiative for these were also individuals that were part of this technology transformation as well as business operations transformation so the technology for lack of a better word was invading although that's not the appropriate work but to make my point quickly was invading the administrative business processes it was invading the pedagogy and the andragogy if you will meaning it was having an impact but not forced on anybody but it was quick it was fast and it was new so by analogy you have in Japan they they have skipped entire generations of technology infrastructure for those of you that maybe aren't students of technology and they they've they've skipped over some of the basic telecom infrastructure of a telephone wire and pole and cat nine cables and gone straight to Wi-Fi there are many regions of that country that they're just operating on wireless access points technology they've skipped entire generations and so they're able to innovate faster and have greater speed with their IOT devices because they don't have this lead lag relationship that we have with our antiquated technology infrastructure and trying to you know find the capital for that and and then transform it so this institution went through something like that there are faculty that literally are still using typewriters I didn't even know you could buy the somebody asked the other day I had the same question for somebody in my my institution you could so buy the ink ribbon for that at least in this country I didn't think you could they are they're still you using that they refuse to touch a computer so you know upgrading an email system well they're not even touching than the email system this isn't all the fact that saying it's certainly not a representative sample the whole but like I said it's a very diverse culture it's statewide and international so there are there are a diverse set of stages of technology evolution digital literacy and fluency and as well as business savvy and business operations experience so a lot of change within it and so it was chiefly focused on the human actor and and so the the survey reporting's leaned towards an interpretive epistemology although the leading into the analysis and discussion here the the internal survey was just for the participants within the institution that took part in the ocm training organizational change management training and represented different regions of the institution the external survey was not something I like that was actually provided by pique elephant of a presentation that I gave on this subject so after they had gone through the training the ocm training the participants at my institution we discussed resistance to projects retaliation to projects which is the essence of the era I'm sorry which is the antithesis to temperance right after we discussed these things I then presented an annual pink elephant conference in Phoenix Arizona and reported that experience and in the approach and and what the what the experience was there and then they and then they were the the participants in that presentation they responded to a survey as to what they thought of my presentation conceptually mostly as well as the content of the material and so the findings an analysis of the idea of virtue the idea of temperance being applied in an organizational change management setting in relationship to technology and business process and pedagogy and andragogy transformation was very well received internally within SUNY Empire State College if you you can read at your leisure some of the results of that and the findings and conclusions asking a series of close ended questions in the survey it was short sweet right to the point and with a constant feedback section a similar rubric was used by pink elephant for the presentation that I gave on the subject matter and the content material and the numbers weren't so good so those individuals I can only speculate did not have the proximity to the transformation they were not part of the institution and so maybe they didn't understand you know experientially if you will a posterior I right it was just pure a pride to them there's no bridge between that and so you know it wasn't very well received I was probably if it were translated into the traditional grading system I think I would have failed and so that but that's just the findings and conclusions but you can read through that yourself and so based on these findings in this study I've concluded that the impact of using ocm techniques coupled with applied virtue within a formal training study does improve efficacy and quality within digital and cultural transformations and also significant significantly reduces social woes and I detail some of some of the evidences or the proofs if you will that I have in support of that that we that we did experience over the last year and a half following the instantiation of ozium knowledge coupled with applied virtue and so keeping in mind this is a secular institution I can't go in with a with a religious numinous agenda and shoving it down anybody's throat but I can appeal to business ethics and I chose to use the one set I subscribe to which is Christian ethics and and that that was I was temperance and so the application of temperance I I could see further research being done on an implementation incorporating prudence I think that would be a really good one in fact looking back I kind of wished I would have done that but but temperance was certainly in the path that that I chose and very half of that so I'll now open it up for questions because I know that we have maybe three or four individuals in here that have you know experience in technology and I think there might be some desire to you know sure sure well they weren't just IT individuals in fact the majority of right the majority of them represented all layers of the organization we had some upper management middle management we had staff pool in there and we had representation from the entire institution it wasn't in fact most of them were not IT so there were plenty of individuals that thanked me that actually said oh I appreciate you bringing in sound business business ethics into this and you know it you know it's truly just Christian ethics is what it is at root but you know much of that is you know so much a part of what is in the text books anyway so it was an easy translation and an easy sell and so I didn't have any misunderstanding in fact it from my perspective which is an interpretivist epistemology based on the survey data but also based on my experience in there as well as said it was very well received we had no I it actually stimulated the conversation and they would actually dive into the ocm or as a change management training material deeper as a result of that and so I did it in real time and I reference that in the research paper that it was real time intervention strategy so as we were partaking in the OCM turning I was the sponsor for that it was either me or the previous executive vice president I can't recall actually and and so but I was positioned in there and as a leader and Enza uh to sponsor even organically and and so I just in real-time intervention strategies when I saw an opportunity to you know circle back on to virtue I did and it was senior consultants and university would be very busy so about presenting Virgin King and as I recall her presentation where the four cardinal virtues she was doing this you know I haven't you know I not within a religious environment so most of the my peers and institutions are not having conversations like this so I'm kind of well I never yeah I never referenced virtue actually I referenced temperance and terms that apply to temperance and can be derived from temperance and and I did it in real time intervention strategies conceptually propositional sure sure yeah thank you for the points well we'll take in and received and I'll certainly give an excuse well I've seen the agile methodology it's agile methodology I've seen edge' its agile methodology is a term that applies to project management if you don't know what project management is it sounds what the term is it's managing projects so processes and processes recur continuously over time project in the recurring value projects are temporary valued that lead to recurring value so project manager follows a methodology the three classical methodologies are agile incremental and waterfall Waterfall is you gather all the requirements for the project upfront and it comes out like a waterfall in that implementation incremental is a kind of a combination between agile and waterfall and and so that's how most projects are done if it's a global manufacturing company you tend to see waterfall methodology and within the implementation because it's very straight for very quantitative it's logical positivism there's not a whole lot of human actor and human action involved but as you get closer and closer to service organizations you tend to utilize incremental methodology and agile methodology agile methodology is very hard to do most individuals that are claiming to do agile are not doing agile which is how it gets that reputation because we're a few people have actually seen it done well I've only seen done well a couple of times and they were very very good and very hard very high paid individuals there's a fine line between agile and ad-hoc and that's when you can start to get into ethical issues and ethical concerns when they're not actually performing agile methodology in the workplace to implement a project and there tends to be a lot of chaos a lot of confusion there's a theological separation between relationships and definitions and understandings which leads to sin in the workplace it always Christians we would we would define that as as sin you know some of the things that end up happening as a result of ad hoc methodology [Music] so real quick before I answer any more I think we have to go actually but Roku okay okay real quick before I answer your question here I would like Oh gotcha yeah some of the technologies the IOT technologies are really interesting I actually in retrospect I should have put together a slide presentation to actually show you some images of many of the IOT devices that we implemented in conjunction with some kind of standard enterprise software infrastructure and so you know it you know most of the IOT devices the IOT technologies the Internet of Things would be things that impacted the student experience and the faculty teaching experience educational technologies Oh bill if you don't mind me picking on you or both guys we can take it but you know there is a comment you made earlier about putting the cell phones in a basket with your students well I would actually come at it from the opposite you know angle that these IOT devices need to be incorporated in the teaching learning experience to raise the value proposition innovation of propositional knowledge and sometimes you do that as strangely it sounds through visual learning to get them back because this is how they live in their daily lives I remember I was at Southern Polytechnic State University and I was assisting a full professor of teaching a course and he was telling him he was telling me that there was another faculty who walked in the classroom said take your laptops or tablets and your phones put them away I don't want to see on the rest of this class and the student was just not listening it was like you know like this on their phone and he said what are you doing and he said hold on one second professor I'm dropping your class and registering for another one through the online you know ERP so sorry I even probably say ERP and so I mean that's that's the reality that we're facing higher education is in a transformational period right now it we're moving out of the Industrial Age of you know supply chain and you know you're gonna work on the assembly line I'm from Detroit I know the history here from growing up in it and how this all transformed to where you have your 100 your 200 300 400 level classes that's something a lot of talk on the paper and some of the theory behind this is that Bloom's taxonomy if you're familiar with it Bloom's taxonomy has just been completely abandoned because of IOT and Internet of Things I mean they're not doing it well mind you you know you've got all these people and these students of all ages adult learners and fresh out of high school too that are out here and they have access to information and knowledge and they're checking their professors and sometimes they might be right but in the mature time they're making moral decisions and they're making they're making all kinds of decisions they're they they have a they have a purpose and they're intentional and then there and they're pursuing things based off preferences and they have so much access so much access information and knowledge now they can consume and create data via the internet of things and they they just go up and down Bloom's taxonomy like this and sometimes they do it well so most of the time not so well and so higher education is I think is trying to find itself and I think you know in many ways it's being transformed organically by the Internet of Things and that needs to happen I think you know I got probably another 20 year career in higher education and then off to retire doing something else because it's just changing so fast and and that's a good thing it needs to happen I will finish with this the analog for me when I say all those things when I say all that it leads to a philosophy of despair to some degree but despair that you know you know and this is why here at Christian commerce because I believe as Christians we have technology leaders need to brush up on metaphysics and ethics and we need to really understand how it applies because the analog here is early 20th century you know although I don't agree with much of what John Paul Sartre said I do like this statement I think he was poignant ly correct when Sartre actually looked he was a concentration camp survivor and he looked out and is very crass what he said he said what do you see in the late 19th century in the early 20th century and Sartre essentially if I see my stipulated version of it he says you see the rise of Technology he called the technology you see advances in technology going you know exponentially and social moral development as it on as it applies to that technology was moving along this one so the Gulf the gap is getting wider and nobody was there to do a gap analysis and the churches and the monasteries and the universities in fact it was in them it was in some of the universities that some of these technologies are being developed but nobody was checking it and so what did you have you had the ability to create pseudo sociopaths you have a man who gets up in the morning kisses his wife and kids goodbye and he goes to work and he hits buttons knobs of pressure dials he sees these things this is his experience but what he doesn't see is the mother stepping on her children to get the oxygen behind a 12 foot concrete wall and the concentration camp that man was a Nazi he was sitting behind this technology that made it possible for him to remove himself from the thing and and he lost that and new ontological relationships were developed and so you know somebody has to figure all this stuff out and how it applies because as Mark Twain said history doesn't repeat itself but it sure does rhyme and I think we we see that looking backwards throughout all of history so you know he's gonna for what four causes hmm could you remind me of the four causes yeah I think that's something that we should work on I mean I'd be happy to work with you on that and yeah the problem is is that there's final variation final causes though too because information has a final yeah however though it you're right but I just want to add to that information has a final cause if I understand the four causes correctly because information some some organizations they pursue the data transformation just to information because that's all they can do but that information has value has a final cause and I know itself and so [Music] [Music] you know this is good and I would very much like to continue the discussion analysis and then maybe even presentation or just synthesis of this which is part of the reason why I'm here is to start down that path hmm you know but that's in an organization that's in a business this can be extrapolated out to culture and society so that's kind of like the that's kind of my final that's my final cause here yeah right well you know and that's that's and in what you're talking about what I was talking about with you is very much based in a business setting I mean even though it's I'm in a you know University it's all business and much of it this should it should normatively it can positively and it should normally be extrapolated out toward society as a whole civilization and culture I mean you have cultures and civilizations that are you know rising and falling based on digital literacy influencing the data transformation process you know sending and receiving data and they're making you know choices of purposeful choices in the Aristotelian sense daily and leading to ethical consequences works within the context refers to as circumstances okay so you transfer it something that says the kind of abstractly normal entity into this and you have to reduce them eventually screw these who's living while moving out so what was in some way to contribute to this specification specification rather than the final nature of the activity so that that to be included in this process not another floor cause with the way English with an organization operator P circumstance on the back to execute do believe practice yeah I'm not so sure I'd have to decompose the terms but sounds good but leadership is attribute base management is function based there's crossover like yeah yes yeah it has a lot to do with there's internal business practice wonders whether its integrated with other with other activities and whether there's an excellence ins that are involved in pursuing the virtues of that practice socially instituted and what those excellences are he has a sort of criteria for all of us and he thinks of management's the problem management of pain is it is the element of prudence well that's it that's an attribute within me yeah there's some leadership inherent within management but yeah but they requires the attribute is the order of interesting challenge compare his yeah I think the main issue is that if you're dealing with a social practice that's purely is there a period of overwhelming the prior prioritize instrumental reason means means me know yeah that makes sense you know I think there's gonna be a problem with with what a virtue means that makes sense to us yeah yes we passed this perfection as a perfection of distances for hospice I thought though tooth is perhaps not so well known is the man who kind of established the practice of Management Council Drucker says Becker wakes up about these people he's commenting on those who actually do the work if you go to the original Brucker he points to a man Thomas his name is Bernard molar time Bern our time was March Macomb's so he was fighting with ever lost and exited the field and Thomas piece in early men of science that may be can I can I say something that quick I think you got to expand that horizontally though a little bit that's a good vertical description of the history of management but horizontally there are different schools in different cultures that all impact where we're at today so you have Taylorism right Taylor the founder of scientific management and then but also the antithesis to that the qualitative version would be Henry failed which came out of France in the late 19th century and that's fail is on and that's very qualitative approach and that's where we get the modern and every intro to business textbook in this country at least said we get the five functions of management and so the five functions of management have nothing to do with those names that you were mentioning there before I'm not sure attention [Music] [Music] so I did I say destroy I think I said revolutionize or something like that it's transformers that transfers transformed it it or maybe it's mutilated it to some degree because blooms you know it's a theory right I subscribe to it because I've seen it in an instructional design theory in the classroom and how we define correct curriculum mapping and course design and it works and so you start with the lowest level of cognitive thought which is memorization right and you know memorization being the lowest level then you move up to analysis and and then comprehension and comprehension it's like decomposing it and finally you get to the very top there's several layers and you gather the top and that synthesis or creativity there's a couple different interpretations and synthesis is seeing relationships with of like ontology right you're getting your you're relating that that subject through a predicate to other things and so yes he does weigh in like in how to read a book he is in topical reading that's synthesis so you're literally going from the lowest level of thought oh I got three by five cards right this will we teach our kids you know get three by five cards out memorize it then you memorize it then apply then comprehended it decompose its parts and then synthesize and then do something creative create something of value but here's here's a thing yeah well that's that's what I that's what I mean when I say higher education is searching for its soul is because they're still operating under the Bloom's taxonomy approach of the Industrial Age and we're no longer in the Industrial Age we're in the connected a striving the Information Age that phone is actually a piece of crap and so is mine you want to know why the world wide web is changing and and here's what I mean by that I know that was kind of crass but I'm just being silly but Google is actually very stupid what a stupid form of cognition it might - - dorset and Google is a stupid form of cognition you literally take a phrase or words and you match it to other phrases and words on the web and it goes through you know the IP traffic flows all the different layers of security and calls and all this technology stuff and it finds things that match before you're saying it's a one-to-one relationship essentially it's dynamic but it's so stupid form of cognition our brains are so much more advanced the Semantic Web is something that's on the rise right now I'm you know Tim berners-lee is the creator you know of the world wide web he not the Internet era it's different the Internet's a backbone the world wide web is the is is the in is what you call the Internet most of the time that's when you go onto a browser that's the world wide web the Internet is just the transport to get you there but Tim berners-lee is the one that created the concept of the world wide web and he and his crew are now working on a more dynamic version which is all about illogical engineering and it has its first principles in the philosophical discipline of ontology and how do we take the human ontological relationships and how we think and apply to the world wide web so that now you're not just matching phrases it is actually finding additional relationships the system itself is evolving and finding new ontological relationships and that that's going to change everything yeah [Music] [Music] and seeing that model yeah so huge mistake to call but Google yeah I think your instincts are good because you you were you're spot-on what I think I mean I look out at the world wide web and I see what some IT philosophers are calling information overload we have not just from the Bloom's taxonomy it's information overload but in grammar logic and rhetoric the Trivium I know where you're going right it's the Trivium and so I don't know how something like that can still exist even though it should I don't know how the Trivium is going to be the norm amongst human beings under an IOT connected world it's not right now how it's only going to get worse because of information overload they're not going to perfect that virtual quantity of grammar logic and rhetoric because of information overload and so that's where we can just mitigate the problem as Christians by you know trying to bring that back [Music]
