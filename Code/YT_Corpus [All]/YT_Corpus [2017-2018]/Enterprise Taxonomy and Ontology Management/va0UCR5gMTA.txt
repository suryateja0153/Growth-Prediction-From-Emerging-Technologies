 the final one before the use case is the technology roadmap subgroup this sexy maid I think party could make less progress in the others because in some sense he difficult to make a road map you know what the technology is and the technology was only coming out of the use cases and the reference architecture groups towards the end of the end of the treatment process so I think this I expect the technology roadmap to have a significant further enhancement during the second stage of this world so here is what how is worker starts off with the usual general word about community of interest would notice it does have to actually look at the materials gathered from the other subgroups and initial understand standardization issues and priorities and adoption priorities and here we have to look at these texts on amis to be able to classify the various needs here's where standards come in they haven't really mentioned up to now but if we want to have a healthy roadmap and progression we need to identify the key the key sweet spots where it's important to have a standard so that we can have an ecosystem of different people doing different things and those things fit together marvelously an idea Microsoft we don't really want to have systems that any data can put together so it's okay I think which is part of the answer but not okay of therefore brucellosis of the any way you could do that is for there to be standards and these large vendors produce components of the baby standards and then others other large companies or just smaller startups to provide to produce standard-compliant I should point out that Europe is particularly interested in the standards some sense they tend to be a little tank James start up in this German ketchup so in this general area and for them therefore our standards are particularly important so here's they looking at the face other means to be able to see the various ways that we're developing the technology will be in the roadmaps so we have storage processing resource management infrastructure information itself standards applications and business operations and these they're map into the components of the reference architecture over here and finally we have here the how the various sub groups get together it's a reference architect and security and sort of closely linked and so I had the security was linked from the components of the reference architecture in some sense you want to start off for the Reformers in use cases that drives that it also drives the technology roadmap but then that has to interact with everything else then we have definitions to take not summaries which when you refer all the D seems to be operational especially the requirements in the reference architecture and security and privacy because those are the ones that would produce the groundswell the groundwork to allow you to know what you meant to define and what you meant to have until a decent take something was for then the reference roadmap was in that lets you use these all of these things to decide what to move forward
