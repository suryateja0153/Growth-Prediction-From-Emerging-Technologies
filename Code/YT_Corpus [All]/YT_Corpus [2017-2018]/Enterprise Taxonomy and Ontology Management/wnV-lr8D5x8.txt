 as I was telling you that sways are the storytelling tool and an interactive one basically so what it helps in doing is that one need not to have any coding experience but one can still create very interactive sites so just as an example of 1 i'll be sharing this I've one with you to give you an how it looks basically create these kind of soils we have got three options either we can start but create new or we can start with a topic or we can start with a document which we have prepared like our document / document or PowerPoint or a PDF so just to give you an example first let's start with a word document so that we can move on and do a hands-on further later on on our with selected topic so here's our one example when that I had muted so it's like a as I would show you you can look at it in a way that but just like the PowerPoint is there to give presentations it's so very static when like one person has created it and when we are giving that presentation everybody is just sitting in a conference room maybe and having a you look at the all the web's or this thing all the content which is being shared but in this case you can simply create that kind of you know you can embed the images you can embed the videos you can have the simple text created or the placement of images is very elegant in a very elegant way in a very nice manner can be done further you can also embed that tweaks into this so now just with a word document so all this thing was in the word document if I show you how that word document looked like so this is how that word document looked like so this was the simple word document there was nothing fancy in at just the image and some certain pointers inserting headlines and when I you know imported it over here so this is how it was looking the headline the first line went into the first headline title of the sway and then there is this text card which has got all the texts and then there the image was automatically taken in the image card so basically this is how it is looking alright so now on the left side you can see certain these small tiles and it is called cards so basically cards is the smallest unit in the sway which is being used or placed in the manner you want to tell your story is everything clear so far yep okay so this first style is the header time so you can also put a background over here or you can just leave it like that so the early this way if I show you there is a header image over here if I show you the editing of this over here this header image has been added so that is why there is this header on which this title is coming over and over here it's just the simple text is there so it has automatically chosen a style that is the design aspect on which we will go a little later so the cards are here heading is here so if I press on this thing it would allow me to choose any option header heading I can choose or a text image anything I can choose from my device or the extra tiles can be taken from here so I cannot add an audio file as well as this embedded over here you are there are certain cards so heading is their textures their image all these tiles are for media sharing so image video tweet audio every question I have a question sure in class sign when you click the plus sign the the heading here reading text image Mike those things comes up right right this 20 ways to fight of divination and breast punch this is the this is for a particular slide yes this is for a particular sweet play okay sway and background if I put something wrong there it will come like this right the next one next textured it will be soon after that yes so yes this one is first is basically the heading of toss way all right just like every Power Point has got our first head mean section type Magnus a mean section slide similarly this is just the main slide of the swing mean no title of the swing on which we can set a background after after this we can have any header if ice for example put a heading it's let us say 20 so it put come like that so this is just the main heading then there is the smaller heading and here is the text card with the details so this is the heading and it's the text car after this there is this image sorry got it profitez ok so this is the image now every card has got its own nitty gritties on which I will take you a little later after this 20 ways so this is the entire group actually cut it yeah after that i can add either a heading so again just are heading i can add which would go in a separate section so i can for example add the heading edit this heading so it is part of this this separate section so heading is there if I add the text so i can add this text card so on adding the content it is taking me over here on from several sources i can add anything i can add from one die dr flickr bing this is one aspect as well as if i expand it over here so here itself i can add the text card it if I put this one sentence over here this is how it starts looking now so separate section are separate heading and one line state now you can look at cards over here so all these grouping can be again done in a separate manner automatic stack so stacked works greatly with the vendor or several images so for example I can add images from these sources also so just for showing you certain images if it's over here it's searching for the result and i have put this is as the search term so just showing me see some searches so i have just put i can drag the image over here and i have put certain random images over here so all these images if I click on this so all these images are right now coming like this so I can just place these images in a separate group that I was talking to you about so for example I add a stack group over here so this is the drag-and-drop kind of thing that you can simply drag put it over here now this is the group stack which it has come in between these two images can drag the image over here and add it in this group because this group is basically kind of a container which has been designed to take up the images and it is in the back end just placing it in the way that it has been it's basically feature is to show you the images like this so now this is that stack just that stack of images so like this it is coming so did you get a little understanding about the group stats of images yes now first is how section is created one thing is as it is the slides are coming or going gives that portion how you have prepared a sack of it section so sack is the creating a section is very easy you just insert the content so for example instead of heading if I create this text now so now this text is part of this section only right ok yogi and when i start with the heading it automatically takes it as a separate section three so this is how the logical you know this is how it's so much like the storytelling aspect in the sways like that only that it may takes it like that that if there is a headache that means a separate section is there and further you can also embed those embed certain codes if you want so for example in this third section that I just made for the purpose showing purpose so if I have got our chart or like in case of a YouTube video if I were for example like if I want to embed that code over here I can simply copy the code and put it over here so on clicking this I can just paste that entire code over here and it would be the part of this sway if I show you for example here is the fourth on youtube video and there is the small section so there is this a small section which allows you to take the code nobody's mantra there is the sharing so I can look for embedding so when I click on the embedded shows me the code for this the size room I copy it I select all then I copy it and I take it into the sway and just paste and when I go over here you can just upload it so that image that code is all already here so this is another very powerful feature because now you are not just bound by what cards are available you can if you can have access to that kind of code that you can simply embed we can use that good so it can be the charts also it can be the videos also audios certain maps so if you want to show some location also you can embed that over here okay to be also now this is like the variety of cards that we have caught over here another now I will just go into the nativities of these cards so what is what do I mean by that is that each card has got these a small squares on the upper right corner so this is different in each card so for example headings don't have that but you can definitely in case of headings you can add the backgrounds or you can emphasize it which basically means bold so this is how it starts looking up or you can have the accents of which basically means that it's italics this is how it starts looking so that is the point or that a little more designing or styling that you can do with these also you can add link to it so it's basically that hyperlink thing that can work so on flicking this if you want to take them on certain other maybe you can want to take it to another sway your sways are interlinked in that case you can do that also that on clicking every heading you can take them on a difference will after this so you can of course every text can be further just like in precise and X and over and you can have bullets numbers links as well as these a small squares what do they do is they make the size bigger or smaller so if I read it the bigger square this is how it stands out from the rest of the text the rest of the text is still in the black but when I made it to the moderate sized looking so this is how that whole styling of the look changed also what i can do is over here if I want to make it a look a little more of you know I want to look improve the design or the look and feel of this sway so I can maybe just break down the points I can add this text over here then I can take this out and make this stand out because i want to bring more focus on the points rather than the other text because that I feel is the main thing that I want to discuss in this way in that case I can like the way I want to point out or bring focus on certain things I can design it that way so these two things help you to bring more focus on the text that you think is important or you want your readers to pay attention to similarly with the image card you have got three squares so you can increase the size of the image so in this case if I look at this even right now the resolution has gone down a little so I may want to leave it at this but for example if the resolution is great and I wanted to be the main focus point for the document or I want to highlight it for some reason I can make it the largest size so that it is it also serves as a section breaker or something like that the way the latest web sites are working these days so that is another aspect with this card similarly with these over here and now one card that I haven't shown you is that of the tweet so tweet also helps so by adding to it you can simply select from here or you can search and you can search anything so for examples inside subtweet and I should ideally be searching for it in the twitter so i can maybe use a news related meet or uh let's say i have put up this news related to it i do not know what it is but just to show you as an example this is how the tweak starts gets embedded into this and similarly i can also put a video card also itself so for example here there was a video length and if i drag it over here i can again place the card silikal upper or lower side i can like you know rearrange the cards easily by doing like this so i have put it over here and i take this i want to add the video so it's taking me to the heater only but i want to searching you hereby put it over here and then I simply shows me that video teaser I can put it over here then similarly the way there was with the image card similarly that is there with this video card so I can show it like this or take it like this and bring focus on that video itself so right now with the largest this is how it is swinging with the smallest this is how that video has come and it's it shows whatever a caption that I had put for that video card so it comes like this over here so this is this was all about the cards now we come to that design aspect that I was telling you so you can this is the default design which sorry this is the default design that sway started with our text and it was randomly chosen by sway because whenever i have worked with different ways the different designs come i can take any other design and i can further then customize it so for example if I have to choose in this design now this is how it starts looking this is how the mice way is looking now I can change the layout of this way so right now it's in the scrolling mode I can change it like this so now it would go like this so if I show you it in the play mode would look like this the same text can be easily placed the way I want and just leave I go I go back to the editing mode I can again change the layout so it can share simply now become like this and just one screen at a time so now you can see it's more responsive it's far more responsive every single slide is coming one by one aspect so that it's easier for a person to read and it gives a better impact to the feeder because there is a lot more animation overhead like that is there also if I for some reason I like the colors and some aspect but I am NOT happy with the design I can do this remix it so it would keep some aspects it would change some aspects so now this is this thing starts looking so you can see the font has changed a bit but the background is still white and the navigation style is same but certain aspects of that design is changed now I can again do the remix so there is no upper limit on the number of times you can remix it it has simply taken some aspects of our design and change certain aspects this time the sprawling is there instead of the earlier navigation base so that kind of designing is possible further in the design you can customize it so I can maybe you know change the color or ballet of this I can change the font choices so I like this style but I am NOT happy with that font choice so I can maybe choose this one so it just keeps the color combination but then it changes the way it is looking the font and everything of this week further in the customization I can change that animation emphasis so right now it is a quite animation is there when the news images coming or the new heading is coming on the screen I can change it to the moderate I can change the text cite text size also so all these things are there which you can do to tweak your design as per your audience or as per the way you want it so those are the major things about sweep now one last thing that I would like to show you about swales that you can do the settings for this way so you can make it sure that your us cannot duplicate this way or viewers cannot change the layout of the say for example if you have said that scrawling for for this way that means scrawling me this one if you have said this one that is crawls vertically if you do not uncheck it your viewers might simply change the way the scrawling is being done in this room so if you want to give that kind of freedom for your viewers you can simply keep it like this otherwise you can uncheck it also if I show you over here so if when I play it the animation is there everything is coming fine but at the end there is this thing made with swing so for a professional so I am sure you would agree that this would not look good right good so that kind of thing can be taken off from this side by pissing sits in the play formats so it's not sure okay so from here I can just uncheck it and now this will go also you can have this Auto loop so after every if autoplay is on so after every 3 is 5 seconds 10 seconds or whatever it put continuously but you can have it off okay so this is like one of the ways to make this way that I create the document and do it but if I show you the other two ways which are basically you can say the subset of this approach I mean they help you to do it in on a very basic manner so for example if I want to create a sway or not so what it will do is it will create a very basic outline to start off on the topic and it would guide you that these are the things that you can do on or create on everything and then you can customize it so you can see that it has created already the header tile then the text card another text card with the detail then it has got the section on history it has got the section on goals approaches has got some images also so it in the background it must be using internet of course to collect the information from various sites maybe from Wikipedia and other images other platforms as well and it has created some basic sections for our purpose to start off now we can simply go and change the text on these sections maybe change their design outline and everything so these are the images has put and also it is guiding that for the section interesting topics can be these for this section it can be these tools it is pointing out that you can consider them all these things it has created that basic out that this is what should I really be there and depending on your requirement you can tweak around with the content as well as headings and sections whatever you mooned so this is another aspect of creating a swing and the last see the very basic one of courses starting from the scratch which will be to create the new which will basically give you a very blank sway where you have to decide everything you have to put everything you title your sway you a add the earth from starting like heading text images you design everything you customize that you put decide the layout oh so and after that basic thing is created you can remix it of course also you can share the sway with your team's members we can get that embedded code from here and then put it in your website so this is what we have done without port Ron website as well this is what ever stood at on port Ron for our journey because our journey is something that is frequently updated so i just created a very simple sway over here there and embedded that taken that so for example over here it is showing that get embedded code so this kind of embedded code was there which I took and embedded in our website so it's there I can simply navigate it through tweets al whatever tweets we had embedded them for things need to be frequent updating so we kept it in this way and then stack of images are there and which basically helps us to look through the things which are events which have been part of so this is how we embedded sway or in our office website so how is that possible like you if you click on the share button you can take the option of just me those in our organization with the link or anyone with early so anyone with the link you can simply share this link if you want to invite people just to view then this link if you want to invite for edit then this link you can also go for more options over here like you can ask consider a password to view or edit this sway so in case you are sharing it with somebody in our organization and you want somebody to you know input or equal or co-author with you this sway document you can simply share this link with the editing capability and at the same time require a password so you can enter that password you can ask them that password required to edit you can set that password and after that whenever you share this link that people will be able to access that link for oolitic only when that password is shared or you can just also you know take the embedded code for this so this is what I was telling me that if i take this embedded put it in the website so if it would appear just the way that our journeys wave was up here so majorly all these things are there even
