 hello I'm Kim Daugherty one of your I school career specialists and I'd like to welcome you to this career webcast with Mindy Beattie Mindy Beattie leads the Library and Information Services Group ad firm a suitable company Gilead Sciences Inc in Foster City California and that's a job she's held for the past three years the lis group supports Gilead users globally with research services and access to databases and journals to enable all the gilead colleagues to make informed decisions before joining Gilead she managed teams at two other pharmaceutical companies and a chemical company Mindy holds an MS LS from Catholic University and in her free time Mindy enjoys tasting wine baking and exploring California which sounds like a terrific combination to me in today's webcast Mindy is going to share information about lis careers in the pharmaceutical industry her own career path and her career advice based on her own experiences so with that I'd like to hand it over to Mindy thank you so much for joining us tonight thank you Tim and I appreciate you and Kelly helping to facilitate this and I excited about presenting out to San Jose students so I'll jump right in and start with the second slide so in the first I'll introduce a little bit more about the current functions talk about organization design like where do information functions fit in pharmaceutical companies what kinds of roles and responsibilities are there for people what kind of tasks are involved with those jobs what are desired skills that many companies look for and because some people may think it's mostly that you have to have a biology degree or something but it's very interesting because a lot of times soft skills are can be more important in a role and moving you forward than necessarily the hard skills and then also talk about how to own your career because you have to drive it and I will talk a lot about that I'll get second so as a Kim mentioned my experience as a has been for 20 years at chemical and pharmaceutical companies and I actually started out more on the information scientist side after I was graduated from library school I actually had managed a firm in Washington DC where I got to start a library from scratch so that was pretty cool as a government contract firm and then I was hired at Dow Chemical and moved to Michigan to manage their corporate information center and I did a lot of work for you know business development of strategic planning things like that I don't have a stem degree I started out more on the business corporate side and I have worked with companies and it with a team of people in all backgrounds similar to what I've listed here in my current organization at Gilead we have six total team members including me I have four information scientists some with pharmacy some of library science biology chemistry my most recent hire was somebody that came last year and she was hired from the lab in inside the valve Juliet already and then me as the content manager so in many pharmaceutical companies the library or information management functions it's usually in three different areas many senses in medical affairs and I'll explain what that is or research and development or IP I've worked in companies where I've been in medical affairs and I've been an IT I've not worked in an organization except when I was at downe many years ago and when I moved over to the scientific R&D library where I was actually under the R&D function but in in the organization that I'm involved in called the pharma documentation ring which is a professional association of 20 I think there's 25 member pharmaceutical companies those are the three functions that most companies are under so most people know what research and development is and the IT organization of course is information technology medical affairs is the organization that a lot of times is doing our pharmacists who are working in medical information or they're developing standard content that would be shown to a health care practitioner such as a doctor and so they are actually 36% of our overall number of requests the people who are in medical affairs and we also have the health economics and outcomes research group in medical affairs it's quite a large group there's like over 500 people globally in medical affairs our company overall has over 9000 employees now and so we saw our team of six but we've done a lot of strategic planning and outreach in the past year and really grow in our business and I'd be happy to answer any questions about that as well so there are of course related functions to the information management function and in many pharma companies these can be separate like I know at our company the competitive intelligence function is separate patent searching usually falls under the legal department and there can be records management knowledge management or enterprise content management which is management of internal assets not external content like the library group manages so some companies these fall the information management function comprises a few of these or maybe all of these functions but I did want to list them because there's many different roles that we are will be in these functions not necessarily just the ones that I'm list talking about tonight during this presentation the funding models is very different as well and so the funding model is in a in a pharmaceutical company is that the font budget can be centralized as in it's managed under the library kind of function and everything is the databases of journals are all licensed and managed and funded centrally by that function decentralized means perhaps your group still manages it but you are managing it on behalf of other groups and they might be paying for it there's also what's called a chargeback or cross charging environment and some pharma companies do have this kind of organizational structure as well so in a chargeback environment what that means is that most you can charge like charge that department for specific services you might charge them for research services and you have to subtract what you're doing or at least some databases or especially article delivery of what's called document delivery most of the time that's charge back like if people order articles it gets charged to their particular cost center or department we are not in a chargeback environment but we do move manage kind of centrally ND centrally do with budgets because we manage many of the resources in the company but not all and we work with other departments and sometimes we share cost or they're paying for resources that we also put on our elibrary because their enterprise accessible so there's many different funding models in companies so we did at the poll are you already working in an Information Center or a library and you could say yes or no through the polling if you'd like to answer that question I see we have to check and unknown course I am thank you for responding so I think that helps you know set the stage for where we go with the rest of the presentation so in pharmaceutical companies and in many companies because I'm also involved in another organization that is some pharma but other corporations like oil and gas companies aerospace big companies like 3m Dow Chemical Cargill etc there are almost always roles for information scientists and like the Content Manager which I'll talk about so I've listed alternative titles here information scientists are information specialists and I also listed data scientists because in some companies they have completely changed the roles of their information scientists over to data scientists so they're doing different type of work but basically a lot of it is sometimes people say well I'm a searcher I prefer a different title but a searcher but what it means is that they're doing advanced literature searching across many different areas is like for us it could be in the medical literature or it could be finding market research research they're doing for business development or corporate development you might be using commercial databases that have forecasting information or competitive intelligence databases but you can also be doing the medical and scientific like biology side of it but a lot of that is about not just being reactive in doing the quick searches but moving toward that advanced technical search kind of competency where you're not just identifying but you're analyzing and synthesizing the information also delivering the literature perhaps in a different way like you know using text mining tools doing more visualization making it more useful and so a lot of times when people ask you to do a request for them what they may want is something they can put into a PowerPoint slide that goes up to their monitor and then up further through the company so many of the people on and for who are information scientists are getting more into these advanced tools and to do more visualization do more rather than just here's a literature search of the biomedical literature and you return back a list of references and citations the other thing that's different is in moving from that sort of reactive role to the proactive role is partnering with project teams so what that means is instead of you being kind of invited in at the beginning of a project and then they don't when they don't need anything they don't come back to you until later when they have another request is you actually become a core team member of the project and that's actually where we've moved in the past 18 months after them we've rolled out our strategic plan so the best part about that of course is that your team members are much more embedded in the project team so they have the knowledge that all of the team members have from the very beginning and see how their remit changes or they say oh what about this we haven't talked about this and so the information scientist is in the room there on the calls and they can understand the context and the direction of the research team so they can be a much more effective information professional in the types of research that they're providing so as I mentioned also there are other activities that they do of course identifying evaluating acquiring and deploying tools and resources so if we're looking at another clinical trial database they're going to compare those tools do a matrix of what's you know one hand versus the other you know why would we buy this one versus the other one how much information did they find where the gaps they may also of course do we work on the deployment so work with the vendor to do the training communicate out to the users target those specific groups of people or publish stories on the internet about particular training or offerings and then there's other you know sort of library operations things that they may get involved in so these are the other duties as assigned that are in the job descriptions constant procurement of course is a key role and you find that in most pharma companies this is the role that is usually not done by the procurement department and some companies that group is called strategic sourcing content licensing and the pricing on that and the license terms is very different than the people who do an RFP to select the new Xerox repair system or a new drug safety system or something like that so a lot of times they're more than happy to have our group still be the subject matter experts we do partner with procurement when we need to like if you actually are do need to do a request for proposal for a particular service because let's say there are multiple companies who provide that service then they'll help you run that request for proposal but also procurement departments and a lot of companies are not going to get involved unless is quite a lot of money you know where they can offer their expertise but that way they can help with it like it's a request for proposal process help you with the weighting as in WEEI ght of those specific requirements you have and help you make a decision based on all the requirements of the people involved in it but Jen general what the person who's doing content procurement is doing is managing the negotiations and the renewals for all the resources and services and and many companies have worked enact manage budgets from you know when I was much more junior you know let's say I started out with a couple of licenses there were only $50,000 and then moved into companies where I was managing 10 20 30 million dollar budgets so it depends on the size of the company how many resources they have and how much budget have and also managing the budget is a big part of this job as well which I have at the bottom of the slide so managing copyright compliance procedures and systems is very important most companies in pharma have a copyright Clearance Center license and you have to be able to provide you know copyright compliant materials there's also an interest and pharma that's very different we have specific license terms for being able to provide content for a submission to a regulatory body so for example when your company is putting in a submission to the FDA of a new drug you know a lot of the literature that goes along with that submission can be put in the submission without having to pay an external copyright fee if it's from your licensed journals that's a key term and then there's also the medical information what's called reactive use so these are again are clauses that you need to have in your licenses and they're actually now covered under the CCC's annual license but a lot of companies still have them individually so what reactive use is is if you are a pharmacist working in a medical information department you get calls or requests from pharmacists nurses physicians that are what are called health care practitioners in order to answer a question many times the pharmaceutical company has standard materials that are about the efficacy of their drugs or you know questions like that and they've already pre-selected certain journal articles and content that's you know talked about those specific issues and so if it's a New England Journal of Medicine article that's quoted in the standard response document then they can provide that article out to the HCP without paying for a separate fee to this through the CC C so copyright compliance is important but understanding all these license terms is a whole other learning curve for a lot of people but you find that a lot of people don't want to do content procurement because the information professionals may not like to negotiate I actually love this role but you know it's it's something that you have to really like some people don't want to do it but I think there's great opportunities for people to work in the space and another part of that of course is building productive relationships sometimes the relationship you have with your procurement person in your company I've had one of them say to me I'll be your bad cop you can be the good cop so you maintain that relationship with that Account Manager and that supplier so you know that's one of the ways that you can maintain what I said here building those productive relationships because you also want to know what's coming down the pike what are the product enhancements you have to deal with Account Manager changes all the time what are the pricing models and pricing model means like do they license only across the enterprise and your company maybe only needs 10 licenses because it's a small group but the company says well we're only going to license it for the entire company well it doesn't really work and you have to know when you want to walk away and when you're not service model changes sometimes back and you may know this in academia there's what's called a concurrent user license where you could say up to five people could have used this database at the same time some companies just said we're just changing our license model so you no longer can do concurrent so it's enterprise or nothing so there's a lot of those things you have to understand and be flexible with and be able to negotiate with those publishers or be able to walk away if your company decides they don't want to do it there's also managing projects to streamline the renewal process knowing how to structure your agreements so that you're not renewing 120 contracts every year because most pharma companies have similar content and if you have a license for every public journal publisher plus all the databases it can be over 100 so if you structure like 25% of them or more one year two year or three year licenses that way you're not doing them all the same time every year because it's a lot of work and then I mentioned managing the budget in the forecast so some companies have a monthly forecast where you have to go in and update in the finance systems my current company we just do three a year so again a lot of it is understanding how to run the budget and then also negotiating with the suppliers so I'll move on to outreach and training which for many companies has become more of a key role recently so let's say you are spending you know five million dollars on content I think it's worth having a role to do this kind of job because you want to make sure that you are maximizing your return on investment and the products that you're licensing so this training and awareness role or some groups some companies help marketing and training it's a way to you usually it's a manager level role and it's developing the strategy to deliver the training so I didn't want to make sure people do understand it doesn't mean you're always delivering the training because if it's training on a database many times we just have the vendor do it we do training of course on our own internal processes and you know awareness of our services but if it's a training on you know trial throw of database then we have the vendor do it but it's understanding and setting a strategy every year and being able to say what are we focusing on what's the most important resources that we should be looking at maybe the most costly ones how do we look at the usage and see who's in what department and maybe only five percent of the people in this department are using it and we expect that more people should be so that way you could better target how did offer training or find out what the barriers are for that group benchmarking of course with internal external training experts working with a Learning and Development function in your company if you don't have one then looking at how do I deliver training in different ways sometimes people just want a two-minute WebEx to get started you know like a little recorded video we every company should have a YouTube channel to be able to click through and just listen what's the basics to get me started on a database most people don't come to one-hour training anymore unless of course you're feeding them and then they'll show up so then then a lot of this is you have to do a lot of writing because you're usually promoting their resources through email or on your intranet and writing stories that get published through public affairs so operations can work with the content manager quite a bit and work with the other people in the department this can be anything from managing the library website or sometimes companies have it in SharePoint partnering with IT or the hosting company as needed to update the site many companies have now moved to a ticketing system for requests because there's literature search requests which the information scientists pick up then there is the regular tickets of hey I tried to access this article and I couldn't can you help me with that so we do an Operations person who handles all of those kinds of tickets and we are also trying to get people to start you know utilizing the resources that we've set to put them into the workflow so it links them to the licensed journals and if they're searching for example PubMed which is a medical database from US government that way there's a little icon that says click to access Gilead so if they start with our special link it puts them in a workflow to take them to the license journal if we have it but if we don't it actually opens up an order form populates the citation data and they can just click order to go to the document service so you know we there's a lot of like I said a lot of communication and instructions that you're sending out to people a lot of times or sometimes people report hey I can access this journal is it down then we either look at it of if it's acts accessible for us is an issue with their eyeteeth you know they're if it's an IT issue then we have to turn it over to IT because maybe they have a an issue with their computer you know and access to the network so there's a lot of those kinds of things that happen - so another big part of that is of course gathering all the usage statistics for the journals because you look at how many downloads have you had on the counter compliance statistics versus like if the license fee is this much and we could order it for less money ad hoc when it's needed then we would cancel the subscription or what we call licensing the journal and then just have people order it instead so that we look at that return on investment calculation every year so my team member has a huge Excel spreadsheet she is the Excel wizard and she says okay this is what we're paying for this journal title this is how many downloads from the usage this is like the calculation and we've actually got a very interesting metric in there because we always say if you send it if you send people to an ordering form instead of it being licensed I actually calculate that it would be half the number of downloads because people never order as many articles as they click on so we kind of divide it in half and so let's say there were a thousand downloads but it's a twenty three thousand dollar journal or something or more expensive but if you said okay if we send it to order and then there's only half would it be cheaper to order it ad hoc as needed the other thing is that's different in a lot of corporations once you've ordered let's say you ordered the article because you didn't have a subscription that goes into a repository because it's argue for you paid the copyright and you can reuse it in your company as much as you want so as part of our ordering workflow if it's already in our system it pulls it up for people so that it doesn't get ordered again and again and you know even if you do that with your supplier you can negotiate a lower rate for the reordering so you're not having to pay like the $50 copyright be you just pay for the transaction fee to the supplier so there's a lot of things to manage around the journals and the database statistics too and I mentioned document delivery service there's a lot of linking and authentication when I worked at another company they called it all the chewing gum and strings that have to happen all these integrated systems to make everything work like I said the linking from the SUBSCRIBE content through the workflows out to the ordering form etc and then of course you're working with different colleagues like the IT professionals to resolve these issues so there are of course other opportunities and companies as I touched on at the beginning of this section there's data scientist roles which can be very different more statistics base more looking at maybe huge datasets of real world data and doing a lot of analysis on that my team does get involved in text mining and data mining projects there's and I've got tools listed at the end that are commonly used in pharmaceutical companies but we don't have the same role as defined as what you know a program would call a data scientist so I mentioned enterprise content management again this is managing more the internal assets patent searching again most of the people who work in patent searching usually chemists they have like a PhD in chemistry and then they get patent searching expertise in like a certification and they work usually for the legal department and I talked about CI also the role that's interesting that one of my colleagues in the past had had migrated to like you know she changed jobs a business analyst is somebody who takes all the requirements for a system and organizing them in a way to understand what everyone needs I mean if you think about a reference interview you're basically helping to reiterate and understand what somebody needs before you do work for them and that sort of business in list those a lot of times this takes all that information and organizes it and works with like project manager to work with on an IT project for example so there are some people who have moved into business analyst roles as well and then I mentioned project management there's a lot of technology initiatives setting up integrated portals of content and integrating content programmatically like through data feeds like application programming interface kind of things or RSS feeds some new stuff is still done via RSS but there's a lot of opportunities on project management as well and a lot of times as people start moving up in the organization they're no longer really doing literature searching they're more managing projects and managing services so that happens quite a lot in many companies you so how many of you have a stem degree raise your hand science technology engineering and math I'm out okay so we'll talk about this like is this your requirement you have to be a biologist or a chemist or something like that so this slide says yes and no but my answer is yes no and maybe so if you are an information scientist supporting let's say chemistry and biology I would say yes because there is as people now have so access to so many information sources there's there's being able to be in that searcher role but there's also an analysis piece of it that now happens and you're working with colleagues who are in the Patent Department in the biology department in the bioinformatics group etc and you're working in that project team so the expertise is usually very similar and you're not just running a literature search in the medical literature and returning the results it's a much different workflow and still level that's required now but there are so people who you know like in hospital libraries etc who may not have to have via pharmacist to be doing biomedical literature searching in a hospital again data scientists analyzing statistical data you may need to be a mathematician or a statistician or a bioinformatician as somebody who a lot of times has a biology degree and also computer science degree now these things these roles are available in pharmaceutical companies but in the library information services department you can be an information scientist but also you don't have to be a scientist as in a stem degree if you're working in different roles so I mentioned content management the content procurement piece of it training and outreach not a requirement operations stem is on a requirement and if you're in information science is supporting like business development the corporate strategy group those kinds of roles don't necessarily have a degree in engineering biology chemistry etc so what I would say though is that of course if you already have a biology degree it's not going to hurt I think it's very helpful you know and you can speak equally with people when they're talking about targets drug targets so I like to tell people about what's called the top model so talent organization and passion so when you're looking at where am I going to work and what's going to make me happy what role is best for me the top model is the integration of these three things so your career best is actually when your talent the organization that you're working in and your passion all come together and this is the best happy place for people who are in this role and remember I talked at the beginning about you know finding using those soft skills that a lot of people have this is a great place to look at what other companies look at so last year there was an article in Bloomberg where they do a survey of what recruiters from big corporations banks etc want from MBA graduates and you could actually filter it by pharmaceutical industry you could filter by different industries like finance or banking etc what I found fascinating about those because I presented this out also at SLA PHT conference last year I was fascinated by this because a lot of times you think Oh wouldn't they think the most important or hardest to find skills would be I need people who do financial modeling I need them come out of school to understand you know you know laws and governance about you know working in finance or banking or things like that or they need to be Excel wizards or whatever you know being a financial analyst but actually what was so fascinating about this is that these are all soft skills so people in pool recruiters said when they hired MBA graduates which I like I said I know it says MBA but I think this is so relevant for people who are coming in to like any function you know whether it's a library science student or somebody who has like a liberal arts degree etc communication skills were most important in the pharma like seventy three point nine percent of recruiters said we need people have communication skills you know there is always that kind of joke about people who are so technical that they can't talk to people luckily I'm one of those extroverted librarians so I never had that problem but usual communication skills strategic thinking you don't have to be a vice president of a function to be a strategic thinker leadership skills same thing you know are you leading by example can you take everyone's input into consideration creative problem-solving I thought this was just fascinating and there's more so there were two more work experience which was interesting because 54% of them said it was hard to find even though I think a lot of people who get their MBA working consulting for like five years after their undergrad before they go get their MBA so I thought I thought that was kind of interesting that they didn't in pharma anyway they still needed people with pharmaceutical or experience or some kind of work experience and they said it was hard to find and then of course working collaboratively I think that's so key basically every project that you work on now is all a team project accomplishments of the group are of an individual our accomplishments for the team and that's how you report out success as a leader it's not I did this it's that the team did this so working collaboratively is so critical because like I said every project you do every person usually has a role in the group you know and whatever even if it's a cross-functional team like your people plus people from your accomplishments that's what's also important as a leader so the next slide I also have I like to call it your superpower so how many of you know what your superpower is that is like we're going to talk about your strength and I like to call it the superpower so raise your hand if you know your superpower did you lose audio okay so we'll move on to the next one I have done some external research I won't call this benchmarking because there's no statistical data there oh good Tim thank you the what you know important to people in pharmaceutical companies and as far as roles and responsibilities things like that there's many different aspects here for people to sort of choose you know like strengthening market and net marketing and outreach navigating organizational change building a relationship closer relationship with your clients there's a lot of opportunities here for people to make contributions in their company so where does that leave you where I where do you how do you start doing this and I included this visual because I wanted to say you have to own your career it's not a self-driving car it's not going to happen by itself you have to actually drive it and I think that you know you have to understand how do I make my life happen I think it's all about personal motivation I think it's all about understanding where you want to go and that's where we'll get into also this you know superpower or your strengths we could talk about that so look at opportunity connecting with information professionals are you even involved in SLA special Libraries Association or other divisions even specific divisions of SLA how are you meeting more people are you seeking out opportunities for development there's internships there's scholarships for conferences there's all kinds of mentoring programs we in the pharmaceutical division we have travel scholarships for the spring what we call our Spring Meeting which is actually going to be jointly located with SLA in June next year we only have like one person or we had two people apply and then he said the one we picked he said oh I can't come to the spring meeting but then we deferred it and he came to the summer regular SLA annual meeting which was great but actually that meant one award went without being awarded to anyone you know for like the summer meeting so a lot of people who are students could get these travel awards like a scholarship to go to these conferences in your hotel and your airfare etc is paid for and they're not taking advantage of applying for these are you are you seeking out you know changing your role like are you building expertise by looking at other opportunities and thinking about a stretch goal another thing that I think people don't think about when they're fairly junior in their career because this is something that companies do want to know and it's part of what's called your talent profile in your HR systems is knowing your mobility so what that means is a mind willing to move like not just even for your own company but and you wouldn't of course put that in your talent profile but am I willing to move what I want an assignment for example in my company outside the u.s. maybe a short-term assignment or a long-term assignment I want to have an opportunity to work in you know the UK or the Netherlands you know we speak to your manager about that what are the opportunities that are available for you to take on another role look at other departments find opportunities to do like a rotation or a special project then that way you can start learning something new and that will help you decide oh that was a great opportunity but it wasn't the right fit for me but you know then you still can come back to your regular job and look for other ways to expand your roles so have you looked at any of the vendors or what we tell the suppliers working with corporate information centers there's many different companies they would be happy to provide you know probably overviews of their services or their tools and again highlighting those soft skills obviously very important for many companies to have employees I mentioned a lot of these current needs outreach training marketing metrics and visualization is still very important if you don't know how to use Excel you really have to learn or if you already know how to use tableau you're ahead of everyone else so communication skills can you talk to people can you understand you know how to communicate get out your idea how to present to executive leadership how to be short and sweet and get your point across there's a lot around communication that people still have an opportunity to learn and I mentioned leadership and collaboration already the most important thing I think is actually agility so in your current role are you flexible if your boss says to you like I really would like you to take on this you know project and manage it do you say yes or do you say no not sure if I'm ready you know get the help that you need don't take on something that you think is completely beyond your capacity but at the same time being a very flexible agile employee will bring you future opportunities in your organization because companies change their organizational structures all the time in corporations and you have to be ready and somebody who can move very fluidly around the organization is going to be retained for a much longer period of time than someone who says I don't want to learn that so how do you build your knowledge you know what do you need to learn about there's a lot of places you know that you can learn these things tableau there's lots of free you know learning available on you know webinars and through their website there's analysis and visualization pipeline pilots use quite a lot in corporations Spotfire for visualization Stanford actually has a continuing education session for data scientists it's not a degree program that would give you an introduction there's text and data mining I've mentioned lingo medics ite is a tool that's used in a lot of pharmaceutical companies for text mining some companies are getting involved with IBM Watson to look at how to filter you know terabytes of data you know to meet to find the information side byte termite is another one if you're looking at taxonomy management or ontology in your company or text mining and then byzant as a very small company that's been around a long time but they can actually take multiple data sets and combine in so it helps you harmonize and be able to present information in a different way and I mentioned ontology management a bit as well so I mentioned I will talk about additional resources I already did mention you know SLA and these career and travel awards that a lot of people don't take advantage of em so I put a link in here to be able to you know find out what awards are in your in yours chapter or in your specific division that you're interested in but you have to be a member of that chapter division it might have to be a chapter member but not maybe not that division to be able to click through and apply for an award but you should definitely take a look at that to see you know what's available because if you can get a free travel award to go to an SLA conference to cover your hotel on your airfare etc you know what an opportunity to network with so many people and learn and there's a need to review start discovery article that was written by the pharma documentation ring members in 2012 and it's about what key roles and responsibilities and functions there are in in most corporate information centers and as I mentioned the pharma documentation ring is this organization of like 25 member pharmaceutical companies their information groups so I'm involved in that along with many others so Merck advisor and novo nordisk and Novartis and know they have a public website you can find out about the PDR is P - D - R comm I talked about knowing your superpower do you know what your strengths are there's a book called the Clifton strengths finder there's a book or you can do an online assessment but it's really an interesting exercise and actually the same Francisco chapter had a strengths finder session that as a student you know we had to pay like $25 to go and they filled up pretty quickly but look for these kinds of opportunities and you could do that assessment at a much lower cost and also get the facilitated session that went along with that so you did the assessment first and then went to this class that was in the evening or something so that helps you sort of figure out like well what are my strengths and how what would be a good place for me to go so I mentioned also additional like different databases I talked about of course biomedical literature I PubMed is a the National Library of Medicine one but there are often and ProQuest dialogue which is how come pharma companies integrate different data sources like med lines and the National Library medicine along with other different databases so there I'll just you know leave this slide up here to you know have you take a look at this but many of these companies I'm sure would be happy to you know do demonstrations or show you more about it they're always really helpful and you know their websites are easily Google that's word and then and I just would like to say thank you a lifetime of happiness lies ahead of you this is actually was a fortune that my husband died when we were out to dinner and like the week before he was going to ask me to marry him so I thought it was a good picture to put up but it was a different sort of outcome than a job but a lifetime of happiness they can be ahead of you thank you for that presentation I have about 600 questions that I've been noting but I think we want to open this up to my own would you like to ask a question or ask some questions or type in some questions and Kelly what do we need to do to make sure that a young young can be heard or or communicate looks like they're going to be typing so okay hopefully hopefully they can still hear us oh yeah behind and all that goes okay been there done dad okay good question great go ahead great question yep this that is an excellent question and the answer to that is we did have an intern this summer we posted it through San Jose State but they wouldn't post it on the internship list not that I'm talking Sevilla when I'm you certainly Kim or anything I guess it has to be for credit I think if it's posted on the internship opportunities right that what they told me that ours was not for credit but we actually ended up hiring someone who lived in Arizona and let me just tell you some of these internships pay like 30 dollars an hour so it was a missed opportunity for someone to not have applied so I only received I worked with San Jose State I only got one resume from San Jose State that was it so oh my gosh okay so let me check with my on which by the way let me just say this is one of the reasons I'm working on a resume review session with two other SLA people because the resume I did receive was not very good it was very poor and I would love the opportunity and we're working on a session that's a live session that people could hear what's expected and then actually have somebody do their do like get tips on their resume at a live session and no I cannot hear her she said her audio was gone but she could type I think okay and so we're thinking that there may be poor connectivity so okay well my money denominator I closed I posted it through San Jose I posted on LinkedIn it was on the Gilead web site I posted it many times through SOA and many different SOA connections so I tried to brought like spam it out to everybody as much as possible that is amazing because to your point that would be an incredibly valuable internship not just financially which is amazing and wonderful but experience and contacts and sort of learning the environment you it would be phenomenal is does Gilead do internships on a regular basis yeah it's every summer it's a huge program and they have a whole separate part of the website where you can select the internship positions it was across many many different departments so we did post ours through and usually I think we had to have everything posted out around March but I kind of member if I did budget for someone next year I think I did because it was a great opportunity I would say our first time doing it I probably didn't do a good enough job like with the team of saying here's like a really cool exciting role you could come in and do this fabulous thing but you know we had a lot of different tasks but we still need to I think design a better big project for the student but we will definitely have that for next year was our first time but she had a great time she was really fun she's older and like I said she came from Arizona and lived here in the summer while she worked here oh my gosh how fabulous okay so all three of us want to do that with you new Timorese I have a great team and she just integrated really well and she was a fabulous fit okay well that that's great to know um they young how about any other questions from you because it sounds like you have a background in sort of the stem field are there other questions that you would ask what to ask Mindy and I'm going to sort of volunteer this question myself could Niang um follow up with you Mindy if if she's sort of combining parenting and and participating would you feel okay about having my own follow up with you after the the webcast absolutely I'm on LinkedIn anybody can reach me through there and I do respond you know to messages from people so I'd be happy to okay well you know I have some look at my list I have like 12 questions here and so the other one Mayer what would a fresh graduate do or should do that with the general direction I would say get involved I know it's a big time commitment but even just integrate going to like a networking event through SLA or you know finding people through LinkedIn i I've actually just also had lunch and and/or coffee with people who've been interested in learning more and they've come to the site to meet with me just to understand more about the roles that are available and my know my team would be interested in doing that as well so I think networking with people looking to vessel a directory reaching out be just being very proactive and saying hey I have I could meet with you for 30 minutes you know at your site or what however much time you want to propose but don't tell them you want two hours you know try to publicity or buy you lunch you know or whatever you know I would love to meet with you and sort of ask you you know these questions and give people a heads up on what those are and I think you would find most information professionals are very willing to do that so I'm typing interesting case now on can't hear us where are you located okay in San Jose so you guys are close by yeah I think yeah I think this could be a great opportunity very very cool yeah well we we are at 6:30 Pacific time and so I'm going to wrap this up by saying Mindy this has just been an amazing presentation and I think all three of us are are walking away with about 500 different things to think about or look at or research I follow up with you about so I can't thank you enough on behalf of the San Jose students and I school for you taking the time to do this because this has been from someone who's a career adviser this has been one of the best overviews I've ever seen so thank you thank you thank you I hope you have a wonderful rest of the evening and all three of us will look forward to staying in touch with that I'll wrap up well thank you very much for the opportunity and if anybody does want to contact me through LinkedIn you know feel free to do so um you know I'm definitely open to talking to people about you know what their career options could be wonderful you
