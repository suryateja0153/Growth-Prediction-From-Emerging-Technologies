 What's up youTube this is Christopher Ramirez coming at you with another? video and look what we got going on now and as far as Computers going the one of the biggest brands they have in the game intel going to the next level which is quantum computing with their devices and If you do not know a quantum computing is I'm gonna go ahead and have a little real play for you guys To go ahead and school you on quant with quantum computers are so with that said let it roll in the quantum realm physics works quite differently from the predictable ways we're used to and Traditional computers, just not making sense. We are approaching a real physical barrier for our technological progress to solve this problem Scientists are trying to use these unusual quantum properties to their advantage by building quantum computers in Normal computers bits are the smallest units of information? quantum computers use qubits which can also be set to one of two values a Qubit can be any two-level quantum system such as a spin in a magnetic field or a single photon zero and one of this systems possible states like the photons horizontal or vertical polarization in The Quantum world the qubit doesn't have to be in just one of those it can be in any proportions of both states at once This is called superposition But as soon as you test its value say by sending the photon through a filter it has to decide to be either Vertically or horizontally? polarized so as long as it's unobserved the qubit is in a superposition of Probabilities for 0 and 1 and you can't predict which it will be That the instance you measure it it collapses into one of the definite state superposition is a game changer for Classical bits can be in one of two to the power of four different configurations at a time There's 16 possible combinations at which you can use just one For qubits in superposition however can be in all of those 16 combinations at once This number grows exponentially with each extra qubit Twenty of them can already store a million in parallel a really weird and unintuitive property cubits can have is Entanglement a close connection that makes each of the qubits react to a change in the other state instantaneously, no matter how far They are apart This means that when measuring just one entangled qubits, you can directly deduce properties of its partners without having to look qubit manipulation is a mind bender as well a normal logic gate gets a simple set of input and produces one definite output a Quantum gate manipulates an input of superpositions rotates probabilities and produces another superposition as its output So a quantum computer sets up some qubits applies quantum gates to entangle them and manipulate probabilities Then finally measures the outcome collapsing superpositions to an actual sequence of zeros and ones What this means is that you get the entire lot of calculations that are possible with your setup all done at the same time? Ultimately you can only measure one of the results And it will only probably be the one you want so you may have to double check and try again But by cleverly exploiting superposition and entanglement this can be exponentially more efficient than would ever be possible on a normal computer So while quantum computers will probably not replace our home computers in some areas. They are vastly superior One of them is database searching to find something in a database a normal computer may have to test every single one of its entries Quantum algorithms read only the square root of that time which for large databases is a huge difference The most famous use of Quantum computers is Rowing it security Right now you're browsing Email and banking Data is being kept secured by an encryption system in which you give everyone a public key to encode messages only you Can decode the problem is that this public key can actually be used to calculate your secret private key Luckily doing the necessary math on any normal computer would literally take years of trial and error But a quantum computer with exponential speed-up could do it in a breeze another really exciting new views is simulations simulations of the quantum world are very intense on resources and For bigger structures such as molecules they often lack accuracy So why not simulate quantum physics with actual quantum physics? Quantum simulations could provide new insights on proteins that might revolutionize medicine Right now we don't know if quantum computers will be just a very specialized tool or a big revolution for humanity We have no idea where the limits of technology are and there's only one way to find out This video is supported by the australian academy a great video. There's other videos, but I didn't want to like really drag it on To too too long, but oh yeah anyhow yeah quantum computing is a really going to start taking off Next to a lot of other things that's been going on in news. I don't know if y'all been paying attention to the bitcoin Bitcoin if you got your digital wallet you cryptocurrency building up in your wallet. You're going to be missing out on the the next spikes in the Bitcoin Community and It's really interesting stuff. How that works, but I'm not going to go into detail on the bitcoin, but You know I definitely do want to recommend Some of the computers that they have is an intel computer I Hadn't I didn't even know they had these kinds of computers for three hundred like three hundred and Eighty-two dollars really seventy-five cents? I'm looking at this thing and it's got a uh it's got a sixth generation intel Core I5 Six two six zero so that I'm loving that shit, so you know Grab that thing I mean, it's a steal I'm totally for that because I just bought a six hundred dollar computer but this is this is a nice deal right here because I have a desktop that don't even have an I5 and That's it's kind of like moore's law to talk about you. Don't know moore's law is it means that a computing power doubles? enough speed exponential growth in power and speed and and even Shrinks in size About about half as well, okay It goes down even more in size and doubles and speed every 18 months a year and a half. That's moore's law So yeah look at this you already got a piece of hardware through hundred Eighty-two dollars oh Yeah, that's part of moore's law - like the price goes lower all I could look it up Moore's laws nice stuff Yeah, go ahead and keep this piece of hardware out of this a nice little piece of hardware. I even know existed Good to show you because I got a I got a uh this computer right here since the Beach days Man, I'm looking at this computers pushing like 11 years old. I'm still spotting the operating system from 11 years ago on this computer It's really interesting, but you know go ahead and pick it up links in the description All right get that present for you. Uh for you a friend of family Peace. I'll see you in the next video
