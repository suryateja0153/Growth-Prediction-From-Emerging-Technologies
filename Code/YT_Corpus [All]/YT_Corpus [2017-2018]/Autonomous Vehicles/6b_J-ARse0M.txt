 I think that that is going to be one of the big issues. Is when individuals are going in, when these vehicles are eventually ready for sale and on the market place, there's a big difference between going in and buying a level two vehicle and a level five vehicles, and we're putting that up to the dealerships and the purchase yard to understand exactly what this vehicle can do and how to switch from mode to mode. That's going to create a lot of issues. It reminds me of that crazy story of that gentleman that bought the RV and put it in cruise control and went to the back to take a nap because he thought the car was going to drive itself. That's a kind I think we're gonna see happen because we're relying on individuals in our community to understand this complex technology, and we've got some of the smartest engineers at Carnegie Mellon working around the stuff and trying to figure out. Taking out the keys over to someone that has been used to driving a stick shift their whole life. It's a big jump. Yeah. It sure is. It's obviously a learning curve here for everyone. I think we're far off from getting to those level five vehicles being on the road. It seems like it. I think we're generations. My guess is I think we are a generation away from them.
