 [TITLE & MUSIC] Hi there smart drivers. Rick with Smart Drive Test talking to you today about autonomous vehicles--self-driving vehicles and why these are not going to take over a roadway anytime in the 21st century. I got six reasons why they're not going to overtake our roadways. Now just before we get started here, be sure to hit that subscribe button just about there. That way you'll get access to all of the great information for those of you working towards a license or starting your career is a truck or bus driver. As well, be sure to hit that "bell." That way you'll get instant notification. Now autonomous vehicles have been made famous by Tesla and Elon Musk who is the public figure and the billionaire who started the compan...and his team, And as well, social media... the media in general have promoted that autonomous vehicles are going to appear on our roadways and very soon. When in fact, they're probably not going to appear on our roadways anytime in the 21st century. I had a few smart drivers on the shifting theory video say that taxi drivers, bus drivers, and truck drivers very soon we're going to be out of business. As well, I've had a lot of smart drivers ask me why big trucks do not have automatic transmissions in them and why they still have non-synchromesh-- what's called as crash box transmissions--and then why they're so difficult to drive. Well technology--the limitation of technology--and the sheer forces involved in moving huge amounts of weight in big trucks--some of them up to as much as 140 thousand pounds or sixty three thousand five hundred kilograms. So they're big, heavy and there are lots and lots of forces there. And you need some very durable technology in place in order to be able to move that kind of mass. Autonomous vehicles - two questions I'm gonna ask you about autonomous vehicles. The first question I'm gonna ask you is: when was the last time you rebooted your computer restarted your computer to get it to work? Was it a week ago, a month ago, or a few months ago. Answer that question... just have a think about that. The second question I'm going to ask you is, if an autonomous vehicle showed up outside your doorway, would you get in that vehicle and let it take you for a two or three hour drive. Just ask yourself that question while we're getting going here and we'll be back to give you the six reasons why autonomous vehicles are not going to take over our roadways anytime in the twenty-first century. So stick around, and be right back. [INTRO & MUSIC they're smart drivers welcome back Rick with smart drive test talking to you today about six reasons why autonomous vehicles are not going to take over our roadways in the 21st century the first reason is the simple complexity of driving and when I that's an oxymoron when I say the simple complexity of driving because driving is probably the most complex tasks that we do on a daily basis Harold Smith who is the originator of the idea of the Smith's space cushion system which is the basis of defensive driving that he formulated that seventy years ago and that still forms the basis of defensive driving and is the guiding principles for any driver education course that teaches defensive driving Harold Smith came up with the idea of the Smith's prescription system and stated in that that we as drivers make a hundred decisions per kilometre or per mile of driving so the decision-making process and the processing of information as we're driving is highly complex highly dynamic and ongoing so the complexity of driving the best analogy that I ever saw in terms of describing the complexity of driving was in the VicRoads on the road to solo driving which is their driving manual they're in the state of Victoria in Australia and they come up with this analogy between sports and driving now if I asked you the question of whether sports is dynamic or whether sports is static most of us myself included when I was first asked this question would say that sports in fact he is dynamic however if you take a closer look at sports and look at the field of sports regardless of whether you're playing hockey you're playing football you're playing netball or whatever sport you're playing the field or the court is the same dimensions all the time so if you're playing basketball you're playing on the same court the lines are in the same place there so the distances between the lines is the same for that sport same with hockey same with gridiron football or whatever sport yours playing the field is the same all of the time the players who are playing the sport are all approximately the same age they're the same gender they have the same ability so all the players are the same the equipment that they use is the same they all have the same equipment if they're playing gridiron football for example they all have helmets on they all have shoulder pads and knee pads and other types of protective equipment that they're using to play the game they play the game at the same time every day and for the most part if they're playing footie in Australia or you're playing soccer or you're playing gridiron football the seasons are the same every year you play it at the same time of year so the lighting conditions are going to be the same all of the time and then the objective of the players is the same to score a goal now if you look at that in terms of driving the task of driving is that the playing field that drivers are driving on is not the same you can start at your house on a residential Road drive out onto a two-lane roadway that's 60 kilometers an hour 40 miles an hour and then be out on a highway within a few short minutes and driving on a roadway that can be 80 kilometers an hour 100 kilometers an hour 50-100 miles an hour so the playing environment for driving is different the people who are driving are all different ages and abilities in their driving many of them will have physical disabilities that will limit their ability to drive and those types of things they're all driving with different types of vehicles Road user can be pedestrians cyclists scooter people on scooters motorcycles cars trucks buses big trucks trams and trolleys all those types of things so the equipment that we're using on our roadways varies vastly the ability of the players we can drive at any time of the day 24 hours in the dark and the light glaring Sun pouring rain driving snow all of those types of things in weather is going to have a huge impact on our ability to drive and then finally the the objective of the drivers is not the same as the sports players the objective of drivers can be anything they're going anywhere they're going to the grocery store they're going to see their friends they're going to church or whatnot so the objective of the draw ours is different so you can see that there's some a good analogy there which describes how dynamic driving is and how complicated that task of driving is and how much it requires us to be able to make decisions ongoing as we're driving all the time and to process that information that's coming in and not all of the information for driving is visual information only about 90% of it there's another bit of that information that is listening to the vehicle and feeling the vehicle smelling different environments and those types of things that also are information that is relevant to driving so our computer is going to be able to do that in terms of autonomous vehicles in the simple complexity of driving the second reason that autonomous vehicles are not going to overtake our roadways anytime soon is technology the sheer amount of R&D that is going on in terms of developing technology to pilot these vehicles is astronomical and probably the leader of the technology to build autonomous vehicles is Google and the Google cars which have driven hundreds of millions of miles accident-free now the question that I ask is how much how many support personnel are sitting in the background making sure that those vehicles are going where they're supposed to be going or is it simply the software and computer engineering that is allowing that vehicle to go forward and in terms of technology one of the factors is the size of the technology you see that large dome on top of the Google car and the lind ours it's called which allows a 360° scan of its environment that is a huge piece of technology now are you going to be able to take that technology and shrink it down so that it's in the vehicle and makes the vehicle look attractive like a sports vehicle like a high-end premium car that people are going to buy and want to buy or they want that big dome on the top of their vehicle people are not going to be attracted to that kind of technology so somehow the technology the sensor technology that you need to pilot vehicles autonomously up and down the road is going to have to become have to be able to be in a size that they can hide it in the vehicle and it's not really readily apparent or the shape of vehicles is going to have to change dramatically so that is one aspect of the technology the other aspect of the technology is how does this technology navigate these vehicles do we have some sort of guiding strip in the roadway some of the preliminary sensors detect road markings what if the road marking is off did they used Global Positioning satellites and as we know Global Positioning satellites even in this day and age are only accurate to about two meters in most places and when you're driving sometimes satellites and the tracking and the piloting of the vehicle has to be within inches or centimeters it cannot be within two meters because if you're within two meters you're going to have a crash so how do we how does the technology move these vehicles and pilot these vehicles up and down the roadway and finally the other question about technology and whether it's going to be able to move the vehicle up and down the roadway is digitized map scan these use digital maps in order to navigate the vehicles up and down the roadway and as it says an article by will night yes the article was written four years ago but it's still relevant today's technology in the fact of keeping digital maps up to date the world is ever-changing we're changing roads we're building new structures and those types of things the monumental task of keeping those digital maps up-to-date to pilot these autonomous vehicles up and down the roadway cannot be underestimated so the technology the size of the technology and then bringing the technology down to a size that you can fit it into a modern autonomous vehicle and make it attractive to the consumer and make it affordable to the consumer so that the consumer will want to buy the vehicle and allow it to go up and down the roadway is another limiting factor and just going back to the complexity of driving I know some of you are going to mention blue the computer a few years ago maybe a couple of decades now that was able to be able to beat and match the top chess players in the world and again I come back to the analogy that I used in reason number one of the complexity of driving is again chess is on a board and the movements of the chess players of the chess pieces rather is static and open to mathematical calculation and is very cut and dry and of course there aren't any risk of life in terms of playing chess so the computer technology and the ability of computers to reach a level of art artificial intelligence that somewhat simulates our brain and our ability to make decisions at an ongoing pace is going to be one of the limiting factors in terms of autonomous vehicles becoming available to mass consumerism the third reason why autonomous vehicles are not going to be overtaking our roadways anytime soon is ergonomic sand this organ Amin that Joshua Brown was killed on the seventh of May in 2016 in the state of Florida driving his Tesla car now what happened is is that the sensors on the Tesla car became confused by the bright sunlight glaring off the side of a white semi-trailer and the vehicle drove into the side of the trailer unfortunately killing Joshua Brown he was the first fatality in an autonomous vehicle crash and there was an investigation which exonerated the Tesla company in the fact that there were no less than six warnings for Joshua Brown to take over this raises a very serious question in terms of the technology of autonomous vehicles the interaction between humans and machines which is called a ergonomics it's our interaction between machines which makes them easier for us to use makes them user friendly and as well makes them safe so is the technology going to be safe now the first generation of autonomous vehicles is going to require the attention of the driver now don't get me wrong in terms of all of this that I'm talking about that they are coming anytime soon I'm all for autonomous vehicles I want an autonomous vehicle I want a vehicle that I can go out and get into and I can read a book or talk on the phone or have a conversation with somebody else you know in the movies the way it in the movies I would love to be able to do that however this first generation of autonomous vehicles when somebody has to interact with the vehicle and take over if the sensors become overwhelmed or the computer cannot deal with the traffic situation that is being presented to it how long does it take that driver him or her to come back into that complex driving situation you have to assess the situation and you have to determine what action to take in a very small space of time sometimes a fraction of a second is the sensors and the technology in the vehicle going to be able to give you enough warning that you're going to be able to come back assess the situation and take appropriate action to interact with that vehicle and that in right now is probably the biggest barrier to autonomous vehicles being on our roadways and being allowed on our roadways that issue of ergonomics and the interaction between human beings and the autonomous vehicle in the autonomous vehicle not being able to handle the situation and the human being or the driver having to come back into it and take over and make a safe decision and make a strategic move that is going to potentially save their life and other road users lives and that as far as I'm concerned is probably the biggest barrier to autonomous vehicles not becoming widespread any time soon reason number four of why autonomous vehicles are not going to take our roadways over anytime soon is the issue of ethics and the issue of ethics was explored in the movie I Robot starring Will Smith which also had autonomous vehicles in it but it wasn't the autonomous vehicle that made an ethical decision in the movie I Robot the ethical decision was there was a crash on a bridge involving Will Smith's vehicle and the another vehicle containing a little girl and the robot in the movie saved Will Smith made calculations about the chances for survival in the event of the crash didn't say the little girl and saved Will Smith while he lived with that guilt that the robot did not save the little girl when it is that's the ethical choice that it should have made as opposed to saving him he felt bad about their and carried that guilt and that guilt influenced his decisions and his feelings about the robots in the movie even though he was a cop so it's an interesting movie so have a look at it but it comes back to autonomous vehicles if there's going to be a crash and there will be crashes because it's traffic and it's motor vehicles and there's always crashes there are 33,000 people a year killed in the United States of America due to traffic crashes and it's exponentially more than that who are injured in traffic crashes so there are going to be crashes and the ethical decision making process of this computer technology is it going to decide for example if it's cut if the vehicle is coming through an intersection and a child steps off the curb into the path of the vehicle is that vehicle going to choose to run over the child or sideswipe the vehicle beside it these are the ethical decisions and ethical decision making processes that need to be considered with these computers that are guiding autonomous vehicles and this is going to come to the fore because all the choices that these computers need to make in order to safely navigate a vehicle down the roadway need to be programmed into the software in addition these ethical decisions that are going to be debated for years and years and years to come how do you teach a computer to make an ethical choice between a small child and sideswiping another vehicle where there probably won't be any injuries or fatalities in that sort of a crash because sites wave crashes are very usually very low casualties and very low injuries but again there are many variables that go into that and it's a dynamic situation and things could change the vehicle could hit a curb or a Smit barrier or flip over or something that then you do have fatalities in the crash so there's a ethical decisions as well that need to go into this and these really tough questions need to be answered and until these really tough questions are answered autonomous vehicles probably are going to be delayed being available for mass consumerism the fifth reason that autonomous vehicles aren't going to be taking over our roadways anytime soon is the social protest the protest of those heavily vested in the current infrastructure of drivers in cars and the you know people who want to buy these vehicles the manufacturing the oil companies and all this huge infrastructure for those of you who know me and have been following some of my videos know that my doctorate thesis looked at the transition of horse-drawn traffic to motor traffic so you're looking at the transition from one huge transportation infrastructure of the horse to another transportation system of the motorcar and there were huge battles that went on between those two infrastructures for the transition from one to the other because it wasn't a simple transition and you think of cars with drivers in them to an autonomous vehicle infrastructure and the will Knight who wrote the MIT article he talks about that a little bit he talks about Google as being the forerunner in autonomous vehicles but the fact that that Google doesn't have any experience in building automobiles so how do they build automobiles when they're a online search engine company that does online advertising how do they go from that to building cars so you have this huge social protest that's going to be in place not so much protest but you're going to have a resistance and in terms of that social protest you're gonna have hackers are gonna hack into the software and that is going to be one of the other huge factors that's going to prevent the moving forward of autonomous vehicles and just on an example of that in the early 19th century in England when the steam engine came in it was applied to the loom which was manufacturing textiles and our clothing and those types of things when the steam engine came in the steam engine was attached to these power looms and one person with a steam engine loom could now do the work of 300 workers you had the creation of the Luddites who would break into textile plants and destroy these steam engines because they were being put out of work so if we have autonomous vehicles coming in and you now have taxi drivers and bus drivers and truck drivers and other people who deliver services and goods and freight as part of their job what is the social protest what is the pushback on that because these people are no longer employed because of what autonomous vehicles are overtaking their jobs and again terrorism hackers those types of things these are all questions and barriers that have to be answered in terms of autonomous vehicles how are we going to replace those jobs how we're going to put those people to keep working so we have the social protest aspect and the transition from one huge automotive infrastructure to another huge automotive infrastructure that is going to see a lot of people being displaced a lot of people being put out of work and one more point about the social protest is the traditionalists those of us who like driving we like driving cars we don't want to get in an autonomous vehicle we want to get in a vehicle we want to have control of the vehicle and we want to drive it so that is another aspect of why autonomous vehicles aren't going to be taking our roadways over anytime soon the last reason that autonomous vehicles are not going to be overtaking our roadways anytime soon I've alluded to this earlier but it's the cost of the technology in the cost of developing an enormous infrastructure to build create teach new drivers how to operate autonomous vehicles and having you know if they're going to be electric cars we need to have more electric hookup outlets where we can recharge our vehicles and those types of things so in terms of creating the technology and making the technology smaller how much is that going to cost as I alluded to earlier in the video the Lindner on the top of the Google car that piece of technology costs eighty thousand dollars well for most of us that that is ten times more what we're willing to pay for an automobile currently so how long is it going to take the technology to come down in price as well again the aesthetics of the motor vehicles what is the vehicle going to look like with all of these sensors and those types of things in it and what is the cost of making those smaller and making them readily of for mass consumerism is that even a possibility that we can that the engineers automotive engineers software engineers and everyone else who is involved in the development of this technology is is it ever going to be feasible to create an entire infrastructure with autonomous vehicles and the other thing the question becomes in terms of cost if the price of a motor vehicle goes up to sixty or seventy thousand dollars that is probably right on the sort of high-water mark of the amount of money that we as consumers are willing to pay for an automobile and then the thing is is that we say ok it's an autonomous vehicle and it's $60,000 are we just willing to drive our own vehicles and say listen you know I can pick this one up for 20 or 25,000 or 30,000 dollars and I'm gonna drive that motor vehicle so these are the other questions and the last one it always comes down to the cost of the vehicle how much is the cost of the vehicle and does the cost of the vehicle outweigh the benefits are the benefits of having an autonomous vehicle going to be worth the cost of having it and they talk about this is that we're going to have increased fuel economy because the vehicles are going to be able to follow closer together and they're going to get better fuel economy we're going to reduce congestion in large cities and those types of things I really don't think that the technology is even close to beginning to have the benefits of all of that that they're projecting for autonomous vehicles that they're going to reduce traffic congestion they're going to reduce pollution they're going to have a smaller smaller environmental footprint and the fact that they're going to increase the economy of vehicles and those types of things and what are these vehicles even going to be powered by are they're going to be petrol engines in another twenty or thirty years are we still going to be drilling for oil and those types of things so the last factor of why autonomous vehicles are not going to be taking over our roadways anytime soon is the cost and the cost versus the benefits and due mass consumers do the general public do we want these autonomous vehicles or we do want to continue to drive our own vehicles so that's the last reason why autonomous vehicles won't be taking over our roadways anytime soon quick review of why autonomous vehicles will not be overtaking our roadways anytime the first reason was the complexity of driving the sheer number of decisions that need to be made by drivers and as well in the article by will Knight the MIT article he was talking about being in a cab in Europe and the driver who said to him that the reason the taxi drivers were so good was the $0.07 that heightened awareness of being able to determine traffic patterns and the actions of other road users on the roadway as you're driving and it's kind of like any professional who does something all the time drivers who work for a living have a higher sense and ability to predict traffic patterns and the actions of other road users so that's the first reason why autonomous vehicles are not going to overtake our roadways any time soon the second reason is technology just developing the technology and getting the technology to a point where it's not huge and cumbersome and compromises the aesthetic value of Motor Vehicles because most of us do really like the lines of fast sports car and what that looks like in high-end cars and those types of things so getting the technology to a point where not only is it small enough to fit into motor vehicles but also makes the motor vehicle look good and is reliable and can actually do the task of piloting the vehicle in traffic not just on highways but in our urban environments as well the third one is ergonomic s' the interaction between the driver and the vehicle and whether the technology is going to be advanced enough that the driver doesn't have to come back into the driving task and take over and try to save him or him or herself and to save other road users on the roadway then there's the ethical issue of these computers in these vehicles and when traffic crashes occur what is the ethical dilemma that these computers what is this decision that they're going to make and if you haven't seen iRobot already definitely have a look at that because it addresses that ethical issue that these autonomous vehicles are going to have to address to be available to mass consumerism and then as well the social protest the traditionalists who want to drive their own vehicles and don't actually want autonomous vehicles the cost of the motor vehicle that's another reason is the cost of this technology and is it going to outweigh the benefits of having self-driving vehicles or are we just going to be more beneficial with people who work as taxi drivers work as bus drivers or truck drivers does that out does that benefit outweigh the cost in other words is it cheaper to pay people to drive vehicles or the cost of the technology for autonomous vehicles is it really going to have all of the benefits that they say it's going to have of reducing congestion in urban areas reducing the environmental footprint that vehicles currently have and as well increasing fuel economy the other question of autonomous vehicles and vehicles in the future in general is is what is the power source that we are going to use are we still going to be driving petrol engines engines that burn gasoline and diesel fuel in another 20 30 40 years and I know that the media is touting electricity is the new environmental fuel source for cars but the problem is is that somehow electricity has to be generated here in North America or one of the few countries in the world that actually generates electricity from hydroelectric dams where we're using the power of water to generate electricity a lot of companies in our countries in the world still burn coal to generate electricity so that is not really a viable environmental alternative to petrol engines because we can make petrol engines more efficient I thoroughly convinced that we in fact can make petrol engines more efficient but electricity is not the viable alternative that we're looking for in terms of a power source to reduce the environmental footprint of motor vehicles so the social protest component consists of people who are going to lose their jobs because of autonomous vehicles as well people who are resistant to the technology and are going to hack the software in these autonomous vehicles and present a form of terrorism that has to be dealt with in terms of autonomous vehicles because when that happens when we get people who are hacking the technology the same as the Luddites in the early 19th century who broke in to see factories and destroyed the equipment you get hackers hacking into the software and people are dying it makes it so that it's not reliable and people don't feel safe and when people don't feel safe they're not going to buy the technology so that's the last one of the one of the biggest barriers one of the bigger barriers to autonomous vehicles not overtaking our roadways question
