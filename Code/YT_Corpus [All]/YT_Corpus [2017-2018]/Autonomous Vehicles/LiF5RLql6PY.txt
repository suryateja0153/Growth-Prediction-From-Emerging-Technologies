 Hi, I am Grayson Brulte and welcome to another episode of The Road To Autonomy Today we are here ay DeepMap headquarters in Palo Alto, CA to discuss the vital, critical role that 3D mapping will play in the future of autonomous driving DeepMap is a software company based in Palo Alto We make a special software that helps self-driving cars see the road - it's call high-definition maps and it's a software stack that helps the cars be able to sense the world better and it helps the cars to see the world when there onboard camera and other sensors can not see When we drive as humans right we can we make sense of what we see because we know exactly were everything is we can process everything Our eyes are basically like the LiDAR and camera data on self-driving cars Our brains process that information and it can localize ourselves and pretty actually drive in to within say centimeters on the road The robotic system does not know how to do that on it's on so it needs a map to help locate itself in the real-world What we do in our brains and using our eyes is we need to do for a self-driving car using the HD map and also sensors like LiDAR, etc an HD map is absolutely essential for safe self-driving and we use machine learning to help us derive information such as lane markings on the road, stop signs, traffic lights and so on we also need to figure out how we actually associate them as well So supposed you actually come to an intersection, we not only need to tell you were the intersection is, we also need to tell you if you are going to make a right turn you not only need to pay attention to the intersection in front of you, you also have to pay attention to the cross walk to your right To be more precise we don't actually read that white line as we are driving, because we do not believe in using camera data for localization Oh, thank you, thank you We use, it's the map data that we have pre-loaded and then the real-time scanning of the LiDAR scanning that is predicting were that center line is I believe that LiDAR is the secret glue So, came to me and said we would love to give you a to try out and my wife was like OK, let's go up to Monetico for the night So we are driving up to Monetico and the car starts driving off the highway because of the line My wife was like what the heck and it couldn't do the 405 and 101 interchange the red thing came on and said warning crash intendment because it was all based on cameras and it was a really unsafe and when you drive it you are like uh-oh and you really start to understand how LiDAR is that secret sauce and when I am seeing this, the break in the road but your technology mapping technology is seeing it when I have my three year old in the car I do not have to worry if the car is going to get a mind of it's own and start to due a u-turn because there is no line Not only is this better technology, it's safer technology Correct, we can actually drive the same routes without any lines, road markings So this would look the same and the car would drive safely event without say if you had lots of mud or whatever It's amazing that you pickup all of lights, the traffic, it's really amazing So the approach that we take as you probably seen in the car is that we do not want to build a special survey fleet we do not necessarily so what we do not have to scan the road ahead of time just to create maps ahead of time What we do instead is that we piggy back on self-driving fleets and using their sensor data to make the maps so as you can imagine as the market adopts self-driving cars when self-driving cars become more and more prevalent Just like how smartphones gradually overtook, let's say the traditional phones Our maps will grow with that trend as well, so it can become a very viral and we and when that happens the map creation becomes very easy and can happen literally overnight and again, we only use a single 32 line LiDAR for this How and why? How that is the complex piece That is the I wish I could give you an answer in 30 seconds, you know that is exactly, that is the complex part of it this is the non-trivial challenge we are trying to keep it really low spec as we can and you know the Waymo cars and the Apple cars, they all kind of fully loaded with senors That is fine and they need some of that for development and R&D purposes and for perception and other parts of the stack, but when it comes to what we do We are trying to keep it really simple down to a very efficient way of collecting data using a single LiDAR 32 lines You could probably do it with 2 16's and two cameras front facing and that is it If we can achieve this kind of level of This is remarkable Every parking spot, every Handicap, no parking, it's recording everything You are eliminating risk and if you saw that truck parked back there It did not get confused, so it was still able to localize the car and all of the parking spaces and lines with the truck parked James, thank you very much for taking the time today to show us the future of 3D mapping with this incredible tour and I really enjoyed our conversation as always, I am looking forward to many many more in the future Same here, you are always welcome Well thank you lunch, breakfast, dinner I am going to move in the office and setup a little tent It's great to have you and obviously as you know we have some interesting work going on together So we will continue Awesome thank you Grayson, appreciate it Thank you
