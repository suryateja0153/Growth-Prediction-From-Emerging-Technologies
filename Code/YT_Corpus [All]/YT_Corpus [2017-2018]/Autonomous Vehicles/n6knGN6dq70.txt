 set our global automotive team so all of our leaders from automotive around the world have been talking about what's going on in auto where are things going next and it's been absolutely fascinating and intriguing conversation and just if we could they kept Gemini people from our auto practice if you could quickly just raise your hand so as you see there's a few of us around so again after the event if you want to kind of get some prerogative and our thinking around Auto while we encourage you to do so but it's absolutely staggering and fascinating to see what's going on in the world of mobility and transportation and we're really intrigued and excited tonight to have Sunil joining us and one question that I have for Sunil and he does not have to answer this but I'm thinking that you're if you're a pioneer in the autonomous space in the ride-sharing space like just how did you arrive here tonight was it like by drone was it like some kind of amazing new technology so maybe he'll shed a little light on that but let me hand it over to our partner and and and my friend Pete Layden who's uh who's helped us so much with this conference series and he'll guide us for the rest of the night thank you again for joining us thanks Joe thanks Capgemini and this is like you said this is the series that keeps growing in fact we're gonna be going to New York actually in the fall for those there's a lot folk you who haven't been here and so it's worth just touching base on what makes this a little different one of the things is is there's no way one person can fully understand and get a handle on all the innovation just exploding throughout the San Francisco Bay region right now and so what we've done with this series is each month we go to a different field that's having this kind of explosion innovation and we basically focus on it one and systematically kind of move through them all over the course of the year and now it's our year to in this thing and so tonight we're going to autonomous vehicles and autonomous vehicles hot topic a confusing topic one that's a ton of energy but a ton of kind of confusion on where it where is this going to go what's really real what's happening so that's the field the second thing we do is we always try to focus on one remarkable well usually one remarkable innovator for one of the better word of thought leader in that space who can tell us what's really going on now and where is that field going and in this case we've got Sunil Paul and Sunil in this space in 2011 was one of the cofounders of sidecar and they really were helped really invent the ride-sharing model the montt ride-sharing space and in fact through their tenure they're expanding nationally and just last year sold the last of their assets off and kind of ended their run by selling it off to GM now the beauty of this in a way is he's not a CEO he was that by the way the CEO through that whole period he's not the CEO of a company and honestly that's great because it's a feature not a bug as they say in technology because we've got an independent mind who can say whatever he wants to say has no agenda to drive and no kind of predilection I'm really where the fields going he's just gonna give you his hit on what he has learned in his time and what he's been learning in the last year since leaving that space the other thing about soon yellow is is a serial entrepreneur he's done other things he was the co-founder of bright male among others bright male is a kind of a email filtering company and I understand though he has promised his wife he will not start another company for one year and give himself a space so we'll see how that goes but uh so do serial entrepreneur remarkable person third thing about this is it's what's happening now like what's now in San Francisco and so we really don't want people to do cans speeches or what they've been doing on the circuit we want them to talk about what they're grappling with now what's their new idea what are the questions that really stymieing them how are they wrestling with it and for that we've got it fresh off the right off his brain here because he was working all weekend on this thing and he only sent us the deck that he wants to run through quickly it's a couple hours ago so you are getting about as raw kind of a studio as you can get here the final thing that's other thing that we do want to do is we want to think forward and we want to think what where's this is going and one of the beauties of Sanel is he's not just an entrepreneur a tech guy he actually did a stint as a policy analyst at the congressional office of the congressional office of Technology Assessment basically and so he has actually spent a lot of time thinking about policy and in this space also thinking about policy and looking ahead on what we can actually think about that and the final thing I'll say about what's now is it's really you folks the beauty of this is it's an invite-only gathering everyone here brings something interesting to the table and the con half of this event is going to be interacting with you hearing from your thoughts and interacting with Sunil you're on video as much as f on the front here so watch out for those video cameras room around here so with that I'm going to introduce and bring up Sunil Paul for a little intro here come on Cydia let's hear steel that was a very very kind intro well I gotta say first of all thank you Peter thank you cap Gemini for hosting here I've been to several of these events and they have all been really excellent so so thank you guys for putting this together I need my pointer and I need to hit my spot because we're live-streaming in fact if you want to say something about that and tweet out the thingy or whatever the URL here it's called try that because then you know people can watch it at the leisure they're their own time so 2009 is the first time I got to ride in autonomous vehicle at Stanford in their autonomous vehicle program but in preparation for this talk I I thought why am i so fascinated by transportation and I realized that when I was four years old I came to the United States it was 1968 yeah I'm kind of 1968 snowing outside Oklahoma City he and my mom my sister traveling to my father's house and the thing that I'm told I'm told the big observation I had about the United States was wow so many cars so many cars only a couple days earlier I had been in a town border town in India where the transportation was walking and you know maybe occasionally a horse buggy so in that short couple of days I had experienced a dislocation and transportation that's comparable to what happened in the United States over the course of about 50 years and so I think that was the beginning of my fast with with transportation and right now what's going on with autonomous vehicles is a comparable kind of total change in transportation and it will fundamentally change all kinds of things all kinds of things that we do in society the world we had today is built around the car and our future world is going to be built around the autonomous car so we'll talk about some of those things tonight this is some of the things that I want to talk about tonight it's one of the most beautiful charts I've ever created I worked all weekend on this so I hope you'll appreciate it we're going to talk about why the pace of innovations move faster than I think conventional wisdom why the AV companies are actually in great danger of running into a terrible business why car sales are going to plummet why a B sales are going to boom and what the distinction is and then we're going to touch on how cities and suburbs are going to change a lot we're introduced to new ideas one is something that I'm calling how cities will densifies something I'm calling part will explain more about that later it's a new model for deploying autonomous vehicles and the growth of extreme suburbs that I'm calling the ultra burbs and we'll talk more about that as well there is so much more like this area there's just so many more other opportunities to talk about things Peter talked about my background understanding of regulation at sidecar we have a C dealt with a lot of regulation there's a significant issue there climate change so I'm going to care a lot about but we don't have time to get into all the details maybe we can during a QA and by the way all this is only is talking really about more or less passenger sized vehicles that can become autonomous we're not even talking about drones and vertical takeoff aircraft and Seabourn autonomous vehicles there is so much more there is so much more going on in this world but just this world by itself just this passenger and some delivery is going to be a big deal so conventional wisdom you know here's a chart from one of the analysts out there talking about how will autonomous cars be rolled out and you know it's basically now-ish is when they'll be experiments and they'll be slow adoption and somewhere in kind of a 2030 2040 timeframe they'll start to be significant consumer adoption and then it's not until the 40s or 50s that we really get to full scale adoption of autonomous vehicles so there are other kind of plus and minus off this but I'm interested how many people in this audience think that was define it that more than 50 by what year well more than 50 percent of Americans have at least some regular interaction right in an autonomous vehicle who says by 2050 like at least by 2050 okay so what about 2040 what about 2030 it's getting pretty close okay who says in 10 oh okay okay yeah that's good what about never thank you thank you that's an excellent question I want to hear more about that what about just 10 years from now oh wow okay well maybe it's because I queued up or maybe that I don't know why but that's interesting that there's at least what 20 percent 25 percent who think in 10 years we'll get to 50 percent right on I'm with you so in thinking about this problem this opportunity I think you this slide seems so obvious but to me the beauty of it is how obvious it is what is the fundamental nature of autonomous vehicle it has no driver and it's very safe I also worked really hard on this one by the way but why does that matter well the reason why conventional wisdom is wrong is because of that fundamental nature of autonomous vehicles and the fundamental nature of ride-sharing networks it's worthwhile to pause when we think about the timeframes and recognize realize that ride-sharing is only a little bit over five years old and black car uber is only about seven years old and so we've gotten to something like between depending on how you count it twenty to thirty percent of the US population is using some form of ride-sharing like that's a staggering development and it's because of the business model so what are the fundamentals of this thing business well well one is that the cost of the ride is dominated by the come by the compensation to the driver if we look at the overall costs it's roughly about half second fundamental about costs is that the the second big driver is insurance out of that twenty to twenty five percent that the platform uber lyft whoever takes takes of the of the take at least half and in some cases as far more than half goes to insurance well when these two combine we're going to get a dramatic reduction in the cost of ride-sharing at least a reduction by half and combine that with the ability to put people in the same car lyft line uber pool we used to call shared rides you get a dramatic reduction and we'll get this new reality which is autonomous cars plus ride-sharing it's going to result in the convenience of a car at a price that's something like today's transit prices which are heavily heavily subsidized this is why we'll get such rapid adoption now this is not new insight Morgan Stanley has been saying it for years I haven't shown this and others but I'm rather surprised that the conventional is not yet fully embraced it perhaps because the conventional wisdom is still thinking about automobile adoption they're thinking about well how long did it take for intellect to get adopted etc etc and it's just it's the wrong way to think about it because people will be losing or get rid of their cars and start using these other networks because they are so convenient and so cheap so there is an obvious question which is what happens as a result of this rapid adoption and this is my conclusion but there may be a little bit of a saving grace so let's talk about why a tea makers are kind of screwed and while there may be maybe some opportunity so part one why are they screwed so again let's go back to fundamentals what is the fundamental nature of ride-sharing Network it is combining supply and demand in order to make the whole network work what are the characteristics of sorry supply and demand right this is a supply side so on the supply side what is most important is that you make sure the labor is fully utilized other words you've got a driver in the car you need to make sure that driver is busy all the time not down waiting for ride or trying to get to the pickup point the more productive they are the more efficient your network is the lower your cost can be in this new world where the driver is no longer there you still have a significant supply expense but now it's all capital you've got a huge expense to go buy these cars they're probably gonna be more expensive than traditional cars now you've got to figure out a way to fully utilize that capital if you spent a billion dollars on your fleet you'd better be able to rationalize an expense or a return off of that billion dollars and it turns it into it's just important fundamental in it for some you may be like okay what's the big deal well let's turn to fundamentals of demand the fundamental aspect about transportation demand generally and certainly we see it ride-sharing is that demand is super spiky the demand on a Friday afternoon at two o'clock and it's sunny it's you could walk is dramatically different than Friday night at 2:00 in the morning and it's raining the bars are closed you want to get home suddenly demand is 10x what it was twelve hours before we lived and breathed this problem and the fundamental aspect of a fleet is that a fleet cannot satisfy both part of the magic of ride-sharing is you get this very flexible supply that will come in and out and if you've got a fixed fleet you either have to compromise if compromise on one side of the other if you have to be willing to have an asset that sits around idle for most of the time but be able to satisfy that demand at 2:00 in the morning or you have to be willing to you know have a fleet that's more or less fully utilized even at 2:00 o'clock and on a Friday but at 2:00 in the morning you're gonna have a lot of upset customers who simply can't can't get right this fundamental is the same reason why we own private cars like why don't we own private cars because you're willing to pay for that asset it sits around 95% of the time doing nothing but you always do it because you have instantaneous demand isn't a nice access well ok so and so the nature of this is that we look at all of the different audio auto autonomous vehicle companies they're all trying to build out their fleets build out their fleets with the idea that that will be their way of competing in this new world but it's not possible to do just with a fixed fleet there's going to need to be another model and perhaps there are ways to do it but I certainly don't see it in a way that that existing AV companies are thinking about it so this is kind of problem number one there's a second reason why why AV companies are screwed and it comes down to the industry structure all right so let's take a look at in this future world will demand look like what will supply look like well on the supply side you get a lot of companies this is just happens to be the list of companies that have gotten permits in California for on driving it doesn't even count I'm sure there got to be dozens maybe an equal list of others that either want to be on that list or not yet on it stealth mode whatever or volumes that aren't on this list there's a lot of companies who want to be able to provide the supply meanwhile let's look at the demand and every once in a while there's going to be a regional provider so there's only four companies in any area for the most part that are really able to supply demand and if you think Hoover's big on demand Google and Apple are easily 10x the demand and you guys understand what I mean by this Google and Apple both have a map product people are going to maps they're trying to figure out where they're going and those companies are already providing directions on how to get to that of a location so let's play out a scenario where an AV company tries to it tries to compete tries to build up their own demand Network you have to concentrate your deployment you can't say ok I've got a hundred thousand vehicles I'm going to sprinkle them around the globe you've got to deploy in a particular area if you want any demand because you've got to get adequate coverage for for a ride so let's say you deploy in Phoenix or Singapore or San Francisco or wherever where will the demand come from well maybe you've got a lead maybe you've got a lead of I don't think anyone thinks that they got more than to your lead by the way they all seem to think they've got a 2-year lead but maybe you've got a lead and you can get a bunch of demand just from that lead people come to you you're half the price of uber and whatever the regional competitor is but meanwhile there is a huge amount of demand sitting behind the uber app the Google Maps and Apple maps and where the regional company is and they're not going to stand still and just let you take that market I mean the simplest thing they could do is subsidize the labor of the normal driver and hold on to their demand but within a few years somebody else will have the same product and they're going to be able to come into that same market and build their own demand network so this is I think sort of the second reason why companies are going to have a major problem is every every market is going to be dominated by a few big demand networks and it's going to be I think impossible to to kind of get out of that world we're already seeing this effect in place if you have not tried it go to uber and Apple and put in a request to go from A to B and in cities where different networks are available they will show you the kind of wait times for different kinds of ride-sharing this would never have happened if it were up to over by themselves but uber is willing to do this right normally their API their access to their network is only on an exclusive basis but here they have done it because it's a huge source of demand and the same will be true for any future autonomous vehicle company and of course if Google and Apple come up with their own product let's say it's a couple years behind whoever your favorite contender is they can simply slot it in and get that vertical integration so not pretty and so I think it leads to some fundamentals about the autonomous vehicle business it's going to be a red ocean a red ocean I think most people familiar but basically a category where there's little differentiation huge competition for margins and margins gets shrunk to nothing it's ugly imagine swimming in the ocean with a lot of sharks you want blue ocean you want blue ocean like a way that new category that doesn't quite exist yet and I don't see a lot of that and world now maybe maybe there's a silver lining in all this the silver lining first is well if you're not a company you've been living in a red ocean for your entire lifetime so so maybe it's not so bad and then you have an advantage because you're already used to having raised within margins you're already used to these big capital allocations so maybe you've got an advantage of this new world also I think the nature of autonomous vehicles is going to change and expand the category of vehicles so there'll be many more opportunities for niche products compared to what we have today because of safety requirements because of the proliferation of tastes because of longer commute times I think we'll see a proliferation of types of vehicles and that will open up opportunities for for startups but I got to say it's silver lining on a pretty dark cloud so what about salt car sales this has been a frequent question item of speculation well if you let's just let's just talk a little bit about car sales so here's my punchline cárcel car sales going to go off a cliff if you have access to this network you're not going to need to buy a new car autonomous sales autonomous vehicle market size is going to explode not necessarily and won't necessarily make up for the number of vehicles so why do I think that well a lot of it has to do with the experience of sidecar I started sidecar in part because I saw an opportunity to reduce the number of cars in the road I saw an opportunity to have an impact on climate change I saw an opportunity to improve congestion on the roads and over the course of that five years what I saw was interesting what I saw was that people were able to live in neighborhoods that were less accessible transportation and so they were using ride-sharing more often that's a good thing for them and certainly there are a lot of benefits that but it did result in more use I saw that we and others were creative about this new capability we're like wow on-demand people delivery how about on-demand stuff delivery and we and others started doing on-demand delivery and so now you've got Amazon uber all kinds of companies doing on-demand delivery of various sorts you can only expect that to increase so what happened here and it's something that I promise not to go into a rehash of your college economics course but it's something that goes back to guy named jebin whose economist back in late 1800s in England back then we were concerned about cold disappearing we're running out of coal supplies and one of his he started looking at this problem and realized that sorry important fact here engines were getting more and more efficient and so the idea was Wow okay engines are getting more efficient that's gonna save us from running out of coal but what Jevons realised is that as engines got more efficient they started being used more widely and and people started developing new applications for them so he coined this thing called the Jevens effect you have ins paradox and you might also know about it as the rebound effect and especially in energy conservation and really what it is is is pretty simple it's when there is a situation when lowering the price results in an outsized or improving the convenience results an outsized improvement or I miss it again imagine the top scenario is hamburgers you drop the price a little bit of fresh hamburger and you get a much bigger set of demand you drop the price by 10% and you might get a 20% or 30% increase in the demand for hamburgers right but it's not always that way different products of different ways so there's there's a different kind of known as elasticity curve like easier way to think about it's kind of a response curve there's a different way to think about it think about a cancer drug that will save your life right if you drop the price of that drug by 10% you're not going to use it 30% more you raise the price by 30% you're not going to use it less i that is an inelastic curve it is non-responsive to price so this curve you kind of think is how responsive is something to price so what's my point transportation is very responsive to price and come and convenience if you make transportation easier and cheaper people will use more of it that's again I think a fundamental thing if people are using more of it and we're also being creative about how we can use it they're going to be more and more autonomous vehicles to fill that demand so I see a tremendous increase in the amount of autonomous vehicles to fill that set of demands and I don't really I can't predict but I know that they'll be out there let's turn to one of the areas where I see autonomous vehicles having a big impact on on the way we live so the way that we have organized our really our society but the way that we organized cities and suburbs is I think probably many kin were familiar with this but like it is intimately intimately tied to the car and you know after World War two we basically said I want to build freeways or an organ I have access to suburbs and it's one of a long sequence of changes in the way that we live as a result transportation I live in a neighborhood that used to be called a streetcar suburb neighborhoods that were created made accessible because of the streetcar suburbs are kind of that same phenomenon for the automobile in the highway so I've asked myself well what happens when you have an autonomous car what happens to your willingness to trap there's an important idea that was developed in the 1970s it goes by marchetti's law and Marchetti was a researcher he uncovered some interesting research by another guy but the point is that what they found was when you look at the human willingness to commute to travel to and from your kind of tasks of life for the most part whether you look at different cities in sort of the 20th century or you look at the scope of Greek villages people are willing to travel about 30 minutes each way and so about an hour each day and this became known as marchetti's law and it's proven to be remarkably robust we look around at what happens when you make it more accessible reduced traffic in a particular corridor people typically are willing to travel further as a result well I think autonomous vehicles will break marchetti's law for a simple reason autonomous vehicle the experience will certainly there will be a commuting experience but increasingly you're going to be able to do other things in your car if you want to have dinner in your car it's not going to be today's car dinner experience of hamburger burrito whatever you have to be able to have one hand on the wheel and the other one holding on to your to your snack be able to have a regular meal think about a meal on an airplane or a train and if you want to watch a movie if you want to take a nap it will be more like traveling in in first-class or a private jet then then it is driving a car and the fact that more aspects of our lives will be possible inside an autonomous vehicle will change the nature of how we're willing to move around more Kenney's law will still apply in the sense that we're not going to be willing to you know purely commute more than about half an hour each way but so much more of our lives will be in this autonomous car and it also means that people will be willing to live further away from the city centers that combined with telecommuting I think will lead to the rise of what I'm calling the ultra burbs the ultra burbs are communities that are made accessible through a combination of autonomous vehicles and telecommuting and generally speaking we can talk about how this is good bad certainly see reasons for both directions but this is one of the one of the insights that I'm very interested in I'm going offline so much for telecommuting this is one of the ideas that I'm very interested in by getting feedback when Peter talked about there are these are ideas that are in formation this is one of them telecommuting telecommuting is the ability to work through means of computers and video conferencing and joint documents all of those capabilities so a second I guess I should back up a second back to fundamentals an improvement transportation is going to make the biggest difference where transportation is the biggest hassle today so part of the rise in the ultra burbs is because it's a huge hassle to travel these long distances to some place it's 45 an hour away from from where you work the other place that today is a huge pain in the ass to live in and to transport around is a city right in the city you have to worry about parking you have to worry about navigation it's more complex it is it is a difficult environment to navigate with a car and so the rise of autonomous vehicles will make cities far more livable we've already experienced that with ride-sharing and we see neighborhoods that are much more livable as a result of a variety on I think the same thing will be true of autonomous vehicles so far the way people have been thinking about autonomous vehicles are as simply automating what automating the vehicle like what can you do there's a another kind of concept that's also been developed for long distance travel called platooning platooning is simply the idea of allowing vehicles to follow very closely to one another the advantage when you're on a freeway is it reduces the drag I think about 10% fuel savings and there are companies out there developing that Daimler demonstrated this excetera what if we could use platooning in a city take small vehicles that navigate the smaller streets join up in main thoroughfares Platoon along the major thoroughfare and then break up as appropriate when they approach their their near destination so I'm calling this idea part as in Bart platooning autonomous rapid transit now I have to tell you I struggled with the name of this like this is how hard I work people I struggled with a name because I thought about maybe this doesn't sound like very doesn't sound like very much fun so I thought it maybe should be called party you know like maybe it's like it's spelled this way but if you're in the know you know to pronounce it party and then I thought well maybe it should be PRT i but then I couldn't figure out what I should stand for individual anyway it's it's part so so what's interesting about this is it could leverage a lot of the same infrastructure that's currently envisioned for bus rapid transit we already have systems in San Francisco and elsewhere where the public access to bus stops is accessible to private parties and they pay a fee for that access you can imagine a similar system there are all kinds of details that we worked out about how platooning starts and ends but I think all that can be figured out and take advantage of the fact that on certain quarters you really want high density at the same time you want the convenience being able to go door to door without how to transfer and change so this basically would combine the convenience of door-to-door transportation with the high density of transit so the consequence of this and other innovations I think will result in much much denser cities and we'll have these ultra burbs honestly I'm still unclear about what's going to happen with the suburbs it's possible that we'll have a stranded asset of transportation in in suburbs that will have you know that will be a kind of the new the new neighborhoods that unfortunately phones a zip line because they are stuck with this old model of transportation of the conventional car and all the infrastructure structure that's built around that more being discussed on that topic so some takeaways first of all AV adoption is happening much faster than I think most people except for the very smart 25% that are here I think it's coming faster than most people expect I think that it's going to be a bloodbath for autonomous vehicle makers that we're going to change the way that we live in cities we're going to see the rise of ultra burbs and the rise of dense cities and I mean I think a fundamental thing that is implicit in all this is this is a massive revolution and it is it's only just just beginning and then there's so much more to talk about like there is as a Peter and I talked about this talk there's so much on the cutting room floor of other things to talk about there's a Q&A session but things that I care deeply about like climate and others and by the way this is kind of this is the version you can just tweet maybe this is a better summary and so with that thank you very much the presentation is always a good little way to whet your appetite here and what I'm going to do here is afrin was just couple follow questions but also be thinking what you'd want to be talked in here on my team to vote his Qi Lisa Neil is nursing a voice here that the tea is going to help well here's what I would say I just want you to do a quickie here as we get teed up here because we had cheese a little bit of what you're going to talk about here is three questions that you actually could infer from this conversation but you couldn't really say exactly will autonomous vehicles make city safer or less safe you may give me a safer and so we give the rationale for that autonomous vehicles are going to be built by companies are being built by companies they have every incentive to be super paranoid for at least in the United States because of litigious nature of what we have in this country so it's not going to make economic sense to field vehicles that are not super safe and super paranoid about whether or not they're going to hit a pedestrian or bicyclist or even out of the car for that matter so I think it'll make it far safer there's some sort of game theory work that's been done to suggest that in some cities because of the prevalence of autonomous cars pedestrians will become emboldened and we'll make city centers or portions of city to desert certain cities impassable because pedestrians just like just walk wherever they want and don't pay any mind to the to the autonomous car and kind of clog up the streets I think this is one of those areas that as those problems developed will we'll figure out solutions the existing idea of crosswalks and jaywalking laws are all a consequence of the automobile there was no jaywalking before the automobile there were no crosswalks people did just walk where they wanted because most horse that was in avens of course is gonna get which wouldn't be great but there weren't that many of them compared good people okay number two here and we're just making ticking this down will autonomous vehicles reduce greenhouse gases or create more and I know that you alluded a little bit with your talk about climate change but to explain out why you're actually more pessimistic about that than you well I think here's the thing entire it entirely depends on the adoption of electric vehicles if we end up down a path and there's been lots of studies looking at different variations of it but I think having done all these kinds of studies looking at the impact of climate change I did this fairly large study called the Giga Tom Throwdown back in 2008 and looked at primary and secondary impacts of climate to actually estimate it is incredibly hard and I think it really comes down to electric vehicles why because we could end up in a world where autonomous vehicles get deployed in regular conventional fossil fuel cars gas and diesel and if you look at the vehicles out there most of autonomous deployments are using gasoline or diesel cars or trucks so I am unfortunately I used to be the opinion get autonomy and EVs are kind of like made for you that each other they had to go together mostly because of an assumption that the electrical loads for all the autonomous systems were large enough that you needed to have a large power pack but that's turned out not to be the true the power requirements have plummeted you can run a regular internal combustion engine and and have it work properly if cities require and if governments require continued push to electrical vehicles electric vehicles and and we maintain at least a decently clean grid then I see positive impact from autonomous cables even with all the the sprawl and all that but it really comes down to electric vehicles and so that way in that way maybe doesn't matter what happens with autonomy if electric vehicles have their own compelling logic then it'll happen I will take the one sorry there is one exception to that which is electric vehicles probably make more sense for a fleet than for an individual because the longer you operate them generally speaking and under today's economics so I'm qualifying all this because it's not that simple under all those statements electric vehicles make sense but why am i qualifying it because in an autonomous vehicle world a lot of they're going to be a lot of advantages improvements in the fuel efficiency of regular internal combustion vehicles as well reduction in all the collision equipments not having to accelerate as fast there's a better smarter driving and so you might end up with internal combustion vehicles that that are also super efficient on a kind of per mile basis and better suited for fleets today's passenger vehicles really are not designed for fleets the fact that they're in a taxicab fleet or whatever is just kind of there's no OEM that says I want to be in a taxi pod can't flee so that's the there's an even longer answer than this but the real short answer is it depends depends on electric vehicles folks we're going to open the mic up very close quickly here but unintended consequences we chatted a little bit about that leading up in our thinking about this and I saw the intriguing what we left on the cutting room floor was sex and among other things why don't you tell us about as you've been thinking about this what are some things that you can imagine just like the car and the suburbs and the you know yeah dress movies and drive-in burgers and I mean what do you what do you see kind of coming off this an aesthetic consequence that four-year-old kid that looks at the world through a kind of wow the world's changed is still in there and that kind of anthropological view the world sex is important it's fundamental to our survival and and so in it flavors the way that we experience things in obvious ways but also less obvious ways so the most obvious thing is look cars are sold with sex and sex appeal you know there's the testosterone driven appeal there's the feminine appeal in and so I think that will change like how will you sell access to a service when sex is still a like a fundamental driver in our motivations now a lot of that's going to move online and already is moving online but I still think that there will be things and marketers will be clever about doing that then the second is just more obvious I mean baby boomers figured out that you know they can get Randy in the back street of cook in the back seat of a car there's gonna be a generation that figures out it's not going to be that Hart's like pretty logical like you have this autonomous vehicle it's driving itself what are you gonna do alright anyhow we're going to open up the mic here and so one of the things we do is we have two two mics here was a lot of folks I've looked at this RSVP list a lot of people from the auto industry from different companies from universities from all kinds of things so you are a lot smarter than me asking questions let's start over here do stand up though if you can and just say who you are some affiliation if you want to and and ask your question or your what say what you want to say OOP not yet is it turned on while we're waiting here I wish I had a better creative answer to your question about how I arrived it is nothing very exciting go ahead but by the way if you can like score me a ride any other stuff my name is Henry Chesbrough and professor over across the bay in Berkley maybe a streetcar suburb thanks a lot for your talk and great in provocative thoughts one of the things I'm wondering about is we're going to have a period where autonomous and whatever the traditional vehicles are called are going to coexist side by side for an extended period what do we know about the benefits of autonomous when they're surrounded by a bunch of traditional vehicles you know sitting out on highways and traffic jams etc this platooning stuff sounds fantastic when you get an array of autonomous vehicle when you've got that interspersed with a bunch of crazy humans how do we know about the coexistence of that and do we lose the benefits until we get to a tipping point for example yeah it's a great question I mean I think there's all kinds of speculation about it that I've read and had myself I do think that it comes back to fundamentals humans are really creative so they will figure stuff out like if there's a platooning going on you know hey maybe I can sneak in there somehow and participate I think that a lot of the benefits we may end up in a world where the the mixture of the two is not great we can't take advantage of all the benefits of autonomous vehicles I think that's going to lead to partitioning off of either portions of streets or highways or whatever dedicated to autonomous vehicles it obviously be way better if we can integrate together and be able to use the same infrastructure for both and at least in the beginning I think that you know will work because we're not as difficult as it is to build an autonomous vehicle we're not asking typically we're not asking them to be able to handle the sort of super complicated situations or the anticipated game gamesmanship that a human driver might might engage in yeah I don't know yeah that's that's a long way to Shawn Becca grab and we'll come up here to hello Keith's Miller I work for a vibe consultancy my own consultancy it's a brand and strategy agency in San Francisco so I'm a I'm a sports driving enthusiast and so I always have conflicts of you know am I going to lose my sport mode in my autonomous car and and how do the folks who still want to drive blend into the autonomous movement as things move forward especially with the electric car movement compared to the you know gas engine combustion which you can feel the engine and it's just it seems like a lot of experiences you're leaving if we move to the automotive autonomous driving scenario and it seems like it's hard to vision that in 10 years yeah well Keith you're still going to be able to drive just like if we've been having this conversation about the advent of mechanized farming I could promise you that you're still going to be able to garden even if you can't make a living off of farming so yeah I mean driving will be a hobby like gardening or like making furniture okay go ahead but so there'll be a market you know they'll be cars being so for those Tamera or something absolutely you're going to in fact you might not be able to get way more since it's likely that eventually that kind of behavior ends up on a track and some side like prescribed way it's likely they're going to be able to get even more powerful vehicles to be able to to kind of get your trills on on a track over here Alex Rosenthal I used to work for snail at Curnow I'm a lift I agree with you completely particularly on the combination of a V and right brilliant however it is a very urban perspective and I'm wondering you know what what is your perspective obviously it's going to be very very different for very long distance car rides say from San Francisco to LA and also in rural environments how do we drive the adoption of AV and/or ride-sharing in those circumstances in more the suburban areas or rulers rural in rural areas well I do think that as you know as the costs as the labor component is is gone or actually by the way labor will not disappear from the operating cost of an autonomous vehicle it's simply going to get very very small because you're not to have all this up some layer of cost associated management but whatever that's in minor detail I think the cost is gonna come down so much that it's going to make economic sense at least in the dense suburbs it really already makes sense and dense suburbs to take ride-sharing for certain trips but it's going to extend the the window to two to three X the distance of what you can do today I also think that one of the other questions I have it seems to me that for long distance trips here to LA for example you should be able to I do want to bet that the door-to-door experience of getting into a platoon for a long distance trip you know forward a six-hour trip would be a high-speed train I haven't done the math but it feels like it should for at least most passenger trips it's going to go point-to-point like downtown San Francisco downtown LA obviously it's not gonna be it but that's not most trips I actually think someone from Hyperloop is here is there's a hyper lift person that could respond to that well Hyperloop sold okay this is much much right but I do you know that's interesting by the way if there's folks out there that have strong objections to it his you know red ocean bloodbath out there for the auto industry I never loved to hear that so you don't always have to ask question if you actually have a some counter to it it's actually just good for the whole conversation here yeah but one here and I got one there too young could you stand up and introduce yourself soft-close are journalists from Germany as I take it from your talk you see autonomous vehicles not as privately owned cars but as a service so the one question would be won't it be cool to have your own autonomous vehicle yeah and the other would be what people will use it first as an add-on to the car that they have but it do you see cars getting obsolete and and so to ask you when will what you will less than fifty percent of American families have their own car sorry when here's what you will less than half of American families having their own car no longer have their own car no longer any car the inverse of your quick yeah the inverse the question that's that's a great question it's certainly not gonna be 10 years but it feels like the kind of thing that could happen in 15 and 20 years I think it can happen shockingly fast now that's for your own dedicated car whether it's autonomous or conventional I think there's going to be it will be people who want their own dedicated autonomous car why might you want one well maybe your your it's set up in a particular way that you like maybe you want to be able to store your stuff in it maybe you want to have sex in it like a public car is going to have a high-level surveillance and you're not going to be able to be private and publicly shared autonomous vehicle in one of these fleets I think also from a security standpoint if you are if you're a public official of any high stature if you are a billionaire if you're a CEO of a large company you are not going to want to get into a publicly share autonomous vehicle you know we're already concerned about ransomware of you know thousands of dollars tens of thousand dollars for some data out of a company sometimes hundreds of thousands imagine if that's your CEO like your actual person is hijacked and taken away the more complex a computer system gets the easier it is to to hack it and to figure out ways to manipulate it so these systems I know there's a ton of energy going to making it more safe but there's no way one of my companies is a email security company by mail there's no way you can ensure 100% security and so there are going to be need there's going to need for autonomous cars and by the way there gonna be some people who continue to have a driver right the president United States will never have an autonomous car because it's simply going to be too hazardous to allow someone of that kind of high target cyber target to allow them to be completely computer controlled Gerald we got Gerald Herron and in the back there yeah I Gerald Aris and it's like this guy ran a small consulting firm in San Francisco and you sorta GPM key and I'm just going to say so Neil you're a nice guy thank you why you know you know when they start out with so many holes in your presentation with me bring I marry one being that people who buy cards I do not make them on economic the rational basis let me give you an example right now you cannot buy a Honda Pilot SUV in this area unless you play the full market price you can buy a used toilet of Ria's about nine thousand dollars they're sitting on a lot nobody's buying them okay so just like the Google Glasses Niva scenarios you are in great need of because a lot of your assumptions are just flat out wrong your concept about the cost of public transportation in comparison you did you cooked your numbers because you didn't include the cost of the passengers sitting in the bus but wasn't in your numbers okay so I'm just telling you man get a scenario plan or someone to challenge you because there are massive holes and what you're saying you're a nice guy but there are massive holes in what you're saying so what is it great it's part of why I'm here is to hear the here challenges and I can I can believe that some of what I say sounds fantastic and unbelievable I would say and for short people do not make straight-ahead rational economic choice right we've all read the books and heard the TED talks about behavioral economics all that however what we know is that price and convenience wins and that it's it's but it's not is there are there other reasons why people buy these other cars and price inconvenience just always wins and once you've experienced price inconvenience you don't go back like there is you think about the advances that have happened like is there anyone ready to go back to the land of only taxis available in San Francisco no one price and convenience is there anyone you know I don't know I'm sure that and believe me there were people who argued why taxis should remain the dominant way to get around kind of an on demand way in San Francisco but and they had good rational arguments for it I just think price convenience will win and yeah but thank you for for challenging and asking questions here the fear that is um go ahead hi steel hi hi I'm Heather summer Villa and I work for Reuters Sunil I wanted to go back to your yeah the AV guy knows it's a tough question I paid him off earlier I want to act your elasticity curve slide that you showed and asked you if no no no I'm just trying to get him to pump it Pump I was kidding about bangable do Oberon lifts current business model allow them to become sustainable profitable businesses or will the actions they have to take to achieve that result in so much increase in cost and convenience that their network effects will deteriorate as well as their scale as a result great question I think the short answer is yes those companies can be sustainable you know a lot of what's going on right now is similar to what happened with with Amazon and other other companies that need to get to a particular scale and Amazon and and others basically built a business strategy and a set of investors including public investors that basically said yes we get it at some point you're going to be profitable and we're willing to subsidize that rise to the tune of billions of dollars and I think the same thing is true of these ride-sharing networks if you know the big thing that makes them unprofitable right now is the cost of marketing driver acquisition customer acquisition or dry rider acquisition and if that was turned off then certainly on a gross basis and maybe on a net basis they can be profitable I'm going to take a question as a private here but let's see the hands up there just want to get so let's get to here this woman here and let's get some in the back there yeah this woman here in the back right there in the purple yeah but I just want to ask a question as we're waiting for that then briefly here we haven't touched the regulation piece and with three and then as a media company we get we get to interview all these awesome folks but I had a really interesting interview with Robin Chase who was one of the co-founders dip and she's done a lot of work on this autonomous vehicle space too and she's kind of talked about a heaven or hell scenario kind of based on their could go a lot of different ways here yeah she I like her Akron the rats the retail autonomous yeah I was going to ask you about about that one of the things that I had never thought about until this interview here was to say that given that there you have an autonomous vehicle you wanted to keep moving all the time you wouldn't want to park it that from a retail perspective you nothing would stop you know someone from filling with you know toilet paper or something and just when you want to get it one sec you know if you want to get something immediately boom and our streets would get clogged with just these crazy you know they're coming from warehouses on the edge of the city we just happen in our streets all time so I'm just wondering but this is actually a regulatory thing is as these things come up do you see the need for strong kind of regulation some of us say kind of ban that or something or or do you feel it's how do you what's the role of essentially a city or community saying this is how we want our streets to be run or this is where we draw the line or here's what we're going to tolerate or whatever I'm doing I I listen to Robbins talk and it's super interesting part of the fun of this category and this topic is you get imagine all kinds of scenarios and you get to imagine all kinds of nightmare scenarios my perspective on regulation is goes back to the fundamentals of what is this technology about well one's about the driver the other one is about safety these vehicles will be incredibly safe thirty five thousand people in the United States die every year from auto accidents it's around a million people that that are injured and over a million people a year that die around the world from automobile accidents the leading cause the leading cause of death for young adults leading cause so if you are a regulator or lawmaker concerned with safety and the well-being of your population what should be your attitude to autonomous vehicles should it be we don't quite know about that there's this nightmare scenario that might happen and we need to make sure we take care of all the contingencies and I don't wanna get fired because is you know one death happened to me this is like you're in charge of drug approval someone's found a lung cancer drug that's fifty percent successful on terminal 100% terminal patients and you're saying I don't know can we get it to 99 percent like you're literally there are people dying that could not die if we adopt autonomous vehicles so it's the fundamental nature of this technology regulators should be figuring out ways to accelerate the adoption as much as possible I think there have been certain steps that I you know I think are mistakes talk of of trying to anticipate all these problems now before they actually happen I think is a mistake and I think that I'm not sure that the California regulations were more the right thing recently yeah I mean they're not very restrictive to be honest they cost hundred fifty dollars and you have to provide data back but like what what exactly was the harm that they were designed to to stop not to prevent but to stop and I'm not clear to me one person has died are you okay woman here yeah and by the way the regulations don't prevent any of that it was a Tesla anyway sorry go ahead so my name is Sarah I'm user experience strategist I am a designer I'm really interested in scenarios and specifically social interaction so right now we have high-profile media cases around Buber drivers and uber users being involved in issues of safety and so I'm curious kind of what your thoughts are around the social environment of these cars in the future specifically around safety and what that will be like for the users who are interacting with one another who are interacting with a robot what are the social environments going to be like and how our company is right now planning for that hmm yeah so that's a that's a great question I mean safety is top of mind concern and I think whenever we encounter a new technology especially one where like our bodies are involved in some ways safety is appropriately the top concern I think the so will we talk about so far with safety is mostly about pedestrians and bicyclists and all that I think the safety for people who are participating like inside the vehicle there's certainly they're gonna be pretty safe from from accidents like that might happen in today's ride-sharing or taxi hour or regular driven driven car but I it seems to be pretty inevitable that there is monitoring equipment inside the vehicle now maybe I'm wrong about that maybe there's enough other methods to kind of score the risk of vandalism and other kinds of harms harms other people perhaps there's some kind of rating system or something like that that could avoid that high level of scrutiny but seems to me it's so cheap to put a camera in and multiple cameras in that that is kind of an inevitable part of what ends up in these in the shared autonomous fleets and then I think there's going to be a tremendous public awareness and and engagement exercise to sort of demonstrate that that they really are are safe some of the way back you little nebulous Emmett hi I'm Carolyn Sloane from Capgemini in the UK you talked about supply and demand and the big players that are involved in the supply and demand such as I'm such as I'm Google etc in the UK Amazon has just announced an affiliation with Whole Foods that rocketed the stock market for the Tesco and the other retailers and they've also announced that they're likely to enter the market for car sales how do you think Amazon will respond to this particular opportunity they already are involved in on-demand delivery the way they do it today is through contracted networks of delivery people in different geographies swapping out those delivery people with autonomous delivery certainly has to be on that roadmap I think a more interesting question is what they also want to do people delivery at sidecar we pioneered we were the first to combine people and packages in the same car and you know we know that that makes economic sense in other words you can imagine just like in an airplane down in the cargo hold they might be carrying whatever mail or packages or whatever in the same way you could imagine the same thing for delivery so if Amazon already has a big network of vehicles out there doing delivery for them to add people delivery to it would be pretty straightforward on the demand side they don't have a lot of people asking where they want to go although I don't know they're getting into Restaurant delivery and others maybe there's there's a window into into people through that way I think the challenge for for them would be on this on the demand side like where do they get the demand for people wanted to go from A to B hi I'm Phil so my question is about the slide you had related to the red ocean supply demand so I think you had a Google Apple uber and regional ride-sharing kind of predicated on the the idea that a Maps service is very currently very expensive to provide and there going to be a limited number of players so my question is you know how that might change when the active mapping becomes a lot cheaper if you're say Tesla and you have a bunch of vehicles roaming about with sent equipped with sensors that constructing a Maps API could become a lot cheaper and if you have an open table reservation you would connect to the Tesla Maps API and so how that assumption around the constriction of maps could be wrong and interested here your thoughts on that yeah it's a good question there's sort of a lot of activity in the map world in order to have demand for people going from A to B you have to have not just the underlying data around the maps but people coming to it lots of consumers coming to it to actually ask that question so I don't see how like the former Nokia unit or any of those are going to end up with significant eyeballs because Apple and Google don't just have maps they have operating systems on the dominant mobile phones which are the devices that you're naturally going to go to to ask go a B there are other potential players companies like transit companies I was thought Yelp had an opportunity but they're simply going to get swamped by the huge volume of demand that is possible out of out of those other platforms hi i'm matt desmond i'm also with the Capgemini I'm from Detroit the world of old automotive so my question to you a very learned man is how we can think about a future of autonomous vehicles without a solution for preventing cyber attacks without talking about required firmware over-the-air updates I can't imagine I would ever get into an autonomous vehicle unless I knew it had a way to be updated and patched if needed I'm kind of liking it too the days in the late 80s early 90s when I was scrambling around patching pcs before there were enterprise solutions for antivirus what are your thoughts on this for safety yeah I think it's a super important concern are you asking the question do I think cars can or should be deployed without that kind of protection of rapid adoption of autonomous vehicles really transforming our lives when you're essentially potentially advocating driving around in a Windows PC with Windows 95 with no antivirus and we're not talking about that there's this spy car act that just got introduced which really doesn't mention autonomous but it does talk about the first Inklings of regulation for connectivity I'm just trying to be practical I would not want to get into a vehicle that couldn't be patched remotely I know some manufacturers like Tesla can do it but I didn't come up in your talk like there's got to be a way there's got to be a consortium there's got to be an open-source way to do it that's kind of what I'm getting up well I'm certainly concerned about this world obviously you know it sounds like you know a lot about it my observation however is that consumers have shown a track record of being willing to trade off a vague threat in the future against price and convenience today and we see that with privacy and advertising I mean you know who pays for all of their content that they look at on the Internet not a lot of people it's it's and you're giving up a ton of they guy I mean those of us who pay a lot of attention know that it's not so vain it gets very concrete very quickly and it'll get more concrete in the future the threat will be bigger in the future because of you know data being collected today and I think it's similar kind of thing with cybersecurity but the reality is and the track record is that you know we'll kind of kind of like regulation we see the problems and we fix it rather than kind of anticipating every possible we obviously want to fix the obvious holes and keep that from happening but I don't see a need to wait until every single thing is fixed before we deploy yeah so just so that the video can hear it your point is that it took people dying for Ralph Nader get traction on on regulation that's absolutely right I think my counter point would be 35,000 people die a year and how many people will die because the car is hijacked and you know driven into something like it will be horrible when it happens but there are 35,000 people dying a year now and sorry cuz you add to that Ralph Nader I'm a big fan he got fought so hard because and one of the big concerns that like airbags are going to kill kids unfortunately they do sometimes you know seatbelts are going to harm people who are just capitate people they do sometimes like like these there are problems with the new safety enhancements there are problems with this safety enhancement and we're going to deal with them over time and just one thing I just want to you know say part of the gathering of folks here is we got about 10 minutes here of just finishing up this formal part but the idea is stay here there's a half hour we want you guys to discuss this these issues it's not the only guy that's a great idea here that's us more people there's a lot of time people here and honestly these are really fastening and open-ended questions and it's stuff that we're all wrestling with go ahead I think we have a guy here yep we're going to get as many as we can in here I'm from Cape jamia in France on a Sunday I took a burrow to move around in San Francisco and we had a very nice lady driver who was doing that as a second job and told us a lot about San Francisco and we spent 10 minutes where we learned a lot and it seems that your assumption is that the the benefit I mean that the autonomous car will be human to machine interaction and that the the relationship element of a number of the services we get is totally out of date and how do you see a world where a relationship has doesn't have more importance than just automation I love starting and running sidecar one of the great joys was meeting drivers learning about the stories I got it's one of the most wonderful things about about ride-sharing and I'm sure you've experienced like you're talking about like you get to meet interesting people you just normally not going to run into [Music] yeah it's one of the great joys I go back to price and convenience automatic teller machines replaced a lot of face-to-face interaction but they were open 24 hours a day they eventually were on every corner super convenient at first they were very cheap they used to be free but then fees came along later but my point being you know in that case almost all about convenience not so much about price and people gave up a lot of personal interaction in exchange I mourn that personal interaction I think it's one of the fundamental problems that we've got with society we don't have enough social interaction thank you for showing up today no offense of the people streaming but like seriously showing up and interacting like that's that's the stuff of humanity and we're going to need to find other venues for it pay premium for that I mean that might be yeah that's good that'll be some little subset of folks might do it or not who knows we have a guy here and then we'll go here name is Rakesh my name is Rakesh and I work in the energy space thanks for your talk so my question was related to using these autonomous vehicles as distributed energy resources as they are sitting idle you know to address the spiky demand situation and capital use and things like that they could what are your thoughts on them providing or being an essential part of the electric grid yeah that's a great question I think it's part of the original original heights it's a it's a vision that we've had for a long time of how could we integrate electric vehicles into the grid I think the short answer really is I don't know I think something I've thought about but I haven't done the math on is with an electric vehicle that's also an autonomous vehicle you know it does it does it pay for itself connected to the grid versus being out giving a ride does that kind of pay for the capital cost because you're not just paying for the batteries at that point you got to pay for the whole car even though you're only getting benefit for the batteries and electronics I don't know interesting question to figure out it's true he said most agree is not to weigh there's massive enhancements that are required to make that to make that court but it is I do think that like will that world end up happening possibly stationary battery is a big competition and yeah we're gonna get a couple last questions here and go ahead here okay I am Barney pal I'm an entrepreneur and angel investor and friend of Snell so actually to two questions I'll try again and you can answer I guess either one first we talked about the the economics of ride sharing and self-driving vehicles how they interact and it seems to me like one of the big assets that the big ride-sharing companies like uber and lyft have is they've got a two sided marketplace it takes a lot of money get those drivers see more drivers more consumers more pastors and so on now with up with self-driving vehicles you don't need one whole side of the marketplace okay if you have if you can afford to buy the car as you're a big automaker or something have a fleet then you can walk in and I don't know what Uber's advantage is because they don't have the driver advantage if you just bring a plate they all drive now you know customers will pay to download whatever out they need to for price and convenience so what's the real long-term value of like uber and lyft in a world where these automakers or anybody else can come in and just create a fleet it's it's a good question I think that's a common question a common vision for autonomous vehicle makers the value they have is simply that it's a two-sided market and you need to have both sides and if you've built up a base of eight million riders that are opening up your Apple to regular basis you cannot recreate that overnight or even in a year you need years and years and lots of marketing dollars to be able to build up that same advantage on the demand side so you know as I kind of walk through in the in the presentation let's imagine that suddenly someone out nowhere has a non fully autonomous level-5 vehicle today and they have hundreds of thousands of they deploy them and in some few cities they sought to build demand for it and yes they will be able to deploy at a very low price and kind of high level of efficiency but first of all with billions of dollars in the bank we were consumption eyes the human capital to maintain their advantage for for some time until a competitor catches up but let's say forget about even that for a second it will take a long time so let's say it's two years later or a year later two years later and there's a equally comparable autonomous vehicle from competitor a Google or whoever else can plug that into their demand Network so maybe it's fallen maybe it's no longer you know kind of eight million to one maybe it's you know eight million to two million but it's not of the eight million a billion like you will not trust me it's hard it's hard to build that demand side and yeah just takes it takes time and energy and money and there's not an adequate differentiation on the part of AV makers to be able to build that big flywheel of demand so they're going to think about it differently and and then there's this whole flea problem of capital utilization of the fleet I think there may be solutions to that one could be having a mix of privately owned vehicles and vehicles that are available to a pool able to give rides so think of it more like timeshare or owning a vacation property where sometimes you're using it sometimes you're making it available to pool to the marketplace and during times of high demand Friday 2 a.m. you're home asleep you don't care if you're autonomous car because it gets all ride although I want to make sure it's well protected so I see that as a future model that they can work but to date I have not seen companies really thinking about that and really aggressively going after it they seem to think Oh it'll launch a fleet and I'm going to give a bunch of man end of story it won't be that way we're gonna know back there hey Rafa Hostetler I'm running ro boy and lucy and IA and ethics initiative and i was wondering you were advocating for policy makers to accelerate the whole process in order to not have 37,000 people dead at the same time I'm wondering a visa will put like 10 plus million people out of jobs so how do you go to two things relative to each other yeah thank you for that question I think with with new technology there is always a concern about employment and those concerns are are I get it I get the concern and lots of very smart people say that there's going to be you know a real bill apocalypse where automation just going to wipe out a bunch of jobs and top the list is drivers because driver turns out to be the number-one job for males in the United States and I think it's something around 30 of the states it's the top job of any so it employs a lot of people who Burrell own has like a million drivers so yeah it's a big deal and for sure there's going to be displacement in in the short term especially if we see this rapid adoption is to be a lot of drivers that no longer are driving however I don't see that turning into a robo job pocalypse that's better I don't know Robo Papua I like a robo-pong games I don't see a robopocalypse because well let's take let's take some examples automatic teller machines we talked about them earlier compared to the 1980s how many people think there are fewer tellers than there were show hands fewer how many think they're the same how many think there are more tellers wow it's all even the split okay well how many just don't care about this well it turns out it's about the same so we had just sorry okay let me give you another example since since the Great Recession began the comment was on a per capita basis it doesn't quite match and fair point but Minh sir is not that it fell off a cliff we opened up more branches we society opened up more branches ended up with more jobs for four tellers doing higher grade work not no longer I'd like a hundred bucks you know somewhat more complex transactions another example since the Great Recession began you've all heard the stories of retail jobs flying off a cliff tons of layoffs but of course ecommerce is the big
