 The current situation has very few rules of the road for autonomous vehicles. But, in the future, there is going to have to be a coordinated effort to make rules and regulations that are effective. It's a delicate thing. Too much regulation will stifle innovation, and you may not have autonomous cars sold for 100 years. But, if they are lax, we'll have more dangers than we may have benefits. Safety has really been the guideline for rules of the road. Safety for the driver, safety for people who are occupied in the vehicle, and safety for pedestrians who are walking around. There are dozens of safety rules. There's a whole book of them in the codes of most states. A number of states, but not the majority, have put in place certain rules regarding when and whether driverless cars are on the road. Under what conditions is it permitted on the highway? Does it have to display the fact that it is driverless? Is the driver have to be in the vehicle? If so, what does he and she have as training? California has probably more regs in place than other states. But, to just say it as it is, there's a vacuum in terms of rules and regulations. States, in general, control who can drive. Drivers license, One of the benefits of the so-called driverless cars or autonomous vehicles is that older people who currently could not have a license will be able to go from place to place. People who have disabilities who currently can't drive, people who may be blind, people who have paralysis of some type. All of a sudden, they would get a new freedom, beyond the wheelchair, where they might be able to go from place to place. We're probably a long way off. Some think 2040 before autonomous vehicles are the majority of vehicles. Currently, almost 40,000 people a year in the U.S. die from automobile accidents, and that with the reduction of human error, we will save thousands and thousands of lives.
