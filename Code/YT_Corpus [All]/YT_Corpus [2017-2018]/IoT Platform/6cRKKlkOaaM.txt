 the process of creating IOT applications can be tough or even frustrating sometimes this time we really find the way to build the Internet of Things while link has simplified the development of IOT applications through an incredibly easy to use level which has got rid of tedious hardware programming and any soldering that used to be very essential in the past based on the ESP a to double six Wi-Fi SOC and specially designed Grove compatible interfaces while link allows you to connect up to six growth modules with various features and functionalities visually set all things up directly on the mobile apps we've provided update the firmware over-the-air make a cloud connected device in only five minutes like building a smart light that reminds you of the missed calls or an outdoor environment monitor to check the real-time weather conditions around your house furthermore while link turns growth modules into web of themes with restful api is exposed you are able to access to the growth modules with a range of programming languages like JavaScript Python Ruby and PHP to water your plans automatically when the soil becomes dry to feed your dog when you're away from home or this cool boss key to save you from embarrassing situations automatically connect the traffic light while link even the boring coding life becomes fun the traffic light shows the code compilation result by red or green wire link has made me feel really comfortable making stuff as it helps me to escape the hot part which I don't like and only focus on the easy part the best thing about web link is that it only cost me a few minutes to set up the hardware pieces and after that I will be able to get back to the world of Python also all the sensor data and the module controls are achieved directly with the Jason support of Python where link has truly offered people like us the opportunity to play with hardware please support the legs every day
