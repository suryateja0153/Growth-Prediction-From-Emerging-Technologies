 [Music] the population is growing the amount of arable land simply isn't going to go up so we need to be as efficient as possible with the land that we have to make sure that we can sustain our population as it gets larger farmers edge is a precision egg company we do data management and decision support for growers we want to solve agriculture we're very heavily invested in the IOT space in our implements factors and combines we've put a device called a cam plug it's a telematics device that basically feeds us continuous information in real time we've employed our own weather network so we have thousands of weather stations across our offering and it just gives us a better and a more complete data set we have two other stations on our farm and they are about three miles apart first thing in the morning I'll look at my farm command - to see the forecasts see the wind directions see if there's a chance of rain before you know if you've got 4,000 acres and you have to go look at every field to see how much rain you had on them it can be time-consuming what artificial intelligence and machine learning is providing for us is optimize decision making we want to create an optimal prescription in order to know how much fertilizer to put down we need to know how much nutrient already exists that's what the soil sampling provides us we go out we punch a core that core goes to our lab they do a lab analysis and they can tell us how much nutrients both macro micronutrients are in the soil that information feeds back to farm command and the recommendation process takes over from there bare blow rate technology is here and putting the fertilizer words meant to me and taking advantage of the yields that's what farmers should be doing essentially what we're doing is we're providing a new type of agronomist one that's driven by the data that we've collected over the years we'll be able to make decisions like what is the absolute optimum day to see whether a chemical should be applied and what day it chemical should be applied what crop type should be going down that's going to maximize ROI in the fall based on say market conditions or how we think that crop is going to perform based on the current soil conditions we're using the azure IOT hub to build a scalable platform for thousands and thousands of IOT devices what the azure IOT platform is allowed us to do is focus on that deployment while giving us all the features that we need in an IOT stack like provisioning like security like streaming so the power of a scalable system that can handle thousands of devices with the simplicity of sort of a turnkey operation where we can deploy these devices and just know that it's going to work for us our seer of crops this year will phenomenal it was one for the ages the credit a lot of it to farmers edge the fertilizer was put in the proper places the crop stood up beautifully and just a phenomenal deal [Music] you
