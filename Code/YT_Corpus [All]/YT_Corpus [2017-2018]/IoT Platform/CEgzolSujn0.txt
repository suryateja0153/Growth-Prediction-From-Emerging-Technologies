 hello i'm philip hooker director of strategic programs at kim lostie and i'd like to demonstrate how the cumulus TI IT platform is revolutionizing IOT solution creation in our many years in IOT we found a large number of initiatives fail at the first hurdle and are bogged down by technical complexity in 2016 we prepared a series of videos for our keynote at the digital health world congress which showed that another way was possible this series of videos shows how our power user focused IOT platform removes technical complexity and allows full IOT solutions to be created in minutes this fourth video demonstrates how business applications can be integrated to create a fuller end-to-end solution in less than three minutes to show how this works I'm using au blocks C 0 to 7 with old firmware an activated Mobile Broadband sim a new 30-day trial account of the cumulus D IOT platform and have completed all the stages in the previous create analytics demo in addition as for this demo we are integrating business applications using the zapier software as a service integration tool I have also registered both the cumulus D IOT platform and Google business services accounts with zapier details how to do this are provided here so ready start timers we can see our device previously connected the dashboard we previously created when also a new Google sheet which will populate with the data go into zapier we can create a news app with cumulus tea as a trigger application at a smart role as a trigger event and associated with our demo IOT platform account we can reuse our previously created smart rule definition Anna fetch to test the integration of Kim lostie we can select Google sheets as the action app and create a new spreadsheet row for each smart rule alarm received associated with kuma las diez google account and select the spreadsheet and the worksheet to be updated can populate the alarm status column with the alarm status and alarm text data from Camille Asti and populate the alarm type column with the alarm type data finally name our zap and activated going back to our device increase in the left analog potentiometer to the alarm rage creates an alarm and community as you can see and is also logged as new Row 4 in the Google sheet so the log time would also be useful so let's included going back to zapier we can select the crate spreadsheet row stage to update it so zappy is detected a new column row and we actually populate this with the alarm time data from Camille Asti so let's move our device out of the alarm range I'm moving back we can see the dashboard updated the alarm raised and the timestamp added to the logged alarm in Google sheets thank you for your attention please use a details shown for more information or contact me if you have any queries thank you once again and have a great day
