 Internet of Things is a breakthrough technology that connects various devices to internet and makes them smart & efficient. In this course, you will build an IoT based smart building system that switches light in the building On/Off efficiently based on the presence of people in each room. It also collects the data about the usage of lights and sends it to the cloud for storage and analysis. As a part of this course, you will use PIR sensors and relay driver modules to track the movement of people and switch the lights On/Off accordingly. You will use an ESP 8266 WiFi module to send data to the internet and an Arduino board to control the entire system. You will learn and program the Arduino with the right logic to make the system function. You will then use the ThinkSpeak IoT analytics platform to analyse the data to show the results in a visual format. The course runs on Skyfi Labs Learn-Do-Review methodology which ensures that you learn the technical concepts in addition to building the project with your own hand using the kit. A topic like IoT can only be learnt by building project and Skyfi Labs makes the process super easy for you. Kit will be shipped to you within 24 Hrs and you can complete the course within 1 week from anywhere on earth and earn a certificate. Using Skyfi Labs courses you will not only build the IoT projects with definite output but also learn the concepts involved in it. So you can attend and crack interviews with confidence.
