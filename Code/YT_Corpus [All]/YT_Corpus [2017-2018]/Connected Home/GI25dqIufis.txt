 welcome them thank you for joining RCR wireless news today for our webinar on the connected car I'm Kelly Hill technology reporter for RCR and your moderator today let me go ahead and introduce the rest of our participants today for as our analyst we have Jennifer Kent who is director of research at parks associates we're also joined by Brian Greaves director of product development for IOT solutions at eighteen t and we also have with us Craig Hendricks senior wireless business development manager at mitsui as well as michael givens who is senior solutions marketing manager at ixia so welcome all and that we're going to go ahead and start off with some of the recent news in the connected car market and on the security side we had some researchers and NASA secure can bus with encryption which could go a long way to developing so that security needs on the connected car side we had the US House talking about legislation for vehicle data privacy and the FTC weighing in with concerns about where to draw the lines for consumer protection as far as data retention best practice development as well as some concerns about allowing researchers and yes efficient access to data while also protecting the connected car from hackers which is definitely something that's top of mind in the industry right now there's a lot of research going on right now we also had some word this week about security researchers using Wi-Fi sniffers to track vehicles via the the vita x which is a vehicle to infrastructure or vehicle to vehicle communications using a 0 to 10 11 p also known as the SRC dedicated short-range communications and it's also of note that the connected car there's going to be connected car expo next month at the LA auto show and so I think we should expect to see some interesting announcements coming out of that event as well as one of the major auto industry events of the year and with that our CR has its connected car special report available mout RCR wireless comm for free download some of the key takeaways from that report include that the connected car concept covers a wide range wireless technologies architectures and use cases in equation is a key area of focus and the fact that simulation is and will continue to be at the heart of connected car testing on the consumer side consumers are increasingly aware of and interested and connected car options although at this point in the ecosystem development there's still a lot of reliance on smartphones inside vehicles as far as new technologies and requirements some of those are coming online dsrc is mentioned as well as we call in Europe and an aversion in Russia as well coming online now being required in the near future that that are greatly impacting capabilities and testing as well as regulatory requirements security is top of mind absolutely as the reality becomes clear that connectivity become brings security vulnerabilities with it and that some wireless technologies are simply more secure than others and testing and monitoring as well as the ability to quickly identify and respond to novel threats is going to be crucial for vehicle OEMs mobile network operators and suppliers so you can read more in that special report that's available for download RCR wireless comm and with that we are going to move into presentations from our participants starting with Jennifer Kent of parks associates Jennifer thanks Kelly they appreciate the opportunity to set the scene a bit for the connected car market generally as we dive into this really interesting topic so I think it's nice to remember that the connected car market is among the most establish of all of the IOT markets and you can move to the next slide the auto OEM the mobile network operators and all of their suppliers and tech enablers have actually you know several decades of telematics experience under their belts at this point both from a fleet management and product tracking commercial use case I'd as well as a consumer telematic so GM's onstar product for instance you know came out all the way back in the 1990's we've also seen very early by in on the value of connectivity from survice manufacturers in the auto space compared with device manufacturers and other parts of the IOT especially consumer I or two so for instance door lock manufacturers in the smart home space or glucometer manufacturers in the digital health space are just now sort of getting up to speed and getting their their products to market and really understanding the value of that connectivity so OEM and a partner certainly understand that connectivity in the vehicle expands the relationship with a consumer beyond the sales it provides greater insight into maintenance issues and very valuable insight into possible recall issues and the ability to get ahead of those things that being said do too long product development cycles as well as sort of a inability to innovate quickly in this very tech-heavy type type market auto OEM have been slower to implement some of these new technologies compared with some of these other device manufacturers like it instead again a bit that being said we are seeing growing consumer adoption we are pushing beyond the early adopter phase for sure here in the in the connected car space parks associates estimates that about sixteen percent of cars in the US or about 41 million light vehicles will be internet connected by the end of 2015 and of course millions upon millions more are internet capable but the the drivers may have not decided to opt in to the programs or the subscriptions or whatever might be necessary to make that an active internet connection and we see this person about doubling within the next 45 years so that by the end of 2019 about 90 million light vehicles we expect to be connected at being said on the next slide you'll see that you know major market challenges the one that's probably still you know the most talked about and perhaps one of the most challenging to address as well as the most actual for or topics today of security interference and testing issues is that connectivity methods in the connected car are not simplifying they're actually multiplying so compared with the relative comparatively simple home attics days where you had a embedded cellular module we now have the embedded approach we also have a bring your own connectivity approach where you can pucker your smartphone to the vehicle and access connective features that way there are also aftermarket approaches that seems to be multiplying by the by the month where you can have an aftermarket dongle or head unit installed that comes with its own connectivity and each of those connectivity methods have sort of a ripple effect of challenges and of course the three that I mentioned you know bring internet within the vehicle but there's also several other layers of connectivity standards that the auto OEMs and their partners have to manage within the vehicle whether it be Bluetooth or an in-vehicle Wi-Fi hotspot or also near field communications perhaps there's the challenges are multiplying as the connectivity methods multiply so each can be as connectivity messages brings with it sort of a sumed business model and assumed a different player that would dominate the user experience or capture the most potential value for that connectivity method and it's been a real sticking point a real method a real point of confusion and sort of limitation on how fast this market is moving because there's a lot of confusion out there as to how best to bring these connected services to consumers with multiple connectivity methods we also get into user areas and consistency is especially if you think about it from the users perspective within one family you may have multiple vehicles in different ways that you're connecting with in the vehicle and is that really the the experience that we want for our consumers there's certainly a big challenge to incumbents right now from those outside the auto ecosystem with notably the tech giant's from apple and Android as well and of course my colleagues here today will speak more to the technical testing design challenges that also security issues that are raised by by connected vehicles I also wanted to just take a moment to bring the consumer perspective to our listeners to set the scene of what activities are actually engaging and in the vehicle and by what connectivity method they're doing so today so the next slide you'll see that we tested several different activities or apps that are performed or accessed in the vehicle and this could be by any excuse me any connectivity methods so just using your smartphone directly as you're driving down the road making voice or or receiving voice calls or actually using an embedded navigation system for instance making voice calls and navigation do score quite highly while some of the newer applications like in vehicle Wi-Fi hotspot parking finder apps are still have has relatively low usage in the vehicle and at the moment on the next slide which I can aggregate view of the ways in which consumers are interacting with these activities and asked in the vehicle and overwhelmingly consumers are just using their smartphone directly so they are just picking up the vehicle and making that call or sending that text message as i drive down the road and i think for all of us in this industry or who happen to have to drive down the road that's pretty scary proposition when it comes to distracted driving three and ten did report accessing at least one connectivity connected activity or app through an embedded or tethered connect connected car method so again not using their smartphone directly but using the types of capabilities of auto OEM the smartphone manufacturers are trying to move to and finally we asked okay well what about your next vehicle so when you are looking in your next vehicle to purchase how would you prefer to interact with these types of activities or applications in the future and overwhelmingly it's not the current situation so consumers do not want to use that smart phone directly they're interested in a experience that built directly into the vehicle and also certainly open to an experience of linking their phone to their car and of course this is an aggregated view and it differs by specific activity or specific apps from our perspective we threw the most likely situation going forward is that there will be a hybrid approach where consumers will be able to access some be some features through the built-in capabilities in their vehicles as well as other features through a tethered approach but that again brings up more testing security and interference issues so I'm looking very very much forward to the other panelists and how they propose to deal with those issues ok great well and and of course the technology development is driven in part by demand now we'll be hearing from Brian Greaves of 80 on AT&T strive studio and how 18t is tackling the connected car right good afternoon so yeah today I'm going to discuss with you a little bit about how AT&T is reshaping the connected vehicle space in quite a few ways if you want to click to the next slide AT&T is focusing on quite a few different errors from once we've early began working with automotive manufacturers many manufacturers would come to us and really ask for basic also data connectivity I know I need to get a connection into my vehicle that's that's often changing now as we work and kind of collaborate with these manufacturers more and more they're saying I need to do more I need to be kind of the first to market or at least a fast follower in this space because a lot of my cars and trucks that I'm selling some of the things that really differentiate these services that I'm bringing to market are in the connected vehicle space so I need to be a leader in that space for eighteen t is really doing is transforming the connected vehicle to mobilize life and what I mean by that is really changing the way in which a customer will interact with with their vehicle and the other devices that they bring to and from their vehicle to create more of a connected lifestyle specifically in the connected car I'm going to cause three different areas in which AT&T is focusing can I click to that next slide first and foremost AT&T is focusing on safety and safety first and safety has a couple different caveats we look at safety from the standpoint of disabling or limiting any potential for hacks or potential hacks into the vehicle and those connected car services associated with potential hacking also customer data and the privacy of data making sure that we we keep that customer data private and that we're not sharing any data with any outside partners or if we are we're making sure that we're anonymizing that day that the customers choose to share and then probably first and foremost and then in addressing the biggest industry issue is reducing distracted driving concerns those are growing exponentially every day so we're really working with this is to see how do we provide connected car services but doing that in a safe and reliable manner we're also focusing on convenience making it easier for customers could to relate and stay connected while behind the wheel and doing that in in multiple ways everything from integrating into your home security and home automation services to wearables and other broadened devices and then lastly focusing on entertainment and that's primarily for your receiver cedar passenger entertainment and that's focusing on a services like brought a Wi-Fi Wi-Fi hotspot support for broad end devices other infotainment so streaming audio streaming video type services to and from your vehicle as well so as we look if you want to click to the next slide as we look at how ATT is focusing or on the industry we're focusing on in four main areas embedded which is basically factory fit services that we put into production vehicles the aftermarket space that can be obd on-board diagnostics dongles that we put into vehicles as well as aftermarket stereos and head units for vehicles also in the flea in rental space obviously fleet customers that's a cute growing industry and a huge area of importance and focus as more more these fleet companies look to connect the cars and trucks that they have on the road and then the ubi which is usage-based insurance space focusing on services very similar to the snapshot understanding hey what are your driving patterns and making sure they create policies according to those driving behaviors so jumping into that and in focusing if you want to click to that next slide specifically in the embedded space you can see connected car growth is growing substantially from the dark purple you can see those are global connected cars shift currently in the projections out through 2020 and the light purple you'll see is is it's kind of projections on cars ship with connectivity you can see the ratio is going to greatly increase from where we're at in 2015 to where we're going to be at into 2020s 75% of the shares 75 percent of cars that are shipped not only in the US but worldwide will have some type of connectivity and 18c is working with manufacturers not just for the u.s. and North America of creating solutions for on global connected services worldwide if you want to click to the next one um and we've been fairly successful in this space right now we currently have five point eight million connected cars that were working with various manufacturers on nine of the top 15 automotive manufacturers that are out there we have agreements with or we're currently either working from a connectivity standpoint or bringing other services into those in those vehicles and by 2017 we plan to have 10 million vehicles connected on our network on the AT&T network and we are the first carrier with a dedicated connected car facility which is the ATT drive studio and I'll get to in a second if you want to click to the next one really 18t is focusing on several different differential areas but I'm just going to mention a couple here obviously the biggest one being our network and our strongest 4G 4G LTE signal also creating unique billing solutions for our customers the the ability to split out bills and different do different bill on behalf services for the manufacturers and partners that we work with as i talked about we're focusing on global solutions so that includes our global sim solution how because every manufacturer that we talked to is thinking globally we want to make sure that we support that and then obviously focusing on services on our ATT drive platform which I'll jump into now on the next slide really AT&T is focusing on moving connected car services into the cloud well a lot of connected car services have been local and you're a good example is that is hey you bought your car maybe it's today or you know a couple years back that experience is going to be the same throughout the lifecycle your vehicle we're doing is really making these platforms a lot more flexible by bringing these services off board and not having such a reliance on local hardware and local software and we're doing that by really creating a cloud driven experience with our ATT drive platform into which we can offer various connected car services on various hardware various operating systems and really create obviously a complete application and ecosystem for our partners and developers if you click to the next slide you can see a few different examples of some of the services that AT&T is really partnering with automotive manufacturers on and that's everything from basic applications like you'll see whether and parking and urgently and some of the other ones too integrated home automation services connecting your car to your home creating personalization so your car knows you versus your wife or husband creating and that unique bond to your dealership for to improve CRM support with X time so these are just a few different examples of it but examples in which 18t is really bringing these services too light for manufacturers and a lot of that is being done if you want to click to the next slide at our ATT drive studio which is a brand new facility that we've built in Atlanta two years ago since our opening we've had over 5,000 individuals come through our drive studio we have quite a few events we have an average two to three events here a day but we're really trying to push for new connected car solutions for drive innovation and bring their services to life so that's that's a very broad scope but hope you have a better understanding of some of things we're trying to help and then improve the industry on okay great thanks Brian hopefully we can jump into that a little bit deeper and and part of our QA by the way participants we will have a lengthy Q&A session once we're done with presentations so please feel free to submit questions that you have through the user interface and we'll get to as many of those as we can and now we'll go to Craig hundreds of and Ritz you Thank You Kelly so anritsu is a global test equipment supplier have been in business over 100 years and we have a number of different solutions for testing various types of communications in the chart use the slide you see above here at the top in the cellular space in the upper left we have things like our 8475 that simulate the cellular network all the different radio access technologies that can test e call and handoff between all the different technologies and cells major data throughput test voice over LTE which is going to be coming to cars and and so forth next to that we also have similar Network emulators that are for doing RF testing the various RF parameters of the cellular protocols we also have boxes for testing Bluetooth and Wi-Fi both in a signaling mode it can be used for various types of interference testing as well as the products are used modular products are used in production over in the lower left we have we have products are used for testing the vita x 802 11 p dsrc we can also test the tire pressure monitoring radio protocol RF parameters and the remote keyless entry over on the far right we have a whole line of handheld instrument spectrum analyzers network analyzers respect master site master VNA master these are these are used for not only troubleshooting the sailor base stations and networks but we sell these to auto manufacturers a lot of times for testing the cables and intent is in the cars and that we have systems for doing Direction finding on interfering signals that will help help point you to where the interferer is coming from and down the bottom we have products for testing fiber optics in the car as well as in the lower right we have our vector star that can test the millimeter-wave radars that are used for collision avoidance in car next slide I'm going to take a moment just expand a little bit on one of the products that I mentioned first in the last slide our 8475 side our network simulator it's very popular with auto manufacturers the telematics vendors module benders cellular carriers automotive operating system vendors it can support all the different cycler protocols FTD and tdd-lte the 3d wcdma gsm td-scdma from china and cdma ev-do like sprint verizon use we can set up in a single box we can set up a to cell network there can be two cells of the same technology or two different technology to do handovers and roaming scenarios and so forth we've had suffer options for testing the European eCall and the Russian version of that called er a blown asks we can test a 911 network time zone make sure that comes up right on the device sim testing data throughput testing I'm battery drain you know when you turn the car off does the radio go off or does it sit there and brain drain the battery of your car so when you come back your battery's dead you need to test those kind of things test faulty rich communications audit quality SMS MMS we can test if the device or the car is being too aggressive with the network and trying to use up too much network resources when it's having trouble getting access we can do reject testing at the layer 3 message that they at the APN and and the ims layer we also have automation comes with hundreds of tests example test cases and we can also automate from other platforms pythons a basic LabVIEW via either ethernet gpib or develop function calls great all right well we thank you for that and I hope we can get more into interference issues and some of those other testing questions as we move into the Q&A session now we're going to move on to you michael givens exia thanks Kelly hi exia is a company that network and security product companies that have come to you for almost 20 years to make sure the products were up to standards we make hardware software and system applications run stronger both for today and tomorrow next slide please going and what does that mean how does it fit into the connected car market well we provide the tools and capabilities organizations can use to test visualize and secure their network so that their applications run stronger as pioneers in the test industry we have a long history of innovation and we have to in order to provide the widest range of validation methods against the widest range of real-world events as a premium partner in autosar XE has led the definition and creation of the conformance specifications that the automotive industry is now adhering to in addition our performance solutions include a full later two through seven range of support for the new broader reach technology being used as was mentioned earlier with the growing number of external access points becoming potential britta zones on the connected car exeis security solutions can help verify the integrity of these systems XE is an industry leader in security product tests in line security frameworks and network security resilient solutions as the new networks that are the connected cars start to evolve visibility into these networks will be key in knowing that there are no issues or blind spots in these networks you need real-time visibility for real-time intelligence and nixie is an industry leader in network visibility solutions in the connected car realm Exia is partnered with multiple leading automotive test houses to partner our expertise in ethernet technology with their expertise in automotive testing to provide the capabilities to ensure the connected cars are stable and secure next slide please and so connected cars require a complete ecosystem testing approach that includes conformance testing to new standards and performance testing of all systems it also includes security testing and ensuring the safety of both the automobile network and the user driving the vehicle lastly dealers can no longer expect all of their vehicles to return home for updates so remote updates and fixes will be a new way of delivering repairs and will have its own testing requirements thanks Kelly back to you okay great you know it's interesting that you mentioned over the year updates I think we just had a very recent release from Tesla that actually you know went out over the air and included some automated driving features that hadn't been available before automatic parking some automated driving while cruise control is on some really interesting stuff that just went out I think within the last two weeks so so now I want to make sure that we start to get to some questions loop we always get the question of will slides be sent out and yes they will we will have a slide deck that's available after the presentation and I'm wondering if we can jump back to Jennifer for a moment and and talk about some of the things that that you see um as far as consumer education um and as we get more into this market you know as more capabilities become available I think with you and Brian touched on you know what consumers are doing now versus what they want to do in the future and how that you know really factors into demand and and I wonder if you can talk a little bit about how you think consumer education you know is going to ultimately make or break a success of the connected car sure of course actually have a bit of a mixed perspective on this from one perspective I think that consumer what you know the success of the connected car market that is going to happen regardless of consumer education efforts to an extent consumer awareness consumer comfort with new solutions and capabilities from from all the new technologies that we follow grows organically over time and and is very responsive to a smartphone ownership so awareness of awareness use and interest in connected car activities and apps jump gently among smartphone users versus you know feature phone or or non mobile phone users and that speaks to how well actually the smartphone experience has really served to educate consumers and what they can expect from their devices and as has really taught them to ask more out of other devices besides smartphones um so so from one perspective you know I think it's going to happen without necessarily a huge push on very dedicated you know education efforts from those involved that being said I think there's an enormous opportunity especially for the auto manufacturers and also for for the mobile network operators to drive real engagement with connected car services an actual usage of the feature by taking advantage of their retail spaces so for the for the auto industry of course when you're making that auto sale there's a really great opportunity to provide consumer education on the spot give them a tutorial or perhaps later offer an online tutorial right there in the vehicle head unit to help consumers actually use these great functions these new features that are being rolled out so I see that as more of an opportunity than necessarily a necessity for the success of the vehicle of the connected car market happen ok great Oh brain we had a question for you and this came up when you and I did the interview that was included in the special report and so I wanted to address this question why is 80mg building a billing interface for the connected car and what you see cases can be enabled for end users by that I know that one of the things that we talked about was the role that services will play in the connected car and I'm going to talk a little bit more about you know why having that split billing capability is important and what kind of use cases are enabled by that yeah great question so let me maybe break it down and explain that a little bit further so what when we talk about different billing solutions that were created for automotive manufacturers when I speak to split billing we often get the question from manufacturers that will ask us hey 80 I'd like to create have one Radio one single sim in it my vehicles obviously to reduce bill of material costs however I'd like to be able to split that same bill on too way so if I am interested in Diagnostics data to re-engineer and improve my vehicles or I would like to do you know from where software over-the-air updates to my car I want to be able to do those and I want to be able to pay for them I want to be able to pay for that data usage I don't however want to be paying for the customer who's streaming pandora for three or four you know hours a day can you split out those different billing salute you know can you create a solution for me to where you can split out those that filling service for me and create a bill for me the automotive manufacturer and then another bill to the consumer we're also creating other solutions that are making it more flexible for customers to really adopt new services and technologies for example adding your your vehicle to your mobile data share plan so if you know you have a family share plan you want to add your car on for you know certain ten twenty dollars a month you can add your car on to that same billing plan depending on what we arranged with that that manufacturer you also could do things like hey I'm going on a road trip or and i want to add Wi-Fi hotspot because my my kids are in the back and they they want to connect their multiple devices i want to turn that Wi-Fi hotspot on for maybe a week or a month or maybe the summer we want to create those unique billing situations in scenario so that customers have the flexibility to add these to certain services based on their needs okay great let's dive into some of the technical questions that we're getting here and we had one of those we had someone ask as you may know the world is expecting 5g to be the future of wireless communications 5g is definitely getting a lot of attention right now as much as it's largely theoretical in some instances but and saying you know no one has mentioned the challenges of the millimeter wave frequencies and the solutions in terms of bandwidth they will offer to the connected vehicle network now I wonder if we can kind of address this in the topic or in the in the sense of you know there are a lot of of technologies and and wireless wireless access technologies being used in the connected car now you know 5g is it i think is an interesting question just because there are a lot of challenges in terms of millimeter wave when it comes to a you know propagation in the as whether that would be how that would work for the connected car speed handovers etc does anybody want to talk a little bit about you know that aspect of you know wireless communications and the connected car going forward uh this is craig i have a few comments yes I in the millimeter-wave spaced in the coming years we could see you know two possibilities from a car one is the 5g cellular and the other is there's a technology in 802 11 ad technology also known as y gig up and up at 60 gigahertz and I was at an auto manufacturer recently and they told me they were interested in that and I asked about the use case and they said that it could be a use case where instead of having a redbox where you have to remove a physical CD or dvd you could get your car within 10 meters of the redbox and download the video into the car within two seconds using something like why gig and could be a similar kind of thing for what I understand 45 g the millimeter wave doesn't propagate is far so it's going to be used in very dense areas maybe small cells so it could be a similar kind of thing perhaps the the redbox could be using the 5g millimeter way instead of the Y gig solution as just some ideas I have some things I've heard okay great we have a question that's directed to at ixia and AT&T and do you see growing requirements from automakers to control the qos from Emma knows or how can they ensure an SLA with Emma knows i think that gets a lot into network visibility as well as you know maybe even some of the big data and analytics that are related to the connected car any thoughts on that from from either one of our distance sure this is Michael I'll I'll give some feedback first if you don't mind there are a lot of different systems in the car and our approach to the testing is that it's a layered approach that you have to build from the bottom up and so each individual system in the car needs to worry about how it can work to meet its own conformance requirements and performance requirements and then you have to keep adding them together and keep testing to ensure that as you then build these systems upon systems in the ethernet network that is your automobile that they continue to perform and make their quality of service requirements so it's not just being able to test one system aspect and saying well that system is good now I don't have to think about it you have to build that car together and keep continually testing the overall product and ensure that they can meet the qos needs that they'll have I'm with another question oh go ahead I'm sorry brain no we're just going to add to that and I agree I mean what are we getting requirements for from from our manufacturers absolutely but some of the the constraints that we have this kind of goes back to be even the question before that is some of the other constraints that we have is moving a lot of these solutions globally and we're talking about five key but believe it or not it's it's hard enough to get a lot of these manufactured moving from 3g to LTE yeah you do have a lot more capabilities with LTE but there's also additional costs and it's very uh the India automotive industry is a is a different industry to work within which they they definitely source a lot of the different from a lot of different suppliers using a lot of the cheaper products that they have so we have to deal with multiple bands in multiple different areas and really understanding yes that full end-to-end spectrum of oh you know when you talked about some of the services in the connected car what is that entire ecosystem look like security is another piece of that you can't just make sure that the security from the pipe is secure you have to really understand the whole thing from from everything that you're building into the car the vehicle infrastructure all the way back through the pipe into wherever you're connecting to so we do have to look at those four minutes all a standpoint okay we have another question comment that I think I'd like a maybe Brian Craig and and also Michael said maybe jump on and that is can you give an overview of a typical strategy for testing connected car solutions before they are launched to ensure proper operation on the commercial network now I think all of you all three of you come at the testing and strategy perspective from a slightly different viewpoints so um you know Brian maybe maybe you can talk a little bit about some of the basics of the typical strategy and you know as you guys work on development questions at the dr studio is there your typical strategy yeah so i think from a testing standpoint obviously we're working a pretty much n 10 with the automotive manufacturers to understand what their which typically these modules that are put into these cars they're built into these telematics control units these TCU's understanding what the tetteh the testing is like obviously with ver in various conditions we do also a lot of Road testing there's a lot of testing that that takes place because often you're not just testing in the city of Atlanta you know that it's more of these remote areas and there's obviously a lot of different things you need to take into consideration antenna placement power gains power limitations different bands different countries that support different bands things of that nature we really work hand-in-hand with the automotive manufacturer the tcu manufacturer which is the telemetric control unit and then all there are other factors as well whether they're you know putting in over-the-air updates and that maybe they're going to put in a client in their other module manufacturers could be like a sarah wireless or tell a tell it we work with them the qual columns of the world so we have we do quite a bit of testing out of here out of our ATT dry studio we also have a dedicated we call it our network ready lab that we also do a quite a bit of testing on for not only the automotive space but also the kind of the Internet of Things okay crane do you want to talk about from enrich news perspective how people are approaching the testing for the connected car thnks similar to what what Brian was just talking about there's testing it at various stages there's testing at the at the chipset level I companies like Qualcomm there's there's testing at the module level my company's good as Brian mentioned sierra wireless tell it you blocks gemalto and and there's and at the at the chipset and and the module and tcu level those products will go through testing probably at a test lab to do regulatory testing for the 3gpp for example testing a protocol and RF and and there's the ctia over-the-air type testing that gets done when the device is is is in its final you know placement or example in a car with with the antennas that it uses to make sure they all worked there's testing that goes on at the carriers like like where i mention in a tts lab so and of course you're saying that some testing some some auto manufacturers depending on their there i guess company policy or the way they operate some some some of these auto manufacturers do some of the testing themselves and some do more than others some of them try to push all that off on to the vendors and some of them you know try to do more that themselves but it takes place all all along the food chain and at each each level that the chip the module the tcu the car the auto manufacturer the DC manufacturer the module manufacturer the carrier the test house all those different places michael your thoughts on you know on strategy and testing sure I think one aspect to point out that i don't believe has been touched on as much as that there are multiple standards bodies being involved in this right now so such as the I Triple E autosar open and Avenue they're all developing different specifications that are becoming requirements in the automotive industry for some of these systems and so it's not at you know as people mention you know testing it to different levels and all that it's not an ad hoc process that's going on inside of the industry there they're basically growing from the ground up all of the standards that they feel they need to meet especially when you talk about the safety systems within the car some of the time-sensitive networks have some really strict standards on how fast the information has to flow inside of the card network and so there there's very strict standards coming out in those areas that are meeting those you know that allow the testing to meet those needs to ensure the safety of the vehicle okay great I'm Jennifer I wanted to jump back to you and talk a little bit about how this technology evolution fits into some of the larger trends that are going on in the industry and you know I OT organization and I'm wondering how you see connected car kind of evolving as part of these these mega trends that are driving you know a lot of other areas as well sure you know I think that's the connected car if you think about it is a node in the larger IOT and so it's not just any other node though it's a very influential note it's one of the most valuable nerves it's a device with an incredible number of sensors collecting data that's valuable to all other ecosystem players and it's also from a consumer perspective a point of connection between the home between the workplace between the consumer and retail spaces as well as infrastructure generally so what I'm seeing right now is more forward-looking industry players are trying to craft their strategies for how to work with with specific crossover use cases so what does it mean when we have the car communicating to the home what types of standards do we need to support what types of services might be possible there what business models would surround that so for instance where we're looking very deeply into the crossover between the connected car in the connected home space is and finding that consumers are really interested in the ability to access their entertainment from their home DVR for instance on the road with on for a vacation or to have the vehicle communicate with their smart home devices and tell them when they're automatically away set back the thermostat lasted or is that sort of thing and so I think that what we're going to see in the next three to five years is a little bit more of a fleshing out from both the technical perspective as well as a partnership business model perspective where these true crossover pieces remain and it's interesting because I think people think of the connected car space itself is being very emerging but what we are quickly getting to place where you know the the larger IOT market is moving these issues will have to be addressed great we had another question on is the growth of connected car primarily in 2g 3G or LTE thoughts on that from our panelists yeah I can maybe take the first Abbott that's so can it the connected car growth primarily i would say kind of today and going forward is focused on LTE and for the primary reason being is network longevity most of these cars understand understandably when let's just say i were to make an agreement with a manufacturer today it's going to be maybe about a two year time cycle until those vehicles hit the road and then those vehicles are on the road for approximately of the life cycle the vehicle would be about 10 years so you're thinking about 10 year or 12 years out in total that those vehicles will be on the road so you really need to be thinking LTE well a lot of services don't require LTE services and most manufacturers are moving towards that that being said there's still quite a few manufacturers that have 3g services and are even still rolling out 3g and there are a few that still have 2g services as well and as much as we talk about kind of the connected car market growing please understand that the connected vehicle space is a very slow moving industry traditionally moving much at a greater pace as of late I would say the last you know five years but it's still very slow and is and for good reason the long there's a long what there's long cycles of testing and validation required into the roll out a lot of these different technologies so it's needed in this space okay Michael I wanted to come to you and we were getting quite a few questions on various security related issues you know someone asking about the g-pack that was that was published by wired and earlier this year you know and some of these that you know these the security concerns that are related to to the connected vehicle and I wonder if you can talk a little bit about you know some of the things that are being done to test and secure the number of internet-connected technology entry points on the vehicle this was something that came up over and over again as I was researching this report that you know IP connectivity brings with it a lot of wonderful things but it also brings some risks as well sure um yeah as you mentioned are they're becoming way more entry points in um then there were typically in the past in the past most of the entry points also we're very physical that you had to be with a vehicle and now now you're not needing that so so one of the things to think about it and look at it is the connected car really is becoming a little autonomous network that needs to be treated as any other network would especially when it comes to security measures and so that means the individual pieces inside of it need to be secure and on their own as well but also the exterior and the filtering down through needs to be secure so you test it from the multi-layer approach right you'll you'll test each individual system make sure they don't get impacted by denial of service or other such attacks and you also need to ensure that malicious attempts to get in can be thwarted as well so it's it's no different than if you were testing any other you know network that you would build really when it comes down to it okay great Jennifer did you want to chime in on that as well absolutely you know we certainly see privacy and security issues being a huge issue among consumers that we speak to the majority tell us that they are very concerned fifty-five percent that are very concerned about the security of their location data and fifty two percent the state are very concerned about the security of their personal driving data the type of data that might be collected for usage-based insurance program for instance and to put that in context that's about double the percent that tell us they're very concerned about internet-connected devices from other ecosystems so when we asked about concern for privacy and security about connecting a door lock even which clearly has security very real security implications only about twenty five percent of consumers say they're very concerned about that Internet connectivity but when you talk about the car it's it's seen as on a whole different playing field from consumers so so there's no surprise that the g-pack is getting a lot of traction in the news I mean it's something that I expect to continue to see as this market develop um quick I wanted to jump back to you one of the things that I thought your slides captured really well was the sheer number of technologies that are going into the connected car you know obviously we have interference issues in wireless networks as it is you know first and smartphones we deal with that already and I'm wondering you know as as part of this discussion if you can talk a little bit about what some of the common sources are for interference in the connected car and how they were being addressed and it was it was really interesting to me to have this conversation with folks over the course of the reporting for this program you know there's some interesting quirks of the connected car and the connected car environment I think that make it a little bit of a different animal in some ways that not then you know your smartphone or your tablet sometimes very different
