 Moen's Strategic innovation team was exploring the space of a connected smart shower and came to us to do some early exploratory research. One of the biggest challenges was the fact that Moen has such a long wonderful history in hardware manufacturing but not in the digital space. We invested heavily in upfront user research— really understanding the space, really understanding who these users might be, and getting a sense of—you know—how viable this might be once it's launched. So the challenge with a connected shower is to really redesign something that is so intuitive already and not make it overly complex. We designed a lot of initial concepts. Everything from simple typography layouts to data visualizations. Really it was exploring so we were leveraging the research that was done and then sort of figuring out, with pixels, how this might map out. U by Moen really sets a new bar in terms of the connected home. You can customize, control, and pause your shower; all from your phone. One of my favorite features is when the color changes as the shower warms up. It's a wonderful visual indicator of what the temperature is. The U by Moen shower, fits into the evolution of smart home technology as it's the first. I think the water delivery and water management space is— I wouldn't say it's the final frontier of smart home technology, but it's a—it's really just being explored now and the U by Moen shower is a really cool and fun entry point into that. For the U by Moen shower I think it's just one less thing you have to think about everyday. You know your shower is going to be perfect.
