 Hello friends i am Shahbaz Malik and you are welcome at Electric Point In this video i will tell you step by step procedure to repair Home Theater I will explain about every component in Home Theater you can repair any fault in Home Theater by going through this video so lets start the video first of all transformer coverts 220V to 16V it outputs in 3 wires green wires contain 16V and yellow wire contain 0V so basically transformer converts 220V to 16-0-16 voltage right two 2030 ICs is for speaker and left two 2030 ICs for woofer we have already made a video to check IC 2030  (link is in description) but here you will learn a new method to check IC2030 16-0-16 voltage from transformer will receive at IC2030 right IC4558 increase woofer bass whereas left IC4558 increase speaker sound same voltage from transformer 16-0-16V will receive at IC4558 this 16V will go to mp3 card by this wire
