 As I approached my home, I unlock the door with an app on my smartphone, by using a direct Bluetooth connection. After the door unlocks, since my door lock is enabled with multiprotocol zigbee and Bluetooth connectivity, it then sends a Zigbee message to the connected devices inside my home, such as the thermostat and lights. Later, when I'm ready to turn down my lights for the evening, I again use my smartphone app to directly turn off the light in my room. My bedroom light, after receiving the Bluetooth message, then sends a ZigBee message to turn off any remaining lights and lower the temperature setting on my thermostat. This series of applications occurred without having to communicate through an IOT gateway or home hub all thanks to Silicon Labs' multiprotocol connectivity
