box it mentions that the Samsung Connect home is a three pack it's a three pack design what you get inside the box are three of these samsung connect home routers and the question that probably comes to your mind right away is why would I need three routers in my home I have one router I get decent signals sometimes it's good sometimes it's bad why would I need three different routers in my home well the problem with home today is that there's so many different shapes so many different sizes on one end of the spectrum you can live in a small apartment and on a completely opposite end of the spectrum you may have a three or four storey home and both places need Wi-Fi but one router is going to perform differently in a small apartment versus a multi-story dwelling that's where the Samsung connect home comes in the reason that there are three units is because they act in a mesh configuration what that means is you plug one of these guys into your home internet probably connected to a modem and the other two you spread throughout your home so let's just say you have a home where you have decent Wi-Fi but in one area of the house or maybe a couple areas of the house it's not as fast or just doesn't even exist at all you take the other two Samsung Connect units and you plug them in where the dead spots are and they'll talk to each other so in other words if you have one of these connected to your router on the first floor you can plug the second one in on the second floor and get just as good coverage up there as you would on the first floor and then you can take the third one and put it in the far corner of the house where your signal is super weak or maybe near your backyard where you might want to have signal as well and all three of these routers will talk to each other wirelessly spreading out your signal throughout your entire living space each Samsung connects home device can cover up to 1500 square feet so if you have three of them you're covering a 4,500 square foot home at a maximum you can connect five of these devices together giving you 7500 square feet of amazing Wi-Fi coverage you get up to 866 megabits per second on devices connected at five gigahertz and up to four hundred megabits per second for devices connected at 2.4 gigahertz on the back of each samsung connect home unit you'll find the reset button a power input and two Ethernet ports you can plug wired devices into the Ethernet ports for a more solid connection or plug these directly into your home network if your home or business is wired that allows you to take advantage of even faster speeds with ethernet backhaul eliminating data from the need to hop between the nodes wirelessly now as amazing as it sounds to greatly increase the footprint of your Wi-Fi signal that's not where things end for the connect home as I mentioned these also act as hubs to control your smart home devices that's right the connect home doubles as a smart thing hub connecting all your Samsung and third-party smart home devices to your Wi-Fi network and aside from Wi-Fi controllable devices it also supports controlling Bluetooth SIG and z-wave smart home devices as well this allows you to control a variety of smart home appliances and devices remotely this includes security systems smart locks kitchen appliances TVs speakers lights and more using the Samsung smartthings app on Android or iOS so what that means is that rather than having to jump between different apps to control different smart home devices inside your home you can use Samsung smartthings app which the Samsung kinetic home talks to directly to control all of your smart home devices I've found compatibility to be pretty wide and extensive as smart things works with devices from brands like lifx ecobee Lutron Honeywell Yale Philips you ring Google and many more so if you're looking to increase both your Wi-Fi signal and your smart home game look no further than the Samsung Connect home Wi-Fi
