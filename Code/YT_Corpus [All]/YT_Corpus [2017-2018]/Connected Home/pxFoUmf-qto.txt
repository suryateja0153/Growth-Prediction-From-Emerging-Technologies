 now we've been talking about home solutions and really doing those things that bring those things into our home that make it more comfortable how about cleaning and again I know cleaning is not always our favorite subject but what if you didn't have to do the cleaning what if you had a robot to clean for you that never got tired that never gave you excuses about why it wasn't done that cleaned efficiently every single time and you didn't even have to be there to supervise wouldn't you love that well that's what you're seeing right here this is called neato it's the bot vac Wi-Fi enabled connected robot vacuum and it is super easy to use super simple to use and you get everything that you need including the bot back itself you're gonna get that spiral blade brush the ultra performance filter the cleaning tool and the boundary marker and we're gonna show you how this works how easy this is gonna be for you to use and you will never want to push a vacuum again Alexandra Baker is joining us this morning she is our home BFF and Alexandra so who are you I'm so excited I've seen you using this in your home yes you had it for several months and I love this and for me this is all about how would you never like to vacuum your home again you don't have to physically do that chore that's really what this is about I'm all about you know a clean start in 2014 as your home BFF what 17 do I say 15 I took his back three years no we're in 2017 and it's all about a clean start and it's all about doing things that are faster easier and smarter and this is the quintessence of that faster easier smarter this is our neato bot back and it is connected so it does work with Wi-Fi but I'm gonna go through some of the features in just a few minutes because I have to tell you I don't touch my floors anymore oops - vacuuming or steaming this really does everything for me so you're receiving quite the package here all that you need all of the accessories the unit itself I don't know if you want to talk about that Tamara but it's quite the deluxe package everything that you see the unit itself you even get as you can see your spiral blade brush you're gonna get your integrated charging base with the power cord that's that that's the big one and that you know that really I think is one of the biggest points of difference between this and anything else that you've seen like it of course you get your ultra performance filter you get your cleaning tool your boundary marker you get it all and it and once it's plugged in it works on its own it works completely on its own now the first thing that you're going to notice you know because this is the latest most powerful of the butt backs that we've ever seen ever and so the first thing that you're going to notice is that iconic shape that is a d do you see that so this has got the clever corner technology it's able to really go into those corners if I flip this underneath you're able to see look at that extra wide brush yeah Tamara I mean look it's going from all the way more than 10 inches long so you're getting that nice long wide profile you've got these huge monster almost a TV like wheels that look it can even pick up on itself oh I really pick up and go over you know lots of terrain and different floor textures and also you know it's got the spin brush here and what I really love Tamar you're going to love this it's got a very large bin the high performance filter this high performance filter can pick up microns 0.03 like tiny tiny little microns so it's a large filter this is to give you an example of how much one round pickup can pick up in this really extra-large bagless bin so you just pop this in right like this and then I'm going to show you something pretty cool about this I'm just going to turn this on and in a couple of seconds it's just going to start doing a quick clean right in this area do you see that it's cleaning let's just have it do a house clean okay put in put my dirt but does that please put my dirt bin in correctly there ya go I love how it talks to me like that and I also can control this from my Wi-Fi from my phone so we'll be talking about that just a minute okay but some of the features include you can have that spot clean or the power it's got two different cleaning modes it has an eco mode which means see how it's not going to fall off so if you have stairs wow it's not going to go through the stairs we have a little bit of the boundary marker this is a tape that you can lie down anywhere in your home if you have a very large home and maybe you just want to spot clean the kitchen or you just want to clean the kitchen with the boundary tape it's not going to go past the surface you can see how I'm not trying to catch it it's not going to fall off the ledge Oh Alexandra so if you have stairs or even if you have a sunken living room Tamara it's not going to fall into the living room this is great fantastic it's working with laser mapping that is a big difference this is working actually with a laser and the laser is actually looking all around the room you can work in the dark it can work under and around furniture and because of that laser smart mapping navigation it's intelligently looking at the room devising the ideal pattern its cleaning the room four times faster than a typical boss back that you're finding on the market okay it is doing you see this methodical pattern it's not doing a random pattern it is cleaning up and down like in rows going deep into the corners backing up cleaning going all around going underneath your bed underneath furniture it has powerful suction which is so important and that large brush let me show you this brush your receiving two brushes now the first brush is the combo brush and what I love about this product is you open up the box it's completely fully charged you don't have to charge it you don't have to do anything all you're going to do is take out this base plug it in if you'll notice on the back it's got a nifty little so that you can take the slack and then tie that in plug that into your wall put this down and then nito very easily just backs itself right into the charging base on its own which is so nice this is I don't have to touch it I don't have to do anything it's going back to the base and it's come fully charged and it has the brush already installed and the filter is already installed so you just open it up open it up and press it on and you're really good to go and then this brush it comes with the little cleaning tool so this is actually mine Tamara I know this may not look very pleasant but I can actually you know clean the brush with the blade very easily yeah and get all of that out so it cleans up very very nicely yes somebody on my blog said Alexandre your house already looks pretty clean why are you using this camera I know this doesn't look pretty but we have a white Bunning in cucumber and I have named our we our family has named our neato bak bak QT number two oh yeah and look this is just from a couple of passes just look some of the bunny Cobb oh my god okay some of that buddy Cobb has gotten in there and the hair the white hair you can see my black hair you don't want to be sleeping on this breathing this this is in your home even when you think your home is clean so that's why it is so important to look and consider a robot like this especially one with that digital mapping and the mapping that's going on so let's go over and start vacuuming let's do it and this is gonna this is gonna be so fun because we're gonna vacuum and we are not going to you know really have to do much we could vacuum and read a book at the same time we could vacuum and take a nap at the same time we could vacuum and go to the movies same time absolutely could we can just let it go and let it start and I'm just going to you know press the house button now I'll be honest because we're here in the studio I'm actually you know bending over and pushing the button but when I'm at home yeah I have it set you can have a schedule and with the Wi-Fi app I'm able to use my phone and I've got the app right on my phone and I can schedule my neato cucumber to to clean my home every single day at 2 p.m. we got this home schedule this to clean it every other day or once a week or sometimes this happened to me on Thursday I was here in Saint Pete and for those of you who know I live about three and a half hours away from the studio I was going to be heading home I knew in about an hour's time my my needle would clean my home cucumber would clean my home and so from st. Petersburg three and a half hours away on my phone sitting in a little restaurant having my coffee I was able to select go ahead and start cleaning and it tells me when I'm cleaning when it's ready to clean yeah see it's fully charged yeah ready to make you clean okay when it's cleaning and then when it meets when it needs to charge again when it's charging all of that is right there on my phone I so excited about this because my favorite word is delegate everybody says delegate that means somebody else or something else you need doing something that must be done and it doesn't have to be you and wait a minute and they're doing it as good a job if not better than what you would normally do did you see what's going on here the very first thing it did was clean the perimeter so very intelligent because of that intelligent mapping what it did was first do the perimeter and then look in methodical rows it's not doing a random pattern notice how it's doing just methodical rows up and down so if you're a little OCD yeah and you're thinking oh my god I wanted to get every single spot look at that on the very first pass through it picked up everything it's working on berber carpet this is the type of Berber that many of us have in our bedrooms and then it's working on laminates and hard floors getting into the corner you can see that fin brush is kicking out anything in the corner yeah and look how it's making the little turns even though these are very tight curves yeah tighter than anything you probably have in your home I am so excited this is going to free your mind and free your time because your floors are the largest surface in your home that's right why are we do use a dishwasher for your dishes yes use a washing machine absolutely by hand yeah so why are you manually cleaning your floor's yeah with a vacuum or or some type of sweeper yeah a broom and all those allergens are flying around yeah when you can the the newest latest most powerful suction the best way to clean is with your needle back and this is the deal too because you're right the we use robots so to speak or machines so to speak and so many other avenues of our home everything day this is one that allows you to keep your home cleaner because I've always said when your floors are clean your whole house is clean even if you didn't do anything else even if you didn't dust or or wash a window when your floors are clean your your you know your carpets and your floors are clean everything looks cleaner your house smells fresher so if you could have this done if you could just either program it or press the button imagine you can actually clean your floor's every single day that's more than any of us ever would vacuum or sweep you could do this every day and you could have that clean and come home to a cleaner looking home every single day so when somebody calls you and say says I have 20 minutes out can I come over you don't have to panic you can say sure turn nito on and then go put on a pot of tea or coffee and you're ready when they get there absolutely and I do recognize this one is free shipping which is gonna be great you do have flexpay so what we make it even more even more comfortable it even more affordable for you to get it home and you can try it out to see to fall in love with it add a flexpay of one $39.99 so they don't wait I think flex is no favor this is a really cool feature we all have a place in our home I'm going to hit spot clean right so this is the little icon you can see the little spot there I'm just gonna turn that on it's here in its docking station it can be anywhere in your home but we all have an area in our home where maybe it's just an area in the kitchen where there's always a little bit extra mess maybe it's outside of the bunny cage or the kitty litter bin maybe it is you have let's see spot let's see I'm going to do a spot clean here there you go it's gonna do it in a turtle maybe you have an area like underneath your bed so Neto is going to cover the entire house but on occasion you have an area where you really want to concentrate maybe a 7x7 area or a 13 by 13 area it's only going to spot clean so the first thing that Neto is doing is its using its laser we can't see it with our eye and it's checking out the perimeter yeah it effortless effortlessly goes through the furniture yeah it's scanning the perimeter and technically cleaning the perimeter now we're in you know a wide space here in your beautiful home here Tamara and thank you for letting me be a guest here with you today and it's just checking out its boundaries it's checking out the perimeter oh it's going to do one pass around and then we will see it doing the methodical rows back and forth cleaning every area you know is really really cool because you know we've you've probably seen like BOTS VAX for a number of years now and they get progressively better and better and better I swear that there was somebody in there one is the best that you know likely the best that you've ever seen this one is brand new so you are seeing it early you're seeing it first if you're saying yeah that's one less chore that I have to do ever again I mean it's so worth the price it's so worth your time and energy to to find out what this is all about get it in your home and see and truly truly see what this is gonna be and how this is gonna be in your home so Nieto is going to work Nieto is going to work and when we were talking about you know sharing this incredible new product with you and it's the latest it's the best you know where this was birthed Stanford University a team of entrepreneurs said that they wanted to create a robot vacuum that was just smarter more efficient more powerful and they knew that with the laser technology that digital mapping of the room you know laser mapping of the room and that methodical navigation of how it actually cleaned rent versus a random cleaning was going to be critical so this was done at Stanford University in 2005 and by 2010 Neto was on the market and became just a customer favorite and everybody fell in love I love bringing products into my home that are that are actually going to help you know help my life you can see that methodical mapping you can see how it's doing the perimeter and then it does the rows the the iconic D shape is really important and that extra-large brush I mean look at the size of this brush you know we're looking at it cleaning up methodically but I also want to remind you the brush I want to talk to you about this brush okay this particular brush you're receiving to one is the spiral and it's almost like a silicone like yeah Tamra I have very high gloss shiny floors I mean lightly veined by glossy shiny almost like a sub a subway tile shiny because of this silicone like texture I find that it's not only picking up hair but it's also kind of wiping the floor I've never seen this before like wiping the floor so it almost is to the point where I do steam you know I use my Sienna Luna D mop but which I also tend to grab because the floors were already clean yet so you know you don't steam mop or mop your floors as often because but now I find that even this is keeping the Troy walked into the house and said did you run the steamer after and I said no I said I really think that the brush is just cleaning so the combo brush is ideal for as you can see picking up pet hair look at my long black hair I mean you probably the same thing we've all had bear all over all over the leads into the bedroom so on that Berber it's got a great job of picking it up or if you've got dirt that's really in the carpet use the spiral brush okay because then it's a continuous flow of that silicone rubber like really dink and cleaning that carpet I get so excited about this because of all the things that I do for my home for my family to prevent allergens to get the dander out to just keep it fresh and clean my home is often on display because it's photographed a lot you know I mean it's not a fancy home you guys see my house but it needs to be cleaned yeah and so because of that I was always concerned about the floors and it's been a non-issue I want it to be a non-issue for you yeah I mean I notice you've seen I mean look at this not a spot missed it was smartly done and really neat Oh vacuum sort of the way that we all vacuum check it out check it out and here he comes check it out you got to see it goes back to the base is he gonna back in he's checking out where he needs to go he's looking around so you know my bedrooms are way down the hall and then I see neato going all the way down yeah and going all the way back to the base and here's another thing neato knows where he is where he's been and where he's going so cucumber to in my house knows all of that so let's say he runs out of charge of working on a lithium ion battery look at that he's right back to his base and so he's working on a lithium ion battery which is a very long-lasting energy efficient and also good for the environment battery and maybe he's running low on his charge well he will go all the way back to his base yeah charge he'll remember where he left off and then he'll go down the hall and say I remember seeing that bedroom but I didn't get to you yet so now I'm going in that bedroom I'm going to map that bedroom and continue this is smart I I had no idea sometime here I brought you a cup of coffee because I told you I do a lot of demos yeah and on this one I feel like all we have to do is stand up and drink our car I mean literally uh the house work it's like having your girlfriend just come over and you go check out my new toy oh and let me tell you this is the gift that you'll want to give from Valentine's or Mother's Day where the wife will not be insulted thank you the one that she actually wants she's not going to be upset if you get this to her or for your mom she's not going to be upset she's gonna be excited she's gonna be glad that you thought about her because this is something we have to like we say we have to do it all the time anyway so when you call me up and I say and you say what am i doing and I'm saying oh I'm cleaning the floors SYP SYP wink wink right that's neato doing all of the work that is the deal this is I say this all the time we are living in this kind of in the Space Age we're living in those times that we always dreamed about we read about in those books or watched on those cartoons when we were kids where all you had to do was put your food and into a box press a button and it cooks it that's called a microwave put your clothes into a box and press a button and they washes it or dries it that's called the washer and dryer now you put your knee toe on the floor you're poor you drop the dirt you press a button and nito cleans the floors how much do we love that I'm so glad that we are using technology now to do the things that now don't have to take up our time is how long does vacuuming take how long does doing this on a weekly basis all and for every room in your home take we don't have to calculate that time anymore because nito is gonna do it without thinking never get tired and never complain and it's also really doing this the only times I find myself like coming down and actually do it is here at HSN because at home I do everything from my smartphone you can do this from your smartphone or your tablet using the wife now I know you hear the word Wi-Fi and maybe that can be a little intimidating you don't have to use the Wi-Fi you have seen how here I have just simply you know come right down here and you know press the button so you can control everything you know right from the touch of a button and it's so easy now what we have put down is a little bit of the boundary tape we've given you two rolls of the boundary tape one is longer than the other and what it does is maybe you've got your grandchildren over they've got their toys on one side or your pets have their toys on one side or maybe you're working on a project and and you just can't be bothered with moving it yeah lay down the boundary tape make sure it's flat it is magnetic make sure it's flat yeah and what that does if the magnet is not necessarily for your floor the magnet is telling nito don't go beyond this boundary so now you can see the perimeter was done only within the area that was open yeah and then where we've got the boundary tape neato cucumber too yet has not go over there and he's just cleaning up the area that he was told to clean okay remember so if that tape is gone yeah we'll know to clean that area this is just to cool it really is this the perfect name for it too and I think this is what you're gonna say when you get it home get it home and try it out and really put nito to the test because I know even though we're showing you even though you're seeing everything that it can do I know there might be a little bit of still being a little skeptical because you know Lee's vacuuming the same way our entire lives so I get that you might be a little bit skeptical but so what try it anyway if it can save you from doing this job ever ever again then guess what it was money well spent would you ever go back to washing your clothes with a washboard in the river no you would not that's why we have a washing machine when you try something that actually saves you time and energy and and really frees you up but wait but still does the job great you're not giving up a clean floor I mean you know what I really understand I'm a mom I'm a wife I run a business you've seen me here at HSN I'm in my car driving I mean I'm just busy I have my daughter I mean it's just it's so much sometimes as women
