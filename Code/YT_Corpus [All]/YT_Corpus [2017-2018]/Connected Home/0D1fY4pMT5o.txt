 Hey Ryan check these out man we just got these brand-new Samsung wireless Wi-Fi cameras for security for the outside of the house where should we place these, take a look. Well typically you want to be able to place them where you see your front doors but you also want to take a new account if someone, some creeper is going to come up, like yourself, dark van you want to know where they're driving from. How did you know I had a dark van? So I'm thinking maybe we'll put it to where it will catch the front door. Great. Plus the means to egress to the neighborhood so when they leave, you got their license plate number. Well you know we got a couple more cameras for inside so we want to put one sort of it's a 350-degree motion activated movable camera with an intercom system so they can speak to the kids or speak to the dogs when they're on the road right from their smartphone. So we actually have a really good spot and it will shoot the front door, the back door and the stairs so it will catch every means of entry to the main level and upper levels. They look like they're super simple to use and we can get them done. Good well speaking of getting it done two screws buddy. Here the DIY guy. Two screws man! You go and get on it brother.
