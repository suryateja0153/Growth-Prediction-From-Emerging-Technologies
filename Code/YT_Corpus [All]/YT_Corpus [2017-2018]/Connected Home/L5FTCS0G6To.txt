 GAFA Google Amazon Facebook Apple Hey are you guys doing happy Thursday I'm here with the CEDIA Lifetime Achievement Award winner Mr.. Eric Bodley also known as the Future Ready Solutions. I just had a great conversation with Eric and wanted to put it on some video and tell you what we were discussing obviously it's about the Giants right which we would call GAFA Google Amazon Facebook and Apple thank you to Bruno Napoli for that terminology and Eric's been in the business for a long time and the thing you just said to me is you know Rob some of you guys have only been  through this one time but you know I've been through three or four or five times and I just wanted to get his opinion on what was going on in the industry and how he feels well you're asking about GAFA Google Amazon Facebook and Alexa what that means  is it threat and to me it's just another part of the cycle of our industrial years ago when most of the industrial or small mom-and-pop high-class shops we had companies like Best Buy and Circuit City and we thought it was the end of the world and look where we are today after that cycle so I see these big GAFA Google Amazon Facebook and Apple really opening the market consumers to learning and embracing network technology because we're gonna continue to see data just hence and if you're not looking at fiber is the high way to do that good you're gonna get left behind because it copper just can't it's reached the edge of its cliffs right so networking data I'd love to come meet with you and Eric it's how long would it take us to terminate by traffic today well if I don't talk maybe maybe a minute and have thirty do your hands get if they don't get dirty at all there you go listen I just wanted to get some advice from the man hopefully you guys are watching and hopefully you invite us in with future Eddie Eric I appreciate you congratulations on the CEDIA award thank you well deserved thank you
