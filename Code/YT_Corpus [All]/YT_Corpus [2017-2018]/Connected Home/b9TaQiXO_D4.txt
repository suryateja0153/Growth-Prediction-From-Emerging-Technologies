 the new Moni security system is up. We were gonna look at the new security cameras outside but hey, it&#x2019;s really hot out there. Why don&#x2019;t we just check it out on your tablet. Absoultly. I think this would be great at my house. In case Gunny tries to come by. That is amazing. How you guys doing? Very good. How&#x2019;s the excitement level? Was so low. I'm sure it's been crazy. So listen. On behalf of Moni smart security, I couldn't be prouder to have had the opportunity to take part in the Military Makeover and today I want to show you some stuff about the app and how the system works. These are the ones you're gonna use the most. So when you leave the home, you press the away button and just in one, in one press of the button, it's gonna arm your system. It's gonna lock your front door, it's gonna turn the lights off, it's gonna turn the temperature down in your home all done very simply with one button. So it makes life a lot easier for you and when you get home the opposite events are gonna happen. Also on the app is all your video cameras set up on there your light modules, your thermostats, so you can control anything individually on the app as well too. You can just if you're sitting on the couch and you want to turn the light on just press the light module button light comes on you don't have to get up for anything. One of the features I really like is the on the panel on the door once that's you put in your PIN or your personal password it actually deactivates the system. So therefore you dont have to race into the house. We used to race up to the panel and put in another password. That's really convenient for us Moni focuses on comprehensive home security, the best customer service, and the fastest response time to an alarm. It's been an honor for us, for Moni to be part of the makeover and for myself as well so thank you again and appreciate it! [Music]
