 SEXTON EXPLAINS WHY.rt  THIS IS JUST NOT RIGHT. ADAM: KATHY STACK IS CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A STALEMATE. HER HOME ON KNOLLWOOD DRIVE INrt MERRIMACK HAS A WELL THAT TESTED AT 74 POINTS PER FOR TRILLION PERFLUOROCHEMICALS, JUST ABOVE THE STATErt HEALTH ADVISORY. WHILE SHE RECEIVES BOTTLED WATER SAINT-GOBAIN, ABOUT 2 1/2 MILES AWAY, IS DENYING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONTAMINATION AND REFUSING TO CONNECT HER HOME TOrt PUBLIC WATER, AS IT HAS DONE FOR HUNDREDS OF LOCAL PROPERTIES. STATE OFFICIALS CONFIRM 5 OTHER HOMEOWNERS IN MERRIMACK ARE IN THE SAME PREDICAMENT.rt  WE DIDN'T CONTAMINATE OUR WELLS OURSELVES, THIS WAS DONE TO US, YET NOTHING IS BEIN DONE. rtADAM: KATHY SAYS NO ONE HAS ANY ANSWERS, AND SHE'S NOT SURE WHO CAN HELP.  SORT OF A FEELING OF ABANDONMENT. BUMMER, TOO BAD FOR YOU, YOU'RE rtON YOUR OWN. ADAM: CLEAN WATER ADVOCATE AND STATE REP MINDI MESSMER OF RYE SAYS DES NEEDS TO STEP IN.  I THINK THE STATE SHOULD MOVE rt FORWARD WITH PROVIDING A PERMANENT WATER SOURCE FOR THOSE PEOPLE, AND THEN COST-RECOVER LIKE VERMONT'S GOING TO DO. ADAM: VERMONT TOOK SAINT-GOBAIN rtTO COURT AND WON A $20 MILLION SETTLEMENT IN JULY. DES HAS TRIED TO WORK WITH THE COMPANY, BUT IN REGARDS TO THE CONTAMINATED WELLS IN DISPUTE THE STATE SAYS "rt THESE PROPERTIES REMAIN THE SUBJECT OF ACTIVE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN NHDES AND SAINT-GOBAIN. NHDES IS HOPEFUL THAT THESE NEGOTIATIONS WILL BE SUCCESSFULrt IN PROVIDING A PERMANENT CLEAN DRINKING WATER SOLUTION TO THE IMPACTED PROPERTIES." rtWHILE THE STATE IS STILL IN NEGOTIATIONS OVER THESE PROPERTIES KATHY STACK SAYS MORE TALK IS NOT WHAT'S NEEDED RIGHT NOW.  TAKE ACTION. DO SOMETHING. BECAUSE DAMAGE WAS CAUSED.rt THERE IS HARM THAT RESULTED FROM THIS, SOMEBODY CAUSED IT. WE DIDN'T DO IT TO OURSELVES. ADAM: ATTEMPTS TO REACH SAINT-GOBAIN FOR COMMENT WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL.
