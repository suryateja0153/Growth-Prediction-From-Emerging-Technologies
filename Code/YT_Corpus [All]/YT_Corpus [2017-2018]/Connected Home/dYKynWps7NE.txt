 (Music) Ryan and Russ are working with MoniSmart Security to give the Tagues smart control over critical parts of their home. For safety and to help them save money on utilities. Bruce, how are you? Great, how are you? Great to have Moni on board. We appreciate your help. Security systems are super important for any family but especially for Ed and his family. Couldn't be happier to be part of this. Security in todays world is really more than just security it's automation. You see I got Stephen here who's also a veteran. Thank you for your services. He's installing the cameras so we're doing a lot of things with cameras, and door locks, and thermostats, and light modules, and motion sensors. So it's really more than just security and really help them to protect all families and more importantly help protect our veterans in a sense to be safer than what they're doing today. Come home, have automation there and push one button house lights up, thermostat cools down, the cameras are active. Well we can't thank you enough but there's a lot going on there like you mentioned so listen if Gunny starts yelling at you guys if you're not working hard enough tell them I already talked to you. Alright, thanks great job!
