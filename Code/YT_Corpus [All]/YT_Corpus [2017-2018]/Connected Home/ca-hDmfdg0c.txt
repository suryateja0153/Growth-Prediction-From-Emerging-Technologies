 or you can have your cookbook this is about truly connecting you to a healthy home that's different from adults you've seen on the show this is not about cleaning this is about actually physically being healthier doing the things you love to do in your home you're exactly right I'm a big TV junkie and I take a lot of plates to the couch and my wife is like you're balancing that trick where you keep it on the side of the chair or you have got it on the side of the sofa then it tips over and makes a mess sometimes you just want to sit and be able to watch now when I'm just changing it to another position I can tuck it back in my chair I could tuck it back in the couch and now Brett I can sit it right down there so I've got my little sandwich I'm a little snack and I'm ready to go but this may be I've got my laptop here maybe my kids are doing the homework here it makes it so convenient cuz it turns a chair that normally wouldn't have access to anything else and you can place it right there now this is just one of several positions that I've got a tucked in but you can also when you're done with this you can actually tuck it up to virtually nothing the legs will fold up the whole thing only weighs one and a half pounds and this is my daughter's favorite thing is that I tell her to clean up and she lashes like that it's not really cleanup this is so easy to do because you push the button you tap it down and up Brett it'll swallow ya fun or the desk look at it at its full height I mean you know your daughter could literally just be standing around she could be on a tablet she could be on a computer doing work doing research doing projects you can take this up onto a desk it adjusts to every major height imaginable you get that bonus mousepad that's thrown in when you buy today this is a new new new launch here at HSN and we saved it exclusively for you to be the first customers to see it it's on four flexible payments only for today it will replace the TV dinner tray and so much more sometimes you need to do work on the computer and you want to do it lying in bed right you want to do it on your favorite recliner you still needed to sit easily you still need to be able to the keys not wobble around you know sitting on your lap is not efficient where does the mouse go there's a great idea well the exactly right especially you can see we have it in different positions there and you might be thinking oh yeah this is a phenomenal price KYNA really holds your laptop absolutely and the way they've designed this it actually can handle up to fifteen pound a laptop or 15 pound device sitting on top of it that's heavier than any laptop we've ever sold here at HSN at least for the past 10 years so if you want to get your laptop off your lap now you can bring your flex desk with you and then now you've got that comfortable position that you can put it on now I also love the genius design behind it because laptops are notoriously hot well the way they design this is that they actually have a vented section I don't know if you can see it it's got little holes that are on there so now it keeps it nice and vented so now the laptop is not going to be an issue for heat no longer and it also has a little lip here that'll keep it rested right on it we are also including the bonus mouse on the bonus mousepad adjustment so even when you're not at a traditional desk you can take this with you and use it as your full functioning desk you know and there's another there's some other really great ideas with this it really it's sky's the limit with this one you can use it to set your cookbooks numb and open I don't know why it's facing me I'm not cooking tonight you could use this to set up your cookbook in the kitchen and not have the surface space of your countertop taken if you don't have the luxury of having a desk in your bedroom but you want to do work on your computer in bed college kids that are in small dorm rooms and no desk space putting a laptop computer on your lap it's kind of ironic it doesn't work it wobbles around can't really type efficiently what this does is it gives you your countertop space back it gives you a sturdy level and totally adjustable playing field it even comes with these great little clips so that when you angle it you can have your laptop sitting totally stationary you could have the cookbook sitting totally stationary and it's not taking up any space if you notice Joe's setting it up right now I mean if you look at right now he's sure right back up do you notice that underneath his flexed aspirin is all desk for papers or research your bills that's a small desk and a lot of you only have a small desk you just doubled its size and can adjust where the computer sits and as a computer user it makes it so much easier to be able to use computer but also be at that right eye level because when the computer is right there at your eyes it's gonna be easier for you it's get more comfortable position but also notice that because my arms are raised up it's more ergonomically correct cuz normally you'd be hunched over that laptop you start feeling that pain in your back or your neck because you're leaning over this it just creates a natural unnatural feel for you and even though it's elevated I still have my desk space down below I'm still getting that bonus mousepad on the side so I don't have to worry about where my good mother put my mouse it's included that's a bonus you're getting today and more importantly it's a very comfortable feel now there are a lot of desks elevated desks that are out there accessories that you can purchase they do cost a tremendous amount of money this is virtually gonna fit on any desk you don't need more than more than 22 inches wide and now it can become the perfect desk and now when you want to stand up just take your laptop down there are many positions it's this will work in I'll take my mouse down I go ahead and put my screen up a little bit I go ahead and click the hit the clips on the back side I'll readjust my mousepad and you're seeing how simple this is I can do it you can do it you're gonna have that power to do it now when I'm ready I just stand up and now I can use my computer as that full functioning standing position truly very natural and now getting that blood flowing once again yeah that really was what this was about today there's all this research that's been done sitting is the new smoking we're all getting poor posture sitting over a computer like this if we can get you standing half the time if we can get you up and looking in a northern direction we are improving your posture we are giving you healthier back support and then to be able to do it comfortably like this sitting in front of the television in your favorite recliner on your comfortable sofa maybe you know you don't have a guest bedroom with a desk in it but guests come to visit want to work on their computer right grandchildren come and need to do work for school maybe you've given up an office to have a guest bedroom now that you have grandchildren this is a real deal totally adjustable totally customizable

in the kitchen when we were making her cookies my daughter sits us down on the floor and she does all of her coloring down there and now she's gonna be using her homework because you've got that great service with you and all the different legs you can angle them at different positions you just push the button and makes that adjustment there's no screwdrivers needed you just figure out what position is good for you and it customized and it works like that and when it comes out of the box it comes flat it comes 100% flat nice and easy that you can tuck it under a couch and then when

up next is very near and dear to all of our hearts it's the brand new water filter but before we start the presentation I have to give everybody heads up final call for the year and a very special deal was negotiated by our friends at DeLonghi this is their most powerful their most innovative their true all season portable air conditioner why is it all season because it's a heater as well it is your portable air conditioner in the highest capacity that we offer and it is a portable heater now there's two things that you need to know okay its end of the season but this is the only all season we offer we have 250 left now in addition to only 250 left to offer that's healthier air because it's got biosilver technology and a dehumidifier that never has to be emptied out but what I want you to know why this is so special that we're doing this for you tonight the $50 rebate from DeLonghi expired at the end of July and they're offering it to you for one last show for one last chance they were so thrilled when I called and asked them to be a part of this show when our team put this show together and said healthier cleaner air can be accomplished by a portable air conditioner they are giving you that $50 mail-in rebate if you place your order tonight it's coming up in just a little bit now this is the connected life offer of the show it is what we call our featured item present it is the brand-new aqua sauna powered water filtration system it is the only of its kind that we have ever offered here at HSN that is actually electronic true movable water filtration it doesn't just sit and stew in a static filter it moves the water through the filter without anything permanently installed in your home and allows it because of that movement through the filter to clear over 60 contaminants in your tap water in under 60 seconds cleaning a half a gallon of water purifying it in under a minutes time and what you buy tonight will replace four hundred dollars worth of water 2400 plastic bottles with a plug-in high-powered one-of-a-kind system now why this is our feature item of the week is there was a major expose on a Sunday morning talk show about a website where you can enter in your zip code and it will tell you based on your municipality how many contaminants are in your water now here in Pinellas County it was five dangerous contaminants five over the limit of healthy limits contaminants in our water and an additional 14 contaminants that are advised against aqua sauna is a one-of-a-kind product and Stephanie Roberts is going to take you through the technology inside of it we're gonna talk a little bit about the need for true air water filtration in your home but this system will remove 99% of lead and 95% of chlorine I just want to say that right out of the bath lead and chlorine out of your water for $32 on your credit card and over $400 in savings in your water Stephanie we're so glad to have this here and I think when people visually see it they'll see but it's really unlike any water filter system we've ever offered absolutely and you mentioned LEED and chlorine I want to mention chloramines too because 95% of the chloramines are pulled out of your water with this that is what caused the problem in Flint Michigan we have all heard those news stories this company aqua sauna brought these in to clean up the water in Flint and now you can bring them in to make sure your water at home is safe now I want to show you who are actually getting two different systems here you're getting the ability to do a gallon and a dispensing on-demand pitcher and you can also do a half gallon picture that goes right into your refrigerator now look what happens here I've turned my tap water blue to show you the contaminants in it look what is immediately happening in the picture do you see the blue water going down and crystal-clear water coming up that is aqua sauna that's really fast that's not a drip drip snap filters sitting in its own filth in the fridge that's not a replace and it runs and pops off of your sink faucet every single day you saw the movement that's why this is a powered water filtration system that's what makes it different that's what makes it faster that's what makes it more effective now it's a gorgeous countertop accessory if you want it in blue I have 30 if you want it in red I have 60 liters there's only 600 of these to go around we're going to work fast and furious to get more aqua saunas in stock get yours home now when water is life absolutely and this is water that you can trust aqua sauna is pulling out 66 different contaminants that includes 99% of the lead 95% of the chlorine and the chloramines and 96% of pharmaceuticals you think your water is safe but do you really know that's where this website has come in where you put in your zip code and it pops up the information this is the kind of water that you want now the user friendliness of this to me is out of this world it has this amazing sleek configuration I'm only four and a half inches wide here so it fits right on the counter this pitcher slides right into the door of my refrigerator so what I'm doing is that I now have the ability to keep one cold should I want and then I can hook the other one up and use it as a dispenser I want to show you this black unit here because once again we have filled with tap water there's actually a great spout right on top so that all I do is slide this dispenser under the tap I feel in my tap water we you can see the dispenser there we have gone ahead and turned the tap water blue to show you the 66 contaminants that could be lurking in it and then with the push of a button do you hear the power firing up there that tells me that each and every time I dispense myself a glass of water I know it is filtered fresh it is not sitting there dripping through what we call a gravity filter it is on-demand fresh filtered wine I know what you're wondering what is my future cost involved additional filters each of which replaces 2400 bottles of drinking water the replacement filters they're not a hundred dollars they're not fifty dollars they're 29.95 in fact our savings tonight as the connected life premiere of aqua sauna will buy you an additional filter and it will tell you when it's done and needs to be replaced there are thirty dollars for replacement filters we will keep them in stock we only have actually a hundred and forty of them if you want to add it to your order right now if you're worried about longevity of this brand remember what Stephanie said thank you I want you to try this is the brand that was sent to Flint Michigan this is the biggest water crisis in this country this company is what is making that water healthier and safer exactly aqua sauna has been doing this for over 20 years professional large commercial filtration systems this is how you get that quality filtration in your home tell me about the taste clean pure delicious fresh and you know one of the reasons there smells no odors yeah aqua sauna leaves the good in right now we think about taking things out well there are certainly things in water that we don't want to take out those would be the healthy minerals so aqua sauna leaves in the good stuff which means it tastes good with this unde Amanda Spencer you can get a gallon worth of water ready for cooking ready for smoothies ready for formula Oh to know that your infant is drinking pure clean water and why would we want anything less for our pets when you start to think about all the different uses if you ever have read the coffee machine it tells you use bottled filtered water and look at this right here there's a lot of great information here but I'd like you to all go down to the third line for a minute you're going I need some real deal proof here you're making some big big claims this is a major brand start here it is NSF certified for over three hundred gallons over and over and over again and then you just buy a new filter and it's NSF certified to keep going and keep going and keep going all you do today is choose your color you get both the picture for the fridge and the tap dispenser you choose black you choose white if you want red I have 50 if you want blue I have 25 this is a ten minute or sellout special launch we are honored and proud to have finally gotten our hands on aqua sauna like Stephanie said this is a professional water filtration company and this is one of their first that is a consumer in-home model it is electric powered you don't set this up to a water line you just pour it into the dispensers you can take it with you to your next home you don't have to buy filters every time you go to the grocery store water is the thing of life and unfortunately old municipalities old piping whatever the issue may be it really does clean it and clear it in a way no no other of its kind can 66 contaminants come out you see right here the blue represents the contaminated tap water within 60 seconds I have a half gallon of perfectly clear professionally countertop filtered water available to slide right into my fridge or keep in a countertop and dispenser it's what's happening inside aqua sauna that is different than anything else that you have ever been able to use in your home for water filtration this is power and pressure and when you understand what's happening inside it explains how the contaminants are literally pushed up through the filter and push out of the water that takes some power think about it can the gravity water filter when it just drips down through the filter really push anything out of the way the answer is no 60 psi here are blasting the contaminants out of the water and through the filters that is how we know that our water is getting clean the filter is a solid piece of equipment and I love that when you look at a gravity filter it's plastic this is hard carbon block and that's what's taking out the contaminants for me Brett mentioned how easy they are to get a hold of you are going to get 2,400 bottles of water the equivalent of a hundred cases of water with one filter and filters are only $30 we've paid for an extra filter you get your first one with you I've got less than a hundred filters left but more importantly aqua sauna is the company that was sent in to Flint Michigan they're not going anywhere you will always be able to buy additional filters and what you are owning look it's a visual reminder to drink more water it's a visual reminder not to take what's in the tap it's the easy grab in the fridge cold water or easily dispensed water for your coffee pot water for the dog bowl water for making the formula it's fill plug and turn on there's no permanent installation here and most powered models are permanent installation buys yes and it would think about it you don't want it stuck under your countertop forever what if you move what if you weren't to Grandma's for the weekend and you want your infant to have that high-quality filtered water send kids off to college with it you don't know what you are drinking until you go to the website and put in the zip code and you can do it you can check it out but get your aqua sauna first of all we have them available it is now five minutes or sellout if you want white it is now our number one top seller and I'm down to about fifty in white that one will now be the first to go and it's the one we have the most of you get started I've got 40 left in red and I've got 15 left in blue by the time we get to the final moment or two it's only going to be black what's going to be left in stock once you invest in this you never have to buy the big full model again you just buy $30 filters and each $30 filter will save you $400 in plastic bottles it will reduce the plastic output an input in your home it will save you space in your pantry carrying them home messing with them yeah that's a bit of the environmental look at the way it works when when Stephanie talks about a gravity filter that's the drip drip drip that you bought at the grocery store that you buy over and over and over again the reason you have to keep replacing it is it sits in its own muck yeah it needs to be replaced this is pressure and filtration together giving you a better cleaner healthier drinking water experience and also I want to note the blue light on the front that tells me that filtration is happening you may want to wonder when you're gonna be at the end of your filter life this gradually turns to a blinking red and then it will go to a solid red but not for 320 gallons of water I love the fact that I know when I have aqua sauna that 66 contaminants are being filtered out that 99% of the lead 95% of chlorine 95% of chloramines and then you think about pharmaceuticals and runoff that's out of there as well this ensures that my family is getting the best high quality drinking water possible I threw in my zip code for the heck of it for unhealthy home as soon as you start to do some research you realize you want to know what you're cooking with what you're making baby formula with what you're giving your pets what you're putting in your coffee maker everything tastes better when the water itself tastes correctly you know the end of the day even the bottles of water we don't really know where they come from babies are the lovely Asian water is is well water and there's no guarantees what they're doing or not doing with it you are buying one of the first home models of the company that was building commercial models for the last two decades the company that was sent to Flint Michigan to help solve the biggest water crisis this country has ever seen and Flint is just one of many cities we hear in Pinellas County have seen over 5 dangerous harmful contaminants and another 15 that we're not supposed to be exposed with lead and chlorine are the one we all know about and it will take 99 and 95% of those out we're not just making up these numbers they all have to be legally approved aqua sana is NSF certified not many in the industry are the ones you're buying at the grocery store over and over again are not the bottles of water do not say NSF certified for cleanliness anywhere on them there is no policing this is what connected life is about this show is healthy home this is the foundation of your personal health you and your spouse and your kids for the iced tea that you make and the dog bowls that you feed with water and the formula they make for your baby it's not obtrusive it's

dispenser on demand on your counter you know what my kids used it all weekend long because it's fun so suddenly we're drinking more water and then they thought they didn't want to drink water because

the AC and we have this one set up on the heater so all you have to do to switch modes is push a button so this is as you know this is DeLong ease top-of-the-line it's also the one that will take you year-round so a couple things about it before we start cuz I know this is our healthy home the filter there's no maintenance whatsoever to it I want to show you a little difference here because it has what they call the biosilver filter you never ever have to buy a filter it's a permanent filter that comes with it and with this filter it inhibits the growth of mold and bacteria now there's no air filter that you buy at the grocery store for your major central system that has bio so exactly and then you end up breathing that now a lot of the other this is a foreign one so it's your air conditioner your dehumidifier and it has the heater and a fan a lot of times when you have that dehumidifier a lot of other units have water standing and then you end up getting a moldy filter and then you end up so you don't have to worry about that with DeLonghi no maintenance ever this is portable so you can move it from room to room and listen to this installation five minutes and no tools you don't need a screwdriver you don't need to bite or knife you don't need a handyman you don't need your husband to help create a husband you did it myself okay so we're gonna show you how to set it up the other thing top-of-the-line it has a quiet mode on here which our others don't and then it has what they call real feel so it will automatically adjust the heat humidity the air conditioning to where it feels right in your area of home also it has your remote control and then it has a timer I know Brett was talking about some ways to make it energy efficient and save money right there your timer you can set it to turn on or off so if you want to check the sizes of your windows it fits any standard window windows excuse me they go up and down or the kind that goes side to side and then it comes with this piece right here this is an adapter right here that adjusts and it fits windows 20 inches to 47 so this way or this way to kind of go up and down so you just put this in your window again no screws you can keep your screen in so there's the screen right there there you go and then you take the back of this all portable air conditioners need a way to vent out now this is important there's no water there's no drips inside the house or outside this snaps in just like this and then you put your window down it even comes with a weather seal and then right here 14,000 is the most powerful the most powerful you can go with a standard outlook exactly anywhere that fits into a standard outlet so this is a three prong outlet you turn it on and that is it so I do want to remind everybody as you're seeing that you're not losing your blinds you're not having to give up an entire window you don't have to worry about your HOA or drip drip drip along the side of your home or that ugly eyesore unit right here this is our true best of the best and once you own a DeLonghi you or by again my daddy says you buy or you buy smarter you buy often this will be the last portable unit you need in an emergency in a single room because you're an empty nester and you don't wanna cool the entire home in a winter problem store you know there's so many reasons why every home in America should have one of these we have 200 left with the calls coming in right now at the best price you'll find anywhere else the retail value is over seven hundred and sixty dollars you can get it on flex for 120 you get $100 off HSN's price you get free shipping and handling which is almost an additional $40 and only for you tonight DeLonghi has taken their expired rebate and is extending it exclusively to you it is final call for the year it is final call in the industry it really is the night to invest in healthier air in less dangerous climates I mean we know that summer is now far from over it is a hundred and eleven degrees in Phoenix Arizona it's a hundred and five in Las Vegas look I don't need to insult your intelligence you know how hot it is you know that it is only going to get hotter and you know that a super hot summer is going to lead to a very cold winter you won't have to worry about an emergency if God forbid your system blows you don't have to worry about you know heating or cooling an entire home if you're an empty-nester exists to keep yourself comfortable and it's cleaner healthier safer air with de'longhi than what's coming through your central unit and Gosling knows what exactly you know on the weather map did you see where it's like Green and then it's red it looks a little bipolar doesn't it and you know what's going to happen in a couple of months one day you're gonna be running your air conditioning the next day you need your heat and when you have this DeLonghi all you have to do is push the button right here where it says mode you can go from your air conditioner to your heater you don't have to replace anything all you have to do is touch the button right there to go in between modes it also has a digital thermostat right here just like your central air so you adjust it and it will automatically adjust to the right temperature which is another great way to save money you can adjust it up or down by either right here on the controls or your remote control this little rate see that little icon right there that's like a mom shushing their kids that's the quiet mode so all you have to do is push the button and it goes into a quiet mode and then this is the only unit that has what they call real feel again this is our very top of the line with features that we don't have on other ones and what it does is wherever you live if you live out west and it's dry or if you live in the East where it's humid it will take your temperature wherever you live and it automatically adjusts so it's that proper feels comfortable temperature which is nice so let's talk through some of the other features here we're obviously going to show you this side-by-side comparison but you guys know this you know that your HOA won't allow that big bulky ugly window unit you know that it knocks a window out from use all season you know that is drip down and ruin the outside of your home you know that it's not healthy you know that somebody broke their neck trying to set it up in the first place you know that it's stuck in one window of your home rather than being able to move it from room to room and keep yourself cool and comfortable and temperature regulated wherever you are in the home and you know that you're spending the same amount of money on that old clunker anyway and you know when my husband and I moved into our house our house is 100 years old my husband was up on the roof holding this to try and balance it and I was on the other side trying to screw it in and then it sat in our window for 10 years because it was too hard to pull out okay this right here is the window unit this is only 6500 btus on the other side this is where I just installed the Jelani over there which is more than double its 14,000 BTUs which will cool or a room up to 550 square feet also you can keep your screen on remember the DeLonghi is on the other side here nobody would ever know little animals can't get in because you can keep your screen on nothing hangs over and nothing drips no drips the water standing other units like this when they have that dehumidifier let me show you what the standard is you have some sort of a bucket or a tray and it constantly drips you have standing water it can create mold I know Suzanne and her house they had one overflow today no bucket to ever replace no standing water no mold and mildew bacteria growing healthier cleaner and more comfortable air you know heat is a killer but so is mold and mildew that you are breathing in you know we had a problem with their central a/c unit the insurance company took over a week to fix it it was August in Florida oh my gosh and when they came to fix it mold in the walls surrounding it all had to be ripped out all have I'm grateful that had to be but listen I couldn't go to a hotel for two weeks while they fixed it and if I had it certainly would it cost me more than what you're spending today to have better comfort better features the ability to zone cool and zone heat and not pay to heat the roof not pay to cool the kitchen when you're in your bedroom ladies and gentlemen literally this is one of the big investment buys that you make in your home I know that I know that it's a considered purchase but what you need to know is this price is done for the year this unit is last call for the year and if you're thinking oh I can suffer through one more month first of all summers got at least six weeks to go and second of all this one is a heater as well high-powered major real-deal warming heat from the same exact unit this one never gets wheeled into the garage this one never gets put down in the basement this is a all season highest power best unit that we offer here at HSN and you're not paying seven hundred and sixty dollars you're not paying $700 only for you for the last call for the season for healthier air with less allergens and less dust and mold and mildew coming through your major systems you get it for one hundred and twenty dollars on your credit card if you want it I have maybe 150 left to go we have maybe 10 minutes left to offer to you and present it to you take advantage do your research by all means by midnight tonight but don't miss this opportunity because we will not have these back in stock and I believe it's the best investment you can make in lower energy consumption and a healthier cleaner air for you after your family yeah comfortable healthy temperature yes and no maintenance remember that installation is five minutes you don't even need any tools to put it in and I want to show you once again because we have this one in the AC mode right here and then we have this one in the heater mode so we have this set at 64 degrees but it's so powerful at 14,000 BTUs when I put my thermometer this is the little temperature gun here watch when I turn it on it instantly reads that in the 20th yeah 2020 1917 1914 okay well you're well you're boiling high weird air while your air conditioner while your air conditioner is struggling to cool your home in a hundred degree temperature it's a degrees of air output right now you're overpaying to cool your entire home the room that you're sleeping and turn your thermostat up a couple of degrees in the rest of the home and then to switch it okay in a couple months when you need that heater watch this and maybe you don't want to heat your entire house maybe you just wanted to heat a certain room okay this one's in the heat mode and we have it it's reading at 133 if you can see that 138 140 ok so instantly when you turn this on it I want to talk about the dimensions again because this will either heat or cool a room up to 550 square feet that's the largest because this is the most powerful so that's a room the size of a two-and-a-half car garage that's either a small apartment or that is a big master bedroom or that's you know your large family room this is the most powerful 14,000 and it's portable if you want to move it from room to room you can let me show you installation - real quick if you want to measure your windows 20 inches to 47 and it's totally flexible so you can see how it adjusts right here you just bend it or just pull it out right here you don't have to screw it and it just fits inside the window you can keep your screen twenty to forty seven inches and then you can put that down and then this back snaps in like this you plug it into a standard three prong outlet and I want to show you two on the back because all you have to do is snap your hoses six feet you snap and click that on and that's it and I'll tell you what sleeping as you have mentioned before it's better to be cool at night it's healthier there's so many benefits so your master bedroom is nice and cool and with a quiet mode and quiet dark you don't know anything Hey to cool your kitchen so it is a real investment I understand that but it is also a major cost cutting measure long term if you're somebody that God forbid lives without central heat god forbid lives without central air this is the biggest and best solution that you can possibly have but even if you're somebody that has the luxury of owning both of those as a backup as a zone solution as a my AC unit malfunctioned and we had to wait a week for the insurance company I needed it I needed it and the cost of a hotel room was extraordinarily expensive I had two kids and three animals it wasn't even an option this was how we kept her family safe in over a hundred degree weather and to know that this is your silver infused healthy filter versus what you're breathing in right now with alternative methods or with the filters that you're buying over and over and over again at the grocery store no water to mess with no mold or mildew or anything like that and I do just want to remind everybody because of the immense value that we're so thrilled to be able to offer to you now I know you see 200 left and available in stock we are processing through about a hundred orders right now it is seven minutes or sellout to get not only the best model we offer not only one of the only models we offer that has heat as well as cool and to get it at this special price the HSN price is seven hundred dollars the retail price is seven hundred and sixty six dollars we are giving you $100 in savings for final quantity for final call for the year and DeLonghi has this to extend their $50 mail-in rebate exclusively to you it expired at the end of July it's only available now for about a hundred callers as we process through your orders this is not just about an air conditioner right it's about cleaner air it's about better energy consumption and your home with having money yeah and listen heat is arguably deadly yeah 11 degrees in a lot of us still live in buildings without central air this is your best solution it is the best solution and we want to compare to what the what else is out there and brighter there you go there's that's the heater that they're showing one's an AC and one's a heater there's no attachments all you have to do is push the button to go in between your modes but this is an alternative and this right here is only 6500 btus the DeLonghi is 14,000 they don't make a 15,000 in portable air conditioners and also this one doesn't have the heat I want to show you the back again I know we went over here but these hang out the window if they're upstairs somebody has to get on the roof or on top now that's not healthy that's neck breaking exactly you have to screw it in there's no easy way to get it out either I know that from personal use and this is the DeLonghi right here there's no drips it has that no drip technology there's nothing that drips inside or outside of the house right here and you can even keep your screen in now I want to show over here because we show the alternative this has it's your four in one that DeLonghi this is not the DeLonghi but it's your air conditioner your heater it has a dehumidifier and it has a fan most people when they hear dehumidifiers they get nervous because of the water there's no buckets with DeLonghi so the other units like this what you have to do is they have the constant drip and you have to empty this outer the unit shuts off and when it shuts off you restart it but I want to show you to what happens with your filter this is what Brett is talking about when you have standing water you end up with filters that get moldy like this and with the DeLonghi by the way it's a permanent filter and it inhibits the growth of mold and bacteria because it has biosilver so there's no buckets and you're not going to end up with these moldy filters like this okay so now is your time I have to be very front and clear about this we didn't really have enough for this show it is really a phenomenal way to invest in a healthier home and a safer home in cleaner air and lower energy costs and at the end of the day it is our most premium top-of-the-line model at a very special sale price and I haven't even mentioned flex pays for absolutely everybody every major debit or credit card will ship

end of July but they wanted to give everybody one last shot because it is a hundred and eleven degrees in Phoenix and it is 94 here in Tampa it's even 90 degrees up and cool calm Seattle Washington Wow and the thing is I know you're hot this summer but once you buy you own it next summer you own it this summer after that and you didn't have to spend $750 and by the way if you go to the major a website out there if you go to the major hardware store competitors you'll find one 10,000 BTU 8000 b2 air conditioning only at 800 bucks exactly yeah but this is well over the HSN price and it has the heat remember because we don't sell a lot of them here that have the heat it's your year-round and this one in particular is the top of the line it has a quiet mode it has what they call real feel so it automatically adjusts your air conditioning I know sometimes it's blowing cool but it still feels wet this one automatically reads it it has actual sensors inside right here and it reads the temperature of wherever you live and it will automatically adjust and I want to show once again so it has a digital thermostat this is a great way to save money because instead of it running all day long this will automatically go to 64 that's where you have it set we have it set on the lowest here's my thermometer or my temperature gun right here when I you can see it's in the 20s going down I mean this is the most powerful 14,000 it will cool or heat a room up to 550 square feet so that's about the size of a two and a half car garage now watch this is okay and we have never gotten in digits like this and below or 99 degree nine degrees degrees think about high hand is reasonable that will be when you are boiling when your air conditioner is struggling when your freon levels are low and nobody will come out for a week to take care of it or they want to charge you an arm and a leg you can zone cool and sleep better at night without needing to freeze your kitchen or worry about
