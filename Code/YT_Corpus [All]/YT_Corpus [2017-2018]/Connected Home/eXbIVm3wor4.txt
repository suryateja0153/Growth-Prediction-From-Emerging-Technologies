 To begin setting up your SENSE router and pairing it with your first device, you should ensure that your old WiFi router is connected to the internet. Next, open the SENSE app and select the "Create your SENSE network" button. On the following screen, make sure that you agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy before selecting "Let’s start". Plug the SENSE router into a power socket using the power cable included in the SENSE box. Your SENSE router may come with different types of plugs for the power adapter. Use the plug that is suitable for your country. Wait for the router’s display to turn on, then select "Continue" in the app. Wait for the router display to start pulsing. Once this happens, press the blue button located on the lower back of the SENSE router. When you see a four-digit code appear on the SENSE display, select "Continue". It may take a few moments for your device to connect to the SENSE router. On the next screen in the app, enter the code that you see on the SENSE display. Once your device has been paired, choose the Wi-Fi option of connecting SENSE to your router. Select your router’s WiFi network from the list of available networks and enter its password when prompted to do so. Please wait as your SENSE router connects to your router’s network. At this point, your new, secure SENSE network will be created. Use this network as your home Wi-Fi network from now on. If you’d like, you can now change the default name and password of the network. Select "Continue" once you’ve edited the credentials to your liking. You can find the network name and password at any point in the SENSE app under the Devices tab by selecting "Add new device". The setup is now complete. You’re now protecting your first device using SENSE. To protect your other devices, connect them to your secure SENSE network one by one.
