 [Music] at this very moment we're busy connecting millions of Australians to the things they love but what about tomorrow see all the other things that make us human will never change the ways that we connect will we're building a smarter future where clever innovations will change the way we live work and play for the better and one thing's for sure life will be easier giving us more time to focus on the things that really matter [Music] we'll work smarter and faster machines will actually talk to each other so we can concentrate on the big picture communication will be the new transport immersive technologies will allow us to feel like we're in the same room even warmer miles apart we'll be able to be at home when we're at work and work when we're at home work and life will be truly balanced and imagine saying goodbye to waiting rooms appointments will fit around your schedule and the world's experts will be there literally at your fingertips [Music] shopping will become more social more interactive more engaging in fact the whole way that we transact will be revolutionized entertainment will take on your dimensions will create more interactive experiences that put you in the heart of the action we're making our cities smarter they'll be cleaner safer and more connected capable of responding to the here and now now tell us what we need when we need it it's going to be amazing but no matter how much technology will influence our everyday lives there will always be some things we'll have to figure out for ourselves paper tab is the world's first paper table pc paper tabs represent apps as physical windows working together to create a seamless experience the location of each paper tab is tracked on a desk through an electromagnetic tracker tabs help by the user act like full screen physical windows topside arms reach in the warm zone show thumbnails of documents while cold tabs that are out of reach show app icons these apps can be opened by touching them with another paper tab when a tab is held by the user it's flexible touch screen allows full editing of its contents here we see a user picking up a PDF document by touching one paper tab showing the PDF icons with another the document is open and navigated by bending the display allowing the user to flip through its contents without requiring buttons or swipe gestures here we see how a user uses a pen gesture to fast forward to a video the user reverses the action by dog-earing the display in the opposite direction here our user is creating a larger view by placing two paper taps together because the displays are thin it's very easy for users to draw or drag graphics across multiple tabs as you would with paper by working together paper tabs make it easier to work with multiple documents than traditional tablets emails are simply opened by touching the inbox tab with an empty tap a quick dog-ear creates a reply attaching a photo is as straightforward as tapping a reply with the photo the email is sent by placing it in the outbox in paper tap each app is a tablet it wakes you Wyatt Lee and punctually with a gentle vibration and by so doing without disturbing those around you [Music] [Music] it won't allows you to get bored turning the usual morning job into an enthralling composition having chosen an opponent well match to you even if they're on the other side of the world [Music] with the technology of a wireless payment system it will replace your wallet as well as your apartment and car keys and what's more it will assist in keeping tabs on your finances helping to control your expenses it will keep an accounting of your nutritional input by tallying up the calories of food that you buy in the store and deducting the calories which you expend through physical activity in addition it will not only keep track of your weight but also the nutritional value of your diet indicating to you in a timely manner any deficiencies or over abundances of vitamins and trace minerals which you require observing the chosen diet if Keeley feels and understands you so well that it can easily determine if you will like a new movie or not even before you have watched it it won't let you down and at the point where different people's tastes collide it will help to find common interests and choose music for you and your partner matching both your tastes the perfect assistant is like a person's character everyone has his own unique one the s bracelet an assistant with an attitude I'm Natasha and I'm here from p2i demonstrating our hydrophobic nano coating technology so well I'm gonna start with the tissue this is a bit of a party trick for us one of these is treated with our nano coating technology and the other one isn't now the coating is a thousand times thinner than a human hair so actually you can't see a difference you can't feel the difference but if I put these into the water you're going to see a very big difference normal tissues will wet like you'd expect but on our hydrophobic tissue the water simply beads up and rolls up nowhere your company you make a tissue we don't make tissues we make the coding so working with electronic manufacturers like Motorola and TCL we apply this technology onto electronic devices and I'm going to show you why here so normally when you get your components wet you can see that the water spreads out on the surface and in fact in this point right in here capillary action is pulling that water into the phone now on our hydrophobic phone instead of being pulled into the device the water beads up so the water molecules are now more interested in themselves than that and if I give it a little tip that water will come straight off we would work with brands like Motorola and right at the end of their processing we would go on just prior to packaging and supplied in the plasma chamber which looks similar to a fridge and we'll put about 800 phones in there at once and the process goes down to a low pressure and it gasses the flight and that goes both on the externals and the internals of the device absolutely we lost in October 2011 with Motorola and in October 2012 we launched with TCL so Alcatel OneTouch now this we're very excited about because this is almost our next-generation technology it's got similar hydrophobic benefits to splash proof but it's got a barrier technology so it's actually physically stopping the water molecules from interacting with the electronics that enables us to have had this phone under the water for an hour and fifty five minutes now why just gonna leave it in there all night and it's fact on our booth set up like a standard some production this is a standard Samsung Galaxy s3 well we've applied it and you have to open it up and put it well it's a nano coating which is about a thousand times thinner than a human hair so actually the coating is applied at that low volume low pressure and the gas so it doesn't necessarily need to get opened up can go in through out yeah we're talking about gas now well if nobody explained it to me recently which I thought was very good it's almost like it's growing on the surface so we're forming these very very very tiny polymer chains on the surface of the product but right they're kind of like no we put it into one of these plasma chamber machines so we'll put the phone in there and lower the the air pressure so when you apply the gas and put it under a plasma it's going to grow all those molecules together to form these polymer chains yes we can do yes so when we work with Motorola on the slash group technology then that's actually a really important part of us being able to commercialize the technology because that way we can be right at the end of processing and we don't interfere with their production line making us very cost effective yeah so Duncanville for us is still just the technology we're working with pioneering brands to commercialize the process making sure that it provides everything that they need at a cost-effective and industrial scale it depends on the price of the boat so if the Impostors normally absorbed directly by the manufacturers so the consumer doesn't please a consumer won't see any increase in cost well this is actually a water repellent technology not waterproof but they in the water over I know but waterproof others as the definition implies that no water is getting into the device and actually here this phone has water inside of it it's full of water room is full of water right master working but it's still working okay so it's yeah a certain amount of time again it well actually what's going to happen fast is that the phone battery will run out and we'll need to take one of the reasons why we apply it in this plasma chamber is to get that bond with the surface so it informs the covalent bonds so permanently applies to the surface we have 56 patent families protecting our patent portfolio and we actually originated as the part of the Ministry of Defense to protect soldiers clothing from chemical attack the UK ministry and absolutely yes then we've got other sectors as well so we work in filtration life sciences Footwear in fact even Timberland in case twists apply this technology onto their shoes k-swiss in particular is quite interesting because if you're running a marathon in their shoes you don't want those Footwear to gain any more weight can you talk about the revenue not me personally I can't but I do have other people here today we're privately yes [Music] ring is a wearable input device which will allow you to control the most anything you just need to wear the ring and tap on the side to start your gesture ring captures and analyzes your gesture inside of it it sends the data to your smart devices vibration and led notifies you of status updates and notifications each application has its own unique gesture mark so when you want to use it simply perform the designated action gesture marks can also be edited making customization simple and easy to control home appliances simply sync ring to them using your smart devices you can connect directly or by using the hub when designing read we had to start from scratch we made numerous prototypes in each time we got smaller while as functionality improved capturing and analyzing the fingers movement was also a challenging task in 2013 our gesture recognition technology was still in its early stages however by 2014 and has been nearly perfected and has even precise enough to detect letters now you can type text midair anywhere anytime we also provide ring fun with making typing quick and easy another unique feature of ring this is advanced payment solution gateway when used with GPS or ibeacon ring allows you to immediately make payment transactions revolutionising the way you shop we will also open API so developers can make original applications and publish in the ring store the ring store allows you to search for and install many applications we've already tested and confirmed that ring works with numerous hardware smart devices and web services [Music] you
