 on the dishwasher because that's smart speed and that power belt technology this won't even get dirty so go ahead and throw everything else in the dishwasher and store this in your utility drawer you know at the end of the day there's so many healthy better choices you can make when you've got the right tools there's so many ways you can make things from scratch yourself and you're serving for the holidays out there and not buy premade at the store you'll save money you'll save time you'll get a better end product and experience a meal to serve start using it in your 40 seconds I now have

or their zucchini pasta this comes included this is also makes perfect mashed potatoes or cauliflower mash it's the puree attachment everywhere else this is $25 okay so now you're getting that completely included basically as a freebie do your avocado your cauliflower mash use it for your mashed potatoes and then switch to your chopper you guys this comes included as well so none of this is extra we're not adding asking you to add anything on this is a one and a half cup chopper and you can up completely control so you can see what I'm doing there with my fingers if I like a chunky salsa I just have to press a couple times I can stop there I happen to like the creamier style salsa I can do that there so now we've created this really fun party dip so I know it's all about entertaining for the holidays or if you want to just do this for yourself and your kids or your spouse you just paint the inside of a bowl with that puree of the avocado and then you just take your fresh salsa right so this is not from a jar there's no preservatives and you pour that fresh salsa right over the top of your guacamole and what a beautiful healthy fresh dip no preservatives no chemicals nothing that you're worried about eating let's get back to the basics of eating healthy so we're at close to a thousand sold and he's a wonderful gift but it is a great empowering way to take control over what you're serving when is the indulgent meals and when it's the healthy choices in between you know our our guest expert tonight AJ Johnson she says there's 30 days between Halloween and Thanksgiving to eat healthy to make better choices so you can eat what you want like it on Thanksgiving there's 30 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas when you have the right tools the right tricks you can make better healthier fresher choices for you and for your families and you're investing in a company and the brand and in a product that is the industry top best yeah and you're doing it all today in a better value than anybody else in America gets you're getting every attempt and even the beakers that are comfortingly size that you see a fella using all of it we're connecting you to tonight for a $20 bill you spend 20 and you get phenomenal clean easy quick meal prep answer and so when you were doing that smoothie what would you have gotten out before you would have gotten out your big clunky blender that you don't get out very often because it becomes a pain in the neck creating four hundred watts is what the four hundred dollars stand mixer I'm not allowed to say the name brand but there's a 400 $500 stand mixer in the marketplace it's about 400 watts I'm not giving you 400 watts literally in the palm of your hand you guys all you have to do is pull out your want to get 400 watts the big barrier to eating healthy often times is cumbersome getting out these big large machines now I'm asking you to open your utility drawer the same drawer you put your spatula in right and go ahead and grab your motor choose whatever attachment you're getting a year this is Braun it is so highly rated that I don't know if there's anything above 5 stars but if it were it would be getting 5 stars and it has that smart speed so all you do is pull if you want slow and pull further if you want fast and you're getting all the attachments which come included and this had no liquid added there are very few blenders in the marketplace that can actually take solid and turn it into a liquid the Brawn hand blender is one of those blenders that doesn't need an extra liquid added now officially over 1000 sold extended holiday returns and a $20 bill think about what you could take off your countertop no I laugh in that little video there's a blender in the back it's not being it's for decoration yep and there was probably two if not three times the price of what you spend for your multi quick immersion blender you know it's unfair to call it an immersion blender because all the frustrations the headaches and the hassles you've had with immersion blenders in the past they're all gone with the Braun the vortex the power the versatility there really is nothing else like it out there in the industry to control what it is you're eating and serving as a holiday season ants to save you money yeah when you forget makes it angry food or did I knock it out peanut-butter right so originally and if you watch it's actually free that more tags where it's pulling down but if you wanted to drop your knife you couldn't even stop but it's actually created more time so it's extracting right here it's already extracted all the oil from the peanut naturally right now back down to the blade and start again literally starting from a full jar of peanuts it was into this that's really and created the most creamy decadent peanut butter but this could be almond butter or cashew butter around the holiday time I like to do macadamia nut butter you know what a beautiful thing to serve what an awesome gift create your own homemade peanut butter jars little paint jars and give them as gifts to people you know homemade peanut butter is expensive and now you can do it without getting out a big cumbersome food processor a big cumbersome blender now you can create it by just getting out that single one that one that gives you 400 watts of power literally in the palm of your hands I will let you know this is a product we have not been able to keep for the rest of the year and consistency that you've never gotten in the past with anything like it and just stop for a moment and think about the prices that you spend for kitchen gifts yeah that for the kitchen lover for the person who's cooked for you and hosted you and what have you priced out and what is it costed this will exceed their expectations it will be better than anyone they've ever owned before and it's yours to shop for today for a $20 bill you know what about those that are now downsizing smaller kitchen great idea not enough space 7 countertop appliances this is such a multi-function product for that it really is and this is that $25 attachment that comes included normally you have to buy it as an extra add-on all we did was we softened our cauliflower whether you want to steam it or press or cook it whatever you want to do and I'm telling you right now if you're trying to eliminate carbs from your diet my friends season your mashed cauliflower just like you would season your mashed potatoes and people will not know the difference but whether you will notice the difference is in your waistline it's so much healthier to do a mashed cauliflower and it tastes the same in fact if you go to these five-star restaurants they're serving cauliflower mash instead of mashed potatoes or they also have it on the menu along with mashed potatoes and you're only able to do that because of that masher it actually air rates your food and don't get me wrong it will do mashed potatoes okay and I am gonna do mashed potatoes like I am NOT a purist I'm a mashed potatoes at my house and I'm also gonna have cauliflower mash because I have that attachment where all you have to do is to pop it on and then guess what when I'm done using this attachment throw it in the dishwasher there's virtually no cleanup you're getting a full year on the warranty and you're getting bran it's the number one we basically invented the category we are the number one immersion blender in the world basically right and this is the best buy that we offer in the industry it's the number one top selling customer pick model today you're getting that $25 attachment included you're getting all of it for $20 on your credit card as Kelly tempts you with desserts available $20 on your

at the end of connected life this entire show tonight was built around the launch of the Food & Wine brand here at HSN they have a great big today's special that's coming up at tonight we are launching our hottest most exciting new cookware line the food and wine line and the hottest best most sought-after high-end cooking tool in the industry right now and that's a sous vide and food and

connecting you to the most innovative sought-after way to cook for the holiday season we've got an exciting new guest Justin Chapel who's joining us but you can shop for it now and be one of the first to be able to own it now AJ Johnson is joining us she's a celebrity life coach is a health and fitness expert and as much as we all want to throw health and fitness out the window during this time of the year she's given us lots of great ways to be balanced in this season's thank you so much for joining us I love being here health and wellness it should all be a part of the holidays we shouldn't feel like garbage now or we enjoy it right no because the first thing I say is please don't think you have to be so got Apple healthy to have a good holiday okay so we've talked a bit about hosting and guessing and cooking and all this kind of stuff but obviously here at HSN giving gifts is a very big important tradition that we do we always want empower our customers to have some great ideas so as a fitness guru there's a lot of fitness tech and fitness traces out there what would you recommend to somebody who wants to buy a health and wellness fitness gift oh my gosh I love anything that's really really practical like I love thigh bands because they do the same thing as a machine but clearly lightweight I like hendrik hand bands they're really inexpensive any sporting goods store has them and you can use them anywhere throw them in your suitcase foam in the back of your car I also love matter of fact like even the blender the hand blender I want one I was like just staring at the TV like oh my gosh that's perfect because I usually do a nutribullet right but you're right it's bigger it's more cumbersome and this is awesome no when you talk about the fitness gifts dare I say there's maybe sometimes a bit of a hesitation is this gonna be like an awkward gift that you give to somebody how do you sort of empower somebody but say this is supportive and loving and how do you make it a fun gift again I think the best thing to do rent is to just stay creative I mean one thing you can do is make it a friendly competition and say listen you know girlfriend we've been talking about you're using five pounds I lose five pounds how about the first person who loses the five pounds gets a free spa day and then it becomes fun okay I think the other thing too is you know try something new you can do new dance classes if they're into yoga you can do new yoga classes if they're into body sculpting keep it new keep it fresh and how about something like a gym membership with wherever you are so that you can do workout partnerships somebody new at the gym with you always kind of gets you motivated and doing new fun stuff you show off a little bit what you've accomplished okay no we are focused in the kitchen okay this week so as somebody that wants to promote a health and wellness lifestyle what kitchen tools do you think people should look at as holiday gifts oh my goodness I said the blender which I love I'm hooked on you can tell them up fast it's my new thing my new favorite thing outside of that I would say a food scale I know it sounds like oh gosh AJ it's too specific but it helps you really monitor your serving sizes especially at the holidays I also feel like a good gift from the kitchen would be a pressure cooker because for me perhaps it cooks everything you can walk away it's ready you can serve when the kids come home from school it's already in the pot you don't need anything else done AJ thank you so much for being one of our guest experts here in connected life you're a wonderful welcome member of the family and I promise you we'll make sure everybody stays a little bit healthy during the holidays thanks T's is the season okay thank you so much for being here we look forward to seeing you again well there you go she asked for it she said to gifted you know it's the easiest best way to prep and serve without going to fast

grandma cooking worthy meals home for the holiday season an extraordinary price right Kelly oh my gosh Brett have you ever seen ribs so tender so moist so juicy so decadent your ribs will literally melt in your mouth when you do them in a pressure cooker if you haven't started pressure cooking or maybe this is a great gift idea for somebody it's gonna blow you away the leaf Bistro line is the number one selling pressure cooker line in the history of HSN and there's a reason for that you are getting top-of-the-line features that you've never seen in a hundred $150 pressure cooker but tonight we're bringing it back to you in their number one requested size you know at the end of the day Kelly I start to think about the fact that yes I'm hosting 24 at Thanksgiving but I have to cook every other night of the week this is the perfect meal when you're busy when you're cold when you're behind the list when you're trying to get everything set and ready this is from frozen to perfect in absolutely no time it's safe it's easy and it's never been more affordable today in fact not only did we put the pressure cooker on sale we even put the pressure cooker cookbook oh wow and sale of the lowest price ever so if you've ever wanted one but you just don't know what exactly to do with it we've got a cookbook available for only $17.95 but this is connecting you to homemade food two great dishes to you know just that perfect it's cold outside be with your family but not worry about how you're gonna serve the whole family yeah that's absolutely right so pressure cooking is so amazing I love it year-round but it's my favorite way to cook as it gets colder because these are our sort of homemade stick-to-your-ribs like lovely type of meals that grandma used to make right look at 4 quarts of mac and cheese it's the OES gooiest softest most decadent deliciously melted cheese perfectly cooked pasta 4 quarts I mean even if you got it and brought it to your church group if you cook for maybe Sunday school you know on you know on the weekends or whatever it is if you brought it to the office and you did a beautiful potluck for your office workers there you brought it with you to Grandma's or aunt Sally's or aunt Susie's or Uncle Bob's whoever you go to for Thanksgiving and Christmas and you can all you need is a plug so let me ask you something you know that one of the big focuses of this show is innovation yes and a lot of people go a pressure cookie because lost your minds there's been pressure cookers around for generations my grandma your grandma's pressure cooker brains and the technology in the elite Bistro is why it is our number one top-selling kitchen appliance and why we are launching our final available quantities for the holiday season here on this show because the Big Mac Daddy brains inside this machine you are amazing it's a computer system built into the front so now I don't have to worry about pounds of pressure or how long I'm cooking or how much my food weighs or whether my food is fresh or frozen right all I have to do is choose from one of the presets and we're gonna pop those up here you know soup and stew if you're doing beans and grains bro you can brown in this you can saute in it if you want to use this as your slow cooker you guys just push the slow cook button pop on the glass lid you can do desserts the chicken button is what I'm about to use but there's rice there's steam and then keep warm it's a huge feature because if I'm doing a meal and I want everybody to have a hot meal I just press that keep warm button and then three hours later somebody comes home or wife comes home guess what it's still warm this is start to finish so if you are still sort of skeptical about pressure cooking or maybe you're still using the jiggly kind or you're afraid of the jiggly guide whatever your story might be you see we popped in our chicken breast our chicken cutlets from frozen and then this is the race that comes with the seasoning so we popped in our rice and then any veggies right so you don't have to do this specific veggies I'm using maybe you have peppers that need to be used maybe have an onion that you'd like to finish off we're doing peppers peas and olives totally your call on whatever spices and seasonings and vegetables and then you always choose a liquid so right now we're just doing water but this could have been brought there my favorite can of soup or a red sauce Oh white wine whatever it is you want to use you just pour it on the inside of this machine and then what's so fantastic about elite Bistro is that you can't mess it up right so you see it says open and then you just slide it to close and then it actually beats and says I'm ready I've never seen another pressure cooker do you know I have to say for our customer for so many of you out there this is the perfect size oh yeah it is not built to serve 20 it is versatile it could serve 2 it can serve 4 it's that perfect size at that perfect price and look at our special flex promotion for you tonight for you to be able to make home cooked meals when you forgot to do it first thing in the morning to connect you to healthier choices today you get to do it all for $12 that's all you spent you have extended holiday returns you have the ability to try it out at home and see if it is the best countertop appliance you've ever owned you can get our cookbook for the lowest price we've ever offered it guys this truly is a holiday blowout because we are so proud of our partnership with the lead they are number one top-selling kitchen appliance we have here at HSN now if you want plum because this one will stay out of the countertop and will replace your oven night to nine nights out of 10 I have now only about 300 remaining in that plum color and that's it for the rest of the year whether you're a gift shopping or you are making it easier to cook and serve your family when you read the reviews time after time one after the next says where has my kitchen been yes without a pressure cooker once you start who you are a member of the cult for life and look at the rice is perfectly seasoned the vegetables aren't mushy you can see my chicken below is actually moist it's juicy it's tender it's not overcooked it contains all the nutrition because under pressure nothing is able to escape so it's actually a healthier way to cook I mean it really is one of my very favorite ways to cook my pressure cooker is has a prime real estate on on the countertop you know I use it probably I would say everyday conservatively there might be a day or here there that I don't but to do my quinoa to do my rice to do my steel cut oats to do my chicken breast to do my ribs to do your pork or even to do some frozen shrimp just to cook your vegetables you can do that as well to go from frozen to cooked if you forgot to take the chicken breasts out of the freezer if you forgot to take the shrimp out of the freezer if you're gonna choose something frozen but you want it to taste moist and fresh and delicious you know it's like a Jay Johnson was saying to us there are 30 days between each holiday there's a lot of prep there's a lot of chaos there's a lot of shopping there's a lot of a lot of a lot going on in your life if we can give you home cooked grandma worthy meals yeah on the nights that you forgot on the nights that you're running late the nights that there's oops surprised three extra people coming over for dinner we want to connect you to the products that can do that and that's what this is now we sold hundreds of thousands the pressure cookers here at HSN is our number one top seller Elite makes better than everybody else in the industry everybody else in the market we have over 350 sold and we are on our final supplies for the rest of the year we got a very limited shipment this year of Elite pressure cookers and to be able to get the four quart model for $12 for a better than your own oven oven for $12 with extended holiday returns take it home see what it's all about see why we sold literally tens of thousands of them at this table and it's so easy to use that all you have to do is press a button you know a lot of people are still afraid of that jiggly one that grandma used to use this isn't like that now grandma braved the weird you know nests of that pressure cooker because the food the results that came out of it were so decadent they were so juicy they were so moist but now we give it to you where there's no jiggling around even our gasket is like designed for the next future generations it pops out other pressure cookers are you're gonna pay a hundred hundred and fifty dollars for the gasket is soldered or affixed to the lid so that it makes for hard cleaning ours pops out for easy cleaning pops back in when you want to use it we offer this little great cup at the back which collects all the condensation so all you have to do at the end of this meal is take your pot your four quart pot by the way coming included it is very high nonstick and throw it in your dishwasher so at the end of your meal if you've done vegetables in a protein you literally have one pot to clean and I would just like to say with now close to 400 sold they will all go early on in the season yeah maybe it's a gift for somebody that's in a studio apartment or just getting started with their life somebody in a rental who's complained that the oven in that rental is lousy is unpredictable the temperatures don't match what it says they're not gonna replace that at a rental sure this is an easy way a young family I can't tell you how many times I'm juggling kids and dinner as an Oh moment yeah you know that's - yeah the end up going out and you end up spending 30 40 dollars on one lousy meal yeah Wow dollars frozen to perfect for the whole family and by the way if you're going yeah but I don't know what to cook in it the lowest price we have ever ever ever done on the pressure cooker cookbook today it's on sale today your savings on your pressure cooker buys you the cookbook yeah that's normally full price we don't ever put this on sale today $17.95 it's evens on flexpay today so you could make this a wonderful gift collection for somebody at the holiday season we've got reduced shipping we've got our best price price on our 4 quart model and truly our final quantities for the year and just the foundation of great holiday cooking all season long it really is an honest-to-goodness you even cooking a gourmet then I use the quotations under gourmet because it will taste gourmet it doesn't have to be hard my friend it can be something as simple as getting the peel-and-eat shrimp from your seafood counter and putting your favorite jar of beer this is cooked with beer but it could be white wine or it could be water broth your favorite jar of soup whatever it is you take your peel-and-eat shrimp you pop it on the inside now this pot is actually the stainless pot which is also available in hsn.com if you would like to add on an extra pot I might add that I love using that stainless pot for seafood you can do that but look on the inside here that amount of peel-and-eat shrimp at a restaurant at a seafood restaurant would cost you the price of this pressure cooker I'm not talking a flexpay I'm talking the price of this pressure cooker you would easily spend $60 on an appetizer for a family of four with the peel-and-eat shrimp variety I mean it's just very expensive and now you can do it for pennies on the dollar get it when it's on sale throw it in there frozen even if you wish you don't have to throw it in there fresh and guess what there's a button that says seafood or there's a button that says steamed excuse me you're gonna use that steam button it's right here and this coming included is our glass lid this is typically with every pressure cooker in the marketplace if they even offer a glass lid its twenty twenty-five dollars we're giving it to you included in your package today and here's the deal with these rusher cookers they'll be gone before the holiday season they will be and then you guys will be

ready to redo our kitchen I told my husband I'm not gonna put an oven in my kitchen anymore I don't need an oven and he's like well what about resale value I was like not my problem don't need an oven like I'm not selling my house so it doesn't matter but I'm just saying I don't need an oven which is intended to dry my food out let's just just be very clear for that for one second so people understand what they're buying today for $12 you are a cooking expert on a national network and you're telling me you don't need an oven because I use my pressure cooker almost every day I true dido ovens to me drive food out now I do have the large elite the 12 quart which does my turkey right you know I have a 12 cup pressure cooker that you know you've got your sides and my strides your great potatoes right now I believe we've got Denise is calling us from Mountain Louisiana Denise good evening thank you so much for shopping with us and calling in here and connected life I understand you're a fan of the elite brand it is wonderful I have the 8 quart which is great when I'm serving company and I had another kind of 4 quart that died after two months so I'm going back to the elite they're reliable they're quick easy to understand easy to clean and I just need a smaller footprint for every day because I cook every day good for you so I'm guessing that you're less than satisfied with the other 4 quart that you bought and I'm guessing you probably so you know listen I'm always so thrilled to talk to shoppers who say I cook every day and I wouldn't be able to do it without an appliance like this now I'm once upon a time he had a 2 quart and I like that for or if I'm just cooking for myself right it is currently sold out I am hoping to get some of those back in I cannot promise that they'll be back before the holiday season you've got really the most versatile middle-of-the-road take care of you and those that you love model we're so glad that you're shopping with us tonight Denise thank you for your call and thank you for your order we're so glad we can replace the other brands a wonderful evening stay connected with us so now is your moment to do it with over 625 now ordered we're talking final quantity in that plum color getting down to about a thousand in the red this is a wonderful opportunity to replace your oven to lower your energy bills to cook faster to cook easier to get it set and ready and go decorate or do it absolutely else you want to do do whatever if you're me you pop in your pressure cooker you put your liquid in your protein your veg and then you go and use your bar craft wine over and you have a glass of wine that's what you do if you're me now whatever you want to do with that extra time this is a pineapple upside-down cake and we've baked it inside here now this is a nonstick pot so you don't have to worry about it sticking and you could even do like brownies or lava cake it's a great way to bake because it's very moist on the inside there so you don't have to worry about anything drying out I'm gonna take a little slice just with my fork just to show you that the inside of this cake is almost as if you'd steamed it it's so moist and tender that no cake that you do in a pressure cooker will dry out and the reason is obviously all the moisture gets trapped on the inside so it infuses back into the cake itself it doesn't dry out it doesn't get crusty and you can't hardly burn it or overdo it because the machine knows when it's done it has all that computer built in and you press a button and it really just is your sous chef it does all the work for you and I just want to in our last moment it's $12 a month think about that's great loss to fast food yeah think about $10 at the gas station for a nice team I mean you think about that last minute oh I forgot to defrost you could have a gorgeous wonderful full course dinner made right here without doing having to do any of the lifting yourself shop for it and take advantage we do have that great cookbook which seems to have been taken away from me and so popular it is on special sale which is something that we've really never done in the past before so

food and line cookware collection here at HSN and what we decided for the launch and for all of our you connected life shoppers was to give you first access to not only the full food and wine line but to the most sought after talked about advanced in the industry cooking technique and that's sous-vide cooking now justin chapel is joining us he's the culinary director of food and wine he's the newest member of the HSN kitchen family here he has these crazy online videos called mad genius tips that will teach you how to turn anything into anything in your kitchen and I know you didn't invent the sous vide but this certainly is worthy of some crazy mad genius tip oh definitely and you know I definitely did not invent this sous-vide it's actually a technique that's been used by chefs and restaurants for decades right and there's a reason for that because it's foolproof right and it you know X and you can execute perfectly cooked food every single time so tell me a little bit about exactly how it works and what you do because it seems complicated and advanced it's not now this is the only one we offer that's under a hundred dollars that does wine cooling as well it is the gift of choice for foodies out there it is the way to make five-star gourmet meals and it's so goof proof and the results are absolutely unlike anything else you've ever definitely and I love the term goof proof I'm gonna have to steal that next time I'm gonna show you a little bit about this and you know first of all we talked about sous vide and what is it and you know if you just say sous vide it sounds kind of fancy right it's a little fancy but it's actually not it's actually quite simple and the idea is simply nowadays we talk about cooking food in baggies in a bath water in a water bath you know that's heated and so that's what I'm doing here I'm gonna go ahead and add some beef tenderloin right into a little baggie here and seal it up and what I'm gonna do is actually lower it into the water before I seal it completely because you want to press out as much air as possible here and once you do that you can secure it to the side of your pot which we're using the food and wine 12 quart stock here or you can you know one of my little hacks is I like to secure it with just one of these handy-dandy little songs there yeah but this is the really cool part so when we talk about sous-vide we talked about perfect cooking perfect cooking every time easy cooking weeknight cooking and that's exactly what we're doing with this steak here it's gonna cook our steak to a perfect medium-rare okay or a perfect medium if that's what you prefer so I'm gonna go ahead and take it out of my bag here just get a pen hot here because you can actually take it right out of the soup you don't eat it just like this so if you slice this really thinly it would actually make an ideal french dip put a little shoe on the side but we're gonna go ahead and brown it off because that's what I like there's a little butter in here a little oil and we're gonna go ahead and add it right into our pan and while that's cooking and it's just gonna take a minute or two to get nice and brown I'm gonna go ahead and show you exactly how this gives you the perfect temperature and if you look here we have this three temperature test okay right so we have medium rare we have medium and we have our medium Wow okay now I don't prefer the medium well but some do and so we'd like to you know make that an offering so you know all you do is set your device so if I can go ahead and show you how you do that here I'm gonna turn this over here I mean look at just in 30 seconds ya already been perfected and you do that using this device here so this is the cooker and you could see it's a very simple digital display so you just press your temperature pick your selected temperature I'm doing 130 because I like medium rare and then you hit go oh I'm sorry you hit time you can select how long you'd like it to go a steak like this would normally take about an hour only that's it but it can hang out in there for up to four or eight or ten hours and it's never going to overcook well never not once and then you just hit go and it's not just about like your premium fancy steak dinner fish no chicken it's vegetables its side dishes it is the most talked about sought-after form of cooking in the industry right now if you're going well it seems complicated Tyson Suvi to any website and you'll get a thousand different ideas and tips but we're giving you the best sous-vide cooker you've ever seen at the lowest price you'll find there is no sous-vide cooker with additional display and the ability to chill wine with the same model that's under $100 if you're gifting top-quality premium kitchen appliances there's no better buy of the year than a sous vide and to be able to get the food and wine stamp of approval you know what you're buying is top of the line best of the best in industry and right now it's available to you for $25 on a credit card we have a limited supply we have a brand new launch here at HSN food and wine has got their first ever today's special coming up a Friday at midnight but you're getting early access and we really fir connected life we wanted to give you the latest innovation the most exciting technology and one of the most sought-after forms of cooking for centuries and it comes to professionals now Brett would you like to try this okay I guess I suppose I'm going to give you a little piece here because I've cut open the stick and you can see here look how perfectly medium-rare that was I die medium-rare guys so that's good for there you go then we're gonna be best friends and that was 30 seconds in each side in a pan you get that delicious beautiful char flavor on the outside but you get the perfectly cooked from edge to edge beef tenderloin no my dessert before I got here and that was but uh I mean that was dessert it was absolutely perfect and so even throughout I mean it really is it's perfect cooking when you use this technique that's been swarmed by professionals forever yes and you know perfect cooking is key but perfect cooking every time is a better thing right you're gonna cook your food perfectly every time and it's simple so we did some beef we did some beef tenderloin we're gonna do a little salmon because you can also poach salmon and forget about the mess of poaching it in a liquid forget about the fact that you're gonna poach it in water and then your Salmons gonna actually taste like water right because here we're gonna poach the salmon with a little lemon maybe sometime if you'd like and it's gonna cook in all of the lemon juice in all of its own juices and it's going to keep all of the flavor you know what's exciting is that you just the fact that all the flavors get infused just by being in the bag with them I mean I saw you put an entire clove of garlic in you didn't chop it you didn't saute nor mince it it just went in and the sous-vide concept infuses that flavor into the meat exactly and that and it's not only me because we're gonna also do vegetables but first I want to take out this salmon here check this out put it right onto your plate and I mean is that not a perfectly cooked healthy meal okay so now is your chance to shop for it take advantage it is the first food and wine product that's being offered here at HSN it's on a special holiday sale price so that is giftable so that you can experiment with it during the holiday season and take it home and enjoy extended holiday returns this is early access get a sous vide home and see why the entire industry is abuzz about it you can use any major just simple stockpot that you've got its water this digital brain and your basic bag and food concept you've all read about it you've all seen it and now get the best in industry at the lowest price you'll find anywhere you know the next sous-vide cooker I could find it one hundred and eighty dollars one hundred and eighty dollars that is almost double ravely reviewed is not a wine chiller did not have the ease-of-use and function that food and wine is brought to you right and you know best of all in the food wine Test Kitchen which I've been in for nearly a decade we've tested hundreds of pieces of equipment and we've discovered what is best we discovered what works what does it and we've put it into this product and we're very proud of it okay so what do you got going on so we are poaching eggs directly in the shell we are poaching whole eggs in the shell and I'm going to show you one of my mad genius tips here so I since I've already got some eggs going in here you can lower them in easily with a slotted spoon but I like to stick them right into a whisk just like this a balloon whisk you can put as many as you can fit in there and you can literally drop it right into the water just like that and in one hour you get perfect poached eggs in the shell and these can hang out in here while you're preparing brunch so you have 10 people over you do 10 eggs at once what other device can poach 10 eggs at once and the fact that it's not a difficult Oh chimpanzee that it's not a terrible difficult mess and it's the whole egg at least the perfect it is sir it is a whole egg and it's the perfect way to serve and watch this you're getting this is gonna blow your mind here so I'm gonna put it on this spoon here just so it's easier to transfer to my eggs benedict that we're gonna serve up you just crack your egg just like you're about to break it into a bowl OOP and check this out with a little jiggle and this of course is just the loose whites that would otherwise escape in a typical poaching process put it right on top of your eggs benedict put a little hollandaise sauce if you will and you have perfectly poached eggs now that looks good I mean poaching is complicated it's difficult it's messy not anymore not anymore not anymore not anymore this is a true treat tonight we are so thrilled and excited about the launch of food and wine here at HSN and now is your opportunity to try it home to upgrade and elevate your kitchen your cooking your presentation not to mention making it so easy and hassle-free shop for your sous vide with food and wine it's the only that's available at under $100 and is a wine chiller as well and that's your biggest frustration that's your biggest frustrations off because it's coke so perfectly all right so vegetables should we talk vegetables let's do it okay so we are doing carrots okay but we're doing carrots for the whole family so I like spicy carrots I like a lot of black peppers I'm going to add that to mine okay but what would you like with your pepper I mean with your care well I'm a little bit of a spicy wimp so I'd say ease off the pepper ease off the spice but maybe some butter right and I heard that you're a fairly new dad yes okay so this is perfect because you can make your you can do your carrots here right right and you could do your kids carrots here okay so you can season them differently put them in a little like this that's genius at the same time just like that look at that put them in there and what's amazing about that is let's say little Suzy is a ballet practice and little Johnny comes home from football practice one hour later it's Jack and Lily just to be Jack and Lily someone out there has a little Liz and a little Johnny but they might come home at different times or perhaps your husband's stuck at work late and you want to bring out the carrots you know an hour later you can totally do that or you can do what I have here which is have a family-size portion of carrots cooked all at the same time and all I'm gonna do is transfer them to a little serving plate here and you have perfectly cooked carrots steamed to perfection all you need is a little chive and you have this beautiful side dish to go along sighs your roast chicken and there's Melrose there perfectly cooked so as somebody that really sees everything right right you're you're in the Test Kitchen there's a culinary director you're making all these videos about crazy new ways to think about using your appliances have you ever had your hands on something that was so versatile and so easy for even the most novice of chefs to really create professional results right well I've had my hands on similar products yeah but that's why we developed this one because we wanted to put what we knew was gonna work best into one product and go with that and that's why we're so happy that we're launching this today with HSN because we know the HSN customer and the fans of HSN are going to this is gonna rock their world I mean this is gonna change the way you cook forever I mean if you do one thing take this away today this is the cooking of the future except it's not the future it's now because you can buy it today and you know what I like to tell people is this is actually the new modern vettern better slow cooker I mean it's just different and the results are truly extraordinary and today you can take it home and try it out for less than a dollar a day on your credit card and if you're going it's like it but I'm afraid it might be too complicated for me oh there's bags and they're screwed listen it's less than a dollar a day on your credit card and you have extended holiday returns you can try it your spouse can try it your son and daughter when they come to visit they can try it you can make it a fun little cooking adventure extravaganza in your kitchen during this holiday season but you are first shoppers in you are being connected to our first ever food and wine kitchen gadget here at HSN you set the temp you set the time you're done you're good to go and it's perfect cooking every single time that's why it is sought-after by industry professionals that's why food and wine have created their own and because they're not just food food and wine we're also wine so let's get to that because this is actually this converts into it turns into a wine chiller and that I know that sounds a little crazy and I was skeptical myself but here's what we did we took we went into the food wine Test Kitchen and we did a side-by-side test we had a bucket of ice in this case a stockpot of ice and we had another stock pot full of ice that had the sous-vide cooker with it and you if you look here there's a little button right on top and it says chill all you do is hit chill go and what that does is it starts to circulate the water that's in the stockpot it's it's hard to tell because we actually have quite a bit in here so that we can chill multiple bottles of wine but the water is circulating and believe it or not in our tests in the Food & Wine Test Kitchen the bottle of wine side by side it chilled in almost a third of the time oh wow so I was able to chill a whole entire bottle of wine just like this I'm gonna go ahead and add it right in there in about ten minutes seven to ten minutes whereas the bottle of wine that was just in the regular iced water which we had over there it took twice as long in one case it took three times as long to show so here we go as you can see it's really cold and then it's perfect it's perfectly sir I mean this brand this new experience for us is about making your home your kitchen your experience worthy of a five-star restaurant you shouldn't have to go out to experience it you can make it happen in your own home with the incredible food and wine products
