 and we've done it once again finding a home security system for less than one hundred eighty dollars now it's early I know it's early you probably flicked on a lot or two throughout the house now the traditional light globe right here last they say around a thousand our something like that well if I could give you a globe that will now last you over 22 years surely that would make sense but it goes further than that now GE put together what they call a life bulb we're doing a pack of three of these not only get ready for this not only will this last over 22 years but you can control it with your smart device bluetooth you can dim the lights change the lights you're getting a pack of three of these for under look at the price thirty nine dollars and ninety-five cents it is a launch again this is all about smart homes as we go into the 2017 we're setting you up now I know when it comes to LEDs they've certainly been around for a little while we know the cost effectiveness of them now you can control them with your smart device so with a smartphone a tablet how about that walking to your home and the lights turn on as you walk in that home now a man who loves to have his lights turn on when he walks in his house mr. Joe Harrison happy new year mate happy new year it's good to be back I love to having new products and it's a little dark here so I need a little light I have my phone got my lab here I tap every single light and they all instantly come on I don't have to be close to it I don't have to reach for it anymore it gives you that convenience to be able to be connected to your lights but you can also customize it for you and I love with Jeff mentioned is like every single time I come home to my house before I had my GE lights the house is always pitch black you're always trying fumbling and looking for where everything is now when I pull into my driveway I tap one button it's my get home button and now instantly every single light comes on and then I can tap it and turn off every single light individually to it really gives you amazing control to be able to make those adjustments while you're there on the fly plus it also you can multiple settings on your app so i love the way geez making this simple for you you have manual control over all your different lights but then you also have these pre adjusted settings so whether it's the wake up whether it's the bedtime whether it is to get home or you movie time you're customizing these scenes for your situation so you tap the button and it controls all the lights even down below it allows you to make the instant adjustments where if you want to turn that light off I tap that button the light goes off I can even adjust the dimness to it because these LED lights they're not just a light bulb but it's a dimmable light so I can make a brighter I can make a darker all by just making that quick little slider adjustment that's right there but the thing about the LED technology is this isn't something you're going to be using for the next year because like Jeff mentioned the government stopped making these said everyone has to stop making these in 2014 so companies started stockpiling millions of these light bulbs the reason why they said we have to get rid of these because this only lasts about a thousand hours but then you may have seen these little curlicue guys well these last about three thousand hours shooting three times the link well that was pretty good but this takes about three minutes to turn on so then they came out with these LED light bulbs this isn't going to last you this last 2,000 hours this will last you 25,000 hours so not only are we giving you a light bulb as you have to change excuse me get all choked up I can't believe this is this is a light bulb that you're not gonna have to change until let me do the quick math until 2042 that's the next time we got to change your GE light bulb so not only be making it connected we're giving you technology that's going to be there for decades to come that's correct i think about if you have a brand new baby instead of changing changing this once a year now the baby is born now the baby goes to elementary school middle school high school to college and that's when you get to change that lightbulb again that's the convenience about having a GE lightbulb they've been around for decades and now we're bringing that technology to make sure going to have it for decades the second of January 2017 you're going to be getting these yo it basically thin 7 to 10 working days you have them installed let's say by the 15th of January you're not gonna have to replace them until 2042 but the most amazing thing with this is not only the fact that it's going to last so well incredibly cost-effective to buy the line they say it's going to cost over a written down here a dollar 32 a year that's running on 33 hours a day depending on the price of your pain but a dollar 32 a year to run this light bulb but now you can control it with your smart device it doesn't matter you Android with your Apple whether it's a tablet whether it's a smartphone you can control is and up to 50 globes right up to 50 became we can be controlled by the app yep so and the average household has 40 elephant lights in it so the thing is this is a light bulb that looks like a light bulb because there are a lot of LED light bulbs that are out there we are not correct quite sure what it looks like more or less like a science project I don't want this sticking out of my lamp shade or hanging from my ceiling fan GE create a light bulb an LED light bulb that looks like a traditional light bulb so when you have this in your house this is not only going to look like a light bulb like Jeff mentioned this uses up to eighty-five percent less energy than a traditional incandescent so why is that going to be a big deal because right now you're paying a little under our run a little under $13 to get everyone these light bulbs home but the thing is this light bulb right now if you have 40 lights in your house using the traditional incandescent your average light bill is probably around five hundred dollars a year when you switch over to GE because it uses eighty-five percent less energy that five hundred dollar a year bill went down to a hundred dollars so it's going to be saving you years and years and years every single year you're saving money because it doesn't use that type of energy anymore but now the fact that we're making it a connected this is the first light bulb I've ever offered here at HSN that has that convenience so I've got my lamp that's right in front of me and this works on every lamp it's a 60 watt equivalent so whether it's a lamp or taller lamp that we have on the side or a ceiling fan this is going to work for all your lamps that you have but the thing is now I could be connected to my light so if I want to be able to turn it off I can turn it off if I want to turn this one on turn that one off I make all the adjustments that are right there on the fly and if I want to even adjust the brightness to it this is even dimmable which is extremely rare for LED light bulbs immobile mate but look how sensitive it is it's super such as you're touching the screen on your smartphone it's instantaneous and exchanging if you want to set a little bit like that then going turn it on moonlight and then you can come down and just turn it down maybe watching a movie you would customizer for you maybe you're just relaxing a long day you don't want that bright light you can bring it down into your perfect adjustment that's the thing about geez we've made it so simple and when you look at all three lights like let me go and turn them all off if I wake up when I first come home I hit my get home button boom all three lights come look at that I never come home think of it security with that I mean we just talked about that amazing Samsung camera that's coming up in just a few minutes but this is security as well you know what else it's your home welcoming you home as you walk in the door to turn these lights on to know that when you get what get about within 50 feet range please work on bluetooth so within fifty feet rains these will turn on now you go from room full room light now this an equivalent this here is the equivalent of a 60-watt bulb but it's running on like 11 watts that's the difference that's why you get such longevity out of it that's why you get such cost-effectiveness but then on top of that the technology the technology you've got a smartphone no smartphone I saw earlier there was a statistic that say there's more smartphones than our population within the u.s. so there's I daresay you've got a smartphone if it's got bluetooth you can control this you're
