 [Applause] [Music] hi this is Randall wrestling I'm the vice president of applications engineering at digi-key digi-key strives to bring you the newest suppliers and the latest technology devices we can find we're constantly on the lookout for slick new technology so every week on 10 featuring two devices and this week I have one from a company that really surprised me in how much they've changed when I started in my career 35 years ago this company was known for military connectors large mechanical connectors it turns out this is a dust sensor that I'm holding in my hand and it's made by Anthony this sensor happens to have a little thermoelectric heater that causes convective flow of current through here and it has two outputs each of those are pulse width modulated so you can read how much of these two things are in there one thing are dust particles in the neighborhood of one micron that be the size of particles that come off of a cigarette smoke the other one is 20 microns which is good for detecting things like house dust so with this little sensor you're able to sense atmospheric dust conditions so that's pretty slick I think now the other sensor I have is very neat as well this sensor is from speck sensors traditionally to sense gases you end up having a reaction with an electrolyte so that makes them large and mechanical and costly it turns out this is done in a more solid-state fashion and so using a catalytic reaction of gases with the material what this device does is read out various kinds of gases there's a different model number depending on what gas you want to sense this would happen to be a carbon monoxide sensor because it's got a metal catalytic element in there after time that catalytic element will become exhausted but so this thing will have a lifespan of 10 years so again these are products that are new to market I didn't fully appreciate the VC were available if you've got the need to send a dust or since gases I recommend you check these parts out thank you for listening [Applause]
