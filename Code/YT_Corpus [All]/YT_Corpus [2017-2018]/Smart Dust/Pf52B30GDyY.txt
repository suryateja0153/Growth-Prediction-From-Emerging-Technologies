 It's nearly mid-March, and that usually means high levels of fine dust in the air. The Ministry of Public Safety and Security has asked residents to take several safety precautions on days with lots of dust... to prevent respiratory and cardiovascular problems. When dust is in the forecast, it recommends wearing a mask when going outdoors, and for children and the elderly, avoiding outdoor activities. And when a dust advisory is issued,... it advises closing the windows and staying indoors. The day after, it suggests opening the windows to clear the air indoors and washing any items that may have been exposed to the dust. The full list of recommended measures is available on the websites of the public safety ministry and the Korea Meteorological Administration.
