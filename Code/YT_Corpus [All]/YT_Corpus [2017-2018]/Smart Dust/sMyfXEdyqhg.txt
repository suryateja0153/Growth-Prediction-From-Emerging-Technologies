 Dustwalls protect the surrounding areas during this extensive kitchen remodel. While the floor will be refinished later, the living areas needed to remain livable! This solid, pressure-fitted dustwall complete with a solid door protects better than any flimsy imitation. Our work stays out-of-sight and out-of-mind, reducing anxiety and preserving daily routines as much as possible. You're watching Tim, Jon and Ryan carefully remove it in preparation for the big reveal of this exciting kitchen project in the Burns Park neighborhood of Ann Arbor.
