 well we have heard this right pull aside stay alive the Arizona Department of Transportation has long used this slogan to help drivers stuck in dust storms but now they are taking a more proactive approach a DA will install new dust storm sensors and speed limit signs between Eloy and Picacho Peak when it detects a storm the speed limit will automatically start dropping every thousand feet until drivers are going as slow as about 35 miles per hour Hayden says there were 85 crashes near Picacho Peak during dust storms between 2010 and 2015 and we know that area does get pretty rough monsoon making a comeback chief meteorologist Andrew questions and is tracking it for us it certainly is trying to make a comeback and if you ask the folks in Nogales they'd say yeah most definitely not only did a storm turn severe in that area today but we've had enough rain in Nogales to cause the Nogales wash to flow at about seven and a half feet deep at one point today it has now receded back to about five feet deep but still a flash flood warning for the Nogales area does continue through 5:15 through seven o'clock a flood advisory that's the green box that you see there also impacting Nogales so that storm system dumped a lot of water all at once so did the storm system crossing over state route 92 between Bisbee and palominos Bisbee and NACO under a flood advisory until 6 o clock there so we are seeing our storms kind of trickling back into southern Arizona they'll move into the Tucson area come this weekend think of it as a tropical weekend and I'm not talking bikinis and mai-tais we are tracking hurricane Franklin coming up thanks Erin a developing situation right now to some police are looking for a woman they say is vulnerable and without her medications 42 year old Carol Hale last seen near West Glen and North Oracle Road this morning authorities tell us she functions at a 14 year old level and we'll probably know her name but she will not know her address if you see her please call 911 Trump has yet to call the opioid crisis a national emergency coming up White House plans to fight the epidemic plus a new clinic will provide some of the same services as Anne emergency room but at a fraction of the cost details about this facility here in town right after the break you're watching take a 9 on your side [Music]
