 everybody involved means to another geek moment I'm Lindsay and I'm here to talk about it and alls advanced sensors air quality board so this will measure dust but you can also do things such as measures cigarettes milk or even humidity that's ambien in the air so inside this kit we have everything you need to get started so we have a USB cable we have an Arduino that's already loaded with code as well as a shield and a screen we have the air quality sensor and then we even have a QuickStart guide and this QuickStart guide is also listed on our page for this item so to get started what you can do is you're going to take your sensor and you're going to actually put a little piece of tape over this cleaning window in production this will normally have a gasket put this on like so okay and then we're going to take the header and we're going to plug it into this receptacle on the shield and then the next thing to do is just provide power and as this is loading what it does is it analyzes the air and it takes readings every 5 to 10 seconds but the display is actually an average of 2 minutes so you're going to see the air quality be green if there's nothing present but if the air quality is worth it'll change actually to yellow or red depending on what's there so as an example I'm going to just do this just to get some dust present in the air that's it and here it shows yellow and this will reset after another 2 minutes if the air quality improves if you'd like the prototype with just the sensor itself we found the J's T makes the housing that fits quite well into here and we also offer the pre crimped wire leads so you have to do is just plug it in and you're good to go for application nails for more information please visit our website at digikey.com where you can also pick up the sensor and the dev stored and more information thanks so much for watching you
