 Amphenol Advanced Sensors Air Quality Evaluation Kits accelerate the evaluation and development of measurement systems that can objectively measure air quality for home, office, and industrial applications. The kits use an Arduino compatible board and include sensors for temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, and dust. The board includes an OLED display for measurement readings as well as a USB port that can stream sensor data to a PC for logging and analysis and also support data output via an add-on Bluetooth module. The kits are preloaded with software and source code is available to simplify development of the final solution.
