 We start with carbon nanotube forests. The idea is to get the nanotube forests from the initial size of 1 centimeter over 1 centimeter into something about this big. So we're compressing them into two different, in two stages. And the first one is simply pushing the nanotubes together in one direction, and by the time one axis becomes small enough, we're pushing from the perpendicular direction to get eventually a cube. And this is going to stop pressing in this direction. We're starting the second one. You can see that slowly but surely the second densifier pushes that nanotube and compressing them smaller and smaller.
