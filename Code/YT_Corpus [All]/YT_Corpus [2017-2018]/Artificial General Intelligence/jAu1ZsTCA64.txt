 they asked this question and they had this like knowing smile he said do you think you're gonna win I assumed that it had to be good otherwise they wouldn't seem so confident I was pretty nervous but I mean I was excited just because of the implication right on Monday the boat was beatable by some players by Wednesday we played the best player in the world be one with him ten zero twelve to zero maybe they told me it wasn't a big deal because it played thousands of games against itself so I shouldn't feel too bad that was embarrassed this thing accomplished in like six months but I've like set out to do for eight years [Music] when I first played against the AI BOTS they didn't really tell me anything going into it they said you're gonna play a 1v1 I was pretty nervous but I mean I was excited just because of the implication right if there's a bot that can play at a super high level then it's just great I mean it just pushes dota to a new level in general eight very high level players played it at all Eden was Scouts stomped a game too people were upset they didn't want to give it the credit that it deserves anything that can be programmed in six months to beat a top players one after another I think was we wasn't sure exactly whether we'll be able to beat Vandy on Paige does it feel like a player passive so it in time we'd like to find agents that are able to adapt and learn in very new environments and accomplish increasingly more complicated tasks and it turns out that games are really great for this dota2 is one of the most difficult games in the world that are available right now there's just so much about it so much you have to learn so much you have to grind it takes I'd say a year to just learn the basics understanding what all the heroes and spells do it probably takes about I'd say a minimum of 12,000 ish hours to be a pro even one-to-one version of dota 2 is super complicated the game is real-time which means that in every second or 30 decisions to be made if we could we would probably hard code all the strategies but turns out that is not feasible we use a concept called self life so what we do is we start by having a artificial on your network we've initially random parameters and we let it play the game the only influence that we have on it is we say last hitting of creeps is good dying is bad getting damage is bad what happens is that it will walk randomly trying out lots of things we can run the game should be much faster than real time and we can run many copies of them in parallel each of the change of the agents makes it slightly more efficient slightly better after about two weeks they reach a level of professional gamers and then they become much better than any human players it did things that we had never seen anybody else do and it had set like a type of play style that we pretty much just copy now when I see the pop make a play it all it clicks in my head I'm like why aren't we doing that it's actually really fascinating to see the strategies that they learn over time for example we noticed that the Bob behaves in a extremely silly way like in the first minute it started taking a lot of damage and we didn't know why it's happening it doesn't make it doesn't make a lot of sense the bot was using a baiting strategy if you see that your enemy is some low health you go very over aggressive and you think that you're gonna win and then the box was defeating its opponents within the next minute or so when we let it reign for a few more hours it learn to counter that strategy in particular and at that point that no one was really able to beat the bots consistently the matter of what happened like sometimes I would I'll play it it didn't change anything it just kept playing the same way you cannot kill the boss in the way that's what human it calculates what is the most optimal for the human player to do in the next couple of seconds so it's not gonna be distracted by random movements of human players or faking attacks this type of strategies do not work well against the board I think it's gonna be interesting to see how this is going forward in the future we've got many requests from professional players on getting access to the bots it's possible that in order to be the best in the game maybe you need to use similar BOTS for a cure regular practice because it does certain things perfectly and you have to play perfectly to match those things in that regard you could train yourself over and over again to just get these like pitch perfect games at a more consistent level so in terms of high level play it should make things a lot more mechanically skilled players do not want to reveal their strategies to the opponent so when they want to test out more crazy ideas they don't have too many people to play against once we have very good 5v5 bots you could imagine trying out hundreds variations of different scenarios and trying to improve your longer term strategies I don't think that it's ever possible for a group of five us ever beat a group of five human players that are any good just because I don't think that there's enough processing power of the world for it to handle that the interactions between a hundred and sixteen or something heroes that go in so many different ways that work together different spots like there's just too many variables that I don't think it that it could completely gather in knighted people thought that it's impossible to write but that can play chess and like we see the similar team going forward over the last 10 or 20 years and we are able to solve increasingly more complicated environments and tasks I think it's definitely possible it's not gonna be easy but if our research is successful we'll be more efficient and we'll be able to tackle more complicated problems in the future and solve more complicated games it's always impossible to tell which of the advances turn out to be useful we'll definitely going to see a lot more applications of this method in the future but it's too early to tell now you
