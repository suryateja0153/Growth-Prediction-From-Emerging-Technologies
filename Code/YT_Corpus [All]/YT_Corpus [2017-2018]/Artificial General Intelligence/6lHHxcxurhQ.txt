 [Music] so look I don't want to have one of these talks where I just drone on for you know some very long period of time and none there's a question period afterwards so please feel free to ask questions you know during the during the talk however if the question seems to me to be one that's going to involve a long detailed kind of thing I will suggest putting it off to the end so I normally talk for an hour but I guess an hour is really more or less the time of the whole thing here so I have to cut stuff out maybe it will be easier to do as I move along okay so let me start with the so-called hard problem of consciousness and that is the problem of why the brain basis of a given experience is the brain basis of that experience as opposed to another experience or none here's an example so this is a brain the all the arrows are pointing to the back of the brain where the early visual cortex is so there's this area MT and maybe if some surrounding areas like MST that are known to be the basis of our experience of a certain kind of motion of optic flow if you knock that out people have what's called a kin at top Co where they don't see motion and then methane gets activated whenever people see people do see motion even if it's after images of motion like the waterfall illusion okay so we know that is at least a large part of our of the neural basis of our experience of motion but why is it the neural basis of that experience of motion rather than say the experience of a face or something else entirely okay so nobody it's not just that nobody has a clue how to answer that is nobody didn't come up with a hypothetical answer to it that is it at all it's at all satisfactory why it's the hard problem and that's distinguished from the easy problems these are my terms produced by my colleague David Chalmers the easy problems are problems about the function of conscious experience how it interacts with sensory inputs with other mental states like beliefs or thoughts and how it affects behavioral outputs so those are the so-called easy problems now a common distinction made is between phenomenal consciousness that's what the hard problem is about what it's like just smell arose see the sky feel a pain and access consciousness which is perhaps can be defined as global availability of the information in an experience so access consciousness is the domain of the easy problems phenomenal consciousness is the domain of the hard problem now there is it is commonly felt and I I think that has problem that that's the feeling I'm talking about it is probably present in this room among people who have a kind of engineering way of looking at things that there really isn't any serious difference between phenomenal consciousness and access conscious may be no difference at all maybe all phenomenal consciousness could ever come to is access consciousness or another thought that is related to that is maybe maybe there's a difference in some conceptual way but it's not from that we could ever find out about because all you know about anything is how it functions how it effects other things and we've already said that's the domain of access consciousness so how could we ever find out about this stuff I used to teach I taught it at my team for 25 years and I found that that point of view was was very common among my among my students me to do it from here second okay so um what up I'm going to argue well I'm not really going to argue this but I will be saying that phenomenal consciousness seems to be better approach through biological approaches rather than computer approaches computational approaches are better fitted to access consciousness I'm not going to argue about that explicitly what I am going to talk about is how we know these things are different and I'll give you some actual evidence that they are different and say a little bit about how they're different so the issue I'm going to be talking about is our conscious perception and cognitive access to perception that is access consciousness fundamentally different talks going to have three parts I'll talk about a controversy about sparse versus rich perception about concepts and then I'll end with these methodological breakthroughs that I think have something to say about how to approach the issue experimentally and I should say by the way that the experimental approach to this subject really is only about 20 years old before that you know consciousness research was not a serious thing it was regarded as a a tenure killer among scientists that is if you study it forget tenure ok so sparse versus rich first so there is a debate between the view that conscious perception is Sparsit that conscious perception is rich I myself think that the resolution of the debate is that it's cognition that's actually sparse that's thought reasoning problem-solving and that actual conscious perception is rich and that shows that conscious perception must be at least in part distinct from cognition what suggests that conscious perception is rich here is an experimental paradigm due to George Sperling so first you have I guess I can use this thing can you see that pointer okay so first you have an array of alphanumeric about what the difference between sparse and rich in your terminology yeah the machine learning version of it which a lot oh you're probably okay I got a different I'm sure it's different you will see that it's going to be defined in fact by some experiments I'm going to show you but the idea is that cognition for certain kinds of materials only holds about four items that is it's really what's called working memory if you want to if you're interested in how people think there is a mental scratchpad known as working memory if you want to for example go from P and if P then Q to Q you've got to store P and if P then Q in your working memory and that holds about four items now it's conference about what exactly an item is and there are many controversies about it but that's the basic idea and it's common to not only mammals but also birds lizards and there's even some evidence that this is ruff something like this is the limit even in insect so it is a ubiquitous feature of of you know information processing and animals however the number so that's sparse okay rich is what's in phenomenal consciousness so that holds many more things and that's what I'm gonna argue so it's a way of getting at the fact that they are different okay so here is the idea of the this experiment you show people a an array for a very brief time and then after the arrays gone off you ask them what they saw people can report that they saw an array of alphanumeric characters but if you ask them for specific characters they usually report three or four okay so there's the limit of three or four so this guy George Sperling goes in his PhD thesis at NYU tried to explore the idea that people felt that they saw all or almost all of those items and that's you know it's easy to be a subject in this you can do it yourself and you'll have that sense that you saw all or almost all so what he did was how many know about this I'm just curious okay no one here has ever taken an intro psych course that's my guess okay so here's what he did he in his blank period before you have to answer he used a high tone for the top row a medium tone for the middle row and a low tone for the bottom row and what he found was they could report three or four from any given row even though they could also report only three or four if not given a Q and this is called partial report superiority and the idea is that your phenomenal awareness has a capacity of three times three and a half whereas you can only report three or four okay so that is an index of richness and here's this Sperling saying that people insist that they've seen more than they can report afterwards okay so that's the kind of thing that suggests rich what aboutwhat suggests sparse so here's a undoubtedly everybody seen one of these things you have a picture a blank another picture that's different from the first one a blank and then you start over this is a paradigm developed by these guys or Reagan rent sink and Simon's and here's an example how many see what's changing okay I am going to show you what's changing and I hope you'll be surprised there it is see okay how many are surprised why are you surprised you're surprised because it's a big change sort of right you know it's not exactly in the middle but it's a kind of big change you feel like you saw the whole thing but if you did see the whole thing why didn't you see the difference I'll show you a couple more here there's another one how many see what's changing that's a little easier this time okay huh how many amazed just how many don't see what's changing okay good okay I'm going to move this pointer to it there it is there okay I'll do one more just because they're fun okay what's changing is this the ooh not doing very well here something's the matter with it I'm sorry something's wrong with that okay so here is a very pathetic one that I'm going to use this for you'll see why so this one it's very so this was originally made for a PC I'm using another Mac and I you know I'm not skilled enough to get it to go faster but something is actually changing how many see what's changing okay I'll tell you what it is it's the bar in the back see okay the reason I'm using that is because I happen to have an eye track or trace of it and this gives you a little recipe for making these things so the trace only involves one hit on the bar and that is an index of the fact that people are not by large not attending to the bar and that tells you what you can change in these pictures and this is a culture relative thing it's different cultures will attend in different genders will attend to different things but if you change something that people tend not to attend to then people will not notice the difference and that is one of many items of evidence that this is an attentional phenomenon but there are two different accounts of what kind of an intentional phenomenon is one account is this a inattentional blindness account which is you don't consciously see the features that change that's the sparse view the other view is the intentional inaccessibility sorry lack of access not inaccessibility lack of actual access you do see the features that change but you don't conceptualize them at a level that would allow you to notice the change and that difference is going to figure in this whole talk the difference between not actually seeing it on the one hand the sparse view and on the other hand the rich view you see it but you don't conceptualize it at a level here's a little diagram of the difference between the two views and I'm going to be contrasting so this is the top one is my view that you have rich conscious perception there's an attentional bottleneck and then you have sparse cognition my opponents view because they have to explain partial report superiority just as I do their view is that the bottleneck is the between unconscious perception and conscious perception conscious perception is sparse and cognition is sparse so I'm now going to show you a few pieces of anecdotal evidence for my view okay yep quickly how would you describe the difference between conscious and unconscious perception yeah an awareness to the information or the more than that remember I started with the idea of phenomenal consciousness what it's like to smell a rose you know to hear a you know a musical note in conscious perception you're having that and an unconscious perception you're not having it so it's a commonly noted thing in the literature on consciousness that no one has a definition of phenomenal consciousness it's something you can only point to by using phrases like my colleague Thomas Nagle's phrase what it's like to experience experience you know the redness of red or and of course this not surprisingly has given rise to the idea that when people set talk this way they don't know what they're talking about and that there isn't any really any difference between accessing information and having an experience of the redness of red furthermore a lot of people feel maybe there is such a thing but I don't like it so I've encountered that you know I've gone around giving talk from this for some time I've encountered a lot and I'm sure they're probably people in this room maybe half the people in this room who don't like phenomenal consciousness why would anybody pay any attention to that but I'll tell you I think that it is unwise for people and certainly in my business but also in yours to ignore such a salient feature of our mental lives because it may turn out to be really crucial two things you actually do care about so I think I think people really should keep an open mind about there being phenomenal consciousness what its role is and people should not the view that a lot of people do which is that we can approach issues for example in artificial intelligence is just ignoring this because if it turns out that a lot of our important mental processes are done via phenomenal consciousness then it may be that we if we try to make machine you know machines do significant cognitive things that we're going to have to in some way give them that or some substitute for it that does the same job or something but we better know about it before we figure out figure that we don't have to pay any attention you mean like table memory yeah I was hearing principal in my congressional in about information processing and memory okay all right yeah I was the wondering what I was measuring that that's kind of something that is okay I think you could have consciousness without memory the reason I'm talking about memory is because it's involved in a lot of experiments so I think it is possible to think about consciousness in the absence of without thinking about memory at all but you know you have to have some experimental approach to consciousness to be thinking about it in an objective way so memory turns out to be really important that I'm really contrasting two kinds of memory what is sometimes called iconic memory that has some kind of phenomenology to it and working memory which is a our cognitive workspace so but that's not because I think memory is crucial to consciousness it's because it's a it's a way of getting X a way of approaching the subject that we're we know something about how to do experiments on so here is so I'm going to so just to remind you what's about to happen I'm going to show you two phenomena that I think give a kind of anecdotal support for my view okay so here is the first one how many have seen this anybody seen this okay this is a slow change so what you are looking at on the screen is changing right now and your job is to try to figure out what is changing don't say what okay just let's just look at it okay try to figure out what's changing don't say what's changing if you know is this a question about this oh no don't say that how many saw what was changing okay I'm now going to show you and I think most of you will be surprised okay I'm just going to click on this thing here see it everybody see okay so here's the thing okay so here is the intuitive force of this I think this argue strongly from my side why do I think that because look at that base it's a huge part of the picture you were staring at that thing looking around moving your eyes around you know it was on the screen for almost a minute I think you must have looked at that thing a few times but here's the thing why didn't you notice the change it's because you didn't conceptualize the color you didn't say to yourself at the beginning red at the end purple you didn't say the words red or purple if you had conceptualize them applied your cognition to it then you would have been able to notice it but it's hard to notice something that you don't conceptualize so I think that this suggests that okay so this is thing I haven't introduced the global workspace so I'll mention that in a minute but the global space is a mock an opposed theory of consciousness opposed to mine and I think a explain this in a minute but I think why I think the the reason that something isn't broadcast in global workspaces it's not conceptualized now I'm going to show you another one how many have seen this oh good um this is well I'm not even tell you what it is but just watch and listen to the sound here hey Sonny murdered notes my who at precisely 3:30 4:00 this afternoon from brutally bludgeoned to death with a blunt instrument I want each of you to tell me your whereabouts at precisely the time that we started leading took place I hope these brass in the master bedroom I'm exhausted scones for those stairs son but I was plunging my grandchildren in Bobby J comfortable a rest notice mine everything that madam and really all the countries will tell you one does not drive for two years until a okay so now what you're going to see you're going to see the whole thing over again from a different camera that shows you more okay somebody's rumors or smile who precisely pretty 34 this afternoon was brutally 11 to 10 that country's I want you to even tell me your warehouse slightly at times a star can be cynical I'm stoned politics tonight in Bakke said possible unrest this is fine okay so here this by the way this this is a BBC bicycle safety ad and it's this kind of work that for example made people realize that it's really a bad idea to talk on a cell phone while driving and there's a lot of experimental work that backs that idea up and the reason is this is an an attentional problem now my opponents like to think of this as inattentional blindness but I think this case argues for my view which is intentional lack of access to the difference so and my reason for thinking that is I mean look for example at the the guy who's speaking you look right at him it really up you really must have registered his coat for example it was one color at the beginning another color at the end and likewise for many other things so why didn't you notice the difference well I think you didn't notice the difference because you didn't conceptualize that color so noticing is a lot easier if you conceptually I keep using this word concept now I feel like I've used up about half of my time and I'm really nowhere near done so this is over like roughly two is that the idea okay well okay so look I'll have to kind of skip around by the way if you raise your hand and I don't see you it's because the lights are kind of in my eyes so you might just wait here and so um okay so um well maybe I should start skipping let me just mention one other experiment so this is a this is a sort of Sperling like experiment done by a group in Amsterdam and the idea is that you have at the start you have say a circle of rectangles eight rectangles and then there's a blank period and then if there's another circle of rectangles and at some point there's a pointer that points at a rectangle and the job of the subject in the experiment is to say whether the knew whether the rectangle pointed to is a different orientation from the first one everybody get that okay so the answer in all these is yes the pointer can come at the end or it can come at the beginning or can come in the middle if it comes at the beginning people can get almost all eight if it comes at the end they can get four and the idea here is that's the capacity of working memory which we talked about before the new array at the end wipes out your your phenomenal memory of the array the interesting one is in the middle and here you can get somewhere between seven and eight so the four at the end is an index of your cognitive access or access consciousness capacity the one in the middle is in an index of your your phenomenal memory so it's these two kinds of memory that are an issue here now of course my opponents think oh how do we know that that memory is a conscious memory maybe these things are actually unconscious and so and then when they get to cue there something has summoned up from from unconsciousness so what is clear though is that more items can be held in the non conceptual so I what I think is that these that this memory is and what's really crucial to the experiments it's a non conceptual memory now I think that these non conceptual representations are our conscious but I'll have to wait to get to the evidence for that so just to remind you here are the the two views and that put in terms of whether a attention it promotes conceptualization is I think or whether it is needed for consciousness and I should say by the way I'm of which probably people something probably people here aren't aware of is which is that in recent years philosophers have become very tied in with a lot of discussions in psychology neuroscience AI and so these people are you know the disagreements here are equally split between philosophers and scientists now I've been using this word a concept the word concept is actually ambiguous between a sense in which it means something that can be shared among many people something kind of abstract that's at the top some a meaning like or this mental representation sense that was used by the for example of British and Paris's so I'm going with the mental representation sense it's just I'm just talking about terminology now this notion of concept is often puzzles people there's a famous case that helps to illustrate what are on the notion of a concept business french philosopher named bruno latour who says said that Aransas ii could not have died of tuberculosis because it wasn't discovered then and this is an actual quote before coq the bacillus had no real existence to say that ramses ii died of tuberculosis is absurd a saying that he died of machine-gun fire and so i quote this partly because it's kind of funny but the idea here is that it's me he's confusing the concept in my sense with what it's a concept of and so that helps to illustrate the idea Oh some of my things aren't displaying properly but what can I do so what I think is that the that the conscious experience is non-conceptual here is one of many experiments that suggest that this is an experiment done on 12 month old babies and so there's a screen there looking at the screen an object comes out one side a different colored object comes out the other side then the screen goes down and the the babies do not expect two things okay so they don't register color it's an interesting thing about color and babies but they're color vision is fine at four to six months they can they have all the basic color discriminations if anybody's interested I can explain how they tell that but they do not use color in reasoning between about four to six months and starting maybe like 12 to 18 months they start using color and reasoning so they're not they're their appreciation of color is non conceptual so yeah this is what I just said okay I am going to have to skip okay so here is a little kind of brain illustration of some of the ideas that are an issue here so this is the back of the head where vision starts you know the light comes in your eyes it is the signals are sent through retina to the something in the middle of your brain the lateral genican they go to the first cortical visual areas in the back of your head and the my opponent so sorry these arrows are indicate a tension this means that the person is attending to the stimulus the arrow pointing to the back of the head where vision starts is attention to the stimulus so this is a diagram of a brain when somebody is uncontroversially conscious of a stimulus person is attending to it there are all these reciprocal connections reciprocal activations going into frontal cortex the key here is frontal cortex that's where faut reasoning decision-making live in the brain and my opponents think the people who think all consciousness is access consciousness that it's the it's that triggering the activation it's called ignition that makes the and that creates these these neural coalition's with frontal cortex that are the key to consciousness here is a undeniably unconscious perception no there's something called priming if you get a stimulus it affects your later recognition so for example if I get if I have an unconscious subliminal presentation of the word doctor I'll be quicker to recognize the word nurse as a word if if I've seen it here is a controversial case which my opponent Stanislaus tahan calls preconscious and that is where you have attention away from the stimulus you get strong loops in the back of the head but no report ability unless attention shifts so he thinks that's not conscious I say that it's probably conscious so I'm now going to move to maybe I should just quickly explain the global workspace okay since a diagram from Stanislaus tahan who was a French cognitive neuroscientist and the idea is that these the outer circle is the periphery of your body these nodes are our neural systems the links are our links between neural systems the filled-in ones are active so here's his idea the idea is that you have a you know the sensory surface produces a lot of activations there's a competition among them some of them form active coalition's and then they trigger ignition into the frontal lobes when when what the ignition in the frontal lobes makes the the stimuli conceptualized so I've been talking a lot about the difference we unconsenting conceptions this is a a theory of what it is to be conceptualized okay so here's them I'm just going to quickly get to the methodological breakthroughs and I think I'll only probably be able to do one of them so my two hypotheses here are that conceptualize the stimulus requires global broken broadcasting this is called global broadcaster when these active coalition's trigger representations in the front hypothesis - is that non conceptual conscious perceptible broadcasting so now a method here that I could use okay maybe I went to this so this requires red and Glyn green glasses which I happen to war with me actually there's no time to cast it out you know I'm going to pass these out anyway and then I can come back to it so yeah yeah so please don't touch the red in the green and then I'd like to have those back at the end so until those are all passed out which is going to be a while I'm just going to I'm going to go on so if you look at this through red-green glasses what here's what you get you get first a face then a house then a face fills your whole visual field okay it's called binocular rivalry does you have incompatible representations and and the the processing streams involving both the two eyes Duke it out and interestingly you can um this is a terrific thing for studying conscious because you have an unchanging input with changing conscious percept so and that's a lot of people to identify some areas that are more active when you're conscious like the fusiform face area of a face and other areas that are active more active when you're conscious of saith my house these things have if you ask people to report whether they see a face or a house what you get is frontal and parietal links being the key thing here and that that has been taken to support the global workspace idea however eye movements can be validated as a measure of consciousness so the key here this is what's called a a no report method so here's the problem reports are an index of phenomenal consciousness you know if you say you saw it probably did see it there also an index of access consciousness how can you use reports to distinguish between phenomena conscious access conscious it seems impossible people have said it's impossible however whenever people say something is impossible it's a dangerous thing because clever experimenters can find a way to make it possible and that's happened here so in an article from Wolfgang I know there's a group in 2014 by the way I should say that the experiments excited I'm going to get a chance to go through these experiments are all are very recent experiments this is an area that is exploding in what people are finding out and my approach to the hard problem is you know nobody can think of an answer to the hard problem but that may be because of a failure of imagination and the way to sort of you know juice up your imagination is to figure out how the easy problem works how these states affect other states and maybe by doing that we'll be able to solve the hard problem anyway so what how's this lab found was that if everybody have the reading glasses oh whatever happened to them oh oh I'm sorry what what oh I'm sorry well okay so look I'm just going to show you this those of you have them I just want to make sure people see I'm it takes a little while so you make what you should be seeing if this is working properly is alternating house face house face unless you have a very very dominant eye how many are seeing that raise your hand if you're seeing the alternation okay oh good okay I'm sorry I didn't bring enough okay so I'm going to go back to this thing okay so alright so if you do the binocular rivalry with a grid moving one way in one eye and a grid not any other way the other one turns out there's a nice index of what you are conscious of and that index is called optokinetic nystagmus and this is what the eye does the eye movements indicate which thing you are conscious of and it can be shown using people's reports that they correlate pretty well but now there's this cool thing you've got a with an index of what people are experiencing and now you can show them the original stimuli and don't ask them to report okay no report paradigm okay so here's what its found out so here's a quotation from the article importantly when observers passively experienced rivalry without reporting perceptual alternations a different picture that it's a different picture from the global workspace idea merged differential neural activity in frontal areas was absent whereas activation in the back of the head and the middle of the head persisted we conclude that frontal areas are associated with active rapport and introspection okay so contradicting some of these earlier things now I have a lot more on this experiment which I'm not going to go into but you know I was very pleased to see this because of course it backs up my view what I'm you know Eric and I talk to luncheon but of course I'm very most what I'm most interested in is finding you know as is getting a leg up on the truth but I have an independent interested seeing my own views confirmed and this did it and quite a lot of these experiments have actually confirmed confirmed my picture of this which I've been pushing for a really long time so let me quickly switch to a different one so I'm this this longer talk involves three different techniques for avoiding problem but let me just explain the problem I'm trying to avoid the problem is both views meet this is mine this is my opponents both of them end up with sparse cognition so it seems that the basis of theorizing in reports is going to be the same in either case so that's the puzzle and then one I just showed you is a way around it it's called no report but of course reports have got to be in there somewhere in the case I just showed you the reports come before the experiment the one I'm going to show you now the reports come after the experiment and I'll just do this very briefly this uses something called event related potential which is a of a form of EEG and then the idea here is this is my opponent Stanislaus tahan one of my exponents I'll just I won't explain this whole diagram but the eye here is this looks at the differences between seen things and unseen things he means consciousness seen and not consciously seen and you only start to get a separation at about 270 milliseconds to 300 milliseconds so you can use temporal differences to get at whether it's a conscious perception or not on the global workspace point of view so here's the technique this is work done by Michael Pitts and Reid college so the paradigm is this you have a ring with these disks in it and the task is to detect a disk be dimming okay and and that focuses your attention on the periphery of the screen right because it's a very difficult task keep calibrates it to be extremely difficult in the meanwhile while the that's going on there's constantly changing lines in the middle so here's a example of a square that occurs in the middle and you set this up so that only about half the subjects notice it so what it does here is on the first stage which is probably the most significant one is he does 240 trials of this dimming detecting thing and then asked people afterwards whether they saw a figure and what he finds is that if they the heat has a long detailed questionnaire he shows them various possible examples of what the figure might have been and so he's trying really hard to rule out guessing and other facts so what he finds is that conscious experience correlates with activations earlier than the global workspace and about maybe 200 to 250 milliseconds so it's this temporal difference so again this supports my view and I'll just quote some of the what he says here I won't show you the whole experiment but here's what he says he says the pattern results suggest that the neural events reflected in and this is this in d1 and d2 is this stuff right here may be adequate in themselves to produce visual awareness whereas more widespread activity index than these things which occurs at 400 to 600 milliseconds might be required only when the stimuli need to be processed further to fulfill the goals of the task at hand this distinction parallels that made by previous theorists between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness so this is the first of his of many experiments that support this point of view and I won't go into all the details but he he what he shows in that in this work is that it's reporting it's the cognitive processes underline reporting and and conceptualizing that lead to global work space activation and okay so so according to this is a 2014 book by one of my opponents an applause zahaan who says when the prefrontal cortex does not gain access to a message it cannot be broadly shared and therefore remains unconscious what I think is that that unconsented in many cases conscious so just to sum up the evidence for rich conscious perception stems from these delayed indicators from eye movements and I didn't get a chance to do the ones about just judgments and so the idea is that the well I haven't really justified this but anyway there the thought is that phenomenal consciousness probably is not as informational and kind of thing as access consciousness and so I think is likely to resist computer approaches and I'm just going to stop [Applause] so questions and they would like you to use the microphone maybe somebody can handle microphone around sorry there's a little quick kind of run through some lists and stuff okay and I have a question with with the trial that you'd mentioned I wonder if you see differences how asses so does the trial seem to assume that people are always the same but like something like I'm kind of tired right now like it's Monday so maybe the way that I would you know perform with a didn't trial now if I'm hungry if I'm not hungry like how does that like the reality of like the body and your outside forces influence are not influence that consciousness trial yeah okay so in all experiments that's a problem there's going to be a lot of variants you know just treated as noise really it's ways in which to you will not get uniformity of response because of variation of all kinds of things to do with people and the you just have to deal with the noise and the data but it isn't it is a persistent problem I on I wanted back to the title so I wonder why she can't come right why the artificial intelligence approach won't work for the explanation with consciousness or yeah the thought well I didn't really get into this but the thought behind it is that that are the artificial intelligence approaches are probably better for access consciousness and phenomenal consciousness this idea of global broadcasting seems more amenable you know it's information flow basically whereas what's going on in phenomenal consciousness seems so no different from information flow it seems maybe to involve you know biochemical mechanisms in the brain I mean we don't know what the nature of phenomenal consciousness is so I guess maybe what I should really say is there is a possibility that information methods based on the flow of information work for phenomenal consciousness it is certainly true that advances to do with phenomenal consciousness seem to be coming from neuroscience rather than from computer science or artificial intelligence you know one of the hopes I mean one of the points that people have made about the global workspace viewpoint the one I've been arguing against is that it's in principle implementable on a machine so people who are interested in machine consciousness have been very happy with the global workspace idea so to the extent that I am arguing against the global workspace idea I'm arguing against at least a standard kind of computer approach to consciousness you don't mind can imagine or they degrade that machine can get consciousness yeah I think in look I think we're conscious machines so I'm you know we're meet machines I'm not any kind of a duelist or anything like that but I think that the most obvious application of theoretical approaches to consciousness from a machine point of view haven't panned out I haven't mentioned where there's a lot of other more machine friendly approaches so I'm you know some of them may look depends what kind of machine we're talking about my feeling is that we may need some kind of analog processes to deal with consciousness but you know this is initial stages of approach to it so I'm not entirely sure to ask this question it's a very with me but it seemed like a lot of the things you were examining in terms of what constituted you know conscious awareness of information or conceptual vision of information or you know unconscious or preconscious conceptualization nutrition or recognition of information all kind of had to do with the sense that there's sort of like like one place like where consciousness is happening what catches is all kind of one singular like the Cartesian process and like if that's not true what implication with that for these questions you know is it possible that you might all be relevant questions to catching this overall and are merely talking of where information happens to be in the brain at any given point yeah so I definitely do not think there is a place of the brain mind one of my opponents Daniel Dennett has used that to caricature my position he calls it the Cartesian theater so I think that our best guess about like where in the brain consciousness happens is that every conscious content is processed by the area that processes that kind of information so for example conscious contents of motion have to do with activations in that area MT probably they involve reciprocal connections to lower visual areas conscious appreciation of faces probably us to do with activation and this thing called the fusiform face area at the bottom of your right temporal lobe so I don't think there's any place where they come together the closest thing to a place I like to distinguish between what makes a content um between the difference between different conscious contents like face and motion I like to distinguish that question from what makes those contents conscious a matter that has been explored by studying for example anesthesia and it looks like there's some kind of general connectivity especially going back to this thing in the middle of the brain called the thalamus people used to speak of a phalanx so the closest thing to like a place where it all happens might be that but I don't think that's what explains the difference between conscious of a face and consciousness of motion it's more like a kind of an you know something in the direction of an on/off switch hey maybe a silly question but I noticed all of your example is in this we're done with people yeah what about animals like Hill okay so there was a big revolution in the study of consciousness in the mid 1990s when Francis Crick the Nobel prize-winning biologist and Christoph Kok realized you could approach consciousness through studying animals and a lot of the work is with animals you know it happened that actually I skipped something that was about the involved subjects for monkeys but a lot of the work is in animals and I think there's every reason to believe that our primate cousins are just as conscious as we are you know it used to be before about 20 years ago that people thought of consciousness in terms of language and I think that access consciousness was you know what they had in mind and I think one of the things that's happened in the last 20 years is people realize that language really doesn't have much to do with it so yeah there's a lot of work on conscious with animals of course it's easier to get reports from people so but there's been really some surprising work with animals where you can really get at what they you know what what they're experiencing through nonverbal methods okay thank you hi um if you suppose we had a synapse level simulation of the full human brain which I'd argue he might just be 15 years away from or so with this simulation exhibit phenomenal consciousness well that's something that people have argued about so one common point is that a simulation of a rainstorm isn't wet and maybe a simulation of a conscious being isn't conscious either so this all goes back to the issue which we don't know about but which could be true that consciousness essentially involves something to do with the neural processes that are going on in brain some kind of analog thing and that without an analog device of that sort you're not going to get consciousness for example signals and neurons are electrical but the neurons communicate via chemicals that go across the synapse maybe that's part of what's needed for consciousness maybe if you don't have you maybe you could make an artificial synapse well the people have made artificial synapses but maybe you'd have to use neurotransmitters for it to really have genuine consciousness this is the thing we don't really know what at its most basic level consciousness is so we don't know the answer to that how does that - not knowing what consciousness is what attempts have been made to attack this question from the point of asking what is consciousness asking why is consciousness you know speculating why it evolved even yeah ok well a lot of people have have tried to you know to answer that of course it's a little hard to know you know look evam evolutionary reasoning you know there's it's famous for the so-called you know just so stories in to use Stephen Jay Gould phrase but there are all sorts of hypotheses about you know why we have consciousness it's obviously doing something for us you know whether no here are some possibilities maybe it's motivational so you know positive consciousness pleasure pain maybe it is some it's a way of organizing attention or has something to do with interactions with attention so they're all there's no shortage of speculations but you know it's I don't think anybody knows describe again that I was a bit confused the difference between a kind of conscious perception and conscious perception that is not conceptualized which is basically the thing where and also once you do that discuss a bit kind of the consequences like what what would that mean generally one key resource again okay so a good index of this is the baby's perception of color okay so you've got the six-month-old baby it's color discriminations are almost at the level of an adult and the way you can tell that for example is if you have a colored background and a different colored disk a baby looking at that on an adult looking at that will tend to move their eyes to the disc if they can see the difference so that isn't gives you that's one method it's the number of methods of finding this out that's one method that tells you that baby is distinguished between colors pretty much the way we do after about six four to six months however they cannot use colors in reasoning so here's an example experiment if babies are very interested in movement and noise if you and you can they can so you a display this is a done by genre me Hoffman you have a display where a wonderful noisy puppet thing that twirls around will either occur on the left or the right if you see two identical shapes then you can set it up so that it's on the left and a baby will notice that regularity and two identical shapes look at the left because there's going to be something great there what about two identical colors on the left I can't do it they can't they don't register colors in a way that allows them to use them in reasoning so that's what concepts are about they're about reasoning and thinking and decision-making and evaluating they just can't do it so and then fact babies don't even learn the four basic color words until they're three years three months old an experiment done by Michael by Mabel rice in the 1980s took kids who did not know that is between red and green they'd done sorry to not know the words for red and green and tried to teach them the words red and green this is three-year-olds she had to go through a thousand trials to get kids to to learn the red green contrast the typical thing is once they learn one colored word they learn them all because you know this spend a lot of formative work on this but basically what we're dealing with is a creature maybe the human baby that does not register color in a way that allows them to conceptualize it it's non-consumption I think all perception is like that it's that it's most fundamental level it's non conceptual in it it sometimes they're automatically conceptualized and it gets into our conceptual system but what you have to realize is the perceptual and the cognitive are just different in the human brain now maybe that doesn't have to be true in the machine brain but you know we would be wise to give a thought to how people work when we're thinking about how to get machines to work so that's the that's the reason it's relevant one way or one thing that comes to mind here is maybe another terminology difference between these two things that might be useful is conceptual is sort of like symbolic reasoning symbolic process you know processing like you would do in like logical formulae or something you know whereas like the other type of processing that you're considering is more like say a digital signal processor that translates audio data to cute little data not it's doing symbolic reasoning there it's do applying just some kind of six transformations that seems to be the site of phenomenal character in your view so that then gets brought up into this sort of symbolic central unit yeah that's except that good are any of these points do all the salt this make sense though if you are a duelist ah okay yeah um I think everything I've said could be accepted by a duelist maybe well maybe not you know I did say some things that sounded like I think there's a neural basis but even duels can accept a neural basis for conscious experience so yeah I think everything I said it could be could be thought of could be accepted by a duelist so the question is whether that neural basis is really all there is to it or not okay thank you that's a different question sand let's tank that again [Applause] you
