 [Music] one interesting aspect of what's happening now is they increase the use of artificial artificial intelligence both in the scientific study but also in platforms like Facebook Google Google Maps and so on so people often do not realize that the newsfeed that they're seeing is basically an AI artificial intelligence that is just working hard to keep them engaged as much as possible right so way in a way by by interacting with Facebook they're interacting with artificial intelligence which is an interesting thought because very often people would ask me hey so when am I going to start interacting with robots right and like you're interacting with robots for quite some time already you just don't realize that right at what you see on Facebook is basically a product of an artificial intelligence trying to make you happy and make you engaged and now this has far-reaching consequences let me give you an example many people say hey you know like tools are never better good they're morally mutual take a knife knife is not better good it's just humans that can use nice for bad or good purposes now interestingly people were saying the same thing about artificial intelligence they would say hey artificial intelligence cannot be evil it's just that the human user huerta visual intelligence can be evil and can leash out artificial intelligence to do evil things but it's not true artificial intelligence can in fact be evil regardless of the intentions of the of its administrators let me give you an example when you set up an artificial intelligence system you give it a goal all right so if I'm Facebook I will set my artificial intelligence system to keep users engaged and well maximize more my advertising revenues as well right so I set up this very complicated AI system that basically optimizes your experience as a user suggest friends to you suggest content to you or on your newsfeed you know shows your relevant advert and so on and the goal of this AI system is to keep you engaged now the very reason that we use artificial intelligence is that because the tasks that direct official intelligence is dealing with are too complicated for humans to deal with on our own right so you could imagine hiring millions of editors they would sit down and try to optimize you know your Facebook experience for you right peak you know just just the stories for you but obviously this is just not doable so what we having here we replace potential human editors with AI that has a goal of keeping you engaged now the problem is that the goal might be morally neutral or positive like keeping you engaged with Facebook but the ways of achieving this goal AI developed on its own so no one retells exactly AI how to keep you engaged in AI will come up with ways of its own now the problem is that those ways might be ethically questionable fake news for instance we had this epidemic zone of fake use on Facebook why because AI recognized that if it shows you this content then you will basically be engaged in you be like oh my god this is the story's crazy and people would command and some people say that's true some other we would say oh that's rubbish so basically what happened that a I boosted user engagement realize in an excellent way the goal that each designers you know asked it to achieve but achieved it in ways that you know humans will probably see as potentially unethical [Music] so the idea is behind the algorithm like when you hear machine learning or neural networks or deep learning networks ideas behind those models those artificial intelligence models are really simple you could explain them to a seven-year-old really easily but what happens is that those very simple rules that are used to create those models which are basically just very often this is just multiplication and addition that I've been used to build those predictive models but then when you add up millions of elements in your equation it or even hundreds of elements honestly in your equation it's very easy for a computer to work with it's completely impossible for a human being to comprehend which creates an interesting situation in which you have individuals and societies making decisions based on what AI told them to do without having an understanding why this decision has been made Google Maps you drive to work in the morning Google Maps tells you how to go there you kind of don't really question the Machine anymore you know that it's way better than your friends neighbors and partners in telling you how to beat the traffic now how this algorithm works exactly you know we know other the rules driving this algorithm but how exactly the decision for you has been made this might be already beyond human comprehension how the stories were chosen for you for your Facebook newsfeed we know the simple rules that we ask the machine to follow but exact intricacies of this machine learning model and that is actually driving the content driving the choices of the content to appear in newsfeed beyond our comprehension we have now computers analyzing x-rays in order to detect cancer and suggest the best treatment and we know that those computers are more accurate than doctors and making those decisions and we have very limited understanding why exactly this particular decision has been made well you can ask the model model be like hey this is really simple here is 1 million numbers that drove me to make this decision can a human being comprehend you know 1 million or even you know 100 numbers simultaneously our brains did not evolve to work in this way quartz makes the decisions make the decisions about whether to let people go and how long the sentence should be and whether to grant you parole based on the outcome of an algorithm so obviously to judge that you know slums the hammer down the whatever podium but at the end of the day there is a little screen here and the screen says they are written calculated that this person should get seven years in prison or you should not grant parole to this person because their chances of reoffending us seventy or eighty percent and this number is a product of hundreds of variables that go into it so no human being can understand is a mathematical equation so it's it's a deterministic a process we know that it works because you can apply it to previous cases in fact it works for the benefit of humans because what it happens is that when the when the judges when judge just sees you for a few minutes and you know has a few seconds to kind of skim through your case and you are unlikely to be black then you basically just go to prison because like this just a assumption like that just another 100 people in prison who cares right this is the safest option but now what happens is there is this algorithm there that says in fact you know your intuition is to put them in prison but they're unlikely to be offense so why don't you let them go so we have evidence that those algorithms in in fact I'm making prisons more empty because you know they let judges be more liberal with the choices but on the other hand we have the length of your sentence being decided not by a human being anymore but by a computer the time of an algorithm is way cheaper than the time of a judge so what will happen now it is actually prosecution or there they will hit it so counties iris software are a few companies in the u.s. that produce this software and it's basically big data software they analyze life histories and cases case materials and you know some demographic variables like you know number of siblings number of children how many convictions we had in the past and whatnot and then they check okay so how likely this person was to reoffend and you build this huge statistical model and the basic is okay a person that has three siblings and did not have these offence in the past or whatnot you know it's unlikely to Rhea fence where don't you let them go and the judge and the prosecutor will actually give it to the judge it's kind of printed out of this third blow certified well accept it in a given jurisdiction computer program and the judge would be like you know okay now there's an interesting psychological phenomena here because if the judge disagrees with the program there's only one way in which judge can disagree with the program namely the judge could decide to give you a longer sentence because now imagine no human being would risk saying oh software says this person is likely to reoffend I will let them go why because then if the judge takes a responsibility for shortening the sentence against the advice of the computer overloads which basically means that you know you don't have judges with agreeing with the algorithm because why would they take this responsibility if the person we offense they can always say look according to the model it was unlikely to happen I just follow the advice of the model but if the model says this person is going to reoffend and judge lets you go and then someone comes after you and says hey why did you let this guy go you what did you say you acted against the what the algorithm said so literally we have the cases of freedom and and imprisonment decided now by a mathematical formula that no one understands because people don't understand how those Samoas work it's highly disappointing but the fact is that humans are just no better judges of each other then algorithms are and if anything algorithms are better judges of us the humans are because algorithms are not sexist I'm not racist I note ages and I'm basically not biased against you that we have so much evidence if you're a black defendant in a white defendant exactly the same history black just basically will always get a larger sentence now for a computer it will not happen because computer doesn't care about the color of your skin so you could argue that basically employing algorithm in such cases and we have a lot of evidence actually lowers the sentence length and lowers the real reoffending rates so it's great for the society and great for the defendants the problem that I have with it and I don't know how to solve it is that we follow those decisions and we have no idea how those decisions has been made [Music]
