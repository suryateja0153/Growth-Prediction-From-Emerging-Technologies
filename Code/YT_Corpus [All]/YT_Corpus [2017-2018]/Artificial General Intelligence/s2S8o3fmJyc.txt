 only in the ancient legends it is stated that one day and undead shuttles to leave the undead asylum in pilgrimage to the land of the ancient laws Lord [Music] hi I'm Tommy Thompson and this is design die my game design series is part of AI in games to date the series has looked at the intricacies of the most dominant power fantasy in video games the first-person shooter looking at both the successes of games such as titanfall 2 and doom but also the feelings of the lakes of aliens colonial Marines but in this video we're going to take a look at a game that is in many respects diametrically opposed to the core principles of shooter games a game that demands your attention from the get-go a game that demands your respect of its systems and keeps the rewards of your pursuits at arm's length in this video we visit the land of Lordran home of From Software's 2011 release Dark Souls it's difficult to approach this game now in 2017 six years after the release of the initial game on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 followed by the prepare to die edition on pc it's two sequels and its sister series blood-borne is the game that almost every aspiring critic has tackled at some point or another on YouTube as such finding fresh soil to fame purchase can be challenging and listening to another youtuber discussing it even more so but I wish to tackle this game in isolation and for now without consideration for its legacy too many times people talk about Dark Souls being hard and attribute its value to its perceived difficulty to the point that we often attribute Souls s games as a genre to be an adoption of specific mechanics combined with a base level of difficulty that's typically higher than other games the notion of difficulty is a challenging topic that's reared its head in recent discourse from the release of the deceivingly cute cop head and Jennifer Shirl's Twitter thread on game design secrets a thread that yours truly appeared on discussing many of the games have explored as part of AI in games was followed as a lengthy debate over the notion of skill based challenges the notions of difficulty and this remainded me of the idea of gay good a meme muffin used to burry inexperienced players and has a strong association with Dark Souls and the white our discourse the concept of our difficulty is modeled and expressed to players has gone through a slow evolution over the past 20 to 30 years some of our byproducts of the gradual improvement and understanding of games development as a craft as players interfacing with specific aspects of mechanics interactions but also some of it artificially enforced for the purposes of monetization what's undeniable is that much of our notions of difficulty in contemporary game play particularly given the subsequent rise of eSports is skill oriented this is led to a weird form of elitism emerging over games that have high skill based difficulty catering to a world of hardcore truly real gamers whatever you want to call it what I find equally fascinating as I do frustrating about all of this is that Dark Souls a game often held a law for the need to get good and for being the game for gamers sake isn't actually an issue of video game difficulty as we now consider it it's also a game that is when assessed more in terms of contemporary difficulty a lot easier than is often stated what makes Dark Souls continue to be as fun to play as it is intriguing to explorers in truth our cultural programming to video game design we expect clear instruction we expect integration direction instant reward and managed expectation but it doesn't do that Dark Souls has counter programming to those expectations Dark Souls demands your attention Dark Souls dementia respects Dark Souls demands that you die but perhaps most importantly and the thing that many people miss Dark Souls wants you to win it's a game that wants you to persevere to push forward to overcome and to achieve victory but always keep that a victory at least one step away from you so in this design dive let's have a look at notions of difficulty systems typically considered difficulty what does darksouls do to break from such conventions and then ironically how the AI actually becomes more of an ally than an adversary [Music] difficulty is a highly subjective interpretation of the realization of a games core components in context of the expectations of how a player will subsequently interact with them put more liman terms we manipulate aspects of a games core design and codes such that it should prove more challenging for a player but the idea of challenge within context of games is rather multifaceted pulling from areas of behavioral psychology reflexes and hand-eye coordination to lateral thinking and problem-solving as will be discussed through this video the notion of difficulty ultimately boils down to two distinct areas difficulty from mechanics and difficulty from semantics the former is commonplace the latter is often abandoned and contemporary video game design but an order for any difficulty theater system to work successfully a game must reward the player in the event they achieved that which the designers intended as Jennifer Cheryl stated in her interview with Rolling Stone Moore's game designers have at least a basic understanding of behavioral psychology and neuroscience many of the details of neurotransmitters are still unclear but we have a general idea of what the orchestra of human perception is made of and is essential to gain an understanding of them to know why game designers work the way they do the reward structure of games typically ties into a principle of behavioral psychology known as positive reinforcement whereby desirable events or a stimulus of some sort as presented as a result of executing a behavior as intended this result is designed to trigger the dopamine pathways in the brain and ultimately give you a bit of a feel-good vibe you do something right in the game the game will make you feel good about it and in turn teaches you that doing that repeatedly is a good thing the rate at which this reward is delivered in contrast to the actions executed and the level of abstraction involved can vary significantly it's actually what makes video games a really good testbed for artificially intelligent systems given the AI is designed to gravitate towards the most rewarding outcomes in a specific problem space provided we know where they are the rate of reward distribution in contrast to the granularity of actions executed is often referred to as compulsion loop theory where reward loops are established for specific aspects of play to ensure that players feel rewarded for a given action and do it continually you can usually break down compulsion loops into three durations short medium and long but shor and giving brief bouts of reward repeatedly that seldom acknowledged consciously to long-term rewards that give meaning in context to everything done to date to a point but the player feels like they've actually achieved something so let's start to get into how these reward systems are Bill entire aspects of difficulty and what any of this means in the context of Dark Souls [Music] when we talk about difficulty in contemporary gaming were often focused on mechanics and skill based challenge we're testing the reaction times and coordination of the player in stressful situations to force the user to absorb a large amount of sensory data process that within the bones of their existing knowledge and make an informed judgment within a very short period of time the compulsion loop system is often tied strongly to the notion of mechanic driven difficulty in an effort to teach players how to utilize a mechanic and then master it to fill effect this is often quite tightly balanced with more subtle aspects of the game's design in context with the form and function of the system it's executed upon hence the notion of mechanic oriented difficulty and its reward systems can shift so while a first-person shooter will typically have the same scoring mechanisms more subtle aspects of difficulty may be tied to control interfaces hence old-school console FPS is such as to rock dinosaur hunter at a different difficulty curve in comparison to a more contemporary examples such as titanfall 2 given the control schemes of their respective eras have changed quite dramatically arguably one of the best examples of how player mastery of mechanics can be tied to reward propagation can be found in the intent of Super Mario Brothers with coin collection and brick smashing being short term loops that are appealing to the user medium term where we complete entire levels forcing the player to keep moving right earning extra leaves by encouraging the repetition of the coin collection short term loop all the way to long term where Bowser is defeated and the game is won but maddy wasn't a great example in the context of modern difficulty systems given we typically push players towards achieving games on even harder difficulties but this seldom is integrated into the core of the game itself my Simon Parkin discusses in his article in the history of game difficulty and Eurogamer video game difficulty was then a commercial elaboration not an artistic one for many developers it was a requirement that distracted from their ideal vision for their game after all it's not difficult to make a difficult game you simply weigh the numbers and stack the odds against the player that much harder task is to create a perfectly calibrated piece of work one that is to lean on this mediums peg cliche easy to learn but hard to master we've seen this typically in combat driven games and quite prevalent Lee in Phi in games with the accuracy of attacks counter-attacks and more become more precise as the difficulty increases but it doesn't really yield any stronger or award in the context of the original design it arguably makes the long-term reward feel more valuable but naturally that differs from person to person given as I've said difficulty is often a very subjective interpretation these notions of accuracy in reward type to mechanic execution are tied heavily into the core components of what makes Dark Souls tick on a surface level and one of the two critical aspects in which we typically perceive this game as difficult is driven by a high level of skill required to interact with it this alongside a distinctly small amount of reward that is associated with an action being achieved successfully returning to my previous example of mario coins bricks and enemies are typically short term levels and laves are medium and completion of the game itself is long term it doesn't have a one-to-one mapping with Dark Souls if anything the distance between short to medium to long is wider than ever before but also that many of the short term rewards are either less potent or are diminished by other patterns exhibited within the game firstly yes killing a standard enemy does have some small reward to it the souls accrued make this abundantly clear but the level of skill required to do so successfully diminishes the value derived from it attacking without penalty is tough managing your blocks requires practice getting these parries just ready even more so combat requires precision timing and patience and thus immediately strips of the same short term loop time frame as the lake's of mario in addition the risk is much higher given actions intended to complete the short-term loop always have a significant chance of destroying any progress towards completion of the critical medium-term loop leveling your character a bonfire the medium rewards are essentially moving from bonfire to bonfire with the killing of bosses along the way another a more long-term medium reward loop but failure in each instance is pretty jarring old awards from the short term loops are dropped on the ground where he died or reset back to the last bonfire we visited but all the world is reset and we're forced to do it again this is easily where for many the negative reinforcement of years - oh way the positives I've got to do it all over again but with the added pressure that if I feel again I will lose all the previously accumulated resource forever as it lies there tantalizingly waiting for you to pick it up but of course all this mechanic driven difficulty is compounded by the much bigger problems presented by the monsters and Hallowed that haunt the lands of Lordaeron but there's something really interesting happening right here that's often rather unexpected to this day I've never found anything 100% concrete on the AI implementation behind Dark Souls but sources have suggested that it utilizes hierarchical task network planning a method popularized by games such as Killzone 2 and transformers fall of Cybertron and is still used today in the lakes of dying light and horizon zero dawn HTN planning is a means by which to construct macro action sequences well you'll have characters do several things in sequence as part of a core behavior should the number of task networks be large enough designers can create quite the variety of behaviors but the thing is dark souls often doesn't really show any evidence of that well at least fails to show a large variety in behavior NPCs will stand idle until the player intersects with range of their sensors such as been able to see you but also been able to hear you at which point they'll either attack a range or rush towards you to attack up close they'll defend if they can evade and even possibly heal if not they'll simply absorbed a magician and healing typically only occurs once the enemy has less than a third of health and defense largely works okay but it leaves them open to counter-attack either by knocking their shields out the way or by moving around to attack from behind most attack strategies are quite predictable - even if there is some variability in which particular strategy will be picked ultimately the non-player character AI of this gamers on the whole rather dumb but that works in the context of what Dark Soul seeks to achieve their stupidity if you will is in many cases a requirement given they need to be simple enough in order to learn how to overcome them the trick here is that most players don't consider the NPC's in such a fashion given me largely struggle with three related components of the game's design the seemingly unwieldy mechanics the lack of hints and instruction which I'll come back to later but also their overt strengths in contrast to your own these three elements effectively masks were fundamentally simple and not that intelligent importance from the player it takes time exploring the world learning from the environment as is expected and fighting these enemies repeatedly in order to ascertain how best to defeat them their strengths which can often result in player death is aimed constructing an illusion of intelligence given it makes even the smallest of enemies fraught with peril if we slip up this actually carries many similarities with playtesting by bungee when developing the original halo as mentioned in Chris butcher and Jim Gray Zimmer's 2002 GDC talk they found an interesting correlation in play testing between players and the perceived intelligence of AI opponents the well a smart enemy may appear tough a tougher enemy will appear smarter by simply increasing the hit points of the enemies in the damage they do play testers found them to be more intelligent this perceived toughness helped shroud the lack of intelligence of these characters at first but in time this is gradually removed as we often die in respawn at bonfires as mentioned before while bonfires largely exist as our medium-term loop and rewards survival they also give us more information on the structure of the deterministic nature of the game the what would resets itself have to be visible fire with most though not all defeated enemies respawning v respawn in the exact same place they behave in almost the exact same way every time this helps build patterns this helps build familiarity and confidence we know where the monsters are we learn how to protect their attack patterns and in time can exploit that to fill effect this is how Dark Souls wants you to win allowing you to build drain spas to help scoop up extra souls for a weapon upgrade or level up the illusion of intelligence is highly relevant for each of the bosses given you only ever fight them successfully once per player oh and as such it takes several playthroughs of the game and maybe a good rummage through the community wikis to get an understanding of their fight patterns and limitations once you've figured out the issue stems and whether you as a player can actually execute that as expected which is more critical in the context of say on Steam smell the four kings or gravelord nito but it's no longer a one-on-one fight but the emphasis throughout this video and the mechanics and the NPC AI completely ignores the second aspect of Dark Souls difficulty we need to also discuss this man takes of Dark Souls design Dark Souls is undeniably retro in its semantic design a game that actually rewards the more intelligent exploration of its world bias players much of the instruction on how to proceed within the game as well as the actual law itself is hidden away bind item descriptions and environmental storytelling in a way the only video games can cater for I say retro given its rare from modern games to not overtly explain many of us design mechanics and give absolute direction to the player Dark Souls carries more in similarity with classic adventure games such as the dizzy series the original Legend of Zelda and The Secret of Monkey Island in each instance the game only gives a handful with any directions on how to complete it and expects players to explore the world and other to find the best actions to take with many of these games caddying linear and branching paths in an open-world that encourages forward progression but also exploration but even in some instances players can only really learn more about effective strategies after exhaustive experimentation the tricks seldom seen in action games these days with arguably the raids in destiny being a rare exception there are even environmental tutorials in many parts of the game but it's really easy to miss them the one time the game overtly communicates as mechanics and gives direction as in the opening minutes of the undead asylum we are taught how to complete the basic actions but secretly also encourage to start reading orange signs left in the world which after the asylum typically only come from other Dark Souls players but then the world provides other very quick introductions to core mechanics in a way that players seldom realize death and rebirth by bonfire is deliberately structured for that first asylum demon battle but also that attacking from above is explained to you here such that you can repeat it against the Taurus demon in the undead burg so many of the core systems are expressly communicated in the opening minutes of the game but the mechanic difficulty of the task at hand often makes players lose sight of that many core mechanics are reinforced also through the NPC design with a healthy number of humanoid combatants to encourage blocking rolling partying the nasty part is that the bosses never actively encourage the need to learn to party only to block and roll as such the final boss Gwyn the Lord of cinder can prove immensely difficult for players if they haven't continued to practice their block in Perry mastery it's no coincidence that the likes of Anor Londo is filled to the brim with mates are partying at the midpoint of the game a sort of remainder to you that maybe you should start thinking a bit building of that particular skill even figuring out where to go upon reaching the Firelink shrine takes patience in exploration but also reward you for repeatedly returning to the area for further direction the crestfallen warrior at fire Lynx Train actually tells you where to go in the beginning if we actually talked to him King seeker frampt appears after the second bell of awakening has been rung but we're too busy focusing on the cutscene that she was the opening of the gate at sense fortress front normally tells you that they need to go to Anne Arundel but of acquiring the Lord vessel if you speak within I'll concede that even on my first playthrough I didn't talk to him until after I had a quieter Dark Souls reward to exploration and enjoy it by leaving Brett comes for you periodically it makes the sense of discovery its own unique reward system to find out your hunch was right to find a path you're supposed to be on to find out you're actually going the right way ultimately when you pull up our Dark Souls is a fascinating exercise and testing of players intelligence by mystifying the inner workings of a game in a number of simple Albia effective ways looking back on it now I can't help but wonder whether the aggressive stance taken in the advertising was detrimental in our collective understanding of what this game is and how we should be exploring it too quickly did a consensus form within the wider gaming community that Dark Souls is aggressive unrelenting toxic even which seems largely at odds not only with how it's designed but with the largely supportive invoke all fanbase who frequently share their insights discuss their approaches and crowdsource good practice to help new arrivals to the world of Lordran even to this day I recorded part of this video during the annual return to Lord run event in which the server see a spike of activity as many players return with a new character to Dark Souls once more thus keeping its community alive either to help or hen itself as I conclude this topic I confess that my understanding and appreciation of Dark Souls has changed significantly through the creation of this video my new phone perspective comes from what is now my second full playthrough of Dark Souls and only now realizing just how wrong I was my first successful completion of Dark Souls was in January of 2013 took me 3 months and over 70 hours to complete that first playthrough after two attempts the first abandoned after making sloppy mistakes with my starting Ludo after eight hours I boosted my strength wielding ridiculous weapons I even killed solaire of astora because I wanted to see what he was carrying only to then be unable to use it even in my completed playthrough I had failed to learn that which Dark Soul sought to teach my character develoment was unfocused I kept using heavy armor I was cumbersome only then learning the value of partying in combat as I fought Gwyn at the end I finally brought him down after numerous attempts only to walk away and not touch her again until now what this games means to me has changed quite drastically over the years as I've come to learn more of a Dark Souls lore about game design as a whole but also a little bit more about myself as a person the second and now third playthrough has proven invaluable to teach me the importance of embracing the secrets of Dark Souls lore or of anything to ease my frustrations with the game world and pay attention to many aspects of its design that are frankly right in your face and you seldom Lewis on a more personal level it's also helped me understand the psychological problems I had while playing this game and make peace with the weird relationship that I have with it well it's useful skill is not what makes Dark Souls tick it's patience and understanding it's observable world around you and making concessions even completely changing the way you play removing that which is a valuer meaning to you and realizing you're better off for it it's about learning not just from your experience but also from that of others be in the game or in the wider world in an era of increasing accessibility of games from the platforms that are distributed onto the manner in which people can interface with them we sometimes forget this need not be applied so heavy-handed Lee to the literacy of the game itself if anything Dark Souls draws greater parallels with real life than many other games out there it rewards patience study exploration lateral thinking and perhaps most importantly your I'm as a piece of entertainment it legitimately rewards you the longer you spend with it every challenge faced by many games in this age to gain a sense of satisfaction and achievement from your time sure the ending itself is pretty short and simple but it's that dopamine release followed by the ability to go again and maybe not do it better but to do it differently that is what Dark Souls rewards players with a game that is largely static in its construction including some painfully wooden AI but deep in both its mythology and mechanical design the more you experiment the more you learn both of yourself and the tragedy that's befallen Lordran but it takes time to learn these values what is bravery after all with a dash of recklessness for you to truly embrace what Kindles the flames of Dark Souls you must prepare to die [Music] already a short wrap-up - thank you for watching this design davon darksouls hope you enjoyed it if you did please do me a favor and give it a like and maybe even a cheeky subscription to ein games it really helps and given the channel some big supporter out there as always a thank you to my sponsors via the crowdfunding platform patreon who are on screen now for anyone interested in learning more about the phenomena of Dark Souls and its impact upon players in its community I strongly recommend reading you died the Dark Souls companion by cares a McDonald and Jason Killingsworth it recounts a number of interesting tales about the cultural impact of the original Dark Souls in the gaming world also a quick shoutout for patrons about the design dive for you've got a choice of Borderlands 2 fear or Call of Duty World War 2 with more details on what these will be about over on the patreon link now rust my usual ending here because I want to take a moment to discuss two really important personal things in the context they makin in this video you can jump to the next video if you want I'm kind of done same what I needed to say it's part of the main discussion button you get this off my chest the first thing relates back to my story at the end of the video about how I completed Dark Souls for the first time I made a mess of it there are two important Caviar's firstly I've never touched this game since largely because of the negative effect that had on my personality and behavior to a point that I had a significant impact to my personal relationships especially with my partner when a defeated Lord when I yelled at my television finally letting go of a pent-up rage and aggression that had held over me in the weeks prior I was somewhat early told off and quite rightly sore from my behavior I was told to stop playing Dark Souls I would have an impact in the future of our relationship that it had brought a really ugly side of my personality and at that point I did the right thing I turned off the console and I walked away I never played dark souls again until I made this video over four and a half years later in this lie something of a cautionary tale given that many of the topics of this video psychological effects of the game design the difficulty structure the reward propagation and delay the value of information gathered can have a real influence in our mood and general behavior I had become the very thing that Kaiser McDonald had warned of and her book you died the foolish super hardcore match ole gamer looking to prove my mettle think in the end my own arrogance the viability that by sheer force of will I could overcome it I could defeat it but by God did I feel to grass so much of what the game told me I saw as a challenge to my supported ability my ego and in many ways manifested my own arrogance in a form of anger that I'm kind of embarrassed about now the second thing is that well hang on I need to break protocol for a minute here so yeah I finished darksouls on January the 19th 2013 but started that playthrough three months prior on 14th of October 2012 during that time I lost my dad and my father died specifically on the 4th of November of that year which makes it just over five years ago this month and that was tough it's a very difficult time for my family and I and we lost him a fairly young age he was 51 and we were very close I had a really good relationship with my old man and anyone who's suffered loss slit that will know her difficult it is for everyone touched by it to try and make sense of the world in each passing day and you know to try and keep moving in the aftermath to try and take stock of your own life as you're passing you know as your mourning the passing of someone else's but I also had to focus your mind and keep yourself moving forward because the world just keeps on spinning and at the end of the day doesn't really feel like anybody actually gives up I spent my personal time during that period playing Dark Souls which is can ironic given it's a game about repetitive death and rebirth as I'm trying to deal with a really view world real life equivalent and and in some respects my failure to play that game properly as I discussed at the end of this video was because I needed to aim myself at something to focus on my attention and determination on a single point in my life and I could just smash the [ __ ] out of it Kri lag Ornstein and smile the four kings gravelord nito all these people Guin himself all it became a punching bag from my frustrations and put it all in a game because I didn't have anywhere else to put it and it's taken me until now to realize that that really visceral emotional reaction I had killing Gwyn that first time what that actually meant for me it was the first real victory and some respects I think I'd had in my life to here in that time and that anger and frustration suddenly makes a lot of sense and also subsequently my partner's interpretation of my behavior at that point in time suddenly this all clicks no because Dark Souls was in a really strange way my method of grieving and I've only no compass revelation about myself and about this game and it's made this particular design dive a very personal one when this actually brought me some closure so I wanted to take a moment to thank all my patrons for voting on the video and to my waiter audience for continuing to watch these videos because it's been a real boost to me so thank you I wouldn't have been here doing this and talking about this now if it weren't for you and yeah I mean this thing that's about cool or wrap up be saved my friends don't you dare go hallo
