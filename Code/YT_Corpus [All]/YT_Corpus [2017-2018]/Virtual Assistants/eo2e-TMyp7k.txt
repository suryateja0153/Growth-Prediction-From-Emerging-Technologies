 Hello my YouTube friends its Richard founder of STRU and Airbnb super host and yes you read the title right I'm finally making this video I've been asked dozens of times and I'm so sorry that I haven't got to it before but I've been kind of busy so here's the question that I've heard time and time again which is how do i scale my Airbnb in short-term rental business using virtual assistants let's do it so the first question you might be wondering is well why do I use a virtual assistant to the first place and the answer is pretty simple I really won't love hosting and I loved the experience part I loved bringing joy to families and international travelers and obviously the financial gain is fantastic but that doesn't mean that I like every single thing about hosting like for instance I don't do my own cleaning I wouldn't do it very well I certainly wouldn't enjoy it for like a day or a week or a year much less like ten years so the goal for me in hosting and using this to achieve my 15 year plan is to be able to do it for 15 years or longer so one of the things that I did as I started to scale was figure out what I'm uniquely qualified to do and what it is that I like to do and everything that I'm either not uniquely qualified meaning like I could train somebody else to do it or that I don't enjoy I went on a mission to like find somebody who could do it better than me more reliably than me and maybe even do it like full-time and they might really enjoy it so that seemed like a really good solution for me and I want to tell you what it is that I rely on my virtual assistant to do and what I have my virtual assistant do is very similar to what a co-host might do but she uses her own password she logs into all of my different properties she does so on Airbnb and home away she looks at the Google shared calendar and then I've put together a series of templates and responses and a timeline and a series of operations that she then executes for me to help me run my Airbnb business so think of things like questions she responds to questions think of things like calendar management she knows what dates are available what dates aren't she organizes all of my cleaning teams and the different people that are involved in maintenance and so on so she's like my co-host if you will but she handles all of that and the things that I'm uniquely qualified to do strategy pricing expansion financial analysis things like that by the fact that I've given all of the other things that I like to do to my virtual assistant that frees me up to do all the things that I do like to do and it also makes it much more sustainable and repeatable and therefore much more likely to accomplish my 15 year goal so before you start skipping ahead because the next part is really important I want to go ahead and tell you where I found my virtual assistant and it was pretty simple I follow an entrepreneur in social media Chris Drucker if you don't follow him he's worthwhile he's got some really interesting points he's a British guy who lives in the Philippines and he runs many businesses including virtual assistant finder and so they're based in the Philippines he uses Filipino people all over the place and it's been really good for me now the Filipino people are friendly hospitable English is very strong it's not native English so like just be warned about that but here's a case in point where I started to follow somebody I liked what they were doing I learned that he had this business and I gave it a shot it works for me and if you want to try it there's a link below I think it's worth checking out so this parts really important and the good news is it's almost entirely in your control and that is how do you train them and the bottom line is the more time and energy you think about what you want them to do and how you want them to do it and the more time and energy you put into like a training program and checking in with them and so on the better the results will be now there's two components of it you have to select the right person so like it's not worth training the wrong person and if you've never employed anybody that's a big lesson like hiring people and learning like when to invest more double down and when to walk away you know that old like Willie Nelson song you have to know when to hold them and when to fold them No No if you've never done that expect some challenges I've been in entrepreneur for years and across many different businesses I can tell you hiring the right people is not only the most important thing it's also the most challenging and a virtual assistant is no different so the more time and energy you think about like what you need and who the right person is and putting the time and energy into the thoughtful description the more likely that the virtual finder program is going to work for you and then once you have yours look what you're gonna do is Skype interview I recommend you interview at least two or three people look for personality look for who fit look for engagement look for hospitality like all those things that you want your employee to have and then once you have them then the hard work really begins because now it's one-on-one you have to express to them your why how important hospitality is how you want things handled the timeliness of it again think about everything and then spend a lot of time and energy and if you do that you will be rewarded more likely than not most people won't invest the time and energy and then they'll give up on the program just like how this didn't work what have wasted time and money you have to commit to it you have to work it you have to try you have to hire right then you have to train right the last thing I'm going to talk about in this video are like challenges and problems to overcome and there's a few actually more than a few there's a lot and I can't even say I have a crystal ball and I know them all I'm sure you'll have your own problems but like in anything else the upside is so worthwhile like the ability to scale and spend the time and energy on what it is that I wanted to do and that I'm uniquely qualified and that motivates me and rid myself of everything else is really worthwhile so here are some challenges that I've faced the first one is the infrastructure in the Philippines where my virtual assistant Maria's based is not the same as here in New York City which means that we have power outages there's storms that go out internet speeds are slower and things like that and so at first it might be frustrating but then it sort of becomes part of the routine and you sort of can expect it a little bit and so what that means is I'll have an idea of when a response was came in and whether it's been responded to or not and I give her you know a couple of like an hour to before I will jump in and respond again it's infrequent but my point is you have to have like your finger the pulse and know what's going on the second one is communication and language chances are they're not going to be native English speakers although this English language is very strong so you have to give them a little bit more freedom and leeway and like understanding and then work with them that's the good news the good news is they have less like baggage if you will so like training somebody who's been trained and properly who has a bad attitude or you know isn't a good employee that's really almost impossible but taking somebody who's like open and excited and looking forward to working with you and then like helping mold them and define that culture between the two of you you should view that as an opportunity slash challenge another thing that I would say is that um you know they're doing this because they have to write like they need this job it's super important to them to pay for maybe their mortgage or the food on the table and it's really important that you are you know humble and nice and respectful and it can be challenging if like you know you've never met this person and their Internet's down and they didn't respond and I've had a situation with Maria in my particular case where somebody asked for a very key specific date it was peak peak it was like over Christmas and New Year's and she made a mistake and it ended up costing me 6,000 or 7,000 dollars and that period still open and so like I could get really really upset and I could just like throw a temper tantrum and you know like ruin the relationship or I can try and be empathetic about it and say you know six or seven thousand dollars for this person is maybe a year's salary or you know some huge amount of income and so maybe she was nervous about it maybe she made a mistake and so rather than you know like throw the baby out with the bathwater let's talk about it let's regroup let's try and understand what went through if you ever have any questions I'm always available even though you might feel like you're working on your own like if there's something that's really important I'm always available so please feel free to interrupt me ask for help and so on and it's that sort of mindset that I think is really important if you're gonna hire somebody who lives you know twelve hours away at a different time zone 3,000 miles that you may never meet is appreciate like their reality what's happening with them and just be respectful and mindful of that so that's a wrap that's basically ins and outs of what I do and how I do it and why I do it and I would just leave you with this thought if it's not a full-time job for you like you don't have enough properties to employ somebody for full-time this virtual assistant can help you with like your personal life they can call and make doctor's appointments they can call and do your like travel and book your hotels and your flights and so on they're really capable they're really eager they're really excited to like help so just open your mind and say hey I have a set of hands and a great mind and an upbeat person how how might I use them to help me so the world is really you know up to you to define and work together and I think it'll really work out I'd love to hear your comments and your questions below if you haven't subscribed to the YouTube channel I would ask that you do so
