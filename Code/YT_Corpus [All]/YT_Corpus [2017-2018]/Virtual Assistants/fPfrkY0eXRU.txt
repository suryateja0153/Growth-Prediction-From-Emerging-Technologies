 Hi, my name is Rob O'Byrne, and welcome to the final video in this series of using outsourcing to help you get your life back and grow your business in this video I'd like to talk about a really easy way for you to start and get into outsourcing so I've explained so far how your source of EA's some of the sort of pros and cons of different types of sourcing arrangements home-based office space some of the things to look for with office based I talked about pay rates and all those sorts of things that's taken me quite a few years to learn all of that and I've made a few mistakes along the way the easiest way for you to get in to outsourcing and to get your own VA is just to use my team to be honest we've gone through all of the pain we've got the whole thing really humming smoothly we've got a fantastic office for the great team people who are really well looked after so why not think of that as an option by all means go do your own research but just think about virtual done well as well as option so and my team is basically office based so if you'll recall I mentioned that I have 8 VA looking after me but right from the start we actually hired additional VA s to support other small business owners and entrepreneurs so the team has been growing ever since we started in 2012 and that's really grown like Topsy so now we have we do take on a few external clients every year and we don't want to be a multi-storey you know BPO if that's not the intention virtual done well really operates a bit more like a social enterprise we want to be working with good clients who appreciate great service and we want to be able to look after our staff as well and give them a great working environment in fact at the end I'll just mention the win win which really encapsulates how virtual Dunwell operates so as I mentioned we did take on a few external clients each year in terms of the office member those things that I said a good BPO what to have all their staff gets health insurance they get gym membership they're sitting at computers all day and we need to get them active and healthy probably by the time you watch this video we will have established a crush because a little bit staff are actually on numbers so most would have extended family members looking after the kids but we think it will be much nicer if they can bring the kids into work and have them looked after you know professionally in the crash downstairs but not in the office don't worry so they have all of the IT support I get paranoid about internet speed because if you don't have good internet speed it can make things really difficult we have about five different internet providers all of different speeds and depending because you know not only red and got just the backup we've go back up to the backup and a backup to the backup some of those are very high-speed lines because some of the staff are working on video editing and things like that others are you know perfectly adequate for normal day-to-day tasks and clones and things like that so the IT support they have great a child support I mentioned earlier they have you know dedicated supervisors looking after them we have lots of ongoing training in fact we recently instigated a system we call them crew coaches and a couple of my team our crew coaches so what that means is that if you like the subject matter experts on particular areas might be particular systems or using Microsoft Office or something like that and everybody in the business knows who the different crew coaches are they're all sort of posted up on the wall and if I need help on maybe using Infusionsoft or Trello I know to go and talk to lay out because she's the crew coach on those systems so as well as the formal training we have that as well that anybody can just talk to the crew coaches and get some additional training so yeah it's let's make sure that they all have bank accounts so they're getting paid promptly and properly we make sure that all the taxes are paid and all the sort of Statuary things have met all that contracts are done fairly and within all of the local rules salary scales we always like to be a little bit above market on the salary scales because you know at the end of the day we want people to feel valued and well rewarded for working there so that's kind of a little bit about the office in terms of the culture I mentioned on an earlier video how we do the lunch tests it's very much a family culture and where it's quite amusing when new staff come and join virtual done well and they've come from one of the big BPOs they kind of go this is a bit strange it's really relaxed it's not stressful in the big PPOs you know you get fined if you clock in a minute late you know the sort of performance measures are very draconian we'd much rather work in an environment where people are empowered and they take accept responsibility and accountability for their tasks so we're not going around hitting people the sticks not literally but metaphorically you know it's a culture of you're expected to get the work done there's plenty of support that's training you know get the work done you're well rewarded if you don't get the work done you're going to be spoken to and there's a very very robust system of management interviews with with people who might be falling behind at there and they soon pick up so all of that is very carefully managed so that I mean they are just a phenomenal group of people to be honest providing outstanding services and I am never never cease to be amazed that you know seeing them step up and learn new things and start doing new things for their clients so it's just a tremendous environment all of our bas are great all of our team leaders are great and management team is great and this thing down the bottom here I mentioned we operate virtual Dom well a little bit like a social enterprise so I'm not intimately volved with it day to day I am with my team who work in the virtual Dunwell office but but actually one of one of my staff here in Sydney oversees virtual done well we have a very good general manager local general manager for virtual done well and I mentioned it kind of operates a little bit like a social enterprise because how does this win-win-win operate well you win for a start because you're getting outstanding virtual assistants will manage motivated well looked-after well-suited to whatever task you want our staff win because they get really well looked after they're well rewarded they're working in a really nice culture a nice atmosphere so they love working there and you might be wondering who this third one is well like we do with all of my businesses here in Australia in Thailand with virtual done well also we give a proportion of our income to charity and there's a couple of ways that we do that one we operate through a global charity organization called buy one give one the concept there is if you buy something from us we do something to somebody in need as well so so that operates and a proportion of revenue goes to that but also what we do with our Philippines office which I should mention is endeavour City way down south in the Philippines we also support local charities and diversity and the staff themselves pick which charities they would like to support so this year you know it might be a local orphanage or it might be helping homeless people you know whatever that might be it's whatever really resonates with them and again a proportion of revenue will go to those local charities so it really is you know an awesome business win-win-win do the staff and those in need as well so that comes to the end of the video series I hope you've learned something about outsourcing if you haven't considered it before it is a tremendous tool it is it's like the secret sauce for small business owners but as to build their business you know reduce the stress levels get the life back if you remember my story working 80 90 100 hours a week doing everything are now running six businesses I'm working half of those hours and I'm having three non-solid a year now life is good and it's from support of wonderful people like those at Virtua and don'twell that allows me to do that and these are such great people I think I mentioned before my team particularly will get to come over and visit us and Sydney they actually come and stay at my house where my wife and I and our live almost become like family they really are terrific people and great to work with if you need videos come and work with them too
