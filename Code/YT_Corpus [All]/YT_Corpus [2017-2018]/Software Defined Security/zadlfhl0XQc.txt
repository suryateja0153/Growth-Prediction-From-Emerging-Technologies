 The internet, software and digitisation can bring a world of benefits to your organisation. In order to realise the significant benefits that these things provide, your organisation needs to be able to effectively manage risk. Imagine if you were able to access cutting-edge capabilities, giving you that visibility and control. This idea has already become reality with our new Managed Security Services and Security Operations Centres. Our two new Security Operations Centres - built to bring the next generation of capabilities, technology and processes that we use to protect ourselves and our customers. Our customers can work with us and learn with us and influence our new security products. Underpinning all of these activities is a powerful new open-source Managed Security Services platform that lets us tap into global innovation at will. Openness, collaboration and continuous innovation - these are the three principles that will allow us to protect your organisation in a continually changing threat landscape. Two locations in the Melbourne and Sydney CBDs work in parallel, and all data is stored onshore. But that's only the beginning. From our Australian facilities, we already have the ability to deliver enterprise-grade security to organisations both large and small, either locally or anywhere around the world. We also have plans to expand our SOC footprint globally. The Security Operations Centres provide unprecedented visibility and insight into managing risk. But don't take my word for it - come in and see our Security Operations Centres. You're always welcome.
