 if you're working in IT security there are a number of software tools that you should have in your arsenal in this video we'll talk about a number of those tools some of them are passive tools and others work actively a passive tool is one that watches is network traffic goes by and it gives you information about what might be happening inside of the traffic or on a client or a server an active tool will be sending traffic to a device we may be trying a set of credentials on that device we may be trying to exploit a known vulnerability or may just try to query a login page on that device to see if it's active if you're going to capture packets then you'll need a protocol analyzer not only does a protocol analyzer gather these packets but it's able to present the information inside the packets in plain English we can gather these packets from a wired network but we can also gather them wirelessly sometimes the ability to capture these packets is something built into the device and you won't even need to install any additional software a protocol analyzer is going to allow you to view traffic patterns you'll be able to see exactly what protocols are going back and forth and perhaps more importantly you'll be able to identify traffic that is unknown if you're trying to find traffic that may be unusual or malicious this is a great way to do it some protocol analyzers are designed to gather a large amount of traffic into a large storage array for example you could have an analyzer store an entire week's worth of data and then use analytics to be able to gather details about what happened during that time frame a network scanner is commonly used to determine what services might be running on a remote device you can find out if a server is running web services FTP services IRC services or any other type of service these network scanners can also determine what operating system might be running on a remote device you would commonly tell a network scanner to scan an individual IP address or an entire range and it will report back whatever it finds out on the network once the scanner has identified all of the devices on a particular subnet it can even visually graph them this is a tool called Zen map that has taken a scan and has identified all of the different devices on the network and now allows you to go through the entire list to determine exactly what services are running on each individual device on the network this is also a good way to find devices that you weren't expecting to see on the network it's difficult for a device to completely hide itself on the network and these scanners are designed to find every device that they can you may want to try downloading one of these and try it yourself in map and Zen map or a good example of a very popular network scanner but there are other options out there such as the angry IP scanner because of the unique characteristics of wireless networks you need unique security tools one good example of these are the wireless scanners and crackers that you can find for wireless networks the first type of tool you'll need is one to do wireless monitoring you need some way to capture all of the traffic that's going across this wireless network you may also want to try your own set of wireless attacks to see if your access points are susceptible to deopt indication and of wireless attacks and if you were interested in seeing how difficult it might be to find the password on your wireless network you can run wireless cracking tools these can either cryptographically find the WEP key that you might be running on an old network or you can run through a dictionary or a brute-force attack if you're running a wpa2 network you may have seen me crack a whet password in one of our earlier videos I was using the aircrack-ng suite to be able to do that but there's other tools like furn available that will allow you to find and crack these wireless passwords most of our operating systems and applications we're restoring users passwords as hashes that's because a hash is a one-way function we can take a password and very easily convert it to a hash but there's no way to take a hash and convert it back to the password some older operating systems or poorly developed applications might store their hashes in a very straightforward way there might not be any salting and they might be using a relatively weak hash this makes it very easy to perform a brute-force attack if you're able to get your hands on those hashes but the process of getting your hands on those hashes is usually not very trivial there's usually an involved process to break into a system just so you can gain access to the files that contain all of these hashes but if you do get your hands on these hashes you'll be able to run some brute force attacks maybe you try a list of common passwords or run through different languages of passwords and ultimately you might try rainbow tables to see if those hashes have already been brute force and you can very easily find the password using a rainbow table there are many tools available for password cracking you can find many tools available in the cloud where you simply upload the hashes and it runs through some rainbow tables or you can try some local cracking tools like John the Ripper or off crack it is a constant race to stay up to date with the latest security patches before the bad guys try to exploit those vulnerabilities on a system if you happen to miss a patch it's very common for someone to come around behind you and find that open door on your system running a vulnerability scanner would be a good way to find out if you happen to miss any of the known vulnerabilities that might be on your system this is an active test but it's only minimally invasive it's not an act of exploitation that you might have with a penetration test the idea of a vulnerability scanners that will find as much information as possible and gather details about everything it can about your operating system you'll be able to go through the logs afterwards to see what vulnerabilities may be of a higher priority and others that may be of a lower or informational priority there are many tools to do this Microsoft makes a baseline security analyzer tenable makes a very popular vulnerability scanner with necess and you've probably seen me in a previous video run a web-based vulnerability scanner called nikto on your network you may have a series of requirements for the security of your system there may be internal requirements for your organization or there may be regulations in your industry that require a certain level of security for all of your systems to see if you meet these minimum requirements you'll need some type of compliance scanner on your systems these scanners will be able to determine the operating system you're using it'll know what applications are installed on your systems look through the networks settings identifying the antivirus or anti-malware and know exactly what signatures of those may be installed and you'll be able to get detailed information about the configurations of all of your systems information from all of your devices are stored in a central database and from there you're able to monitor and create reports on what you found you'll be able to identify if any devices are changing over time and you can usually integrate this with a login process that way you'll know if someone logs in and their system is dramatically different than the last time they logged in and you'll be able to take that system and determine what the changes might be and if any of those changes go outside the scope of your compliance requirements the bad guys use every possible tool to gain access to your systems they can look for vulnerabilities that might be in your browser and your operating system and applications you use and anything else that might be running on your system to be able to take advantage of these different vulnerabilities the bad guys will need to write an exploit and instead of writing the exploit from scratch every time they'll instead use an exploitation framework all they have to do is find the exact piece of code they need to be able to put into the framework and all of the other mechanisms for delivering the payload and having it execute on that remote system are already built into the framework you can download and use these frameworks right now and test your own systems to see how secure they might be some very common frameworks to use our beef this is the browser exploitation framework project router sploit will try to exploit routers and other routing type devices and you've probably seen me use in a previous video Metasploit where I used a built-in exploit to be able to take advantage of a known vulnerability on a server it's time to upgrade the hard drive in your computer and you've copied everything from the smaller hard drive onto the drive with much more capacity now you've got this additional drive that you've taken out of your computer but what do you do with the data that was on that old drive you probably have information on there that you don't want to get into the hands of anyone else so it's important that everything on that drive be sanitized normally the sanitation process on these drives is one where we can simply overwrite the data that is already there generally when you overwrite the data one time on a hard drive it is gone forever there's no way to recover it sometimes people have write multiple times on a drive just to make themselves really sure that that data is gone but the reality is a single override will make all of that data unrecoverable if you have drives that you'd like to sanitize and you know you're never going to need that data again you can use a program like Derek's boot and nuke or dban you can boot with that and it will delete everything that happens to be on a hard drive if you just need to delete one individual file or a set of folders on your system and make sure that nobody is able to recover those you can use something like Microsoft's S delete that is secure delete and that will delete individual components from your drive leaving everything else available you have to make sure also that you delete the caches and any temporary files that you may have on that system you may securely delete one file for getting that another copy of it happens to exist in the cache one way to store data in plain sight but hidden is by using steganography steganography allows you to take an image and embed a bit of data inside of the image to us human beings the image looks exactly the same as it always has been but a bit of data has now been embedded inside the pixels of this image and there are many programs that can hide the data and then recover it using this steganography capability and steganography an important part of this is the cover text this is the container document or the file that is going to have the information contained within it steganography doesn't have to include an image though we could also hide data within other packets of data going across the network for this network based steganography although it's very common to use a graphical image to store this text in data sometimes the steganography is one that is right in the a laser printer can put very tiny almost invisible yellow dots at the bottom of the page the structure of these yellow dots will include the serial number of the printer so you know exactly what physical printer happened to print this document and they also include a timestamp so you know exactly what date and time was used to print this document if we look a little closer we can now see a little better those yellow dots that are on the page this is how security professionals and law enforcement can really make a determination of where a particular document may have originated instead of having the bad guys come across the internet and try to break into our own systems why don't we set up a system for them that is very attractive and that they could spend a lot of time trying to break into this is a honeypot you're attracting these bears which in most cases are just automated systems trying to find a device that is vulnerable to their attacks they're usually just performing reconnaissance so we can put this honeypot in place to catch all of the reconnaissance they happen to be doing some of these honey pots allow us to build entire infrastructures inside of them virtual servers and networks that to the bad guys looks like an entire company but in reality it's a virtual system that's all defined within the honeypot there's many different honeypot options out there project honeypot org and honey D are two very good examples that you can install on your systems to try out different options for honey pots the bad guys are also keeping their eyes open for these honey pots so it's a bit of a battle to build a honey pot that looks real enough so that the bad guys can't recognize they've been trapped inside of this virtual world part of your ongoing security policy should be the verification of a good set of backups this will protect you if a system fails it will protect you if your systems are infected with malware or ransomware and if you've ever been in a position where you've lost data you know these backups can really be a lifesaver there are many different strategies for backing up data and you may choose to use one or more of these strategies simultaneously one thing I often will do perform in our sink this is a real-time file sync so you can make sure that a secondary system has an exact duplicate of all of the data that's on the first system you'll of course also want to have backups that are occurring constantly maybe every hour you've got an update of everything that happens to be on a particular server and of course you'll want to make sure you have full complete file backups so if you need to restore an entire system you can reimage it in a matter of minutes from a security perspective you want to be sure that you have all of your devices covered so you will never lose any data and you want to make sure the process you have in place for restoring that data is one that works as quickly as possible you may not realize it but some applications really provide a lot of information about themselves when you first connect to them they tell you everything about themselves what their name is they'll tell you what version of software they happen to be running and they may give you a lot more information about the server that they're running on these are called application banners and they're usually always there but usually we don't see them this is something that happens behind the scenes over the network and it's usually so that the client the server can communicate to each other and everybody knows exactly who they're communicating with but you can capture this data you can grab the packets themselves or you can use netcat in C in map and a number of different security tools to be able to capture these banners you
