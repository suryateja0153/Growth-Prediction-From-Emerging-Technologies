 layers and the augmented reality platform so you're open platform where everybody can create their own augmented reality experiences yeah so basically we always say imagine that your reality is just an empty canvas yeah and you can you could be the better you can fill in your reality with anything you think is relevant so information digital objects fun experiences anything you think is cool or amazing worshiping should be added to reality and we we started up only seven months ago yeah netherlands we launched globally mid-august 2009 and well now we have over 320 layers active third-party layers developed by thousands of developers alright so let me get this right for you any further just to get to explain or clarified yeah your software is a platform will you've deployed on multiple mobile operating systems it's correct that anyone can develop arm so you develop on 141 platform that works on any platform its amount of public men's reality and X so if i want to go to augmented reality app i bought it on layer and then i can actually just apply to everyone without having to rewrite my code and all others exactly so then your augment reality layer will be accessible through our layer browser yeah and so it's not for developing standalone applications with which stem but by myself will be downloading for jump the iphone app store but there will be visible within the layer browser so it's a single point of entry for a lot of men reality experiences yeah and it's currently available iphone sorry on android we will come back to the iphone we could completely redesign the iphone app to make it fully to prove and we're developing the symbian version as well for the museum and when I website builder or I'm let's say I'm a consumer and I want to find out how do i how do i find the layer abstracting to layer application or how does that work ok so once you were in the layer browser and then you can find their multiple ways to find that to find a layer security one is layers which are in a featured section so this is our layers which we highly recommend yeah and there is a popular section which basically lists all the layers for most popular to the least popular so we scroll through it you will find all the layers which are active in your geographic area yeah of course is geographically referenced as well so yes yes layers are currently defined by their country or international when you have loads of POS along the world there is also a local tab where you can find layers which are really relevant locally and we are improving this because currently developers have to put some some action into defining a local boundary so there's room for improvement there but it's also possible to type in a keyword so there's a search button so giving keywords like hotel and then it will list you all the layers which are related to the nurses assess was getting my next question how do you have you separate the noise yeah signal from the noise in there yeah of course i mean thats a big thing in the and the answer will be a smart filtering and understanding people's context and that's yeah there's a lot a lot to be it to be done there and of course working on that and in terms of the country where you were there I could dear come from you've come you started six months to way to start yeah well the founders of layer also the original founders of mobile along the Amsterdam and before that we were all just working in beer companies we have a very diverse background in fmcg immobile we need to Nettie retail in media and whatever we met each other well organized mobile on the Amsterdam it quickly became one of the most active champion chapters of mobile network worldwide yeah and because we were so successful we decided to set up a company together no spark so you met everyone organizing this event you can all get on really well yeah you have different skills your maybe i will put your actual personal background I commits early a civil engineer so I'm designing and building bridges and dams and dikes yeah and so now I built British between a different media cool see you guys also saw this in if you have worked together and buy this get on so well that's exactly so yeah the very diverse backgrounds just came to get in and with mobile monday we met so many people and we realized that that us working together create a spark they are basically this would be a fact so there's a lot of stuff worship and so we said why don't we set up a company together and spark the mobile industry and create a little fire make sure that people will see the potential mobile and and start doing something from mobile we did a three and a half we did a lot of evangelizing we helped big companies with the mobile strategies we developed a fantastic mobile application for dutch NOS which is basically of dutch babies at this point at this point let us build the layer application or religious workers consultant helping businesses yes yeah so helping other companies and being paid be paid because if we did a good job there but we realized that it took so much energy from us to evangelize all the times you come on guys do something on mobile we had so many great ideas with all the place I said well why don't we start building and something of our own and we has five IDs early last year early two thousand nine and one of these IDs was layer and basically said to some companies while we're going to build this layer platform and why don't you have one why don't you join us and the five companies big and analysis said yeah cool I see the potential so I mean that's when we started built layer basically so so what sort of companies are these what I had to take it involved they were from that which is the biggest real estate size in the Netherlands there were house which is basically Facebook of the Netherlands they were temple team which is a temp agency there univ ii which is a health care insurance they are company and fifth one on my return video is an OG bank which a layer with displaying items yeah so you just talk to those collars and they were paying you to do it or yeah just said we're going to do one global project you're going to pay us we're going to like it yeah well we said we're going to do a Dutch and I just version first and well they basically paid for present on there and that's when we had enough money to do it that's great you got you funded your company by getting your clients to pay exams that's a renown oh I'm sorry guys I think that I don't think that's a bad model now it's a model that I I know people have used before in software houses where they will build something for flying say well we like this so much will happen to come to France what we like this so much that we're going to license it we're going to lie to you in a license you look at you two lines themselves to resettable to do other stuff for them exactly in this case you've pre-planned that from the outset to do that which is very yes it proved to be very available at that time of me we launched lair first in debt to Marcus ility I need to do these local Lords you saw that we would first expand to Germany into the UK maybe later to the US but within 48 hours after the Dutch Jewish on the sixteenth of to never forget the day I guess but we were featuring on all the blogs and all the news page we read ourselves for her own inspiration and at this party later at this place that you have set that you set out to be a platform or you just well this is exactly what after two days and we went to Barcelona it was a mobile to Puerto company at a conference and we went there at the three of us together and the death moment when were Barcelona and we realized what had happened in the past two days that we were we would have to open up the platform with an API and open it up for everybody and to go global really quickly so you haven't planned initially to make it at platforms that just you were going to do the product for everyone so you can cash fitness because of all the attention you know from people talking about it what I've right yeah here's the opportunity everyone's talking about it let's make a product that's exactly how it went yeah and this won't be hiring or CTO and so he helped us to develop the API and the open platform and within two months we launched the API in a global platform and and we also immediately from the start from the from the Dutch start we got a lot of attention from from from developers can I please also drizzle there and mid July we indicated to developers that we were going to open up with an API and that we would have 50 keys available well we get 200 key requests within a few weeks so we we gave away the first I think 90 keys to developer so on over 17 we launched with almost 90 layers there immediately globally and that was the start of real big increase in the attention in layers being developed yeah now was still with layer version tulare coils and it was very they were still most very basically it's just displaying p wise the extra mounted so they were very much about worries and where can I find Boris ATMs houses for sale and of course display more information about the hospital it was really it was very functional yeah and in December we launched the next version of layered every three which also included three dimensional abilities so we've gone from something which is really basically just shows here's couple of points to now some foolish renders 3d graphics exact through your mobile phone through the phone GPS the my compass and so that i can see stuff that is not there but is there but in a different form epson i think the example you gave of the building that's coming up and understand was great yes it is it's absolutely amazing and delays which are currently being developed i can tell you what's been developed because people were to keep it secret but there are layers being developed for for all tubes which have fallen to ruins and they will be reconstructed in 3d in layers so you will be able to walk through history yeah see how it used to look like and also there are a lot of real estate companies using it to show people how their future how was were even their whole neighborhood will look like yep looking around you through through layers so job is your plan here just to keep making layer better and more features more functionality that people want yes so we're going to see more 3d in mobile interaction absolutely we will improve the tools and we will improve the experience we will improve discoverability and aunt is what you will see of course is that at a certain moment in time it will be necessary to have more accuracy and head currently we were we're still bound to GPS accuracy when you're indoors then it won't it won't work but I mean pieces of the coming years of course but there is a lot we have a very big plans big ambitious and you will see over the course of the year or years what we're up to but basically what we find very important right now is to build distribution yeah so they already comes pre-installed yes this is an interest is another point I'm saying you guys a very short amount of time I've managed to get yourself distributed as a platform on network and quality networks how did you get that at me was that from your network from when you started on Mondays yeah how did you get into those companies because it's the toughening had the thing that every out there personally wants to build an app is you know if the network reinstalls it's like yeah absolutely I mean for us it was also amazing that are made with the launch in August we were already came preinstalled something out subsequently announced so you already created through now you're already pre-installed on samsung phones in them yes is that with the operator is that with so please Samson yeah okay with the art point or hardware manufacturer show and they're really eager well coming back to how did it happen well and we were apparently very much connected all of us from our own backgrounds but also from all the one day we of course the we have invited all these great speakers we tummy out and which also speaker this again we knew a long time from Monday and he knows a lot a lot of people and drove them adult and a lot of eventually we knew and they were helping to a degree ballads and we knew a lot of the bloggers from there and a big blocks of HIV to get more attention sentro shop it helps see you had your video Prevot Kevin time I work yeah when we did realize that so powerful it was it appear to be me helping us a lot in building and building awareness basically yeah yes and the audience and absolutely and of course I mean well we have we've been thinking about the subject for a long time I mean I recently looked back presentation which I gave three years ago ready and it said okay mobile QR codes and next thing will be materiality and and was never thinking that I would be doing this myself but of course we're ready for years we've been reading about it and talking about it very last year in January one of my paragraph I was marked and he and he read a blog post about the augmented reality hype cycle indicating that augment adversity would become a big hype in 2009 in 2010 and then go down there often you never realized either that we were going to drive there will be one of the drivers of the hype and so there was variation perhaps the conversation go when you go and sit down in front of Samsung and say hey we want our happens we're not cure and say we want our app on your hat ready into that same to you Wow yeah yeah if we are in a very luxury position and we do realize that we have great potential and people ask us all if it has gone wrong what would have happened then it's probably us who made mistakes then or took the wrong decision because everything is available right now to make this something really big so it's really up to us to keep the base to hire the right people you can keep you getting for the rider absolutely to really focus on the right things and being very sure about what we're going to do that keeping me very open I mean we have our sensors all the time up and we try to to to listen in to everything which is happening and we read all the blog to read all the user comments and have a meal to be extremely aware of what's happening around them and what should be done and keeping our feet on the ground of course it's it has been an amazing ride last and an all the attention but lucky you all get used to it and it's fine and and we tried to keep it a little bit low and just focus from this focus how do you just do the tooth or two questions may be home for this is so the business side of the businesses how do you so the two things that I want to know is how do you how do if I want to make a letter how do I make what's the incentive for me to make four layers beyond the sort of just beyond the brand but just as an independent person why how does that make me money and also how do you guys make money for operators is you know these agencies a voice of the pricing of course and I can't tell you much in detail about it but you can't imagine that people at certain moment I'm will be prepared to pay for interesting layer experiences yeah and we working that's so wonderful has one point or another you may have some sort of marketplace I mean so that people who put up layers and the same way the app store does people might be able to buy stuff and in terms of your you guys how do you make my now today you fund it or have you yep we're venture bet okay which gives us a lot of yo say how much you raise it or not we wanna communicate that's quite sure what we do ever finish this whole round ok cool when did you arrive finish soon ok so happening still talk using I'm talking about the big success ok it was great and then what's the yes what's the visual is was was it going man what we see from you tomorrow me you going worldwide we're going to see what every like I phone nokia yeah that's where there's already i make iphone okay temporarily out of the episode we pull our about as also some people and some blog posts suggested that iphone or that apple took out the app that's not true we did it ourselves because we found that it was not working properly and there were too many reports of crashing grab for eighty percent more Egyptian people work in just five but we wanted to have an absolute maximum fantastic use Excel and we will be back soon completely redesigned that we're working on symbian version version as well so that's what we're working on my casa distribution and building the platform for for all developers goal was to make sure that they have all the tools in hands and that we make it easier and more accessible to them or even easier to create a fantastic layer and to facilitate the ecosystem to come together no I can also explain today my story good augmented reality experiences require more than just technical skills it really requires a great concept great vision of how people will interact with digital objects and you need you need good desires you need fantastic 3d 3d mothers who are so capable of designing model which is suitable for a mobile phone I mean that's nice that's not a question I earlier which is how do i if I want to make a day and now so I sit open on my laptop so i have to learn to take the programming language or do you guys have some sort of tool that i can use to make that or yeah lots of different tools that fill that out of here and just on that same point if there are lots of different ways to do it you guys allowing anyone who makes software tools like adobe dreamweaver time self you allowing them to build tools to help people just build it into your low whatever languages that you guys Rock yeah all we have a basic to to develop a layer you need just web development skills yes and we have an API and you need to program in web service which make sure that your content is able to talk to our API yeah it's the only thing you need to do and are there any other another a facilitator applications so yes they say if I'm in a final I find I'm going to develop a bit like the best thing that I love about tools online now the things that are happening is that companies on you can build the cool API and the people can other people can I mean people can use you as a market so they can create software that will allow me sir george they make some money off there yeah exactly like this funny that's what's happening that's exactly what happen already five companies at least have you dealt and easy their development tools they make it even easier for their content owner created to develop their layers so they're a toy servers etc and so that's happening and we only stimulate that and we will also provide more tools for them to be more successful yeah right Matt exactly so so dope you will see an array of different different layer services and also different layer quality levels and they will rage at a certain moment in time from we very skilled very beautiful layers being developed by fantastic programmers together with big teams of of creators and 3d modelers and etc to quest and layers which have been developed by x feeling and a foul into a layer api server and then make it a nice lobo nice I Canton but it's which is very useful for let's say your group of friends and say I would create live for the local football team indicating where it's nice to go which bars are nice to visit and which vegetables are nice to go to after the after the match for top yeah and it says a local boundary and it's it's your local goal which is fantastic and yet so there will be there will be a long tail of assembly this is a thing that I've perhaps this is because it's quite a new thing I'm alleged reality I are you or are there any plans or any ideas to take the advantage of reality that we have on our mobiles online to the web so that I don't necessarily have to be online the way to view my Oakland you know to be my layers stuff is that aura like completely going crazy well now of course that ever imagine that moment it feels is really about your reality here and now and it's about what you in which context you are and so that's one thing and also you need a tool to be able to look around so if your laptop has a compass which enables you to you know to experience the world around you then then then it's fine it is fun we're not planning to take it to rep at least on a short term of course any relevant platform and all we see is the next step let's say two years time workshop will be the goggles the end as soon as you don't have to roll up your phone anymore as an interface oh such as head up head up display yeah first and then you can walk through your own reality all day and you can be plain whatever world of warcraft all day because it's just around you did you see behind your desk about your pc any of ever see tweets telecoms hedge is relevant whatever you like whenever you feel we're when you know walking through your disneyland all day yeah provided to you by DZ thank you yeah perfect excellent thank you very much thank you
