 hello and welcome to experience weekly data talk a show featuring some of the smartest people working in data science today were excited to feature Deborah O'Neill who's a partner with Oliver Wyman labs Deborah has worked the range of clients around the world and the area located insights risk management and customer centricity today we're going to talk about the ways that companies can better leverage their internal and external data to make smarter business decisions Deborah it's an honor to have you in our chat today I apologize for all the technical difficulties there might have been some crazy cyber security restrictions on my site we obviously take privacy of data pretty seriously so I'm just glad that we finally made it work I know this is great it was so funny so for those just joining we were going through Facebook live testing all these urban things and then we finally figured out YouTube live will work for us so that's right that's right so I thought it'd be great Deborah to kick this off if you kind of share a little bit about your background what led to you to what you do today yeah sure so when I started and I'm a career consultant so far that's in the short parts of my career has I know I've got a long way to go till retirement these days but so far I've been a career consultant and I actually as anyone he would know joining a consulting firm in 2008 during the financial crisis spent a lot of time doing finance and risk so traveling around the world helping banks figure out you know their losses around all the mortgage defaults helping them figure out the new wave of regulation generally you know it was a little bit of the time and you know that was the topic of the deal so I guess my physics background gave me kind of a love for rigor and data and you know I was probably more suited to analytical consulting than I was ever going to be to blue sky thinking and actually I really found I loved it I mean you know being able to build really interesting models that allowed you to work out you know the positions of complex products on a bank trading platform it's really cool but what I realized was I'm a little bit of a stickler for wanting things to be right and accurate I very much ended up in the world of spending a lot of time with IT departments looking at data and models and sort of going okay how do we actually get these decisions embedded into the organizations so I actually became a little bit more of a change manager and as I got more senior and still very much in the data legacy but in that direction and I think you know the way consulting was going there was a much more technology delivery angle to it and then I guess over the last three or four years I've landed myself in our labs practice which is the technology enablement capability for Oliver Wyman consulting so it's where you know all the great consulting work and analytics that everybody's working on really get embedded into cool tools and analytics platforms that actually live and breathe in these organizations so it's nice to move into a world where it's sustainable and I think you know the new world were in of open-source technology and all these platforms is really allowing that world to become very vivid and quite real for everybody so it's a cool place to be it's a lot of fun a lot of traveling still I am definitely you know in that up in the air kind of category of living on a plane and out of a suitcase but it's exciting times I think it's a great time to be in consulting hank is a great time to be working in technology and financial services I think we're at a turning point so M yeah that's me in a nutshell yeah I mean it's awesome to hear and what's interesting deborah is as i've talked and talked to different data scientists like hearing like how their career has progressed and you're just mentioning how your background was in physics and how that eventually lets you into working on models and we're going algorithm so is this fascinating to hear you know how your career has progressed in data science yeah well I mean it's really I mean for me what's really interesting about it is if I was honest when I was leaving University I always thought I was the non heavy lifting side of physics right I I enjoyed physics as a concept but I was much more I guess on the practical end I wanted to be getting something landed I actually bizarrely at the time loved project management more than I loved maths and things like that I was very much a let's get stuff done so Consulting's being that really happy medium there for people who really like numbers and models but while to be doing something that's perhaps a little bit more sort of has an end in sight it's not you know research that can go on for years I think you know date epochs you know Big Data computer science machine learning all of these topics you know career like consulting is a great place to do them yeah and those are definitely fields are hot right now I just saw a chart of Google Trends people searching for things like data science artificial intelligence machine learning and we're now seeing machine learning as like one of those keywords it's now surpassing Big Data for a long time big data was like the big buzzword and now machine learning is now like overtaking search queries for big data you know I think it's really interesting right because I think big data for a long time I don't think people really understood what big gage it was it was a great buzz term but actually most people's data's not big in the real academic sense of what big data is but machine learning is really applicable in any field it doesn't matter how big in inverted commas your data is and I think that's the realization I mean I still find very few institutions that are really working the realms of the big data as you know purists would call it so how would you define big data because it is a buzzword people do throw it around a lot I'm kind of curious like how do you define it coming from academia now what you're doing out um so I mean it's a big data for me I think I I think there used to be a lot of theory that it was about size and volume for me big data is more of a complexity question is it you know different types of data that need to be stitched together and used in a coherent manner that being you know is it text you know speech-to-text data is it unstructured data is it fast stream data from trading platforms you know is it static customer data that to me is sort of the realms of what I would more call complex data and big data and and actually the bit I'm most interested in is this sort of how you use that to make decisions I think you know it doesn't matter how much data you've got there's interesting things you can do with it and there's a richness it that if you apply the right techniques and that doesn't always mean jumping to the most complex techniques in the world it's more about you know getting things in a sensible manner to get that value outside is the most important way I would look at big data and I think like you just mention like I think one of the difficulties that a lot of businesses have and all of us have is dealing with that unstructured data because there's so much of it I think I read a statistic that 80% of incoming data is now unstructured because we have text we have video obviously we have so much unstructured data that's out there we're trying to interpret it try to make it make sense of it what has you advise clients with the amount of unstructured data that they have what do you suggest to them so I mean I think it depends where they are in the journey right you know I think there's a lot of organizations out there that are very tempted to jump to the most sophisticated level of we should use all of our and structure data we should get an AI platform we should you know have chat BOTS we should be you know automating this and automating that you know a lot of the time they've been caught by the buzzword or they're scared of if they've not got a blockchain project then they'll be you know not cool in their group of you know peers actually a lot of this work that I do is around just dialing that back a little bit and saying what are the decisions you actually need to make what is it that's difficult today so that could be an example of you know a wealth and asset management firm who you know they're still very client focused right they're still having one-on-one discussions around trading and positions it's still a relationship based and business so shoving a chatbot in giving advice is not the right thing to be doing but equally they're not you know there is a theory that they could be using AI to generate really good insights around if you know if the market moves in one direction what does that mean for their consumers trades should they be hedging something should they be making a different decision which i think is right but to get to that point you need to move away from the world that they're currently in which is you know 75 80 percent of their time could be spent manually going through different data sources to find the thing they want to talk to their clients about and naturally at this point you're talking about sort of process digitalization how do you get that single view of a customer just from the basic data you've got you know can you even pull up their latest positions their latest contact details have you even got a view of how they change jobs via LinkedIn you know can you even get that single view and then you can start you know layering on me let's do some AI around and you know what their next position should be that they should you know and you know place can you you know actually eventually outsource some of the advice to a robo advisor because actually sometimes it's more time-consuming for a client to ring up and ask you a question they may actually like the idea of getting self said but it's such a spectrum journey and what I see so often is you know arriving in a client and they say ah we've just procured this platform and that it's that they're just not ready for it you know they haven't got the skills to even maintain it once the projects over they haven't got their data actually even complete or accurate so anything they turn out they won't be able to rely on and they've just got a basic process issue you know at the start of this journey that they just need to understand the decisions they're making and why they need to make them so you know it fairly depends on where they are on that spectrum when you walk in the room but sometimes you do have to dial back the buzzwords a little bit to really get to where is the you know kernel of value number as you're talking with these different companies around the world as so many of them are wanting to start to use artificial intelligence and machine learning but like you said many organizations aren't ready for it because they're not even using data analytics correctly in their own organization what are some of the questions you're asking them to kind of figure out where they are in the journey before you begin advising them on what AI tools they should be using so it's usually around you know what are the key value drives in your business where do you actually make money is it on pricing is it on you know cross sell is it on you know not churning customers you know sometimes just retaining the customers you've got is value in itself you know particularly in this competitive world of you know startups and fintechs you are all coming in to threaten the playing space that banks have traditionally dominated and once you can identify that can value driver you can then start saying okay what does that process look like in your organization how do you address that value driver is it that you're in a great position where do you know what you've got a view of all the interactions your customers has with your organization and you can you're already looking at where there were points of failure and making sure you address those both from an ongoing process but maybe having that client on a better watch list to make sure they don't feel that again if they're saying to me well you know we look at KPIs on a quarterly basis if you know and you'll have all been through an airport where you see their red amber green or doing on delays it's like that but you know if they're at that point then churn is a big issue right because it doesn't matter whether 90 percent of the flights were left on time but you've every week and you're on the 10% that we're always late your return risk but they don't know that because they're looking at that overall number so it's trying to assess what data they're using and how they're using it and what they do with it to really understand how sophisticated they are yeah that's fascinating I I think that um because companies have that a combination of first of all they have all this internal data right data that they're collected from their clients but then there's also that external data it may be he did it that they're purchasing and then to your point like how are they leveraging it right now where where are they in that journey and then from then at that point you're going to figure out okay are they ready to begin adopting some AI technologies I think one of the difficulties we've all heard that saying about garbage in garbage out when it comes to data and really the art of data science you don't have the right data you might have a ton of data if you're not looking at the right data or finding the right data it's not going to be providing you much help so I'm kind of curious about what advice do you have for brands for companies that want to use AI effectively don't want to be finding the right data but maybe not sure like where to look for it yeah so it's two things for me so there's a bit I think increasingly and we're seeing more people focus on data strategy as an actual strategic goal right I mean previously you would have your brand strategy and your product strategy data strategy is a real thing now you know how you measure your data quality how can you actually certify a piece of data as being suitable to make decisions on so we're talking to a lot of people around what are those measures you know a great example would be if you are trying to use AI to make credit decisions so you're trying to decide whether to lend someone some money so you run your algorithm and one of the big factors in there is clearly someone's publicly or you know credit bureaus score you know what is their credit rating score now it doesn't take much for that missed app data to not refresh on a frequent basis because you know maybe the batch file that came in from the credit bureau was was corrupted or you didn't actually update the system and suddenly your algorithms telling you this person's are really great and credit bet and then you look up the score and it says you know they're an A rated or a 600 or whatever number and then you drill into that and you realize that's you know two years out of date a lot can change to smaller edit score in two years so before you know the algorithms can run very effectively but before we get there the strategy around what are the KPIs what are the reliance people can put on that data and that might be from timeliness accuracy certainty you know we see a lot of models now where people are using external data sources to triangulate so if you're trying to triangulate someone's credit score from their transaction data you may not have all their transaction data they may have multiple bank accounts from their credit history that's great but if they've moved house and not link their address that can take a while to catch up with you so setting these measures so that when your data science team or the team that are using analytics to make decisions they actually have something that says this is an Amber field you know it's only 75 percent reliable so if it's coming up as a very high factor in your model treat with caution and that strategy you know is a strategy that has to be rolled out across an organization because often you find data repeated in multiple systems which is the right data who is the person who makes that decision and you know that that links a lot to you know how do you govern your analytics teams do you have a centralized analytics team in your organization that churn all the analytics for the entire organization do you have analytics embedded in each of your business unit so each business unit has their own you know dedicated team that will be smaller but more linked with the business goals you know there's different answers for different organizations but it's a real choice now it's a strategy it can't just happen by accident because otherwise these algorithms work so fast as you all know they churn out results they're not necessarily easy to understand once you get into the deep neuron that's actually explaining the reasoning for that becomes difficult so you know it has to be a deliberate choice the way you go you don't have that case to have time to catch mistakes before big things are done yeah and it reminds me of something you wrote in a in a recent Harvard Business Review article about data analytics and people working in analytics sometimes have halves blind spots he talked a little bit about those blind spots yeah so it comes in two flavors right one can be you know people get a little bit too attached to what's happened in the past you know your data is historic data for a reason and the algorithm can be you know faultless in terms of its determination but you need to you need to still have we're not you know my view is AI doesn't risk people's jobs I think there's more opportunity for people to spend time actually thinking and making decisions rather than having to do manual stuff it should be seen as a bonus not a sort of threat and you know you still need humans to be able to overlay what the Machine doesn't know so a great example that you know I've seen a lot is people drawing sort of conclusions about what may happen in the future and making decisions of it so let's take an example if you were the buyer for a supermarket and you know you're in charge of stocking stocking products for special events in that area so you may have have been you may be looking at a supermarket which for the last 10 years they've always sold a lot of beer on one particular weekend right they've got a lot of people buying beer so seems like a sensible idea there you know go and put more beer in for that weekend it's you know a trend that you're seeing you know everyone's gonna buy beer but actually what you end up doing is if you drill in and you actually you know sense check it you find out that the reason that that beer sale was really popular is there was a local event or festival around the corner right you know and guess what the festivals happening this shoe so you know it's also copy you know especially in Europe where festivals happen in rural areas if you then buy all the beer without thinking about it you've suddenly got a rural supermarket with a load of expensive beer because you know there's an expensive product with lots but they've had to forego their regular groceries to make space for it and suddenly your local you know your local residents who use your shop every day are pretty fed up they haven't got any milk or bread or anything else and so you have these direct mental FETs which if you overlaid the human touch of let me just go and double-check you know that that events data field is up-to-date or you know have I read and checked whether that's still happening you catch those things so you know the data can make you quite blind you know that's why you don't want to complete robot just try using all the buying for all the supermarket's with no overlay of checking silly outcome that reminds me I don't know if you heard the story but Walmart was looking at the purchases of those strawberry pop-tarts and notice like that dramatic increase in sales in Florida but it was because of hurricane season and for some stressful weather conditions people were buying in bulk strawberry pop-tarts well you also hear the stories about and items for sale online right where the to that you know the air to buyers match the prices you know I want to be 95 percent cheap with the price of the other one the other one says actually we're out of stock so let's rack the price up to 120 percent of the other one and you get this great outcome where they just wrapped you to each other up to like you know you know you see that I saw a great blog where someone had ended up tracking this and you know some book had got to a million dollars or something you know you say you know the date it can make you blind because you know although histories are great help and let's not underestimate it right there are a lot of day-to-day things and habits especially tracking habits of people because people don't understand their own habits so checking buying habits particularly look a global population right if you're looking for chen's that noise disappears if you're making big decisions for individual you know individual supermarkets or individual places you've got to be a little bit more careful and that was what we were getting at with dates can make you blind yeah I mean not only can data make you buy but also for those of us who have gut instincts or certain biases that we might not even be aware of that can also mislead us can you talk a little bit about those so I think I this is always a tricky one because actually especially if you're working in a specialist area like trading or relationship management for wealth and asset and guts quite important right like the last thing you want to do is tell everyone that they're not allowed to have a gut instinct and it you know having a relationship manager that's known you for 25 years is still gonna be the best general feeling of how you're gonna react to something but there's lots of ways that you know I've seen organizations deal with this fire and some work you know around making things more suggestions let's let's you know give people suggestions of things they may want to talk to their clients about so you're not telling them they have to do something you're not doing sensitizing them to say you must do this you still give them the override of Noah I really believe but you surface the information in a way that's interesting to them maybe not the way they've seen it before and we'll just give them that feeling of other something there and enough backup information for them to challenge their gut to say I hadn't liked to see it that way that makes sense that's one way and then the other way is around the statistical tools that you put into your data science team I think there's a real importance that or a real fear for me that in some organizations where they're still getting to grips with data science it's still a little bit experimental right each individual data scientist will have their favorite statistical test that they like to run you know their favorite sample tests and and just standardizing those a little bit not necessary taking away the creativity but saying you must have at least on these four or five things because then it means everyone in the organization knows those things and then they understand the metrics they're getting around you know K mean or anything else is something that's standardized enough for them to have that conversation and a lot of it comes again to governance and the desire to change so you know leaders have to also be willing in these organizations to admit they're wrong and the data say something you so having that leading from the top of we've had two organizations who do be interesting data thing I found this week so you know they send an email as the top of the house and say I didn't know this about the organization this week this is what the day to help me and it can drive that feeling if I don't have to pretend I'm the expert and that the data can't possibly know more than me there's lots of little tips and tricks but it does have to want to be led from the top I think it's quite important that the whole organization believes in this because otherwise people can feel quite victimized if they're the person who's brave to say I'm gonna try something different because I think that's what the data says never I never thought about what you just said about even choosing a particular statistical model could be have a could be a bias and you're talking about standardizing I never thought about that yeah but you know cuz I mean we all do it right I mean you know even in the old days of doing stuff in Excel you know when I was looking at work of my colleagues and things I would always go in and do the same three cuz you know the few keystrokes you like if let me sum that color and let me divide it by that and you know all the things that you just you know your natural reactions to how you test that and and that can be quite dangerous in itself and I you know we're all guilty of it you know let me go and pick up my three pieces of core code that I always run you know yeah yeah that's wipe it with you so important right that's why you know we should all work in a world of you know being open and sharing things but again that's a cultural change but open source is helping that I think it's a real positive step forwards you mentioned blockchain a minute ago and you know many many financial companies are investing in FinTech I was reading about City Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Morgan Stanley Wells Fargo they're all have huge investments into blockchain and I'm kind of curious about your perspective on how important thin tech investments are for financial firms and any advice you have yeah so I think I think FinTech you know has a place in this world I think innovation is generally really really important and I think we'd all you know agree that that's why we're making so many strides forward I do think there a great opportunity for firms to get access to new technologies trying new things in a way that's a little it quicker a little bit less cumbersome than trying to start something you know internally it's also you know lower risk you can try a POC of proof-of-concept you can you know have a goat in see how it fits however I do think you know you still have to go back to the basics I keep saying it you know you need to focus on a problem what are you actually trying to solve and find solutions that might help that not just get dragged along and it's the hot new thing because I'm fortunate a hot new thing changes relatively regularly and actually it can be quite draining for the organization because you you need to see something through not let's say to the end of it's the wrong thing you need to have the you know you know they know fear of failure but you do need to give it a chance you know everything has a little bit of a realization cycle it's not overnight so just you know always step back and say what are we solving for I'm saying we must need a blockchain program I mean to me it's exciting to see this because especially in these really highly regulated industries like financial firms oftentimes those are the ones that are most slowest to adopt newest technology is because of regulation and compliance right so do you think that these adoptions of blockchain and AI are gonna force a lot of these financial firms or just companies that are highly regulated to be more nimble so I think there's a few things going on right I mean it's an interesting time in financial services as it has been for the last 10 years but you know I think you know there is obviously a lot of use cases now where the value of AI and machine learning particularly are being seen as important so you know fraud detection being able to you know very quickly scan a lot of data so does this look like an outlier actually a lot of stuff around customer complaints customer service can you predict churn because you can see you know all the interactions someone's had across all the different channels that you operate in also people who've churned liked them so I think they're seeing a lot of value in this so I think you know there is a risk to them not moving into this space then you know someone gets their first they but they do at the moment and it's gonna be a fleeting moment still have an advantage right if they can get this stuff and running they have a lot of data they have the history you know some these banks are a hundred years old not saying they're gonna get a hundred years with the data because it's probably in the bin somewhere or difficulty more than you know some of the thin tax and things or you know the startup banks and all those things but that that is changing as well and that is a real risk so particularly in the EU we've got and the general data protection regulation GDP are coming around the horizon and that's gonna put a lot of power in the consumer hands right I mean GDP are requires one that you have the right to be forgotten which means you can bring your bank or your supermarket who you might have Apple oil to come with and you say I want you to forget me and that doesn't mean just delete my customer stuff I want you to go get rid of all my purchasing information and I want you to get rid of any product I've applied from being declined for you know all their credit rating history you have to be able to delete the lot and but the other thing it gives you is them the right to take your data with you which is a really interesting concept so if you as an organization let me down and I decide not only do I not want you to have my data email but I want you to give me all my information so I want you to tell me give me your information I can then take that to another organization who have got better customer service better personalization better product mix and give it all to them and suddenly they getting data that's really valuable but I'm happy to give them because they're giving me a service I want and you can imagine what the dynamic of the arms race around this is gonna be you know you know you've got supermarkets suddenly swapping you know people's buying histories that's interesting in itself you've got you know if I've got an insurance policy with one organization and I want all my claims history to go somewhere I mean it's a really it's gonna be an exciting year when this comes in and the fines are not insignificant either so I I do see that banks are gonna be getting and going on that and by the way GDP are is you could have a whole talk on that I mean it's fascinating in its own right as far as fascinating as regulation can be to some people but you know it is a risk and I think they are waking up to it and but you know is it too little too late let's wait and see but I think the fintechs have a place to play in helping them out yeah and what you just said I give you more power to the consumer what's going to be interesting to see is how are these financial companies going to react are they going to start treating or be more personal personable with their customers are they gonna be quicker to respond by phone calls maybe they'll be interesting to see how things change research well me and some police did some research earlier in the year about and did we called it digital families and it was really around in the UK we did a big survey around and people's relationships with data and technology in general so we asked them things about how long could they go without their smartphone how did they feel about banks looking after their data how did they feel about the government how did they feel about all these different things you know how did they did they feel technology was giving them an advantage in life or were they feeling left behind and we actually when we analyzed all this information and we actually got six sort of groups or digital families as we called them and that's quite an interesting consumer story as well because it it's not just everyone wants personalised service actually some people want to be you know private actually it would be very upset if you started pushing them geolocation messages because they'd be like wait a minute that's none of your business where I am and some of the some of the commentary around this was people were almost saying I'm willing to go off the grid to protect my data so I think people's digital strategies are gonna have to get more nuanced as well because I think everyone's been going we must get more digital we must get more online you know we've got to get every one customer personalization and actually it depends who your customer base is if you are a you know mom and dad you know organization who's got a long history and being just safe maybe your digital strategy needs to be much more toned down and a little bit more it's there if you want it but we're not going to push it at you whereas you know obviously a more big technology company or something that's appealing to the young generation who has stuck to their phones at all time actually they probably would like you to push them deals but you're gonna have to really understand your mix quite carefully to just not you know completely miss your customer base and it comes to diversity in teams right I mean let's face it the news has been full of lack of diversity on every angle possibly the diverse Sun but you see it right these disastrous product launches where you can tell that they just didn't have the diverse people in the team of that we're developing it because they've just missed the angle and you know we've seen it in adverts we've seen it in product launches so you know diversity in your team to reflect the diversity of the people you're dealing with I think is a really important topic as well I think that's really smart I'm kind of curious with that study that you did where you identify these different personas of digital families did you find that the differences were more about the generations like older generations or more fearful or not not approving of people being targeted versus Millennials and Gen Y actually so that's what I see you know I think any person would go in with that assumption yeah I mean there was a little bit of bias towards that but actually it was much more across the demographic than I expected around age and there's you know because there's an interesting flipside of there's a and it was there was an interesting gender split as well around some people that are feeling like they are less advantaged if they're young now because technology is threatening them and and the skills they're required to have they haven't been given and they also were people who felt that we had a family that just were like they just said that you know is the Left behinds basically it wasn't that they were fearful of data and technology they just didn't know how to get involved and that group was a very cross the age group you know it wasn't old it wasn't young it was just a whole cross-section who said actually I'm a bit nervous that my opportunities have diminished because of technology which I think's a interesting social conversation on many levels well Deborah it's been a blast talking with you today I want to thank you so much for hanging out with us again I apologize for the technical difficulties earlier before we go you want to share any kind of last-minute tips or businesses that want to better utilize our data before before leveraging machine learning yeah so I think it's quite simple right make sure you've got a clear decision or problem you're trying to solve understand insights you actually need to answer that problem and make sure you've got your manual processes really cleaned up so you're not wasting time on the basics because once you've got that sort of cleaner your people will have more time to think and play around with the more interesting machine learning and AI insights if you sort of use that and you do some quick iteration cycles test the fail learn move on I think you know it's a good place to start wonderful debora where can everyone learn more about you and find you online so I have a Twitter account Deborah lab CW and also and on the lat Oliver wine and labs page we've got some interesting insights the digital family's stuff is on there you could take a quiz and see which family um most associate with and but equally you know reach out to me on Twitter happy to answer any questions wonderful and for those who are watching live I'll be having the links to Deborah's Twitter account as well as the links to Oliver Wyman labs in the About section of this YouTube video also on Facebook and Deborah again thank you so much for being our guest today and looking forward to keeping in touch and thank you so much for sharing your insights with our community I love it it's been an absolute blast thank you so much for having me and yes definitely might speak again soon great thanks Deborah take care
