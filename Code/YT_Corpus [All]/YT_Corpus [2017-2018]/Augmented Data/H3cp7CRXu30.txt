 I think augmented reality has a lot of potential in the kind of surgicals, for example. If you walk into a current OR, you will see there's a lot of consoles around, there to look to our test screen and then do operations on the patient and then look back and forth. Imagine if you can project information on top of the patient or say on a virtual wall without having all this big screens so that's I think something that's very exciting. On the surface, they depend on large computer graphics and visualization but in fact, it is much more than that. It is a convergence of artificial intelligence, image analysis, computer graphics, of course, and immersive communication.
