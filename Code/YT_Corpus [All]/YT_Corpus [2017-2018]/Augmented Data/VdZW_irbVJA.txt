 I’m making an Augmented Reality App to visualize Data where the Data are inside the Real World “small, medium or Big” Data will be visualize inside Real World with a 3D Data Diagram An unconventional way to explore the Data that aren’t simply on the screen but the screen is the Real World the BIGgest screen where you can watch the Data and where you can interacts with them In this demo there’s only a first level and the Data are represented by 3D Bubble Diagram In the future version, the user may explode the bubbles to explore aggregated Data The App (for iPhone/iPad and Android devices ) uses Web Services to dynamically load Data Moving the head, the user can see the Data localized ins ide the Real World
