 When we talk about blockchain we often hear that the topic is hyped and has not arrived in reality yet. I think it has already arrived in reality. Take a look for example at Estonia, where e-government is already based on a blockchain. You can for example organise elections there via the Blockchain or set up a company with it. From my point of view, however, many of the known applications are literally pressed into a blockchain. In my view, a blockchain only makes sense if it can actually leverage the added value of decentralized storage or validation of participants within a network. Yes absolutely, I agree with you. In addition, the Blockchain has of course the added value of time and cost savings. This also explains the numerous test projects and pilot projects that are currently being carried out in connection with Blockchain. Not only in Estonia, the subject of e-government but also in the area of digital currencies or in the area of trade and financial system or also in Sweden with the project land register on blockchain basis, which is coupled there additionally with Smart Contracts, so that a further increase in efficiency occurs. In any case, we could have an exciting future ahead of us. Yes, definitely. "Blockchain - Hype or Reality?"
