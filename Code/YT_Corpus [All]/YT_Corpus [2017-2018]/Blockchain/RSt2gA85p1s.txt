 The Blockchain Insurance Industry Initiative B3i is a group of companies that came together to exchange ideas and see how we can make use of blockchain for the better of our clients and our industry. It started about half year ago and we're now about to start together the development of a first prototype or proof of concept. Results we expect in about half a year from now. We joined the B3i initiative as one of the founding members, not to just be part of the hype, rather because we realized there was a fascinating correlation between things we struggle with in our industry, it mainly is the way we exchange data with our clients, and what this technology maybe able to do. Therefore, we quickly realized, we better do this together. It doesn't make much sense to do a mutual distributed ledger on your own. We also realized we need to establish standards of how we exchange data with each other. That really has been very efficient to do that in this consortium.
