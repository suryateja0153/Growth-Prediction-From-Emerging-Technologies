 hi guys welcome back to the crypto corner as we've already talked about in many of our other videos there are a lot of different areas of application for the blockchain technology and new ones are explored constantly one of those is for example of film industry there's many reasons why the blockchain technology and the film industry can work really well together especially when it comes to things like streaming services and property rights issues that could be possibly solved with the blockchain technology so in today's video we're going to talk about an example of where those two things come together and make something great the Pips circus movie is a project put on by a swiss company called a movie venture to do so this company set up an ICO where they're sold a movie venture tokens in order to raise capital for their production what sets this movie apart from other productions is that it was completely funded with cryptocurrencies in exchange for the contributions investors received these tokens as well as voting rights for future projects that the company is going to be doing the movie itself is set in Australia and follows a quirky circus family called the pits as they travel around the country and put on performances the official movie premiere was on the 14th of November in Hollywood and despite its very young age this movie has already received various accolades from film festivals such as the Amsterdam around films International Festival where it won an award for the best experimental film as well as the LA Independent Film Festival where it won awards for the best produce the feature and the Best Director feature it seems that this combination of film industry and blockchain technology is very appealing to audiences as it has never been done before and is already so successful for this video we have been given the opportunity to interview the director Tony Khurana on his movie project so Tony how do you feel about this being the world premiere of the very first movie that has been funded with aetherium and that's already so successful so in terms of feeling I'm I'm super excited and not my wrists but you know excited looking forward to this very much and and it's like no nothing but it could have happened then having the world premiere of your movie you know all of it actually and so you didn't start and plan this that's not something that you can plan basically we had a vision and you made stuff happen and there's so many people that help us in this process and and it's it's really everybody contributed and and now we can go and start the festival tour it's a big excitement and good feelings and I hope you know this this keeps on so are there any other references to the blockchain technology within the movie or was that just the way that it was funded so the kid of this family we paid he finds hard wallet we know love Kryptos on it and this wallet belongs to swiss aristocrats and they get angry understand a killer to kill this family and the mother Bronte pitch he kills the killer and tournaments allowed to say this anyway so problem solved and the family can go on on their journey and that's the Crypt our own in the story so how does the process of creating a movie such as this one differ from one that was funded through traditional means one of the reason why we chose movies is to to to enter with our approaching project this because there is like a lot of intermediaries in the process and Trust is an issue so if you can you know jump a few intermediaries create a more diverse world by using blockchain business if a community can decide on their own values and map these values on the blockchain and create a project you know autonomously independent of third parties that's a game changer and also it allows you know a more direct impact on creativity basically you don't have intermediaries interfere in your creative vision that's what happened with us basically you know you know our crazy star couldn't have gone through a studio no way but now because we managed to fund ourselves through blockchain it's possible to have blockchain community and so I guess community in Hollywood I think that's that's good thing so thanks so much a Tony for answering all of our questions this is I think a very good example of the combination of film industry and suction technology working out really well and I think that this shows that there is a lot of potential still in the blockchain technology for it to be combined with other industries that are already established improving upon them and possibly dealing with some issues that they currently face thank you so much you guys for watching today's video if you want to know more about the Pitt circus movie where we link to trailer and also the official site for it in the description box below don't forget to like our video and subscribe to our You Tube channel and come back very soon for another talk in the corner bye
