 There is a controversy brewing about the real value of digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. So the question is: are we looking at an incarnation of the Dutch tulip mania of the 17th century or are we looking at a technology that will revolutionize the concept of money? My name is Jim Connor welcome to Game Change Silicon Valley. In this segment we will discuss the emergence of digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum as well as the underlying blockchain technology. My guests are Eric Lamisel-White and Ted Lanpher, both are co-founders of the Paretal Network which is designed to provide access to information using a digital currency. Eric and Ted welcome to this show. Let me start with you Eric to give us maybe an overview of the concepts of blockchain technology. Okay, well thank you for having me on the show. Blockchain technology is primarily a ledger so it's a ledger technology where the confidence in the contents of the ledger are secured in a different way. And  this seemingly mundane tweak to an older concept, can revolutionary change the whole infrastructure built on top of it. So when you say ledger, I think of accounting and I think of spreadsheets and of course in things like Google Docs and databases we see a database that looks like a ledger correct? That essentially what this is? That is, the analogy works, there are limitations to the analogy but ultimately you can sort entries in a way you're very familiar with and a lot of services do this exact thing they're called block explorers. Let me go in the next concept of blockchain which is it's a distributed database now we met earlier and you showed me a link, a link which I'll show on the screen that showed worldwide all these computers that are part of the blockchain distributed network and there must have been..., I think there were 7000 is that right? At least, at least. And half of them have to be up, can you give us a little insight into that? Sure so the blockchain as a concept requires participants to help it propagate and the more participants are that are helping it the harder it is to alter the data in the blockchain and so it kind of turns into this amorphous entity that just keeps expanding because new computers or new participants in the network want a benefit from the blockchain network and that's usually in the form of a currency. The blockchain pays the computers that help it stay secure. And Ted let me come over to you then as I understand that the key is and I went and started to look as I signed up for Bitcoin and Ethereum, you create a wallet right, an electronic wallet to hold your currencies or hold your bitcoins I should say or whatever the currency is maybe you can give us a little explanation how many currencies are there and how do you judge which ones are good. Sure, well that and that's a great question and by the way a wallet is is just a metaphor it may be also viewed as a keychain that holds your keys or your your access codes to your currencies but today there is as of today there's almost 1200 of currencies that you can buy and sell and a year ago that was a fraction of that but these currencies are coming out every week and they do all kinds of different functionalities broadly speaking you can divide them into currencies which are a store of value or used for payments and then currencies which have other functions or uses we call them utility currencies or or better utility tokens that give the user access to some resource or they are the fuel for some protocol within networking applications so Eric you are you both are cofounders of the parental network and you as I understand now have a blockchain technology that will essentially capture information or allow information to be access and to access it someone will buy your tokens your digital currency and then pay the provider of that information it's exactly yeah so once again you see how this technology is best suited for creating a market and having market dynamics between participants to provide value what kind of information will be available well the predator network is geared towards financial information things that but financial information that can be acted on very soon and so perfetto network changes the incentive models for financial information such that sooner you can benefit the most people the greater your reward from the network will be is that because each person contributes towards your reward that's correct so aside from the contributors perspective the users of the pareto network are ranked in a leader boards and the your rating on the leader board is based on your level of activity in the network so the more for example you pay a content provider the higher in the leader board you get and this is important because the higher on the leader board you are the sooner you get newly released information can you give me an example real-world example of what kind of permission might be available probably not insider trading information but but would be something that would be viable and raised in this model the printer network is geared towards digital currencies instead of for example the securities or equities markets but one example would be a change in the supply and demand of one of these digital currencies and being able to demonstrate to someone how that changes digital currencies function very similarly to commodities in in many cases there's a fixed supply and the exchange rate is based on how useful it is to somebody at a given time and if you can reveal those changes to someone then you might have people that we want to reposition their own portfolios or try to speculate on this change in supply and demand so information about the commodities market futures market could be a viable way to go could also be very valuable and I'd like people to think of innovative use cases for the pareto network so Ted now you your company is going to roll out your tokens and your your blockchain is this all at one time you're into the end of November I believe yes well we have what's called a pre presale of our token and then in the end of November we'll have a public sale of our token what's the difference well the presale participants are given a discounted price and there are usually some minimum purchase requirements that so there's been some interesting publicity lately about Bitcoin and a theory I'm and and I do notice that there's a difference there's a split I think Korea and China have outlawed all these digital currencies across the board you have any opinion about that I do it's a very nuanced topic especially on a country-by-country basis I would say digital currencies are still very active in those countries that aren't completely outlawed regarding Europeans in front from financial leaders in legacy markets what you have is a gradient of opinions that you would see in any market and these optimistic or bearish outlooks all form the aggregate price and the aggregate opinions and it's no different I wouldn't try to point fingers at any one outspoken character right right it's just a matter of it's a brand new concept there will be some missteps probably along the way but there's gonna be great benefits also and I would add that it's it's evolving so rapidly even in for example the market cap of all the digital currencies has gone from I think it was about seven billion dollars on the January first today it's about 170 billion dollars so you've had a tremendous influx of new capital let me interrupt you you said from 7 billion to 170 billion that's correct yes what time for you well in the last nine months or so that's an amazing it's the duration jump and it's believed that there are dozens if not hundreds of new cryptocurrency hedge funds being formed and there may be another 300 billion to a trillion dollars of capital that is being positioned to come into cryptocurrency so as you can see this is why there's so much interest in it and and actually this is one reason why we're creating the pareto Network peak is because investors need better information about all these thousands of new currencies so let me make an assumption you guys tell me if I'm right or wrong that as long as the currency is being used to access something of value whether it's goods or services or information there's going to be support for it yes if that currency should fail to be recognized as accessing value for any reason they will probe go up in smoke I would like to add to something about that so in the it when a company is not providing value it goes it eventually goes bankrupt and it shares can never be really redeemed for anything block James on the other hand never cease blocks can stop being found the currencies can stop being traded but there's nothing that prevents somebody else from taking the baton for a failed project in in turning that turning those cryptographic hashes the tokens into something of value or giving it utility in the future hmm that's interesting so I could or a group could look at a failed if I may use the word failed crypto or digital currency and decide to rebuild it through a new series of valuation value through a new value being provided on the blockchain is that that's correct and that's actually something one of my previous companies has done and still does hmm they do that mm-hmm they've been successful in it I would say so I like to I got the idea from the activist investors in the corporate markets and just bring the same concept over to the blockchain markets with the understanding of the new abilities that are available the barrier of entry to carrying a project is very low 1001 is the thing it really um sort of got me thinking and engaged it was that there are exchanges now to you know essentially liquidate your tokens your new digital wallet of anything what star sign are those mainly focus like many things are you know like in private security it's just the top two or three or is it deeper well as I said there's probably a thousand tokens that you can now buy himself and many exchanges I mean many of these tokens can be traded on multiple exchanges so that's that's that's here to stay and it's becoming easier and easier to do these sorts of transactions so um how did you just about your personal how do you get to this area I mean that's a you're in a remarkable spot both of you are but how did you arrive here I was actually working on a mobile payment app for a development agency that they were just a contracting promoters were before we encountered a lot of regulatory issues bringing this out mobile applications were new peer to peer payments seemed very intuitive but there was a high barrier of entry a at the same time a Bitcoin wallet for Android phones came out did exactly what we were trying to do and it was open source they weren't even interested in protecting their intellectual property and it just really made me try to understand what was actually going on here who did this what is it and I probably spent two additional years just researching what why how before I could really jump into the blockchain space and really understand it and when did you form the parental network the pareto network was formed early this year probably 2017 and we're just pulling together all the pieces to bring this tool to the markets okay Ted what was your background I've always been in technology businesses of different sorts several years ago I was working in cybersecurity and payments and blockchain came to my attention as a new technology which could address some of the security issues as well as reduce the cost of payments and and also it can bring payments and Financial Inclusion to probably a couple billion people in the world through what's called micro payments and so this led me to be quite intrigued with it and I began studying it and looked at a lot of different use cases around payments rewards ticketing etc after I met Eric I realized that the pareto idea was really one that could be was very timely and and I thought a very powerful one so that's that's how I got here Eric and Ted I really want to thank you for your time for coming in you guys have been great you've given me a lot of insights you know I I have to admit I'm quite excited by the technology after you explain though all the way through and now I have to say that the viewers at home it's not the easiest thing to grasp in the first conversation or two but if you dig a little deeper I found it has legs mainly because there is a liquidity option at the end of the day you can get out I don't know what the price will be but you can get out you can carry out your token so I think both if you're coming in there is their contact information poor either or both of you well yes we can be reached through our website Pareto dot network and we are also available until show media and LinkedIn very transparent about that once again thanks so much coming in I look forward to hearing from you guys in the future and I wish you every success going forward thank you thank you this is Jim Connor thank you for joining us for this week's episode of game changes Silicon Valley each week we'll address an area of innovation that may emerge as a game changer of tomorrow you can watch and subscribe to the shows at game changers TV we look forward to your continued of interest and participation in upcoming shows Oh
