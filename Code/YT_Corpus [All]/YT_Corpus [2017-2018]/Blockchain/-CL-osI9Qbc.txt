 Welcome, welcome to One Minute Crypto! I'm your host, Chronos, and today I'm excited to bring you an interesting new blockchain project. It's called BitClave, and it's designed to take the middleman out of online advertising. Today, most companies have to work with huge internet companies like Google or Facebook in order to tell you about their products through online ads. These giant ad companies rake in billions of dollars of revenue, and you, as the user, get nothing. BitClave is set to change all this. They're building a decentralized search engine where you get compensated for your search data, directly from the retailers that you're interested in. They're creating a new blockchain token for this: it's called the Consumer Activity Token (CAT), and you earn it with the data you choose to share on the network. Anything you search for, or click on, is your information, and the tokens you earn for it can be traded just like any other cryptocurrency. BitClave is planning to launch their beta version in the next couple months, but they're raising funds today by offering their Consumer Activity Tokens for sale.
