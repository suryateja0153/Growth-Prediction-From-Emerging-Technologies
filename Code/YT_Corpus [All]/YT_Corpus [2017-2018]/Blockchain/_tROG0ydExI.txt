 hello and welcome to Columbia Business School executive education executive webinar series I'm joined today by professor frewcandy a professor of economics at Columbia Business School and the Columbia School of Engineering to talk about blockchain Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies we had a small technical issue while recording this webinar I did not capture the first minute of the original broadcast please accept our apologies and enjoy this recording of today's webinar the complication of you know our lives thanks to technology in a way you know could be interpreted for both good or bad obviously technology is affecting every industry some more so than others but in financial services world we are in a position where the application of all these complex matters are creating opportunities that not only need to be understood by technologies who are on the ground doing it but more importantly for the corporate leaders pretty much all of you whether you are a consultant or a banker or a professional in in financial services healthcare board members CEO and so on and so forth so he and I have I am of a belief that this these you know the these topics for those of you in the audience need to be learned from the top down as opposed to the ground up and the analogy I like to use is that you do not need to know at least at the beginning all the intricacies are all it's agnostic to technology nuances of how let's say a Bitcoin wallet is created and the mathematical formulas behind and theories behind public/private key encryption technologies and so on and so forth but just like a general contractor that needs to know how a house gets built you know from the top down that's that's the role I feel it would be best suited for you that general contractor obviously perhaps is not up to date in terms of the latest code when it comes to the wiring and the plumbing of the of the office structure being built but they have a really good overview of all the pieces that go into building this home and they can bring in experts whether they're plumbers electricians to enable the building of the house I feel like the same holds true for for all of you in that Wain we have built this program and this is two day seminar happening on October 23 and 24th at Columbia Business School on your screen you can see the link to the event site as well as our new brand new FinTech program which was launched very recently and it strives to sit at the intersection of academia practice in financial services and beyond but also for those of you who are kind enough to give us your time we you know including a special discount code the discount webinar 54 if for the first 30 of you to sign up for the event you can take $1,000 off your your single ticket purchase so I hope you take advantage of a as well so to give you an overview of how our thinking evolves around demystifying these topics for those of you in the audience who may not have technical background or have it limited engineering capabilities and so on we looked at this space from from multiple perspectives and we're able to narrow down truly the foundational topics that you need to learn and you need to know in order to fully grasp how all the pieces of ecosystems in the blockchain and cryptocurrencies and digital token worlds operate and how they interconnect and what's the interoperability and how they would enable us to do and monetize some of the initiatives that in the past are either impossible to do we had no venue to monetize them so the sequential topics that I would suggest you embark on in learning and as I mentioned at the end of a webinar will be emailing you a series of suggested books or readings with a disclaimer and again there is not a whole lot of good primers for those but no tech backgrounds obviously you can go online and you know do a search of what is blockchain or a rock jam primer and many many hits come up but there either you know too short or too long or too technical or written by engineers for engineers or typically by someone who to sell you something we here obviously being a Columbia Business School we strive to give you the most unbiased content and be able to empower all of you with the knowledge needed to understand all these topics so the first and foremost you know area you need to understand is essentially how distributed and centralized communication networks operate in essence in our summit will talk about how internet itself works the the history and evolution of communication networks they move from centralized to decentralized systems well and especially are the protocols required to run these systems I'm sure you might have included a few in the parentheses you know tcp/ip or IMAP or pop I'm sure you're all most of you have done all of you have heard of these and the but in case you haven't you know these are some of the main protocols which are pretty much standard operating procedures that enable communications over over the internet whether it's to send and receive email or for a data packet to travel through the pipeline's of internet and go from one switch or router to the next and how you get data from coming you request data from a server and so on and so forth and if you look at these acronyms they all end in the letter P and that P stands for protocol so understanding protocols it's quite important for reasons I'll allude to at the end of this list and they also come into play in regard to when we talk about digital tokens and this with utility functions so there are some you know textbooks some quite tech heavy on these topics but nonetheless we'll be sending you some information and I'll be happy to entertain questions at the end when it comes to module one of these sequential topics then once you have embarked on this you need to understand the world of encryption and cryptography since the dawn of human in human age we have always been interested in being able to send or receive secret communications that cannot be intercepted or if it's intercepted cannot be read by the party who stole the comfort the information and you know all the way back to dit to the days of Roman Empire and Julius Caesar we have methodologies developed that enable us to in a sense secure information securely but obviously we are in a very modern age and you know computers play important role in encryption and they're actually fun foundational part of blockchain and cryptocurrencies to begin with so having a good understanding of how these topics work specifically around secure hashing and modular arithmetic will enable you to understand the evolution of cryptography cryptography in an application of it within the digital token and crypto cryptocurrencies thankfully here there are a lot more books a lot of them quite accessible and you know some really good journalists have done a really good job in terms of doing you know kind of a story telling of how encryption and cryptography came about and we also be sending you information on some of the more advanced topics and obviously in the two-day seminar that I mentioned we do a deep dive into all the applicable areas of cryptography encryption in general especially those applicable to blockchain once you have these three topics you know damn cold then you're empowered to be able empowered to to can understand how blockchain action what blockchain is and how it operates so the first very first paper on blockchain dates back all the way to 91 and kind of talked about the use of blockchain in terms of time stamping ie how to create and Link a series of digital assets you can think of them as as documents you know Word documents that are immutable and are forever linked together in such fashion that no one can go and Backpage or edit a document that was said instead in time at the time of original author so that's and once you understand the first three topics understanding Hubble actually operates is actually quite easy so we'll be showing you the original paper I'll encourage you to read it again it's not that hard to read and once you have it then you have a very good understanding of how blockchain operates within the digital currency framework digital currencies are nothing new at in as one of my colleague you know did account and you know going back all the way to to meet to mid 90s to late 90s and you know he counted over 200 cryptocurrencies or digital currencies that came about by it never got any traction and did your a couple of issues prior to the advent of blockchain especially as prescribed in the famous otoshi Nakamoto paper in 2008 was the fact that he had the problem of trust ie if you're in a brand-new startup and you're enabling movement of money or assets of value who would know about you who trust you but more importantly the notion of double spend you can make a simple analogy that whenever you send an email over internet with an attachment you are not really sending the actual document you're sending a copy of it so the recipient is not getting the original document just getting a copy of it so obviously when it comes to money and sending the transferring money over Internet we cannot have something of that sort because then you can spend the same dollar for many many many times over and that's been acceptable so the blockchain protocol enabled and a copy much solved many of the inherent problems that they had before and hence the reason Bitcoin became one of the most prominent and most recognizable digital currencies and and the rest is history so there are also a few books that will recommend reading on Bitcoin also again in the two-day summit that will have will use Bitcoin as a primary example of a digital currency that eventually worked obviously has his own quirks and there are certain advantages and disadvantages to it and this incredibly highly dynamic world we had the recent forking of Bitcoin so we'll discuss that some of the limitations some of the inherent strengths and weaknesses and so on but more importantly we'll talk about some of the upcoming cryptocurrencies and and and digital tokens that have gotten a lot of press some for good some for bad so hopefully we can empower those of you who are in a strategic advisory position or as investors but are on your own or with institutional the institutional investors going to hopefully be able to understand what is good and what is bad and separate the chaff from the wheat and also be able to discern a lot of misinformation in this world and the fact that obviously I'm sure you all of you have heard about initial coin offerings and all the excitement's around it whether for good or bad so hopefully we can empower you with the right knowledge to make the right decisions in analyzing and understanding you know what's really happening in that world it also dedicates good chunk of time money cerium and it's more contracts etherium it's it's another you know protocol say blockchain based protocol with ether being their cryptocurrency but etherium it's it's high it's large extent highly programmable is especially when compared to Bitcoin and that enables us to do a variety of things including small contracts which are algorithmically driven contracts and initial coin offerings and do a deeper dive into digital tokens especially those that have a utility functions and I'll be happy to give you some examples for those of you interested in learning learning more about digital tokens so in essence and in conclusion you know we strive to look at this an entire roll of crypt crypto whether in a blockchain and cryptocurrencies and digital tokens and figuring out at methodology at least proposed a methodology of sequential topics that a non-technical person could learn on your own and we finally in a position to understand how all the pieces connect and engine and how they interoperate and obviously be in a position to have perhaps better client conversations or for future strategic purposes able to make more informed decisions so as I mentioned numerous times we've been sending via email a series of textbooks that are recommend by all means do not limit yourselves to those but I felt it would be important to share with you at least some of our thinking and some of our finding in terms of a research and what it takes to demystify this very exciting world which even though the technically complex is not out of reach for those of you who may not have computer science or math background so in conclusion I would love to entertain questions once again I posted the link to our event on the screen as well as the link to a brand new program on FinTech a Columbia program focused on a deployed projects and Advanced Research in in FinTech and as well as the discount code you all can use in case you're interested in attending our conference October 23 24 at Columbia Business School so with that I'll pass it to Gershom who will help us moderate the Q&A or if any questions that you asked yes there are a couple of questions here related to to the question of basically if sorry I'm just reading through a few to see if I can bundle some ideas here we hear a lot about blockchain having implications for many industries and not just in the FinTech can you speak for a minute to two so if there are highlights from that your list of resources yes yes indeed great question so we in the kingdom the course itself will talk about the application of a bit I'm sorry blockchain not just in financial services but many other industries whether it's real estate energy health care and so on and so forth understanding of that blockchain in essence allows you to create a ledger or a list of interlinked documents or digital assets that are immutable will allow you to do many things for example in energy allows you to create mini grids and and be able to connect multiple homes let's say they're using solar panels on their roofs to exchange you know surplus electricity production amongst themselves without the need to go back to the utility or in healthcare allows you to create immutable list let's say medical appointments or records for instance the veterans affair department in the US has certain rules around how doctors in the system gets paid based on who they see obviously there would be some incentive for it for a physician to go unpacked eight certain appointments or insert some appointments that did not exist or really fraudulent and get paid you know for it even though no services are rendered and obviously a blockchain would allow you to to stop something like that happening but more importantly we can build protocols we can build systems that enables the money monetization of the system for those who built it whereas before there was no way to do it just to give you a silly example you know IMAP and pop3 mail delivery across the internet but none of us knows the heroes in essence who were able to build it and most of them were either government employees or academia so they pretty much for them this was more of a volunteer effort whereas in today's world with the technology and and the systems that we have at our disposal we could build protocols such that it would enable anyone to do you know whatever comes to imagination but be able to launch and and and and share in the world and also new ways of in a raising capital it was the famous experiment in which you could create my pretty much create a crowdsource venture capital model imagine a venture capital firms without any GPS where the decisions are made by the majority of those who commit money and this would be highly democratic and so on and so forth so even though the experiments plan was kind of a failure there was a bit of a hack and we'll cover this in depth in class and we can read about it online but it was a good start and you know showcase the possibility of this in many many realms so we have a number of questions here and sort of a big question but can you speak to a little bit of why what it is specifically that governments and central banks why they've shown so much resistance to cryptocurrencies and then a lot of people are asking about some sort of global perspective why different countries is driven have varying levels of regulation and acceptance yes well obviously I won't I'm not a regulator so I cannot speak on their behalf but part of the issue in my humble opinion is just the complexity of the matter and the technical requirements that one needs to you know have down code to do to be able to regulate it part of it is also the notion of regulators ensuring that they are not stifle innovation but regulating its you soon or too early you could also argue that by not regulating about this providing guidelines you're creating uncertainty so both are side of the argument you know I think are valid and you could have a successful you know defense of it either way but also the complexity of the financial services systems in the US and the legacy and entrenched methods by which we used to conduct business typically tend to act as impediments whereas in some other countries especially you know in in developing world they may not be bound or the legacy systems or this legacy systems may not be as entrenched as they are in the States so by definition they are more capable of just experimenting and as I'm sure you know I'm sure you've heard you can go to Africa and you see how prevalent you know pain by one's phone is and people trade minutes or use their phone even though with an analogue phone to conduct business in the u.s. you still can't do that you know to the extent that they have been doing for for quite some time so it's a combination of factors but you know the more and more we interact with regulators we understand that they appreciate the impact of it and they want to stay on top of it and to our delight they are pockets of you know quite intense activity in understanding it and ensuring that it's doesn't pose a threat to the system and at the same token they can foster innovation we've got a number of questions in in the realm of security but specifically for trying to apply some of this in an actual business environment what are what are the chief risks from a security standpoint and adopting cryptocurrency or blockchain technologies in your operations well in this is the multi-pronged approach to this issue one obviously security the other issue is identity you know for those of you on Facebook you know that you know one of the core strengths of Facebook and the reason Facebook became Facebook is that everyone was tied to just one identity and that was their real identity whereas in in Bitcoin world you know you can have multiple identities you can open up as many accounts obviously you know nowadays when you do it to a company like coinbase they require other identification papers so they know who you are but that doesn't stop anyone from having multiple wallets so to speak or you could be from somewhere outside the US and be in a less you know a strange regime and be able to you know hide behind multiple layers of identities and no one will know exactly who you are also the notion of in disrupting is one system in such in such a dramatic fashion in a blockchain in in general hits the banks of financial institutions and at the core so a more measured approach perhaps is warranted and the the fact that right now they are mostly focused on using blockchain to reduce cars on back-office operation whether it's reporting or trade settlement or things of that sort that requires lot of manual labor before now we could do them in a highly automated fashion driven by algorithms which enable much more accuracy and and lot faster settlement times and but but lower error rate but lastly the other impediment is just Talent having good talent put on the who understands the technology are also understand business and are able to connect the dots about the spirit world and understand both opportunities and risks alright a couple of questions have come in about the relationship between cryptocurrencies Bitcoin particular and and actual currencies even if issued by governments and what you see is the future of that relationship well human humans are quite amazing beings they have a deal if you look at you know the behavioral economics and and the implications of it as applied within the world of cryptocurrencies it's quite a fascinating you know when you look at the philosophical ideas behind Bitcoin per se and how over time some of those you could argue that have been compromised you realize that human ingenuity it's truly pound it's better for good or bad so the the trades be trade-offs are speaking the fiat currency if I'm with those issued by a central bank or central authority versus something like Bitcoin which is truly decentralized to large extent and the advantages of this that is the advantages of each and also the incredible high bollocks of cryptocurrencies thus far including Bitcoin that you know they might change you know massive percentages from week to week you know creates certain barriers to adoption and some might argue that you know when Bitcoin itself is having a bit of an identity crisis ie should it act as it mean to store value just like you know a gold bullion or is it meant more as a currency that facilitates trains and payments and after the forking of Bitcoin you have to you know groups and arguing for that argued for one application more than the other and the jury's still out and there are some inherent also limits to what Bitcoin can do for instance you know in order to to run it transaction on using your credit card it you know the transaction itself is probably takes more than a second or two and from a computational perspective it's very light whereas a Bitcoin transaction it takes about ten minutes to go through and be verified and typically you have to wait an hour just to make sure and takes enormous computing power so you know whether that can be overcome is obviously open for debate and in the research and the cryptocurrency community and the answer seems to be yes but you're also in a very experimental phase a lot of new initiatives exploring all different angles of it and undoubtedly some winners will emerge one more question here so you've addressed a lot of those elements of these questions definitely asking and I should mention one thing I forgot to mention that is you know the value of Bitcoin is whatever the market decides to assign to it it's it's not based on you know any actual physical good for sure and if you argue the same for for a fiat currency so just please keep that in mind you know when you when you think about Bitcoin or other digital currencies that are truly digital and not backed by any physical assets so from that actually there's a question that came in by email for the webinar about the relationship between people's awareness the global awareness of Bitcoin and whether that if we've seen that awareness grow obviously over the last a few years what effect that has on has had on adoption and use across industries a blockchain itself it's it's gaining a lot more attention these days than ever before which is a good thing because it's a fundamentally paradigm shifting approach to too many things so you know not until long ago people used to confuse Bitcoin with blockchain obviously they are not the same thing one is the court technology and core foundation and other one it's a cryptocurrency that's you know partly based based off of it and developed truly to the application of it so it the adoption and you know and the things that as I mentioned repeatedly we can do with it are quite quite amazing and sometimes people are coming up with certain use cases for these but the you know the industry hasn't caught up to it so it's kind of developing something and waiting for the world to catch up to it some and the approach to it is it's quite it's quite different from country to country or from regulatory regime to regulatory regimes obviously you know tipton nefarious activities enabled by Bitcoin in which someone sends you a secret code and they encrypt your hard drive and you have to pay them some bitcoins in order to decrypt it are the ones that grab the most attention for good reason but there are also lots of you know good uses for it and it you know just like any tools that ever invented by humans it could be used for good or bad always make the analogy that a knife in half in the hand a surgeon can save a life in the hands of a murderer can take a life and same thing here but the story compromise comes down to the fact that most if not all inventions found applications that were beyond the imagination of the original founder the you know leave you with one last story and that is you know when Thomas Edison invented the the phonograph you know the the applique killer application for phonograph in his view after doing some thinking and research was that it would be the best vehicle to deliver sermons to people's home so you could be sitting at home and you can't listen to any sermon that you want or the killer app tend it ended up being actually music so and that's true for a lot of inventions so if you should will tell us you know what direction we're gonna go and and we love to be part of the conversations and through our program at Columbia and many other researchers you're exploring this and hopefully with more of you interested and engage you all would bring your expertise into it and make it a much richer richer discussion great well thank you so much for your time today thank you and thank you everybody for joining us
