 Hello everyone today is the 26th of December 2017 Welcome back to the Daniel Bruno 10,000 Bitcoin challenge today. I want to talk to you about cryptocurrency bonds specifically the solidus bond and let's start with some of the basics of what a bond is and How Aban works in traditional bond markets so when we look at a bond we talk about bond valuation We're looking at a bond valuation according to Wikipedia as a determination of the fair price of a bond as with any security or capital investment the theoretical fair value of a bond is the present value of the stream of cash flows in our case the stream of crypto flows That is expected to be generated and Hence the value of the bond is obtained by discounting the bonds expected crypto close To the present using an appropriate discount rate and in practice that discount rate is often determined by reference to similar instruments okay now there aren't any Similar instruments because this is the first of its class Let me mention that I had the opportunity to study Bonds a number of years ago at the New York Institute of Finance, and I took several courses there This one was probably the most interesting as you can see there and I've applied. What was what was taught in that course to crypto currencies and the result is The system and method for providing a cryptographic platform for exchanging Debt securities than denominated in virtual currencies, and here's the abstract you can see it you see here It's under Google patents system for providing debt securities and other Securities and commodity trading instruments and so on and so forth so you can check that out there you can see the date of March of 2012 and There's the abstract of it there So we're going to talk about the mechanics of how a bond is created on the blockchain in just a moment and But before we do that let's have a look at some videos that explain how bonds work? As You look to build your portfolio You will find that you have a large number of investment options the two biggest components of most portfolios are stocks and bonds So how should you use them one decision to make concerns your goals for your portfolio? Do you want your portfolio to provide a steady income stream? Or are you looking for long-term growth stocks? Generally produce the best growth over time a careful selection of stocks including both large and small Companies from a diverse group of industries can produce excellent growth over time or income Bonds are probably the better choice Bonds pay interest twice a year the amount usually never changes over the life of the bond Investors can buy bonds issued by local or national governments as well as by major corporations Even if you're sure of your goals there's always room for both stocks and bonds in every portfolio for more aggressive investors who want growth Bonds can help balance the risk of stocks and stabilize the ups and downs of the market for more risk-averse investors who choose an income oriented portfolio of bonds stocks can provide valuable inflation protection the amount of interest that a bond pays is usually fixed so it increases in inflation Can reduce the value of those payments stocks will help you protect your money from inflation because stock values often rise faster than inflation Your stock purchases provide an opportunity for high reward and help to hedge against inflation while bonds will provide a dependable safety net against stock market losses a mixture of stocks and bonds can help investors to maximize profits and minimize risks Okay There's a basic introduction very well done by investopedia. There are several other quick videos that we want to look at just to Do a quick review of what bonds are all about some of this is applicable to The crypto vers cryptocurrency bonds on the blockchain and some of it isn't but we want to start off with a basic Just a Basic grounding of what a bond is which is a promise to pay it's a debt or a credit depending on how you look at it and It is In the investment world a series of cash flows and as I said earlier in our case. It's a Series of cryptocurrency flows and that's what determines That's one of the factors that determines What the value of a bond is not necessarily the price of a bond we'll see in just a moment What that is let's have a look at? And another at another video here Introduction introduction to bonds, this is a quick one a Bond is a debt instrument issued by governments corporations and other entities in order to finance projects or activities in Essence Avadh is a loan that investors make to the bonds issuer The price of a bond when it's first issued is basically the amount of money being loaned and is referred to as the bonds face Value in exchange for this loan the investor receives interest known as the bonds coupon Bonds are issued for a specified period of time such as one year three years or even thirty years When the end of this time period is reached the bond matures and the bond issuer repays the loan to the investor Al's ice cream decides that it needs to build several new ice cream plants in order to expand Instead of going to the bank the owl's issues bonds for sale to the public Tom buys an Al's ice cream bond with a face value of one thousand dollars It has a coupon or interest rate of 8 percent at a maturity of 10 years this means that Tom will receive $80 or 8 percent of $1,000 every year for the next ten years when the bond matures at the end of ten years Al's ice cream will return Tom's thousand dollar investment Tom could also sell his bond before it matures Corporations often issue bonds to fund capital projects while governments usually issue bonds to pay for public projects There are many types of bonds But it is important to remember that the higher the interest rate on a bond the more risk it is likely to carry For presenting What can be? an obtuse topic in such a down-to-earth way and a lot of What this video has to say is in fact applicable? To the crypto verse2 solidus bonds to debt on the blockchain the difference being that the debt is Confirmed its authenticated. It's even held by the blockchain The the person who holds the wallet the Swift coin wallet will have access to the bonds as we're gonna see in a moment when we look at the solidus bond The bond exists on the blockchain and it pays interest in the Swift coin currency on the blockchain in fact that's the origin of Swift coin a lot of what this video had to say is in fact applicable to us because the cryptocurrency bond Is something that? Has a value and that can be used to raise capital for a company It could be a company in good financial health, or it could be a company that has financial problems There are many different scenarios where a cryptocurrency bond Could be incredibly useful to a company Depending on the circumstances. There are so many ways that this could work that It's hard to say, but we'll look at the next video in just a moment so Let's have a look at the Solidus bond at the mechanics of the solidus bond within the swift coin wallet shall we let's make a bond What do you say? Here is the swift coin wallet and It is fairly self-explanatory Here in the toolbar I Have a previous video where I explain some of the basic mechanics? I'll refer you to that video to go over if you'd like to but today. We really want to focus on the bonds okay, so within the Swift wallets you will see here. There is this tab called solidus bonds This is where you will find the bonds every bond that has been created On this within this wallet You have to have a wallet, and you have to have you have to be you have to have a presence on the swift coin blockchain in order to Create the bond and then later we'll talk about how that bond might be sold or how it might be valued but right now just the basic mechanics, so Here you can see bond donor and these are the different Wallet IDs within this particular wallet these three wallet IDs are commensurate with Bond donors so the bond donor always has to be one of the wall of one of the wallet IDs within this wallet And here you hear here is the purchase date Which is also? Tantamount to the creation date. These are bonds that we're going to create when we buy a bond We're creating it will bring it into existence Right this is the expiry of the bond the bond size, which is the number of units of swift coin? the interest payments and the The Redemption value at redemption there Okay, you can see that we have some bonds in our portfolio already, let's have a look so Let's start from the top, this is always today's date. This is the amount of swift coin Within this wallet or rather. It's the total amount of Swift coins that are available to purchase a bond In this wallet we have five million Thirty thousand nine hundred and three spot nine seven seven Swift coin So if we wanted to create a bond that would be the maximum size of the bond We can create this size or any any sickness or any lesser number Now this bond it has already redeemed That's why this is a watermark bond size was 100 100 Swift coin the bond donor is this? key This key on the on the blockchain is the owner of the bond whoever possesses. This key possesses the bond and Will enjoy the coupons or the interest payments and the redemption of the bond? this particular bond was a 7-day bond and It's a zero coupon bond meaning that There is only one interest payment and that occurs when the bond redeems. It's only 7 days, so here you see the owner Purchase date was the 17th of this month the expiration was two days ago, the bond size was one hundred Swift coin and The interest rate was zero spot 2% per year per day the Total value of the bond at redemption was one hundred and one spot for Swift coin So in seven days this bond grew by one spot for Swift coin or 1.4% in one week and this currently says zero because the bond has redeemed so the bond value at redemption was 100 and one spot for Swift coin and It's that simple so the bond Was created on the 17th It expired two days ago when it expired it paid one spot for Swiss coin For the investment of 100 okay, so that's that one now, let's look at another one here We have a ten thousand swift coin bond Which was created yesterday The 25th of December and this is the bond donor So this is a I believe, this is a different bond donor and indeed it is you can see that that is the? key for the 100 swift coin bond that we looked at and this is the key the 31 to 69 is the key for this particular bond Right and this particular bond is a one year 360 day bond It started yesterday and Or rather it starts today was created yesterday. It starts today, and it ends on the 1st of or rather the 2nd of January 2018 And it's paying 0 spot to 0 8 percent per day So there's the owner There's the purchase date the expiry date the bond size is ten thousand Swift coin And it has not yet paid an interest Interest rate zero spot to zero eight percent The bond value at redemption will be seventeen thousand four hundred and eighty eight Swift coin So when this bond redeems in one year? It will be worth seventy four spot eight eight percent more Than what we paid for it. That's an annual percentage rate of 75 percent that's what these bonds are paying at this time and here are the coupon dates January 24th at base 624 Swift coin the 23rd of February at page 624 Swift coin and so on Until it adds up to seven thousand four hundred and eighty eight Swift coin all of this happens by algorithm. There is no human intervention involved with this at all The algorithm creates the swift coin and Brings it into existence on the blockchain where it is Confirmed by the blockchain so Regardless of what happens from here on out regardless of the credit rating of the Holder of this bond which may or may not be the person who created it This bond was created yesterday it belongs to this key This key could change hands It could be sold this bond could be sold There are many different possibilities, but this is the basic the basic outline of how it works and It will pay without fail and it will redeem without fail That's what sets this apart. That's why this is a blockchain bond doesn't matter What the financial? standing of the creditor or the debtor May be the bond is going to pay It's going to pay this amount and it's going to redeem regardless of what happens So that's another example Now let's create a bond shall we why don't we? Create a bond on the blockchain and See how this works, so I'll go up here to buy solidus bonds. This is today's date This is what we have to play with year five million Thirty thousand nine hundred and three sweet spot seven spot nine seven seven Swift coin In in this particular wallet if we were to change Wallets for example this one. This is what we would have right so we'll go back up here to where the where we've got more funds and let's create a 50,000 swift coin bun shall we let's do it there we go Five zero zero zero zero it's 50,000 coins Note that I can choose the destination okay, so the origination of the bond is here on this key, but if I want to I Can choose another key within my wallet? to receive the interest payments and the redemption of the bond Okay, and this is the drop down menu again. These are the wallet. I d--'s within my wallet only Right, so, I'll choose that one Here's the bond expire we expiry. We've got seven days thirty sixty ninety Three hundred and sixty two years five years ten years Let's see what this would look like If we choose to make this a ten-year bond. What would that spell let's see ten years fifty thousand coins This is the owner of the bond Beneficial owner is this key? The purchase date would be today And the expiration will be on this date. Can you imagine? the fourth of November 2027 what will have happened between now and then certainly there will have been many Credit events Here's the interest rate and the bond value at redemption Is going to be drumroll? four hundred and twenty four thousand four hundred swift coin At the current market rates of Seventy five percent per year interest So fifty thousand becomes four hundred and twenty four thousand four hundred almost ten times This these are the coupon dates a twenty twenty fifth of January We get a payment of three thousand one hundred twenty Swift point 24th of February same thing 26th of March 25th of April and so on three thousand one hundred and twenty Swift coin, and you can see this is the schedule of payments All the way down the line year twenty twenty Twenty twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty four twenty five so you can You can see before you actually commit to the bond you can see what to expect It spells it out for you right there It's very straight forward But ten years is a long time and We don't have time for we don't have ten years to make this video So we really don't even have a year for this, but let's choose 30 days And this is a zero coupon bond, which means that The sole interest payment will occur when the bond redeems 30 days out from today if we choose this to be a 30 day bond We will get 3075 swift coin In a single payment that would be 30 days 60 days Would be an interest payment Of two thousand three hundred and ninety nine with 2400 Next month and then twenty four hundred the following month And then redemption Sixty days Ninety days this is what the schedule would look like so the The payments are monthly alright Let's go out to three hundred and sixty days. You can see the schedule 25th of January 31 2020 4th of February 31 20 and that's for a fifty thousand swift coin bond right So shall we do it Let's do it Hopefully there isn't too much congestion on the network and this will go straight through with no waiting time Let's give it a shot. You ready, let's do it Okay, the bond is being processed You can see here that this is now in a shadow so the the the wallet is is In in processing mode it cannot accept any further Transactions you can see that this is glowing blue That means that the bond is being formed and then confirmed on the blockchain For this is what we've just finished doing This bond is gonna have this 50,000 swift coin bond is gonna Have a value of eighty-seven thousand four hundred and forty Swift coin in three hundred and sixty days And we're gonna wait for this to confirm this hopefully will be very quick so that we can move on in our video Again this is the owner the issuer is Another key within our wallet as soon as this confirms. We're going to talk about how this might be Commercialized there are many many possible applications for This debt instrument and there we go okay. You see this returned to normal color that means that the processing is Is not quite finished because this is still glowing blue flashing blue As you can see Not processed yet It's in the process of Finishing you can see now that 50000 swift coin has been debited from our purse or from our wallet and Is being sent into the solidus bonds portfolio within our wallet? so When we when we talk about purchasing a bond first we have to create it We gain the right buy that we gain the right to create it by having enough swift coin which is tantamount to ether on aetherium or gas on What is it Neil? Okay, so you got to have gas you got to have ether to create a smart contract? This is the proto smart contract. This is what I created in 2011 This is the this is long before etherium, this is actually the first that I'm aware of it's the first smart contract and swift coin is the first alt coin long before litecoin long before all the rest we Created swift coin I'll include the links below so This has taken a few minutes to process as you can see But this is what it's going to be this is the schedule of payments This will be this will occur regardless of Any future event and that has profound implications for Credit ratings and bond duration, we're going to watch a video about that in just a moment Know significantly that this bond was created Slash bought without any intermediaries without any brokers And without any fees there are no transaction fees to create the solidus bond And there again is the schedule of payments? So well that's processing why don't we have a look at? Bond let's have another look at one of these great videos Bond investing is the purchase of the bonds or debt of a company or government? Vic wants a long-term investment that is secure and will grow so she purchases a Treasury bond these bonds are promises from the government that they will pay you back your Investment with interest Treasury bonds can be purchased through a bank a stockbroker or online from the Treasury Department The government uses the money from Vic's bonds to fund projects such as highway maintenance Public Works and even war there are many types of bonds for a variety of different institutions state and local governments issue Municipal bonds to finance local projects companies issue corporate bonds to borrow money from investors Instead of securing a loan from the bank the companies can then use the money from selling bonds to build new factories buy new businesses Or simply pay off older debts bond investing is normally considered a conservative style of investment the return on investment is Historically lower than you might get from a stock investment, but bonds are not tied to the stock market instead They reflect the credit rating of the government or business the riskier a business is the more interest it has to pay to attract investors So if Vic wants to continue investing in debt she can buy a range of bonds that have different interest rates and risk profiles with some careful thought that can create a bond portfolio that is as dive safai does any stock portfolio if Diversification is Vicks main goal. However. She would do well to use a mix of stocks and bonds Synced video about bonds and The utility of bonds so I'm trying to keep this video shorter than my previous videos, but as you can see the crypto currency bonds can perform all of the functions that That this narrator has just described and it can do more When we when we talk about the bond Okay, it's still it's still in the process of Gaining confirmations enough confirmations on the blockchain to be Considered process just as a transaction needs a certain number of confirmations on the blockchain Once this bond is finalized At that point it can be bought and sold As a commodity it is completely fungible with any other solidus bond that pays the same interest rate that is the same interest rate, so at the Once I hold the bond In my in my wallet then I'm free to do with it what I would want to do It's paying interest it has a certain number of cash flows And that has a certain value what that value is is ultimately this determined in the market place What is the value of a swift coin well that depends on what the market will bear That value will go up and down it could be a lot it could be less The The vision of Swift coin is to be less volatile than Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies but there will be some volatility so the the dollar return will vary depending on the the market price of a swift coin Especially relative to Bitcoin if it's liquid with Bitcoin the more liquid that Swift coin is with Bitcoin and Bitcoin being liquid with cash All of these things will will influence the ultimately the price of the bond the The value of these crypto cash flows Will be decided by buyers and sellers the price discovery will take place after the bond has been created so if I am a company, and I want to raise capital I can Go about it in many different ways I could create These bonds and then sell them to third parties I could Bring investors together in order to purchase swift coin If there is a market expectation that swift coin will increase in value then these bonds would be Possibly a hot commodity because they're paying Interest you know you're you're buying more than the face value so these bonds would trade Above the face value in this case the 50000 swift coin bond would be worth a lot more than 50000 Depending on the marketplace. No it's as far as the mechanics. Go how would one actually? Transfer this bond to a seller to a buyer well You would actually take this wallet and you would Physically move it you would go here You would go to copy this wallet and save to a new location Like that And I think that'll be here on my desktop as you can see here it is okay SW backup, so this is the icon for the wallet on this device which is Windows And this is the backup here you can see the date Okay, so if you wanted to transfer this bond you would actually Put this onto a USB Okay, so Here it is. Here's the bond the backup. Here is the icon for the the bond on this Particular device which is running Windows now? Here's the backup that we just created We would take this And put this on a USB Put this on a USB or transmit it by some form to another Device, that would be in the possession of another party That's how this bond would be transferred to a buyer, so if you were to sell For example if you were to sell this 50,000 swift coin bond to a buyer The buyer, let's say pays you in cash Sends you a bank wire and then you would send this You would send he would send the wallet your wallet to that fire So whatever is on this wallet is going to go to that person so you would? To start off with you it creates a wallet for the purpose of Selling a bond and for no other purpose, so it would be a one use Wallet that you would create You would bring the solidus bond into existence you would sell the bond, and then you would transfer the possession of The wallet and that's it That's how it would work Let's see if this has been confirmed yet still not confirmed it could take could take some some time to gain confirmation, but it will right so So those are the mechanics of the box There are many scenarios where There are so many ways that this can be done that It would take me hours and hours to go through them all if you have Proposals or questions or comments or whatever it may be Let me know leave a comment for me If you have ideas about how this could be of greater utility I'd love to hear what you have to say But that's about it when we look at Bond duration, there's a nice two minute video here Duration tells investors the length of time in years that it will take the bonds cash flows to Repay the investor the price He or she paid for the bonds a bond duration tells us how much a bonds price might change when interest rates change a higher Duration number means a bonds price is more sensitive to interest rate changes while a lower Duration number means a bonds price is less sensitive to interest rate changes This means that the price of a bond with a duration of five will increase or decrease by five percent when interest rates move by one percent a longe duration depends on its interest rate Call features Yield credit quality and maturity the shorter the bond term the lower the duration and vice versa also the lower the coupon the higher the duration and vice versa Christine has a bond with a 10-year maturity a 0.15 percent yield to maturity a 2.25 percent annual rate a $1000 par value and quarterly coupon payments the its duration is 9.1. Michael has a similar bond with a 30-year maturity a 0.35 percent yield to maturity a 4.25 percent annual rate a $1000 par value and quarterly coupon payments its duration is fifteen point three two suppose the Federal Reserve announces changes in its interest rate policy and interest rates increase Christine's bond will decrease in value But Michaels bond will experience a bigger decrease because of its higher duration similarly if interest rates were to decrease Michaels bond would gain more value than christine's again because of its higher duration Duration is just one factor that affects a blocks value inflation risk default risk and call risk are also important But duration tells investors like Christine and Michael how much risk they face from interest rate changes Okay, so you know that's that was another great explanation about a bond valuation and the things that go into bond valuation and bond duration the sensitivity of a bond of a bonds interest rate - Or the price of a bond to the interest rates It would be a very long conversation to get into The bond duration of a cryptocurrency bond, I'll save that for another time, but obviously you can see that this is a different Species as it were There is no default risk at all So in that sense the theoretical bond duration would be zero That doesn't exist there's no analogue for that there are other risks instead of an inflation risk that the narrator mentioned there could be a currency risk if the Swift coin is highly volatile then the the payments in the currency could be Greater or lesser value depending on Depending on the value of the dollar value of the source point so There are a lot of Variables some of which have an analogue in a traditional finance and some of which do not have an analogue the inflation rates That the narrator mentioned May or may not have an analogue in in bonds on the blockchain the I Would think that the greater consideration would be the volatility of swift coin itself the? Bond the solidus bond always pays the coupon or the interest in Swift coin the Swift coin is It's own blockchain. It's separate from any other blockchain and The primary interest of investors at this early stage is going to be the convertibility of Swift coin into Bitcoin because bitcoin is highly liquid with cash and Bitcoin has become the reserve currency as it were of the crypto currency universe So as long as your cryptocurrency is convertible with Bitcoin you'll be good to go, and they'll be healthy demand for your currency and And I think I would think that that would have a major impact on the valuation of these bonds So Another excellent video and things to consider How how then would a still in the process of confirmation on the blockchain how would a company use these bonds to raise that There are many different scenarios if Creditors Have an interest in Cryptocurrencies in Bitcoin with a capital with a lowercase B. Bitcoin being big one with a lowercase B. Being the large Crypto versus the crypto bursts in general and not the not Bitcoin with the capital B. They the currency itself Then these bonds are going to be of interest or at least of curiosity to investors because Because of the interest rate and the high interest rate of the bond Does not square with higher risk? It does and it doesn't The the crypto sphere is The is by its nature. It's more of a risk. That's true the crypto sphere by its nature is Riskier that's true But the risk the traditional definition of risk is the credit worthiness or lack thereof of the issuer because the issuer has to make the bond payments, and that's not the case here, so You could have a company that's in bankruptcy. You could have a company that has a negative net worth. You could have a company that has Fear that has in principle has no ability to repay that Sell these bonds They because they're the ability the company's balance sheet does not affect the risk of the bond The bond is going to pay regardless of the creditworthiness or even the existence of the seller of the bond Who may or may not be the creator of the bond as you can see we've created a 50,000 swift coin bond now I Could sell that bond to someone else and My credit worthiness will have nothing to do with the risk inherent in that bond This does not have an analogue In finance this has never been seen just as crypto currencies have different Different laws that apply to them Metcalfe's law the expansion of the user base of a of a of a technology Being the fundamental driver of the value of that technology the network not the fundamentals of a stock for example, but not the earnings not the price to earnings not the not any other traditional Criteria for the valuation of a stock or a currency Apply in the crypto verse other things apply, and that's why as I've mentioned in other videos a lot of People and finance continue to say that bitcoin is nothing but a bubble Because they don't understand that It's there's a lot more going on with Bitcoin than that and so it is with the solidus bond So Those are the mechanics the basic mechanics of the bond we went over The creation which is buy when you buy you create? It's the same thing on the blockchain these are not bonds or promissory notes or debt that is issued by a Government, or a private company As per the Identity of the bond when a Company I don't know for example an oil company issues a bond that bond is backed up by the future earnings of the oil company which depend largely on the price of oil or if a Government issues a Treasury note The Treasury note is backed up by that government's ability to tax its ability to collect revenue But we've seen With great frequency Bonds default over and over and over in the last five years there have been sovereign defaults in Greece in Cyprus Argentina obviously Municipalities within the United States have defaulted Private companies have defaulted It default is very common in in fixed income investments Bond yields are currently at historic lows Interest rates are at lows and historic lows so bond prices Can only go down in the broader market? as far as That issued by the United States and the European Union and so on So This is again the source here in this drop-down you choose which Wallet ID will create the bond on the blockchain you choose the size here Example 10,000 coins The destination these destinations are only within your wallet the these destinations Will not be a different wallet okay, and Here are the parameters of the bond. This is what you can expect over? The life of the bond you choose what that life span will be and this is done by algorithm right That's the bond And This is these are just the basics here. I've gone over P in previous videos You choose which which wallet if you want to send Swift coin you would choose which wallet you would choose the amount You would choose the destination You would go to your address book for example you could choose this one Name is client - you don't have to remember the wallet ID you just choose from Your address book Whatever the name of the person is and then you can include a text message This is the Swift mail function of Swift coin which is mail on the blockchain? and Then you would send it out, right? when it's in the process of Sending it son confirmed. It's read and And then that will process and Get a certain number of confirmations, but before it turns, yellow, and then eventually turns green. This is the traffic light? I've gone over that in another video Here you can get a new wallet ID you can take any number of wallet IDs And there it is This one we just created that has no balance in it You would to transfer the bond you would go here copy the wallet and saved a new location I've got Download set to go to my desktop. This is the backup and then you would transfer this to the buyer of your bonds Who would then take possession of the entire portfolio of within that wallet and As you can see we're on the Windows operating system Solids bonds are Available on Windows and Linux At this time they are not available on smartphones The functionality is not available on our smartphone apps There's a zero coupon bond sold solidus bonds described here on Wikipedia blockchain based at instrument store value patented peer-to-peer digital bearer bond Uses proof of work on the blockchain to perform the functions of coupon payments and bond redemption typically carried out by intermediaries such as a broker Designed by team Daniel Bruno starting in 2010 I Have written a few papers about blockchain that Is an introduction to solid to the solidus bond Derives from the gold coin of the Roman Empire And these are these illustrations or representations of different denominations of bond It's a basic explanation of how it works By the way the bond size can be anything that you might want it to be for example if I want to I Want to create a bond of I don't know some odd number 2347 spot eight seven six Coins I can do that We're not limited to round numbers. You can create any bond size that You want to and this will calculate the interest? payments the interest rate being here Approximately 75 percent per annum at this time Right We also have an investor presentation here that explains some of the macro Aspects of the bond market which is a 78 trillion dollar market per annum and Goes into the basic Theory behind the solidus bond and what it What it can potentially do Disrupt the bond market. That's the intention. That's the purpose of the solid respond So I think that's just about it again if you have any questions or comments or Anything else that you want to go over. Let me know my name is Daniel Bruno and I've had people ask me recently about how to use the solidus bond in a bankruptcy proceeding It's a fascinating Question and There are many There are so many ways that that this can be of utility that I wouldn't even know where to begin There's an arbitrage Opportunity between The seller of the bond and the buyer of the bond if the an instrument that has this kind of cash flow is going to have a Price that's significantly higher than the face value of the bond So What the bond can do is significantly Magnify the The resources that the debtor has to get out of bankruptcy Because acquisition of the bond will will have one price, but the sale price of the bond will be something more Than the cost of acquisition, which ultimately is going to come down to the cost of acquiring the swift coin So if you can acquire the Swift coin at a cheap price Or if you can if you acquire just like with Bitcoin or any other Cryptocurrency if you acquire it at one price, and it doubles in value While you're holding it and everything else being equal You're you've you've Magnified by 100% your your put your Potential Your your worth in the port your portfolio's worth That's part a and then Part B or the cash flows so As we saw in the video the value of the bond valuation depends on the cash flows on the expected cash flows of of the bond if a swift coin is worth a dollar today and It's worth $2 tomorrow then whoever is holding the bonds in getting those interest payments is going to increase by 100 percent The value of the bond because it's Paying double in dalian u.s.. Dollars. It's paying double today. What it was paying yesterday even though the interest rate remains the same on the bond Now can you imagine if the underlying currency? Goes from one to five or one to ten and you're holding an instrument. That's paying interest in this currency So you can start to see What the possibilities would be? The bond would The valuation of the bond would be We'd have to come up with some some new way of bond valuation Because this is not something that really has an analogue in traditional finance I mean the dollar is not going to go from a dollar fifteen to two Sixty five cents or rather Dollar euro is not going to go from one fifteen to one spot one five two zero spot six five It's not in other words the dollar is not going to increase Against the Euro by a factor of two right, but crypto can So to sum up.
