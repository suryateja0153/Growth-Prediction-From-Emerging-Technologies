 [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] because introductions we will be looking at some use cases and actually interesting applications of contracts so that you can do was to create digital cash the inventor of Bitcoin wanted to create digital cash as the reason why many inventors before and failed in creating the total cash is that when you have a bit of an absence they are conflation do not know the concept of scarcity if you take an mp3 file if you take an image you can and this is a problem that many people before satoshi nakamoto the inventor of Bitcoin [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] each of these meaning history [Music] [Music] so when you send a you can also because you can just as easily and just as securely as you can with the other different currencies that exist something that's highly relevant for presentation today is that you can also run cou an executive coach on that blockchain and what that actually means we will see throughout the presentation [Music] basically the first invention of the blockchain to represent digital cash as I said [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] of Islam which can also be used as a central computer or a virtual machine and that's because when you executive coach on the blockchain it's exactly immutable and the transactions that you store in the blockchain so when you execute a piece of code and it's broken into the blockchain that it's not possible to alter that or to change that by any third party except the person has the private keys to the transaction and that's what's making this really really powerful lots of other block chains and some of those have very specific use cases and some of those also more general just fine [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] but if you want to have a really beautiful east-central legend they have hundreds or even thousands of copies just like we've seen on the example of Bitcoin brothers Oh [Music] [Music] exactly for those to keep in mind because [Music] basically the system [Music] [Music] [Music] with you you would be running to keep in mind though contracts that you want to write into the box [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] to give you an example imagine you want to surf you shirts and t-shirts from a supplier because you want to sell them you know the supplier diversity shots and you find out that it's actually not the exact color tone of yellow that you want it but the supplier will say well this is exactly what you wanted but you will say no that's a different culture and it's something that's not so easily quantifiable and something that's not so easy to wrap into the watching so these are kind of problem that block chains cannot solve it can't solve problems with viable contracts where things are relatively clear and put into notice to differentiate in terms of terminology is something that's both smart contract code and smart legal contracts contract is something that is actually just a program that's running on a chain and it's a little bit unfortunate that the term smart contract is also related to that is because it's actually just a piece of software that is running on ad central computer and this does not necessarily have to involve multiple parties this could just be a computation but you want to make sure that it actually happens you want to make a weather forecast that something that typically involves a lot of computational resources and you want to make sure that this weather forecast will definitely be computed no matter what then you could make that run on the hero virtual machine and it'll definitely happen unless who the contract owner will stop it and the seven involve any other parties disagreement but it would be a program that will also be called a smart answer but it's not a legal contract with the parties it's simply a piece of code that's running on the Babji and that's immutable in contracts parties agree on something like this whether that actually previously and this is something where the bottom can actually have soft properties of this agreement now let's stick with this with this better example and and the people who are participating in the project will send money to a contract address and from that point on there was no risk in that contract because the money is sitting in the samples and so let's say you have nothing and nobody can change the tomorrow and the country will automatically pay out the amount of money to [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and this will be simple website of providers which is a public API and you could use from an offer for example as a source for the temperature and temperature it will give you a result and you could use exactly the result through the Oracle for your slab concept so you need to have a connection to the outside world that wants to refer to beta determining outside now bonding that you need as a user you want to interact with snap contracts his bronzes or browser plugins he's a relatively popular browser plugins - apparently yozma Tomas and dismissed in a browser that you are using everyday as a user you can go to you mate it's a website which is relatively simple user interface where you can put in the conditions of a contract and this is something that this is what's that humans will be capable of doing so you can put in all the parameters and it basically the contract for you and this is really convenient because if we don't what to program is not contract yourself this interface to the Syrian one chain will actually [Music] with a programming language these technologies because central points of failure so let's assume you to the jerk just one server which is storing some contact information and if this number gets compromised or it's simply due to an a technical failure the data from that server and from the database gets lost then you might have a problem with contract data's stop them and it's also cases where smart contracts are really really useful just because they are thousands of copies centralized database and the permeability that yeah it was stuck when they tell us is really really small and then also one thing that's of hosts 24 was the cost so that we have solutions that are already working well for you nearly cost free then you might not want to consider smart contracts but if you are using solutions to post contracts to make sure the contracts are binding like not to read then smart contracts might be a really good solution for you just because as we've seen with this unit for example with the ease of access to to programming on smart contracts it's really really low cost and you can actually circumvent the notary in some cases all parties agree as a question my dad wouldn't like it [Music] you can actually not but these are typically essential applications now if you want to raise equity or for your company typically you would go to a venture capitalist you might consider going public and raise funds for the public workers the new sights of Hungary things are not really accessible to small entities or to startups especially public markets something is really really expensive to Marcus's what [Music] for example what is the difference between but why is it so much more successful than any crowdfunding campaign because really accessible so [Music] Germany's relatively highly regulated and you need to sign up with some crowdfunding platform to be to open an account there already you can participate in the world to participate [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] everybody actually then you probably have to comply with security but this is [Music] and you do any type of document any type of file and the hash is basically a string of characters that is unique for the document that you've uploaded and if you let's say you take a PDF or chelsa written pretty standard contract on that p.m. that when you change that PDF if you just remove one from them if you have to begin so you again create a string of characters fire - definitely change and so if you have a contract that was written at some point in time in the time then you can play something that's really interesting and when you consider that financial derivatives it may be places function very similarly to to get some chance you can easily imagine that you could also make derivatives contracts typically are contingent on stock prices on commodities prices or the best prices and you could immutable derivatives contracts and ever written into the blockchain and derivatives contracts actually are done over the counter as it's called so there are or between investment funds between hedge funds and sometimes there are disagreements about the nature of those contracts if they were done the smart legal contracts on the blockchain then the move for potential disagreement would be really really limited because the good thing about gambling or about derivatives contractors that they are not only contingent on quantifiable data like stock prices commodities prices and all that so this is something where even though gambling can look like yeah not so fantasy application if you transfer their concept into the financial markets [Music] so if you if you transfer property for example in many cases you will have money in an escrow account who they not to read because you want to make sure that if you are something something that the buyer is actually the money to pay the price and if you're buying you want to make sure that when you get the ownership of the properties actually transferred to you immediately and then most cases use a notary and you will use the escrow service of a notary and that as I said earlier is quite expensive and you could do the same thing over the blockchain if the type of tool and piece of when a piece of property was in the blockchain the new had set up an escrow account on the watch chain and when you made the payment and in that very moment the ownership will be transferred to you and therefore you can also eliminate the notary in the cases where you're actually in an escrow account now smart alecks is another very interesting application and there are smart locks already today but the problem is that typically the access to these locks service and the becomes bigger today this is something relatively traditional way to do that because you would have a title to the cover and you would actually have the physical paper and you would have a store and if you wanted to sell the car you would actually need to be present at the same transaction now if the keys to the car were digital they could be controlled by and they could use independent on the payments that tomorrow is making so they came to the car would only be active as long as the borrower to the existing income so this is 2 million physical objects or against property houses history of repayment history of ownership these things are [Music] easy to make smart contracts are basically immutable applications so they're pieces of code that can run on chain and immutable and the second thing that's really important is that you can have legal contracts that will help you make any transfers agreements with each other I would encourage you as I said to go and test it out that's not so hard to get started to install a browser plugin and go change sounds like a very theoretical and subject but when you start using it as actually of the garden so base the water [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] - temperament has the exact same quality as the same resolution everything is the same right but there are pockets of these cuts where you would only purchase it from the actual owner so it really depends on people attribute value - I would say because they contribute value to the original fire [Music] if they don't [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] because I think it will always be really easy to and it's more of a question on how it will be the enforcement of those rights what do you demand we give a tool that can help end piracy but it's [Music] [Music] so the question is why should you trust [Music] ones real to be easy to steal that is okay well first of all if you compare to a bank robbery right if you somebody runs the bag they take your cash and run away then it's also relatively hard to trace in people still use things in bringing contraband and I will take this relatively similar here and then some instances it's really really hard to trace those people who legitimately acquired some assets but something is actually possible to probably just because the watchman is a public ledger and you can at some point somebody will want to exchange those bitcoins those those points into peels into euros and at that point they will need to identify themselves book exchange and that's the point where a certain chance of actually identifying the people so it is hard to trace but it's also to some degree a question or concepts and a lot of methods are involved and you also be willing to pay more to trace that the rawness so it's it really depends on basically what is at risk and it's the same on the bank you you are willing to take some risk but you can have a lot of money you will not stop typically distributed and it's the same what you would do in the lid of the world if you have to stop at least they wouldn't just started with oneexchange I would really use something that's called cold storage we actually don't trust any third parties but you just hold the keys yourself if you want to use third party services and you are typically distributed across many different ones and not just a storm you're a sensible just one exchange [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you make sure but the actual document is not stored on the mob chain then I don't think that there is privacy risk involved if you actually make it accessible to everybody who wants to read it right so I think it's maybe a question of design [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] because they can [Music] so this is something that has to be saw with infinite videos before YouTube became a there were a lot of other startups that works to provide a similar service like YouTube and because they said nobody's going to use that of the [Music] able to watch videos because well [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] because [Music] and the relatively short amount of time sold itself
