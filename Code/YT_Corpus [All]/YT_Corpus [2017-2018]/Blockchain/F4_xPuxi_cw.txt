 Blockchain is a secure technology that provides an open, decentralized database for every transaction involving value - money, goods, property and work. And it enables the transaction of value between two parties – business or private – without requiring a third party like a bank to verify the transaction. How is this a business opportunity? Take a small manufacturer. He produces heat pumps and sells them to customers around the world. Imagine his supply chain from production to sale. First he produces the pumps. Then he ships them. He transports them to the port. Port authorities check the papers before the pumps are loaded and shipped. Financiers handle the transfer of money between the involved parties. At the destination, port authorities check the papers. The pumps are unloaded and transported to the customer. Financiers handle the transfer of money between the involved parties. An awkward, expensive and time-consuming process, that requires the interaction of several IT-systems. Shift to Blockchain and the entire documentation process moves to the cloud! Every party involved simply logs on to the blockchain to verify the goods and the transactions and receive their due payment. And it is transparent and traceable since every log in the blockchain is unique. It is simpler, faster and cheaper much cheaper since documentation costs are reduced to near zero.
