 to understand blockchain let's go back to 500 ad on the island of Yap located in what is now Micronesia the abbeys people had stones like this everywhere this is a yappy point it was their money it's about 200 kilos suspending these like modern coins I posed a bit of a problem well the yappi solve this by not ever physically moving the coin the coins were placed in very visible locations on their tiny island every adult MP knew who the owner of each coin was by memory when two people wanted to transact they would announce the change in ownership to the other yuppie who would all update their knowledge of whom the coin belonged to voila the coin was exchanged the yuppies were using what we would call a distributed ledger it's a ledger in the ECAM piece had a mental record of the ownership of all coin and they would mentally update that ledger anytime there was a transaction it's distributed in that the ledger wasn't just owned by one person it was known by all people now the yeah piece could have asked one person to keep track of the mint the ledger point that person would have to be really trustworthy in terms of both honesty and administration skills the monopoly that person would have on transaction activity might lead them to charge a fee or make rules for who and when one can transact and problems would arise that that person fell ill decided to leave or if their integrity was compromised in some way that central person would be a bank distributed Ledger's perform many bank life functions without requiring trust in a central entity in the Yippies example a person can tamper with the ledger and claim ownership of a stone that doesn't belong to him unless all the yuppies come forward and contradict his clinic based on their knowledge of the ledger so fraudulent transactions aren't likely also if one particular member of the tribe isn't available or moved away thereby losing a copy of the ledger transaction can still be validated by the other yeah peace so the system is fault resistant perhaps most interesting is what happens if a coin gets destroyed or lost in one instance and the large stone fell overboard on the way back from the island where they quarry the stone no problem the other yabbies decided we can imagine your coin sitting there in the ocean will give you credit for it and we will mentally use it for transactions like we do with the others so even if for all practical purposes the coin doesn't even exist they could still use it to transact
