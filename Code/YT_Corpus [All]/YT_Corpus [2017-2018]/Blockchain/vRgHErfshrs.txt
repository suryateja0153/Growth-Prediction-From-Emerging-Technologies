 First, I want to thank Vero, GDG and Zinio for this event, for organizing everything and also I want to ask you all how many of you have heard of Blockchain before or have read something about it? Could you raise your hands? Good. How many of you have invested before on Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency? Other cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin? Little by little we are increasing these numbers, this is a good thing and as we can see. We can check this on Google Trends, that the searches of Bitcoin and the interest over time is increasing, we can see on September there was a peak maybe because of the last months that were really promising for this technology we can see is a topic that more and more people is interested about. So before knowing what is Blockchain and what is Bitcoin we will need to know from where we are coming we need to know some concepts One of those is Could somebody tell me What is money for you? "Money is debt." Is debt. Could be ok. Money is basically an accounting system. Money is a record of what we have or own, what we owe to somebody else That's why we can go to the bakery without a wallet ask for a bread and tell "I will pay you later" and they will write it down in some account book basically is this So that's basically what is Blockchain is an account book that instead of.., until now with money we needed some third party to issue that money and to guarantee us that that money is real till now that paper was made by the governments with Blockchain we don't need that anymore is basically what is Blockchain a distributed accounting system. So, how this story started? In 2008, in September we suffered one of the biggest financial breakdown in the history and it cost to taxpayers all over the world a lot of billions of dollars or maybe more, some people are saying trillions of dollars only for rescuing these banks that provoked it Behind that money that was created there's nothing to back it up It was created out of thin air There was no gold backing it up There was nothing How could we prevent this in the future? It was ironic that few months later In November of 2008 Somebody known under the alias of Satoshi Nakamoto Nobody knows who he is published a whitepaper where he was presenting some kind of innovation some kind of solution for this problem with third parties not having to trust in somebody else and for that what he created, the most innovative part of what he created was the Proof of Work (PoW) with this, he could create a distributed trustless consensus as there are a lot of concepts here that are difficult to understand we are going to see them one by one to know exactly they mean. So Blockchain is the technology that is behind Bitcoin Bitcoin is just an implementation of it and we have a lot of others So what is consensus? basically is an agreement, a set of rules that we all in the community decide what to do and that's basically what is language in a language you are assuming a lot of rules when you are talking with somebody when you are saying something that person is understanding you that person also knows that you are understanding him is basically that if we have a common language, a protocol then we have consensus. Another thing is how we can manage distribution for all of us to decide exactly that we are applying those rules we need to distribute this information the fastest as possible If I'm the only one with this account book I can modify it, I can do whatever I want with it and I can be corrupt and alter a record for myself just because I want but if we share this information, all of us is more difficult that all of us decide that this account book is going to be manipulated There are two ways of managing distribution one is waiting until that information is distributed over all of us or just if a percentage of us decide that this is good then we decide that is enough. Trust of Safety for this he was using a mix of technologies one of those is cryptography that is letting us to distribute a message through an untrusted channel using cryptography because if all of us decide that to verify something this needs to be signed with some cryptography it doesn't matter if the message is going in a channel that is not secure is what happens with email, for example. For creating this distributed trustless consensus what he offered was this Proof of Work that it might seems really difficult maybe some of you have heard before about Miners and you said: "Why there are miners?" "Why this system has something so difficult to understand?" and is basically for validating those transactions that we are creating. Is a very careful balance of game theory that creates conditions where participants on the network compete to solve a mathematical problem and get a reward for it It is the entire security basis of the technology because in any competition there could be honest players and dishonest players So for making that there are more honest players than dishonest we need to have some kind of reward that is bigger than the reward of being dishonest within the system for breaking the system or attacking the system right now it would be needed 30 billion dollars just for making one transaction fraudulent that's because the more people are using it the more secure it is right now is in a global high security status not even a country could attack it and going to be more difficult in the future For understanding better Proof of Work there's one of the biggest minds in this cryptocurrency world is Andreas Antonopoulos he said that the best way of explaining it is with Sudoku We all know how Sudoku works and it has a lot of similarities with Proof of Work because is an asymmetric algorithm what it means is that is easier to check the solution than to actually do it for example, for a 10x10 Sudoku for solving it we could take 10 minutes but for verifying it is just a few seconds Let's imagine that for example I have 1 million dollars and I want to play a game with you all and I give you the same Sudoku for all of you and the first one that is solving this Sudoku is getting this 1 million dollars I'm giving you 10 minutes for doing it and maybe somebody is going to solve it and the game is restarting and is continuing so the next time you are going to think "OK, for winning the other people, I'm going to bring other people to help me with this Sudoku" So instead of doing it one person, is like a "Mining Pool" a group of people trying to solve the same Sudoku So maybe instead of 10 minutes is going to take them 8 minutes So what I'm going to think is "OK, you are playing your way for doing it in the fastest way and winning the others" So I'm going to increase the difficulty of the game next time instead of 10x10 and going to do it 25x25 so you going to take more time to solve it Basically that is how is working Blockchain's Proof of Work What this all means is that Blockchain is a secure record of transactions collected into blocks grouped in chronological order and distributed over different servers to provice reliable origin. With this we are making a system that it cannot be hacked attacking one node, one server It needs to be hacked by the 51% of the servers of the whole entire system The technology uses digital signatures and consensus mechanism for ensuring that participants can agree on which transactions are valid The possibilities that Blockchain could give us one example is Bitcoin that is a digital cash solution but we could have unlimited cloud storage any computer that is connected to the Blockchain could provide its storage to the system so you could store everything in there Unlimited computing power there are projects that are using this for solving any kind of difficult problem that could need a supercomputer, with this you could do it that will require a lot of resources Identity management if all the identities are in the Blockchain it would be easier to verify the people that are connected to it Smart contracts Bitcoin could be a smart contract is an app that is decentralised is running on every single node of the Blockchain at the same time voting, ruling a nation, executing legal contracts... there are a lot of solutions and the sky is the limit now I'm going to talk about the two biggest projects that exist right now in the cryptocurrency world that are Bitcoin and Ethereum Bitcoin is a peer to peer electronic cash system that enables online Bitcoin payments. And is the one that was in that whitepaper that Satoshi Nakamoto released. what is keeping is the track of the ownership of the bitcoins all over the world there are no governments that can control it It's decentralized it's easy to set up easier than opening a bank account for sure in a few minutes you can have your own wallet where you can store your bitcoins it's anonymous (kind of) because as it is running on internet somebody could track the IP address from where the transactions are done following the path of who has use it it's fast faster than international transfers that right now you would need two days for doing it with Bitcoin, in more or less one hour you could do it the transaction fees are lower than an international transfer for example everybody can see the transfer that has been done inside the Blockchain "May I interrupt you here for a while?" "talking about transaction fees" "I have different times tried to buy or sell bitcoins" "I have never done it before because what I have noticed is that" "around an 8% of the money is payed on fees" "when i'm going to buy from euros or dollars to bitcoins" "I got noticed that if the value of the bitcoin let's say is 1:1" "I loose a big percentage when I buy it." What exchange are you using? "I haven't use any, I just tried with Coinbase and a few of them" "and I have noticed that if I'm going to buy it I have to pay about an 8% more" "in order to get the bitcoins but I also loose an 8% when I sell them" "so from an investment point of view..." What you are...the fee that you are paying on this is the fee for those miners to get your transaction before others in this case of Coinbase it is a centralise exchange that is the same as having a bank doing the operation for you so they want to get some part so you are paying Coinbase for doing the transaction and also the miners that's why the fee is so high "How can I get bitcoins if I'm not using Coinbase or similar?" There are others with not so big fees "Thank you" Compared with transactions of international transfers they are lower, they should be lower Ethereum is instead of adding to the Blockchain a currency what it's adding instead in the Blockchain are apps they are called smart contracts and is computer code that can facilitate the exchange of money, content, property shares...everything that you can think of an app they can communicate between them you can run an app inside the Blockchain and that app can talk with other apps that are running already there the potential of this is huge right now is in development yesterday we had a big change in the test network of Ethereum the creator is a 23 year old russian guy that is quite intelligent, quite smart that's why the hype is so big right now because it could compete someday with Bitcoin maybe not as a currency but for the potential it has the ups and downs that decentralised apps have one is its inmutability once you deploy an app inside the blockchain it cannot be changed is running forever it is corruption and tamper proof if you modify the code in one node it is not modified in the rest so it cannot be hacked that's why is so secure it's zero downtime it never can be stopped once is deployed in the blockchain, it never can stop if one government wants to shutdown some website it could do it, but inside the Ethereum blockchain it cannot be done. but one of the downsides that Ethereum has is the bad coding exploited if you dont write your code well it can be exploited and somebody can take benefits from it so it's really important to write your code well before deploying it inside the Blockchain These are some of the projects that you can find these are more or less the most important or more known but there are more than 1300 and its increasing day by day there are cryptocurrencies for gambling, for media advertisement BAT is one of the most promising ones of the creator of Firefox and Javascrypt There is nothing you cannot do without Blockchain is not that this is something new that you need to trust on it the way this is deployed is the best we have seen in a lot of time you could do any of those projects in a centralised way and it could work but what history has tought us is that trusting in some central government, bank or company maybe they are doing things with the best of their will but sooner or later they could be hacked and information from you could be stolen like what happened not so long ago with Equifax that 143 million USA citizens Equifax was hacked and all the information from these people social security numbers and everything was stolen and those are things that you cannot change you cannot change your name, you cannot change your social security number it's difficult to change so that's the thing, with this is more secure to do it it is a higher security solution than centralization This is the community that we are trying to create we are in all of those social media places and we are glad to get you get in and learn more about it, about cryptocurrencies and if you have some questions... "I look on internet a bit of information about the Blockchains and all of that" "and I think one big issue why people is not confident on this working" "is about scaling, because over time, to be a miner" "it will require every time a bigger capacity" "and at the end this can mean that maybe only big companies" "can be part of the system, so what do you think?" About this, actually there are a lot of thoughts about it because with the Moore's law the computation power is going to be cheaper over time and the way is distributing these bitcoins for example you can have more computation power to enter in this but this is a big problem, the scalation right now, inside Bitcoin there is a... the community is divided between the people that think that they need to increase the block size and others that think is enough with the last hard fork that we had on the 1st of August and also in Ethereum they are thinking about how to solve this problem for sure, I agree, scalability might be a big problem in the future there are some other blockchains that are scalable they are zero-knowledge proof for hacking that is another big issue of blockchains little by little, is still an early technology but its development is increasing really well "Ok, thank you" "Do you think that governments are going to start regulating the use of cryptocurrencies more?" "Now on United States already some states are limiting wheter you can trade" "cryptocurrencies using your current banks" Actually these last weeks we had this problem with China on Internet there is a famous rule that says that "Everytime China bans something, invest on it" this is the best you can do and I think that China banned it, not because they don't think is good is because they are afraid of it, they want to regulate it they want to do it properly because this is going really fast and increasing really fast but there are other countries, like Australia for example they have accepted not having to pay double taxes so when you are buying a coffee you don't need to pay the government, here is the 21% of taxes and also the taxes for doing the bitcoin transaction only one, that's it So I think little by little we are improving in regulations and this year is exactly what is happening a lot of countries are saying, ok, we are going to position in one place or another and little by little I think Bitcoin or Blockchains are going to win because even if they try to regulate it I'm not sure if they really can that's the problem "You just have said some interesting thing" "that this is anonymous, ok" "that's a very good thing" "but what about people who don't want to pay taxes?" "for example, that unfortunately are needed right now" "I mean, if you can use this like an money laundry system" "is it any kind of fraud around that?" it is a ghost that has been following Bitcoin since it started that is only for criminals and it should be pursued just because of that the thing is that in some countries maybe is going to be used like this because there is a lot of corruption and they want to use it badly for avoiding taxes or other criminal actions but in some other countries like for example the one we are living there is not that need the use of Bitcoin is just because like in the 80's people were storing value in gold because they didn't trust in dollar now people are storing their value in Bitcoin, this generation at least is thinking of this like a profitable solution for their future more than other generations and that's the thing, little by little for sure there are going to be people that would want to use it for this but the majority of the people, we need to get to that point of having regulations for making it more mainstream and more useful for people so this kind of criminal acts would be chased "if you want to create a Blockchain" "What do you think about how many nodes we have to implement for having in production a Blockchain?" "If I'm a small company and I want to use the power of Blockchain" "not for cryptocurrencies, for smart contracts what do you think I would need to do?" If you want to create your own Blockchain you could create it for example in Ethereum and you don't need to...you can create a token that is your own currency or your own way of making these transactions inside your own Blockchain but if you want to make it decentralized by your own the bigger it is, the more secure so the best way and the solution that a lot of companies are using right now is the ICOs Initial Coin Offerings what they are doing is giving a supply, a number of tokens in exchange of ether or any other cryptocurrency so in this way they can make a more decentralised system If you are doing it with your colleagues or with somebody else it can be hacked that's another thing that happened not so long ago with one of these ICOs, that the address for sending the ether was modified because it was in a small group of computers the more decentralised and the bigger it is, the better "One thing I didn't understand correctly" "If you are a miner" "you are a bitcoin miner, an ether miner or both at the same time?" "is not that you are mining in the global Blockchain" No, in the global no there are completely different Blockchains but for doing the Proof of Work that is in what is based these Blockchains you are mining one of those or Bitcoin or Ethereum "So if I want to create an startup and create a distributed storage on a blockchain" "they I decide to build my own Blockchain for this" and I release an ICO with all the work... Can I use the Ethereum Blockchain with my current solution? Yes, you could use the Ethereum Blockchain to create your own smart contract with your own rules inside like Bitcoin could be running for example inside the Ethereum Blockchain because is an app, is an implementation of Blockchain "What is the most used blockchain for this? Ethereum?" The biggest Blockchain for doing ICOs is Ethereum Bitcoin was used before also for that but now what they are doing from Bitcoin is creating forks you can have the same security that Bitcoin has because the technology is the same but implementing it your way if you want to change the rules... for example, another thing that I didn't say is that for Bitcoin the rules that are set in consensus are that you cannot make a transaction if you don't have the money for doing it and you cannot make a transaction that is less than zero, for example so there are a set of rules and also computer rules that need to be validated and these are two of them "I have a technical question, if you want to do your own implementation of Blockchain" "in which platform or language you need to develop it?" Ethereum created their own language that is called Solidity and is basically a contract is written more or less like Python but there are other blockchains like NEO that is known like the chinese Ethereum in which you can develop in Java and in a lot of other languages and this is going to be good for developers' adoption Now with the banning of ICOs and stuff in China the project is still a little bit new they are trying to open the market "Now that you mentioned the thing of the forks, I saw that Bitcoin" "is in Github and is open source, so you can see all the code in there" That's another good thing, a centralized company it's going to audit their own code and if they find something, you'll never know you are screwed but with this, all the community can check the code of it and if they find something they can tell to the developers or the community and it can be improved
