 from Palo Alto California its cube conversations with John Currier hello everyone welcome to a special cube conversation here in Palo Alto California I'm John furry the co-founder of Silicon angle media and also Coast the cube our special guest he has grant fondo is with good ways legal expert in blockchain initial coin offerings also known as AI cos experienced federal prosecutor former assistant US attorney in Northern District California head of the blockchain group at good wind a lot of legal action going on welcome to this cube conversation thank you to be here thanks for coming in Goodwin you guys are a great firm well known in the valley helping entrepreneurs being the track record of Cleveland's pretty significant than familiar with Anthony mckusker and the team over there you guys do a lot of work I've been asking around all the Silicon Valley because we're hot on the ico trail ourselves blockchain we've been following covering extensively Bitcoin going back to 2010 it's a hot market it's fraught it's very frothy but in asking around I'm like who was doing illegal were so a lot of people are kicking the tires now are now getting their toe in the water want to explore blockchain want to explore the notion of crypto currencies take a minute to talk about Goodwin what you guys are doing because you have a lot going on right and there's a lot of issues to talk about we're going to get to that but what are you guys doing it take it take a minute to talk about Goodwin sure so we so we've been involved in the space for three and a half years now probably I got involved I was a former federal prosecutor as you mentioned so I got involved with a regulatory side represented a company in a DOJ and FinCEN settlement and prior to that kinda took off my interest in it I thought this area was fascinating and the amount of talent and energy in this area is tremendous so that's what launched my initial interest and then from there represented a couple of other companies in significant regulatory matters but we're also very actively involved in the startup and that's kind of Goodwin's Bretton letter and so particularly in the FinTech in blockchain space we've been doing it for a while and so now what we've really seen problem over the last eight months is just a tremendous growth and interest in the token sales the you know you've referred them as bi cos and so we're probably doing representing 20 to 30 companies at various stages for from just initial concept to launches yeah one of the personal observation we were talking before when you want on camera here is that you know I've seen a lot of waves in my time and you know the cloud computing I thought that cloud inter second data and mobile is going to be a home run especially blockchain is really one of those disruptive reminds me of the early days of the web where it truly was a Wild West and it is kind of happening so you know you have involvement in the white white-collar litigation area in the past this is essentially a a rush on to the marketplace because with crypto currencies with decentralization and people experience and distributed computing it's changing business models so people are making a lot of cash if you will and raising the money side so people are going there so there's a lot of a lot of people migrating into the space not without some uncertainties what are the issues I mean because on one hand the scam people say and some people say it's legit where is that where is it where's the difference between the two so I think in any many industry especially new industry there's uncertainty and I know you the attention goes to the scams right but I think that's really the minor very minor component of it what you're seeing is a lot of good companies with great ideas who have developed a new model to to develop their platforms and part of what you saw in digital currency that people loved early on and you're seeing in blockchain and now you're seeing in token sales is the democracy of their industries and their platforms and so they're allowing you see all these marketplaces being created and tokens is a way to facilitate that not only in the context of obviously raising money but also providing a platform for people to participate on that platform and so it's been fascinating and so a lot of smart people are getting involved so you're seeing a lot of big brains getting in and also entre president know how to hustle that's why I kind of call the early days of the Wild West of the blockchain is there any pattern that you're seeing what is the what is the catalyst in your opinion what's driving all this besides the new way to finance or a new way to provide value I think there's a couple things one is the interest in the blockchain and the greater understanding even now more mainstream you know eight months ago it was really more crypto people doing the token sales now we were getting calls from all aspects of Industry and so and some very conservative historically conservative ones and so I think what people are seeing is this blockchain technology is really here to stay it's really transformative technology and its technology de playa so many different industries it's not just a crypto technology it's a technology for everybody and it also allows so many different participate participants and transparency and so people are really fascinated by it and they're using the token sales in part to help build that industry great I got to ask you the number one question that I get and one thing that I think about a lot in our business is what's the PlayBook take us through a day in the life of what's going on a good one as you guys are dealing with people knock on the doors and hey help us and now you've been kind of pivoted to blockchain from natural extension where you've come from great great position to be in because it's a natural place but this is a first time market those new things are emerging new use cases what is the playbook what are people not going to they're saying help me with how do I get this implemented blockchain or an ICO is there is there a playbook that you've seen that's working and what's where the pitfalls should should be avoided sure so I mean there's a couple initial decisions that you have to make and one is the question we often get is the people are trying to stay within the boundaries the problem is the boundaries are still very uncertain and so you try and work with a brand new technology and brand new concept with regulatory regimes that are a little bit older they're not quite built for it and so part of that part of what the initial questions are when people call us is how do we fit what you want to do within the frameworks and try and minimize any risk because in any business there's risk but the smart thing to do is try to minimize it and nobody who calls this is trying to scam anyone they're trying to do this launch a fantastic business one that will be truly disruptive in their industry and so one of the things we first deal with is jurisdictional issues where do we set up companies and so we set up people have this common perception if I just set up a corporation abroad well I will I be fine and that's that's not the answer and so you set up corporations and entities that make sense for that business where the people are located the executive team is based here in the US that changes the dynamic we also get a lot of foreign companies to call so there's a lot of decisions about where does this company get set up so this is almost like going back to business school one on one where you domicile where you start the corporation with what entity or is and then a lot of paper that goes on but I want to step back and talk about some of the distinctions that are nuanced or actually specific if you will the notion of utility versus securities concept that's well known in business but as it applies to blockchain those are specific nuances aren't they in how the regulatory market looks at blockchain after you explain like what that means a picture thing about utility versus of security so I take I break it down to two kind of examples the typical utility token would be remember when there arcades and you'll go to arcade and you'd stick the token in to space invaders or whatever the game may be and there's still arcades out there so that's that's utility token does that token have some utility on the platform is it doing something on the platform that's what the model is so that that it's essentially people avoid some of the regulatory hurdles with the security conversely a secure uses as you think about it typically Silicon Valley was built on companies selling parts of themselves for equity and people buying into the company and getting stock and so you're trying most token sales are trying to avoid being terms of security where someone is getting an interest in the company and interest in the profits control over the company and instead what they're the models based is on this utility token the test is called a Halle test and it's basically if you hit certain criteria you end up being a security if you don't hopefully use name a token regime and so it's really and the way to best do that is you build a token that truly makes sense on your platform that people can use it to build to transact to exchange goods to build ideas and they're not running the company they're just using that token is in a sense much like it's an arcade token so it's not like I secure like a stocks there's no stock option plan there's no token plan if you can't think about that way is that what you're saying yeah well so it's a very interesting issue because there's there have been some companies that have set up tokens like vesting over time the 10 or tokens for employees or tokens for advisers and I think there's a risk that the sec wait a minute that looks a little bit like an option or security so one of the things we advise is do not set up token plans or vesting token plans because that may be an addition for the FCC to say hey listen that's a security well okay I want to get to drill down on the whole government because it's still going to be some things are coming down the pike and there's AG also a global phenomenon so it's interesting jurisdictional questions I want to get to that a second but just to stay on the security piece one you mentioned earlier that most of the blockchain activity are and ICO is around disruptive or democratization I think you use the word but really it's disruption of markets so one of the areas we're seeing is the parade browser with the bat token that's disrupting kind of the web browser kind of thing of the user experience steam does like kind of a reddit kind of clone and there's a variety of other ones we've seen some all over the place in different verticals and then there's one was democratizing venture capital yes so we've seen some activity around folks who are using cryptocurrency to invest in companies talk about the dynamics between those two approaches and mainly we the funding one is that still kind of wild-west undefined or how do they propose that work so I think initially was Wild West you had basically crypto people investing in companies and buying these tokens now what you're seeing is the VCS are smart people we represent a bunch of them they're successful for a reason and they're aggressive in the sense of they're not afraid to take risk and they're they're constantly on the move for new ideas and so VG's are investing in crypto now you're seeing I think there's a lot of interest I'm getting a lot of calls about can we present VC fund Laskin will I come in and present and kind of walk through the token process what are the risks I got a lot of calls from investors you know more sophisticated traditional investors hedge funds about what is what are the risks here how do we invest how do we minimize our risk and it's a new paradigm but it's a paradigm that I think the traditional financing vehicles are paying a lot attention to now so it's still a open book at this point not truly defined but there is activity what is the entrepreneurs perspective of what's that side of the table look like because they're looking at this and certainly they're all in than jumping in with the icos how the entrepreneurs looking at and how should they deal with these new progressive investors so the entrepreneurs are looking at frankly as an alternative to VC and loans and I think that they view it in part as it's a quicker and easier way to raise money in a sense but also that there are potentially less strings attached and there and I think there's some truth to that but I think one of the key components is when you raise that money and you apply it you have to do in a truthful honest manner and you can't mislead people I need to be pretty pretty forthcoming about your disclaimers and things like that so it's not a you know unattached raised in a sense you have to be careful about that but I think they're viewing it as any entrepreneur you're always probing for what's new how do I get best get to what I need to do to achieve and have a chance with my business and they're saying this is an ultra great alternative so I got to ask the tough question and that is an entrepreneur perspective this sounds it's going to cost me a lot of dough to get this done what are the fees like I mean you know to give some specific numbers but I mean we talk on series a is that the financing kind of model I mean we talking about hundreds of thousands of those sounds so there's a lot of works again first time we're going on to leverage the economies of scales aren't there you guys are doing a lot of work so you're getting there but I would imagine that the fees would be enormous so I think it depends on what type of token sale you do if you do an unaccredited token sale which is the majority of them these are a lot less or less if you do a credit it's a little bit more but I think there's a couple different components there's not only legal and the legal can be there's I mean you can get sort of the mice's version of will write you ten memos about the following but I don't think that's most entrepreneurs don't take that approach for some reason because the memos are never going to say whatever you do is perfect so I don't typically recommend that but so the fees are probably not as much as you would think I think where the fees start to escalate is there's a lot of different components to this one of the fascinating things about digital currency blockchain and now token sales is there's so many components to it and so for the entrepreneurial Eagle which I think they'll find is actually one of the least expensive parts of that process but getting tax advice so it's a you're bringing in all these token sales you really need good tax advice to make sure that you're maximizing your tax benefits when you do it that can get extent and the tax issue as could be significant because I'm sure even the government has been doesn't figure out that revenue or is it investment so is it revenue or is it I mean how does the tax treatment I think the IRS would look at it as reference okay so this framing I kind of had a loaded question I was kind of smiling there but I want to go into the next question on that point because I think this brings with the next one is how do I organize my company because you know I'm scared to get sued I don't want to get put out of busy Racine Robert Scoble say on Facebook I'm doing an icy on all suddenly like he's almost like a legal - I'm not inviting that company more so someone must have coached him like a if you get involved you're promoting it so people don't know where the lines are any more on what was old kind of test standards you can't promote it an offering is it revenue gray area so people are organizing outside the US yes what what's the best practice of a company says hey I wanna do an ICA what do I do so I don't think there's the best practice I think you have because every company is different I think there are but they're road they're guideposts and so I think if the biggest guideposts is where you located if you were if your team is in the US and you want to get you and or you want to get US dollars you have to assume you're going to be regulated by the US regulatory regime so you have to deal with that reality and then so you structure things differently so then the next question is do you are you going after accredited or unaccredited token purchasers and so then if you most people want to do unaccredited so then you then the measure of protection is okay is our token truly utility you and I talked about that five minutes before and so that's that's sort of the threshold issues if you're going abroad you really have to be completely abroad meaning no US money no US executive team the companies abroad the businesses abroad etc because the US takes very US regulators I was a former prosecutor it took a very broad you'll see right through that that Mirage they'll see right through if there's any impact in the US they have jurisdiction over and they'll and if some if the US people have been harmed they will take notice so there's no real kind of way you can get around about the Cayman Islands certainly the Contras in Panama been a lot of issues there I mean what is Cayman Islands an option or so they came in it's a great question that Cayman Islands is a great option for purposes so a lot of token sales are being run out of the Cayman Islands because of the tax benefit it's not April it's not a regulatory protection in my in my view unless you happen to be all abroad and you're not seeking US money but but usually it's primarily sent there for the tax purposes let's talk about the regulatory issues this is still we've heard it's pretty much again the Wild West we said there's been a rush and there's been rumors at the SEC and the federal government's going to be putting things in place at the end of this year maybe really next year the timetable seems to be shifting it's a moving train what is the concern on regulatory and how is that impacting people in in the blockchain hye-kyo market because seems to be like a rush get out before you can be grandfather has there been any statements of grandfather that's a big area what's going on there so I think what you see is about two weeks to three weeks ago the FCC came down and issue some guidance and I say that a little bit of a grain of salt because I don't think it was a tremendous amount of guidance but there's a couple of takeaways one is if you are if you act like a security they're going to view you as a security that's not news but but that's fine the second component which I thought was in many ways was very interesting was they said they implied that some token sales are not securities which we always believed but it was a nice tap the utility utility yes they're not not all so not all token sales are securities and therefore they are utility so I think and that's where the battleground is what was frustrating about let me one other aspect too is they mentioned the term participants so if they believe that a token sale is a security not only will they necessarily go after the company but they will go after participants that token sale like potentially VCS or investors or well I think it's an open question what participants mean historically if you look at like securities and I used to do Securities Litigation and I do insider trading and things like that participants would be like investment banks for example so if there's an a pseudo investment bank involved and I think they would view that term broadly specifically not investment banks and token sales but the SEC might say listen you're a participant you benefited you helped launch the sale etc so I think for participants there's potential risk as well but they really did leave you know they left the door open for the so not hard core they're not so it sounds like they're giving some guidance like hey we're watching you but we're going to let this thing play out little bit more well I let the professionals kind of deal with it I think it's two things one is I think they said historically those that launched earlier we're probably going to let that pass as long as in commit fraud that's sort of my read on it and then the second component is that we are watching you and your unnotice now so so don't cross that line so you put up the investment bankers I mean I just I mean my salivate when I see this whole opportunities out there because you think about the traditional IPO process not to compare i CEOs two IPOs but there is a serious bunch of cash coming in I mean a couple of these ICS Boldin over 200 million dollars yes that's some serious cabbage as we would say back east so this is significant is there like rules on market making what you can say how you promote it and those reg deed and it's like there's eight plus stuff going on out there I'm not an expert in that area I'd love to get your thoughts on how should people watch the lines on how this gets done are there market makers there are certainly sites that promote icos how is all that playing out is there a schism in sentiment sure so for if you're point doing you to tell any sale and your position is that you're not a security general advice is you should not be marketing your token as an investment opportunity that our token is going to go up and down you don't want to be publicizing like here's a great way to make money by our token that's not that looks like a security you mentioned reg D so reg D relates to accredited investors in the US and generally the rules are you can't publicize your token sale if you're targeting accredited investors so likewise you shouldn't be putting things on them on your website targeting all types of people so that's where people will get in trouble I think the area that for entrepreneurs like Silicon Valley's is so social media focus right now we're at it Twitter etc and a lot of promotion going on and and the nice things about a lot of these token sells is they're building these communities it's a fascinating area but the downside of these communities and these constant communications is you have to be very careful with your language so when you have these reddit community hosts that are helping you with your launch for example to be very careful what you say you can't in any way imply that you're trying to you know ray you know the tokens will go up in value we're trying to protect the value of the tokens so you have to be very careful that's a definitely by facebook post I just posted two days ago most gets trivet so the utility is the key I think I think I would see in min vision more utility deals going down because this is where the infrastructure change is happening I think that's phenomenal I think they'll be arbitrage on the security side just my personal experience and opinion however that is the key I'm a utility token what is the language I should use to avoid selling it as a securities or using language what's safe well what would be safe if I'd we're doing a utility token sale what's safe language can I say hey get your coins during their platform - I market it like software to a market like a technology I think you market like a market you mark it like a token at arcade no sense and it's so simplification but I think the concepts are saying you're marketing that this token sale this token has this great use on your platform and people should be really excited about joining your platform and they should be excited about buying those tokens so they can use them on the platform whether it's to make money whether it's to access games whether it is to art you know we're seeing in areas of artificial intelligence life science is really the game show the utility use case more than on money making that's all you should be talking about etna to anything because you're you're selling your platform and you're selling just a mechanism to get onto your platform okay so what's the conversation like at the law firm these days I'm sure that's the the firms buzzing with the growth of the inbound you have I hope you can say the number of I SEOs you got in the pipeline if you can be great if you can share it greater than 10 less than 100 yeah right now I'm actively advising probably 20 to 30 companies that are in the process or at some stage in the process where's the scar tissue what have you learned what's the big takeaway for you that you can share anecdotally from these ico processes so that's a good question really and so I think it's it's tempering people's expectations I think you get I mean we really I mean reason I'm you know I left the government and I got in with Goodwin and stayed in Silicon Valley because I love the entrepreneurial aspect here and so you get excited for your your clients and you have these clients that approach it with these great ideas and some of them are like mind-boggling I should have thought that never did and so you have to temper that a little bit and temper their natural enthusiam to say okay listen there's right way to do this and there's a right wrong way or it's not necessary wrong way but a more gray area if you want to really be more in the right area here's how we have to do it it may not be quite as lucrative it may not be as easy but it's right way to do it let's and let us help you get there where's the operational bumps that you guys have hit and where has it been similar to existing legal practices within the firm I think the operational bumps is is there's just not a lot of people that really know the space I get calls a lot and people will say like my god you're a lawyer who actually understands what we're talking about and so even in a firm like Goodwin you know there's a segment of us that when we have a team and so we understand the language but not everybody does right and so I get calls even internally from the firm can you help us out on this I have a client who's talking a slightly different language and so that's but that's fun I mean that's exciting probably you know natural background digital rights and securities and white-collar crime you mentioned some of the things you were involved in seems natural that seems to be the profile doesn't it for the legal kind of pedigree I think it is because it's what's another interesting aspect about this is it covers a lot of regulatory regimes so obviously it's fraud its DOJ warily attorney's office but also FinCEN and other consent so FinCEN is basically the regulatory regimes that deals federal level deals with money transfer FinTech or yeah and it's so like it's so like Western Union young money back and forth but there's a lot of issues with moving tokens well why are froth right sounds like token frauds we could hold on the practice you're going to be in business for a while final question your vision on how this plays out just we can shoot it forward five years look at the trajectory I mean you must be sitting there pinching yourself like man this is pretty wild I mean is that where you're at what's your what's your vision of how this plays out I think we're in the beginning stages I think you know when I got involved with digital currency three and a half four years ago I didn't know where it was going but I knew it was going somewhere and and I knew that no matter what we projected it would go in a different direction and it has it's such a great technology so I think the token sales will continue I think as the regulatory regime becomes more certain will continue to figure out how things go but I think it's here to stay the amount of interest outside the valley now and other hot beds is extraordinary and so I think it's transformative and I just think we're at the beginning of that way great great stuff gran fondo one final final question because it's just popped in my head as I get a lot of questions from some of my smart legal friends who are you know kind of in litigation somewhere you know gee seas and companies summer at firms CXOs and large enterprises the number one question I get is may I got to pay attention to blockchain what do i do what do I find information what how should i attack learning and emerging conversing myself into it what advice would you give there so a couple things one is YouTube's got some great videos on just what is blockchain what is digital currency and I you know I sometimes check in on them and refresh memory round so they're great I also we have a blog so it's digital perspective so check out blogs that interest you and and that's those are great ways to do it there's also meetups like in Silicon Valley there's a theme you know so there's a lot of opportunity to really get to know and those are the ways I recommend you go to a couple of those etherion meetups they're really interesting will certainly have you back for checking in with us it's great to have you right down the street here from our Palo Alto office great firm Goodwin doing some great work they have a whole department dedicated to blockchain and ICS this is the cubes conversation here in Palo Alto I'm John forget thanks for watching [Laughter]
