 What could blockchain mean for Rabobank? Blockchain is very convenient in the collaboration between Rabobank and other businesses. For example when arranging a mortgage. You can easily need 5 to 10 signatures to arrange a mortgage. With blockchain you’ve got a shared ledger containing all this information. And all the involved parties can view it and check it on their own computer. Blockchain offers excellent prospects in all the areas in which Rabobank collaborates extensively with other businesses. Such as international payments, registering real estate and issuing shares. Blockchain could even be a great solution for machines and equipment that want to make payments independently. Blockchain is a complex technology. To properly determine whether blockchain would be useful for Rabobank, we’ve got to roll up our sleeves and get to work. That’s why we’re experimenting extensively in our Blockchain Acceleration Lab and researching dozens of test cases. One thing we’re looking at is how we can use the technology to share personal details safely. It is, for example, stated on the blockchain that you earned your diploma and that this information came straight from your college or university. This eliminates the need to double-check the authenticity of your diploma. Rabobank is also exploring the potential of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. But we don’t think they are developed enough at this stage. But we’ll keep tracking developments in the field. Collaboration is key in the blockchain industry. That’s why we’re participating in several national alliances and are an active partner for a number of startup accelerators. Plus we’re a member of the world’s largest international blockchain alliance. Watch the next video: blockchain and customers
