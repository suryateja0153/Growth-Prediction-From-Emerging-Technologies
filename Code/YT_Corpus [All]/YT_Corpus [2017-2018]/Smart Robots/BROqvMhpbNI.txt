 Alabama, USA Success with Robotic Automation - Solutions series M&B Hangers improves profitability and increases competitiveness with help from Fitz-Thors Engineering and KUKA Robotics Main Production Challenges for M&B Hangers: Increasing competition from low-cost countries; pressure to close facility and move production overseas Moving production risks intellectual property, control of quality and loss of jobs Increasing competitiveness requires automation, but merging robotics with vintage equipment is difficult Automation Goals: Improve traceability and reduce wastage Improve hanger counts to ensure each box has an exact number of hangers Speed up production while lowering inputs for improved profitability Automation Solution -- Overview: System successfully merges vintage forming equipment with KUKA robots Mimics human movements where possible, but increases efficiency and speed Cell contains 2 handling robots, 4 packing robots & 1 palletizing robot servicing 8 hanger machines Automation Solution -- Feeding and Forming: KUKA KR QUANTEC pro feeds bundles of wire to forming machine hoppers using magnetic gripper One KR QUANTEC pro delivers wire for 4 hanger forming machines Forming machines deliver hangers at a rate of more than 1 per second Automation Solution -- Payout Inspection: After ejection, each hanger is collected in groups of 25 in a payout system In the payout system, each hanger is visually inspected with a camera system Once a group of 25 quality-assured hangers is collected, those hangers are indexed to a delivery system Automation Solution -- Picking and Packing: Prior to packing, each box is laser printed with a tracking code At each packing station a KR AGILUS sixx robot services two forming machines Each KR AGILUS picks and packs 50 hangers at a time Automation Solution -- Taping and Palletizing: With an exact count of 500 hangers, each box is taped and sent to palletizing A KR QUANTEC PA robot places 3 boxes at a time on waiting pallets The palletizing cell can handle up to 3 different types of hanger products being produced at the same time Automation Benefits -- Output, Quality and Traceability: Output increased 250 percent compared to manual process Each box of hangers now contains exactly 500 hangers -- no more packing by weight with build-in overages Every box is now traceable by day, time and machine -- can discover and remedy issues quickly Automation Benefits -- Employees and Jobs: M&B Hangers in growth phase after a period of stagnancy -- more competitive and hiring more employees No more heavy leading and unloading required by human workers -- reduces risk for workplace injury Workers shifted to new, more-skilled jobs -- robot operation, process monitoring and material inspection Manufacturing stays in home country -- protecting IP and benefiting local economy
