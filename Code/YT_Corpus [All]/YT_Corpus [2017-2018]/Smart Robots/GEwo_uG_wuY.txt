I'm a woman. Ouch. We've come to rescue our friend, you evil bag of bolts... And you will be defeated by the very outmodes... ...that you SCORNED, and defaced. Yeah, because there's seven of us and only one of you. [Robot minions] Hehe! There's seven of us and... Eight. Nine... Uh did you count that one? I think so... WOULD YOU ALL STOP MOVING AROUND! SO FRUSTRATING! I THINK I COUNTED ONE OF YOU TWICE! While you're at it... Count these. As soon as we're done with you these hit the streets. This is the last day any outmode will ever seen!
