 The vast majority of brain related conditions have one thing in common: They affect the connections between brain and muscles, seriously limiting affected people's mobility. This creates 15 million wheelchair dependencies every year. The only way to start walking again is to re-establish muscle memory by re-inking the nerves connecting the muscles in the brain. Currently a neurological patient needs to be regularly trained in walking by 2 to 3 physiotherapists either manually or on a treadmill. These methods have severe flaws: They cause strain to the therapists, are time-consuming and expensive. Research shows that both these methods give similar results which are limited at best. This is why we've created lyra. Gait therapy with lyra is a game-changer for both the patient and physiotherapist. It allows for far more effective therapy sessions achieved in a shorter period of time. This means freeing up a lot of resources to take care of additional patients. Because Lyra's gait pattern mimics the natural motion of walking, patients can achieve a much higher number of repetitions per session than with conventional therapy. This means twice as high prognosis for recovery.  A therapy using lyra comes at a fraction of the price of a new wheelchair. Now the feeling of going for a walk again after weeks in a wheelchair is within anybody's reach at an affordable price. For life-changing results.
