 Artificial Intelligence was once nothing but science fiction, but thanks to recent technologies we've seen a huge leap in robotics innovation in the past few years. The video I have for you today is showcasing five robots that actually exist right now, and they are all capable of autonomously doing your chores. The robots in today's list are just the beginning of an almost entirely robot based future that we all imagined us kids. I hope you enjoy watching...let's begin! First up on this list is a robotic lawn mower this particular unit is sold by a company called Husqvarna I can definitely see a future where these aren't gonna be uncommon to see at almost every house in the neighborhood check it out! Next up on this list we got a robotic snow plow. Not everybody lives in an area that snows, but if you do you'll know how useful this thing would actually be, let's take a look. At number three we have the robotic vacuum cleaner some of you might already own one of these in your home these are definitely nice to have and they don't make nearly as much noise as your standard vacuum At number four we have a robotic window cleaner, if you live in a home with a lot of windows or you simply just have some glass doors in your home this would be really nice to have! All right so we showed the robotic vacuum cleaner but what about a robot that takes care of the non carpeted areas of your home this guy will do the trick! All right so that's it for today's video guys thank you so much for watching I'm really interested in this robotic stuff I really want to see how far it goes in the future I think this is just the beginning! It's pretty cool, don't forget to leave a thumbs up on this video and also feel free to leave a comment down below and I will see you next time!!
