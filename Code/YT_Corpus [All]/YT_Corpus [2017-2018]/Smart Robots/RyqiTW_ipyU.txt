  SOME BUSINESSES IN SAN FRANCISCO HAVE BEGUN USING SECURITY ROBOTS IN ORDER TO FEND OFF THE POOR. SAN FRANCISCO DOES HAVE A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT HOMELESS PROBLEM, AND THEY ARE ARGUING THAT THE HOMELESSNESS IS LEADING TO CRIME AND VANDALATION -- VANDALISM -- I WAS GOING TO SAY, IS THAT A WORD? THAT'S AN EXCELLENT WORD YOU JUST MADE UP THERE. WE HAVE SOME VANDALATION GOING ON HERE. VANDALISM. ONE NONPROFIT STARTED USING ONE OF THESE ROBOT SECURITY GUARDS THEN YOU MEAN THEY STARTED UTILATING IT? THAT'S RIGHT -- THE SPCA WAS ARGUING THAT HOMELESS PEOPLE WERE THREATENING SOME OF OUR EMPLOYEES, THE VANDALISM WAS OUT OF HAND, SO WE DECIDED TO USE THIS ROBOT THAT APPARENTLY DETERRED SOME OF THE CRIME -- YOU MUST BE WONDERING, WHAT DOES THE ROBOT DO? VISIT SHOOT LASERS AT PEOPLE? IT DOESN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN PROVIDE A DOMINATING FORCE AND ALSO JUST MONITOR WHAT'S GOING ON. THINK OF IT LIKE A PATROL CAR ON THE SIDE OF THE STREET. THESE ARE NOT THERE TO INTERVENE WITH ANYTHING BEING DONE, THEY ARE THERE TO PROVIDE A COMMANDING PRESENCE, TO HAVE SOMETHING THERE SIMILAR TO THE PATROL CAR, EVERYONE SEES THAT AND THEY IMMEDIATELY SAY I NEED TO BEHAVE. IT'S NOT ABOUT HAVING A HUMAN PRESENCE NECESSARILY, JUST AN AUTHORITATIVE PRESENCE. THEY HAVE CAMERAS IN THEM, YOU COULD JUST PLACE CAMERAS, WHAT ELSE DOES THE ROBOT DO? GOING BACK TO WHEN I WAS A POLICE OFFICER ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THEY TEACH YOU IS YOU HAVE TO HAVE A USE OF FORCE. AND THAT FIRST USE OF FORCE IS THE COMMANDING PRESENCE. WHAT A CAMERA THAT'S MOUNTED ON TOP OF A BUILDING DOES IS ABSOLUTELY NO PRESENCE. THE SPCA GOT SO MUCH PUSHBACK FOR UTILIZING THESE ROBOTS THAT THEY DECIDED TO STOP, THE CITY IS ALSO GETTING INVOLVED BECAUSE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE APPARENTLY EMPLOYING THESE ROBOTS, NOW YOU NEED TO TAKE PERMITS OUT IN ORDER TO HAVE ONE IN FRONT OF YOUR BUSINESS OR USE ONE ON A SIDEWALK. SO MAYBE THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE PERMIT PROCESS. BUT EITHER WAY THESE ROBOTS COST ABOUT SIX DOLLARS PER HOUR VERSUS THE $16 PER HOUR THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY A PERSON TO BE A SECURITY GUARD SO THERE'S THAT COMPONENT AS WELL. WHY DID THEY MAKE THE ROBOTS LOOK LIKE KLAN MEMBERS? THE COFOUNDER WE HEARD FROM WAS ARGUING THAT THEY INTENTIONALLY MADE THE ROBOTS LOOK LIKE THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK IT'S CUTE. IF I SAW ONE OF THOSE I WOULDN'T RUN, I WOULD TAKE A SELFIE. I WOULD RUN, THAT LOOKS TERRIFYING TO ME. ALSO IT LOOKS LIKE THE EGG ROBIN WILLIAMS CAME OUT OF ON MORK AND MINDY. IT MADE ME DISAPPOINTED THOUGH BECAUSE THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE THE ROBOTS IN I ROBOT. IT STILL TERRIFIED ME, I GUESS I'M THE DEMOGRAPHIC THAT THEY ARE TARGETING. THEY WANT TO KEEP YOU AWAY FROM THE SPCA. NOW LET ME MAKE MY SERIOUS POINTS, LET'S DEAL WITH HOMELESSNESS INSTEAD OF BUILDING THE MOATS AND EMPLOYING ROBOTS DEFEND THEM AWAY. A STORY WE DIDN'T GET TO EARLIER THIS WEEK WAS ABOUT ONE OF THE WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA, THE ONE THAT THREATENED THE AREA I LIVE IN, IT WAS THE BEL AIR FIRE -- I DON'T LIVE IN BEL AIR, I LIVE IN THE LESS AFFLUENT PART NEAR IT -- BUT THE REASON THAT FIRE STARTED IS THERE WAS A HOMELESS ENCAMPMENT NEARBY AND HOMELESS PEOPLE WERE COOKING FOOD WITH THE OPEN FLAME, BARREL FIRES ARE BECOMING COMMON IN LOS ANGELES BECAUSE HOMELESSNESS HAS GOTTEN OUT OF CONTROL, SO AGAIN YOU CAN BUILD YOUR MOATS, YOU CAN TRY TO DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO TO TRY TO GET HOMELESS PEOPLE AWAY FROM YOU, IT WON'T WORK. THINGS ARE GETTING BAD, WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM. LOOK, THE ROBOTS ARE THE BEGINNING. RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE NOT SHOOTING LASERS OUT, THEY ARE NOT BUMPING INTO THE HOMELESS PEOPLE UNTIL THEY LEAVE, I GET THE CAMERAS AND THE ROTATING HEAD WILL SCARE OFF SOME PEOPLE WHO MIGHT WANT TO BREAK IN, I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT ONCE YOU HAVE DEPLOYED YOUR ARMY OF ROBOTS, WHAT IS NEXT? IF YOU WANT TO PREVENT THE CRIME I GET THAT, BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF YOU WANT TO FEND OFF THE HOMELESS THAT'S A DIFFERENT THING. NOW YOU HAVE SENT NONHUMANS TO ATTACK HUMANS, IN A SENSE, RIGHT? THAT'S THE FIRST STEP, IN WON'T BE THE LAST STEP. THIS ISN'T RIGHT. I'M NOT NAœVE, I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE LIBERALS WHO ARE LIKE, THE HOMELESS ARE ALL ANGELS AND YOU SHOULD GO HUG ONE OF THEM. SOME OF THEM HAVE SERIOUS MENTAL ISSUES AND SOMETIMES VIOLENCE HAPPENS, ETC., SO I GET IT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THE ANSWER ISN'T EITHER HAVE THEM ALL OVER THE STREETS OR CRUSH THEM. THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER ANSWER AND WE CAN'T JUST SEND OUR ROBOTS AFTER THEM. OBVIOUSLY SAN FRANCISCO ISN'T DOING IT RIGHT, BECAUSE THAT LEVEL OF PROBLEM DOESN'T EXIST IN OTHER CITIES. IT'S STARTING TO EXIST EVERYWHERE IN HIGHER LEVELS, ONE OF THE ISSUES IS INCOME INEQUALITY, THEY DON'T ALL HAVE MENTAL ISSUES, SOME OF THEM JUST CAN'T AFFORD -- I WAS TALKING TO A JUSTICE DEMOCRAT RUNNING FOR CONGRESS YESTERDAY, CORY BUSH, WHILE SHE WAS GOING TO SCHOOL SHE HAD TO LIVE OUT HER FOR CAR. AND ROBOTS ARE DEFINITELY NOT THE ANSWER. I'M BIG ON INTERSECTIONS, I THINK THAT THE GAY COMMUNITY IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT HAS A GREAT VOICE SHOULD SPEAK UP FOR THE HOMELESS PEOPLE. YOU TALKED ABOUT IT EARLIER, WHAT PERSON THAT IS SCHIZOPHRENIC OR THAT IS SUFFERING FROM A DEEP STATE OF MANIA IS GOING TO RUN FROM THAT ROBOT? WHAT EFFECTIVENESS -- WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE REAL ISSUES, THE REAL ISSUE WITH HOMELESSNESS, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE MENTALLY ILL, WE KEEP IGNORING MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE BECAUSE WE TRY TO SWEEP THIS UNDER THE RUG, IT'S A BIG ISSUE. ALL OF US WILL BE AFFECTED BY IT AT SOME POINT. I WAS HOMELESS. I FEEL LIKE EVERY TIME I COME HERE I BELONG TO EVERY TRAGIC GROUP, I'VE HAD A ROUGH LIFE, THAT'S WHY I'M A COMEDIAN, SO I CAN MAKE JOKES ABOUT IT. I WAS HOMELESS. YOU ARE ALREADY AT THE BOTTOM. I WAS HOMELESS WITH TWO CHILDREN, ALREADY AT THE BOTTOM. YOU ARE GOING TO SHOO ME AWAY WITH A ROBOT, YOU COULD HAVE USED THE MONEY TO MAKE THAT ROBOT TO HELP FEED SOME OF THE HOMELESS. MAYBE GIVE YOU A JOB SO YOU AREN'T HOMELESS. I WOULD BE THE SECURITY GUARD AND YOU WON'T NEED THE ROBOT. I WOULD'VE TAKEN SIX DOLLARS PER HOUR BECAUSE I WAS HOMELESS.
