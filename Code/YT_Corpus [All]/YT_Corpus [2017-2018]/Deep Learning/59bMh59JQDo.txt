 let's play a game close your eyes and picture a shoe okay did anyone picture this this how about this we may not even know why but each of us is biased toward one shoe over the others now imagine that you're trying to teach a computer to recognize a shoe you may end up exposing it to your own bias that's how bias happens in machine learning but first what is machine learning well it's used in a lot of technology we use today machine learning helps us get from place to place gives us suggestions translate stuff even understands what you say to it how does it work with traditional programming people hand code the solution to a problem step by step with machine learning computers learn the solution by finding patterns and data so it's easy to think there's no human bias and that but just because something is based on data doesn't automatically make it neutral even with good intentions it's impossible to separate ourselves from our own human biases so our human biases become part of the technology we create in many different ways there's interaction bias like this recent game where people were asked to draw shoes for the computer most people drew ones like this so as more people interacted with the game the computer didn't even recognize these latent bias for example if you were training a computer on what a physicist looks like and you're using pictures of past physicists your algorithm will end up with a latent bias skewing towards men and selection bias say you're training a model to recognize faces whether you grab images from the internet or your own photo library are you making sure to select photos that represent everyone since some of our most advanced products use machine learning we've been working to prevent that technology from perpetuating negative human bias from tackling offensive or clearly misleading information from appearing at the top of your search results page to adding a feedback tool in the search bar so people can flag hateful or inappropriate autocomplete suggestions it's a complex issue and there's no magic bullet but it starts with all of us being aware of it so we can all be part of the conversation because technology should work for everyone [Music]
