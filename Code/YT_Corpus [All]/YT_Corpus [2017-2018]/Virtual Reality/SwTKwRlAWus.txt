crazy but this RC car is not working this one's not working these are all missing parts we have some work to do we got up this morning and like everything that could go wrong did go wrong but that's okay because every day is a new day and we're still gonna make today an awesome one we made it to the hobby shop and they've got a whole bunch of really cool RC trucks of cars Carlton you see where it's going I can totally see where it's going I don't know oh he's playing right over my head what are we gonna get today originally our plan was we have this big box that we did our 1 million subscriber Orbeez video with yeah and we have like 20 super bubbles that we're gonna fill up with water this giant super wobble bubble watch box thing yeah so we were gonna build like a big sand box but it was gonna be full of bubble bubbles full of water and then total disasters happened all morning I was hooking up this giant red garden hose to try and start filling up the wobbles and look the spigot just totally snapped off and so water was like spraying everywhere come here I'll show you where it happened see you guys right here it's like all wet still the ground still really soggy you can see it with the pipe broke off right there coming out of the wall it was so crazy I totally wish that I would have filmed the whole thing but I was in such a panic just trying to get the water shut off so it didn't flood the backyard we were all running around we were all too worried about getting the water shut off so we didn't flood the property so I didn't vlog any of it I didn't film any of it now that our C cars are not working we've got them all broken down I think the drift cars getting fixed and charged they just have all this stuff so I just decided to scrap that whole idea and when stead we're gonna go to Las Vegas and we're gonna get some awesome new RC cars so we can try out some of the new stuff Kyle what we're gonna go buy more RC cars okay okay mom we're gonna go to Las Vegas love you back you plans for Mario artists I'm on the Bowser battle are you really yeah this is Moon Kingdom whoa that's crazy cool well good luck dude we'll see you later yeah [Music] you

then we're going to look at a bunch of them and you guys have to help us pick by voting down in the comments below I always put the airplanes and the helicopters look hi don't they yes because I wanna be with them in there up so that's a good point right who doesn't want to just like get that one and see if they gonna fly it around doesn't seem like the parts are really expensive though I don't know they were down and people could touch that I think I would just as soon get a drone if I was going to get a helicopter but I don't know which one do you guys think would be cooler would you get an RC helicopter or an RC airplane which one do you think would be the coolest airplane or a helicopter you should vote down in the comments below whichever one gets the most votes maybe oh these guys
