 the future of pain relief may come from somewhere you least expect it in the form of a virtual reality video game researches say all you've got to do is distract your brain dr. max Gomez here to explain exactly what that might mean doctor yeah exactly if you guys ever tried virtual reality not yet yeah okay well you know if you've ever tried it you know that virtual reality can transport your mind to incredible digital worlds maybe you notice that while you were in those fantasy worlds you weren't thinking about your knee pain or backache that's that same effect that's becoming pain therapy Kevin washe finds relief from his pain by immersing his mind in a 360-degree world of snow and ice his back was severely burned in a small explosion have worked there's one time when I did during when got to peel off my bandages will in there and may peel off a couple bandages and I didn't really notice Kevin is one of a number of patients at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle using virtual reality to help manage their pain it's a means to pull people's attention away from very painful procedures but virtual reality does more than distract the brain pain is a complex interaction between pain signals and the way the brain processes and interprets them by occupying parts of the brain with other tasks virtual reality may prevent some nerve signals from being interpreted as pain the areas of the brain that light up with pain light up lessen or just not processing as much dr. Patterson uses a game called snow world using VR goggles patients hit targets with snowballs taking their minds off their procedures overall we're seeing you know 35% reductions in pain is pretty typical where you see somebody's pain drop from severe to moderate that pain reduction translates into less pain medication especially opioids which means lower risk of addiction and possibly preventing some overdoses for patients like Kevin any relief from the pain can help on the road but some people take the view that they can handle pain and so they refuse pain medication but pain releases stress chemicals that actually interfere with healing that's why painkillers are actually medically necessary but virtual reality does that without drugs and while this particular set up was really done in the hospital so that's covered by hospital insurance and so forth you can do it at home you know any virtual reality video game anything it transports you somewhere else the virtual reality and be on a beach somewhere that kind of thing could you watch a regular movie watch comedy routine I don't know other stuff it's really immersive though I mean something that really takes you into that other world and kind of really distracts you also in this case you're actually playing a game so you're using other parts your brain as well all that is part of taking away from the pain signals interesting and it's interesting all without drugs too so that's a big plus dr. max thank you
