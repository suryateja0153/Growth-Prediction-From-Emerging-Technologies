 What if I told you there was a virtual revolution happening right now and that every single one of you would be affected if not today than in the near future it's staggering to think via casino resurgence in the past four years and there are over 150 million virtual reality users in the world today now these users range from everything from young kids to grownups to grandparents like you just saw that was an 81 year old granddad who was using virtual reality for the first time a part of what's been getting VR so much attention and hype over the past few years has been things like that people's reactions to it it's mesmerizing to watch my whole life is a digital creative director I've spent time trying to find trying to get people moments to escape reality but my passion was sparked when I was a kid my story actually begins in the early 80s I was the youngest of four kids and we grew up in quite a rough neighborhood my mom taught me from a very early age that if I wanted to build a future for myself and get out of this place I had to work really hard not just hard but super hard and that if I wanted something I had to try to be the best at it now we didn't have a lot you get to share everything being the youngest of four when I always had to wait till the very end to play with it everything from our first bike to our first scale electric set and you can see how happy is when I I only got my hands on it and that horse that was on our playground was my favorite toy can guess why because there were four seats which means I didn't have to wait so mom taught me and drawed it into me every day work hard she'd say build a better future for yourself and my dad well he taught me that you can be anything that you want and in fact he taught me that being a girl should never stop me from doing the things that set my heart on fire and I took that learning and those lessons from my parents to a completely different level when one day my dad brought home one of these it was the Commodore 64 now I don't know how dad managed to afford this thing but he did and it sparked my passion for technology that still exists today make us proud this year two million families will send their kids off to college but tell you these kids won't be able to compete because they lack computer skills a home computer can help the Commodore 64 gives you more computer for less money than anyone else instead of saving for your kids education maybe you should spend a little for it and don't you love that at the end of that they weren't targeting a young boys they were targeting at the young girls it wasn't a Barbie doll that came out of that gift it was a Commodore 64 well I spent most of my childhood trying to ace this I wanted to be better than my brothers at everything and I was pretty bad at it and I can tell you but I worked really hard I practice every single day when they weren't watching and then one day I played them and I beat them and I was pretty good and I realized something that if I worked hard and did something I enjoyed I'd become pretty good at it so good that it would make me feel invincible because if I could beat them then I could do anything right I loved being in the imaginary worlds when I was playing on that Commodore 64 it made me feel it made me forget where we were from it made me feel invincible I could be a racing car driver if I wanted to be I could be a ninja or even better I could be a Ghostbuster now when I realized that I could beat my brothers at this something happened it gave me a level of confidence that I forgot where we came from I forgot that we didn't have much I forgot that we had to share everything and I became so confident in what I could do that I knew hard work and passion would get me there I turned that fear and I became fearless about everything I spent a decade in my career as digital creative director trying to find experiences that would take people to another world something that would be unforgettable just as I did when I was a child and I played that Commodore 64 and as new mediums emerged I harnessed the power of each of them everything from the web to mobile to creating interactive immersive experiences and then in 2013 something really interesting happened we pushed beyond the frame we received one of these at the time I was working at AKQA a digital creative agency we received the first dk1 headset which was a developer kit from oculus when we tried it something happened I wanted everybody to try it it gave me goosebumps my legs turned to jelly something happened I felt like that little child receiving the Commodore 64 again these imaginary worlds transported us and we were so excited within eight weeks we had pitched an idea to Nissan one of our clients to debut the oculus rift at the Tokyo Motor Show it sounds crazy now I think about it this was a technology we knew nothing about we'd never ever used it we didn't know how to play in it but we were excited about putting this into the hands of young drivers so that they could concept their own cars working in a new technology and a new medium filled us with a sense of fear joy and this nervous exciting it challenged everything we knew about immersive experiences we had to change not only the way we worked but the way we thought and a pro these virtual worlds but it was seeing the reactions of millions of people at the Tokyo Motor Show going through the PR for the first time taking the headset off and being mesmerised and I knew then that this wasn't a technology this was an entirely new medium and what was exciting what excited me the most is we had barely scratched the surface of what was possible and so I decided to move my whole life to New York where I joined frame stores virtual reality studio now at the time there were only a few studios in the world who were dabbling in the dark arts or VR and I wanted to learn as much as I could I wanted to be the best at it now over the past four years in be our frame stores virtual reality studio we've created a number of experiences everything that you can imagine and all of them are being focused on transporting you to a completely different world making you feel like you can do anything and be anywhere but you know what the most important thing I discovered in the past four years of working in VR is that working in any new medium is really about a mindset whether we transport you to being a Marvel Avenger in the heart of a battle scene or whether we take a group of school kids on a bus on an ordinary school bus and then transport them onto the surface of Mars so that they one day may be inspired to go to Mars or whether we take you and put you into the heart of JK Rowling's Wizarding World where you come face to face with the majestic Thunderbird vo is really about a mindset it's not about a skillset working in any new medium requires you to be fearless because it is hard work we felt so many times and every time we fouled I felt like I couldn't do this but you have to be fearless in your approach you have to believe you can do it you have to show grit and tenacity and you have to know of course it's going to be hard work because if it was easy then everybody would do it bi is forcing us to work right outside of our comfort zones if challenging everything we know and if you thrive in adversity then this is the medium that you will want to claim it's frightening it's scary and it's challenging all at the same time and you have to take so many risks but the rewards outweigh the risks now what's exciting is we've barely left the starting blocks this is the lumina brothers arrival of the train in 1895 they were pioneers in early filmmaking they played this film which was a first motion piece to a to a theater full of theater goers just like yourselves who ran out of the theater screaming and shouting because they believed that train was literally going to hit them right in the face I know crazy right we are still in the early days of they are much like the early days of filmmaking it would take a decade of filmmakers to master their craft to even attempt the first feature film which was the story of the Kelly Gang in 1906 and it would be many many more these many years later before they would craft filmmaking to achieve the greatness of what you understand to be a feature film today now working in VR requires us to understand that it is still early days many people still think that VR is a fad and it's not going to take off well let me put that into a little bit of context for you when IBM CEO Thomas Watson said that there would only be a world market for five computers he never imagined that in the next 50 years there would be a computer in every single American household now a huge caveat Hey when Thomas was talking about computers they were the size of the house and sure nobody really wanted one of those now but that's the whole point any new medium starts off big and clunky it gets more compact it gets more affordable and you have to have a vision about where it's going to go you have to believe in its potential and those that do will reap the world's and benefits well let's not forget 'dallas anak he was CEO of 20th 20th Century Fox now he underestimated the power of the TV he never imagined that the TV would not only one day that plywood box that he thought was just a fad and people would get bored with it not only would it be in every one of your households but it would be slimmer than my iPhone now we have to move beyond the spectacle of VR and we have to start shifting our focus into a sense of purpose for this new medium right now we are in the early days but I imagine where VR could transform education imagine where VR could actually heal you or imagine if veal could transform the way you train and perform as an athlete well guess what you guys don't need to imagine because it's already happening VR is transforming education in a way that I never imagined the information that was once in a text book is being lifted you can step right into the heart of human body and explore every single facet it is changing the way we not only educate children but ourselves and the army is using VR and exposure therapy to help War veterans recover from the traumatic experiences of war we never imagined that a medium like this could be used in such a way and the NFL in the USA have been using VR for the past few years not only to measure athletic performance but to actually improve athletic ability on the field I imagine a world of possibilities for VR maybe it's the kidding me I love to dream big but imagine if virtual reality could change the way you you learn change the way you Kate yourselves change the way you heal change the way you think about the world I imagine a world where imagination and curiosity will power progress in this medium and I believe all of this is possible in the future virtual reality is going to get more compact it will be slimmer it will be faster and it will be more affordable which means that over 90% of households will have a virtual reality's virtual reality headset or an augmented reality headset in their hands and where we have only six degrees of freedom I believe in the future there will be a hundred degrees of freedom which means you won't be limited to the space that we're we're in which I'm standing in the future I believe that virtual reality would be more connected which means one day I won't be standing here in front of you but we would virtually be sharing the same experience together I believe that it will change the way we connect as humans and the change the way we interact this week alone Facebook announced Facebook spaces I wrote this presentation a while ago and I already feel like the future has already happened I can't bet I can barely keep up Facebook spaces allows for us to not only be in the same virtual world together to hang out to learn things imagine if you never had to go work again you can virtually connect with anyone at any time and I believe that virtual reality will coupled with artificial intelligence would change the way we interact as humans imagine if you could put a headset on and you had your own digital human powered by AI to learn anything you wanted today I'll learn a language tomorrow I'll learn how to do heart surgery the limitations the things that virtual reality allows us to do is open up our world and create unlimited potential for humans I believe all of this is possible and as I navigate the virtual realms I encourage you to do the same it will be hard work it requires grit it requires you to push and yourselves right outside of your comfort zone but when you do it's so exhilarating it requires you to deliver ideas with a sense of purpose something that added that adds value to the world work hard work with people with the same mindset as yourself to be the best that you can be and whatever you do in this medium be fearless thank you Josh city ladies and gentlemen
