 hey everybody today rahdo runs through escape room the game virtual reality Edition which is a very very cool continuation of the escape the room the game series that's been around for it I have to man I haven't done any plays of the original game but ever since I heard about the VR one I just knew I had to check it out and the game comes with two thrilling VR escape rooms which it's kind of hard for me to show because of course the whole notion of an escape room in your home is you're gonna go through a series of very clever diabolical devious puzzles that you have to figure out and so if I show you how to play the game I'm spoiling it you don't need to buy it so here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna open the box I'm gonna show you the basically what it is and I'm gonna show you the first what you see within the first 10 seconds of starting I'm not gonna solve any puzzles for you at all you'll get a hint for what kind of puzzles await you but you'll still have to actually play the game to know anything about how the story and all the rest of it works so there won't be any real spoilers but I mean I've gotta open this up and show you how it works because all it's so awesome I mean just look at how happy this family is let me show you hi alright let's get in here now it's interesting first of all like I said this is a continuation of a series and the base game escape room came with the chrono decoder which is this big contraption that when you buy the base game you get this it's battery-powered and this is what runs the sessions it's a timer it's got a speaker so it does audio and music and stuff and it also is what you use to unlock your progress because it comes with a whole bunch of these funky keys that you plug in now of course I don't have the base game so to replicate the function of that I've got to use a smartphone and I already got my smartphone set up to be the digital version of the chrono decoder instead of the regular analog one although if you already owned escape room the game you'd have one of these so you could use this or you could use the smartphone version your choice so let's go on ahead and go on in alright we get some instructions there pretty simple straightforward stuff very short just enough to get you in you know how to put the mass together and a description of how the keys work the keys are a big important element of how escape room the game works regardless whether you're doing it digitally or analog the game has a bunch of these keys they have letters and numbers and symbols and zigzags and all kinds of different stuff and while you're trying to escape the room you're always on the lookout for a four-digit code I would say but it isn't necessarily for numbers it could be three letters in a number or two symbols and a number and a letter and they don't all come to you at once you find portions of this code and when you finally figure out what the four-digit code is you've figured out all the different puzzles and you know oh it's three a B triangle then you'll know well you know what the keys I have to do in order are this one because it's got a three this one because it has an A this one because it has a B and then this one again because it also has a triangle and so you have to put this in now I'm going to show you how that works in my digital version of this in a second but anyway there's just a little summary I think these are for the most part with the exception of the stuff about the mask in the virtual reality which even comes with the health and safety warning in case you are subject to vertigo or something like I haven't even read what the warnings are but there they are in case you're worried about such things you can pause and read all that but anyway enough the rules let's actually get to the game itself so like I said the game comes with two different adventures the submarine which is the easier one so the game definitely recommends you do that first and behind enemy lines which is a bit tougher and I will actually confirm mecca's Jenna I have done both of these now this is standard for escape room the game they always come I believe with three envelopes a fur apart one a part two and a part three and you're not supposed to open part two or part three until the chrono decoder tells you to because you've put in once you've found that code I was talking about and you've put the matching keys in if you were right it'll tell you boom hey good job open the next envelope and continue the adventure now I'm not even gonna go into these let's put the other behind enemy lines aside for a bit so here is one of the two now the timer's if I start if you want you're supposed to read this out loud so everybody knows what the story is now you can pause read this yourself if you want I think that should be legible if you pause alright so that's the deal long story short we're on a submarine at the bottom of the ocean how exciting and while oh okay and now I'm gonna open this text interesting the game tells you open it and confirm the contents before you start the timer just to make sure because if you're missing something that would be really bad news now I'm gonna openness I'm gonna pull out the contents of this um and if you consider that a spoiler get out now hit the I in the top-right corner screen go to final thoughts but just let me let me know that tell you it's not really you will see these I'm not gonna show you anything that you won't see in literally the first five seconds of playing I'm not gonna tell you how to solve any of these puzzles you're not gonna know just by knowing it'll just give you some kind of idea of what sorts of puzzles await so here we go I'm opening it now and pulling out all the stuff so what do we got we got this little map now this if you've done other escape rooms at home you knows this is a pretty common thing hey here's a here's a visual reminder of what it is where you are so you can kind of imagine you're in that space you're in a submarine but we won't have to imagine because we're gonna go here in VR and I'll show you that in a minute soon we've got that now we've got this disc thing and we've got this piece of paper here and we've got this other disc thing and we've got this grid thing and we got this thingy and oh and we got hint cards I'll come back to those in a second oh and we've got our hint decoder well actually I'll talk about that right now is that everything do I get everything out of here I reach around nope oh right right right these things and then there's also these three thingies so there you go folks that is what you have this is the basis of how you start trying to solve the puzzles there may or may not be information on the other sides of these I'm not even gonna flip them over but you can imagine you can start messing with these things and doing stuff with them and start trying to figure out puzzles but that's it spoiler time over but let's continue talking a little bit about how the hint system works the game comes with this the hints decoder and each adventure has a deck of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 hints now these are supposed to come up at 55 minutes 50 minutes 45 40 at certain milestones the the chrono decoder will beep at you and tell you hey you can look at another hint in fact that's going to end start the digital to kroehner alright and so time is going we're already trying to figure out all of these things we're in a regular escape room we'd be using this as a reference for where we are but we're not we're in a VR escape room I'll come back to the VR in a second once we get to 55 minutes it's gonna say if you want to you don't have to but you can look at hint card number one now if you look at it right now you can't really see anything I mean because you'd have to kind of squint really hard to be able to read the text on this but what happens is if you take the hint decoder and you slip it in here you will then be able to read what the hint is now just to show you how this works I'm going to show you the first one um close your eyes for a second if you don't want to see the first hand again you would see this hint within five minutes so it's not a big spoiler here's what you see kind of hard to read on the screen there you go so that's just a little hint okay everybody you can open your eyes if you didn't want a spoiler so that's how the hints work you don't need them you could try to make the game harder for yourself by ignoring the hints whenever it tells you to use one but in all honesty I would not recommend it because Jen I found some of these some of these hints actually kind of most of these hints are absolutely essential I mean to be fair there's a fair number of these where when we got to him or like we figured that out ten minutes ago we just don't know how to do it you're not helping me at all hint um but some of these hints I don't think any rational person could figure out how to do some of these things if they hadn't looked at the hints but anyway so this is the hint system it's optional whether you want to use it or not at certain times the other nice thing about it though is it gives you an idea of how well you're doing if you get to thirty minutes and you read this hint and the hint is about something you didn't even know exists yet then you're really falling behind because they expected you by thirty minutes to be in a place where you're worrying about this so it kind or on the flipside if you look at thirty minutes and you look at you said yeah we figured that out um you know a while ago then you're ahead of the curve you know kind of thing so anyway that's the hint system but enough about all the oh well actually I'll show you how the keys work too so this is the virtual decoder you can see I've got four slots to slip in I've got all these keys and again like I said earlier the keys have letters and numbers and squiggles on them and shapes and all kinds of stuff so if we have fig if we think we have successfully figured out all these puzzle things and we like I said what was that example I gave oh we want to be triangle so you take the triangle put it in the first slot and then well I think I thought it was a B right so I take an a card and a key and a B key and then I take the other one and now you can see there's stacks them so there's multiples I take this last one I put it in okay if I can and boom fail I don't know if you heard it it made a bad noise and we just lost a minute so the game definitely discourages you from Hey we figured out what three of the keys are let's just start throwing all the keys in to figure out that fourth slot because we couldn't figure this one out if you do that you will burn through time so you really don't want to slip these keys in until you've got it right so anyway that's how the keys work and you can use it either in this virtual system or in the real world analog one if you've got the neat gadget that came with the original game anyway timers coming up and in just a few seconds it's gonna tell us to look at hit number one but we already did that but okay you folks been very very patient I think it's time to show what we really came for using Jen's phone here the VR yeah you could just imagine you're seeing a submarine from that picture let's actually go into that submarine shall we come here you here it is here is where the magic happens you gotta do a little bit not really assembly you just have to kind of do some folding so it kind of folds like this and this is so that you know ambient light doesn't when you're blaring peeking in you you don't get light bleed in this this comes over the top here's a little button that you can use that does this kind of magnetic detector thing that counts is clicking like a clicking your mouse these snap into place and we're ready to go but hey there's nothing in here because I haven't put the phone in all right so kept okay so this is already been going you were supposed to start this and this oh and it just made the noise to say look in your first flew there's no starting at the same time so it says put this in and then close it and that's how it knows you can see it's loading because it detected that we closed and you actually you can see before you even do it it's a stereoscopic thing you've got two eyes worth of in from but this you can't this does not transport you into a submarine does it let's go on ahead and actually go in okay and here we are I'm in the sub we're at the bottom of the ocean what's going on okay all righty there's some ocean either a shark sharks sharks and there's a sonar and let's see Owen there's a seat now you'll notice when you look at certain things the the cursor changes that lets you know you can interact with them let's interact with this chair don't worry it's not spoiler oh the chairs don't really do much of anything they just squeak but there are other things you know in here that I might potentially be able to interact with can I interact with the TV's connect with the sonar can Aaron for the consoles is that a telephone there is that a shark can I work for the shark can I make the thing come alive and activate those claws can I turn the lights on it's really dark in here can I use the periscope I'm not gonna tell you any of that stuff can I um you know flip that that switch over there if I looked at it it would let me know and then I might start interacting with things but I'm not gonna do any of it folks I'm just looking around and um the amazing thing about this because this is stereoscopic view you can't tell what you're watching but this feels three-dimensional to me there is def I mean this ladder just jumps out at me it feels like it's right in front of my face really really cool it's using the same design as what's it called Google cardboard I think so if you're familiar at all of that it's like um virtual reality on the cheap with your smartphone this is how it works and I've never tried it before but I am super duper impressed I'm gonna shut up a bit so you can hear the ambient sound so you can imagine you know you're here you are transported and well I'm actually looking around looking for clues and whatnot everybody else of course is still at the table trying to figure out what to do and they might be saying hey um is there something that looks like this and I'd look around and I'd actually try to physically find it and maybe there is maybe there isn't maybe I'll interact with something that gives me information that I have to relay to everybody else because they're working on the puzzles so that was just a quick brief look let's say one more time say goodbye to the shark everybody bye shark oh where are you there you are bye Sharky all right let's uh let's leave this underwater tomb and go back to the real world okay hey awesome right folks I mean again I can't really stress it and you know just looking out like this doesn't really get across but and you're looking at in your YouTube video really doesn't capture just how evocative and transformative it is to be in these variety rooms now the interesting thing is I was just looking through everybody looked at me looking like this looking like a doofus and meanwhile they were all working on the stuff trying to figure out you know the standard what do you call them escape room type things there and the thing is anybody can grab this at any time you know and just look through it and you know and this is definitely something Zen I found we would hand it off I would look around I'd see what I can find and in Jin would look in and see if SH and sometimes she spotted stuff I didn't see and vice-versa um you know and so this is definitely something where everybody's taking turns because it's just so cool to be in there although again this is where the rubber hits the road if you don't figure out all of this stuff you're gonna run out of time and lose in fact we've got a minute until we get our next clue at 50 and so yeah other games where they just have one of these kind of things to say imagine you're in a scientist lab or or a haunted cabin or whatever this can't compare to the awesome factor of this I absolutely love it so now again like I said I'm not actually gonna actually solve anything so we're done that although I don't know there's one more thing I want to show so you might have just - yeah here's all the stuff we have to figure out and of course there's gonna be plenty or stuff in these two things that once we've used these to figure out what keys and we've you know used information we find in virtual reality eventually we'll open this up there'll be new things in here and we'll eventually need to find a second code to put into the machine that will eventually let us open up this last envelope where we do our last little bit of stuff and again switching back and forth between the real world and the virtual world trying to solve the problem that was laid out right here that's how it works now here's one thing I'm gonna do oh yeah I just made the noise to tell us hey there's another clue time for another clue I'm not even going to open any of these I'm not gonna show you what's in part 1 part 2 or part 3 of behind enemy lines but I am going to show you the VR circumstance cuz it's you know the submarines cool it's really neat let's see I'm not gonna resume game I'm going to menu yes leave game I'm going to show you how the other one works because we thought this was neat but then when we saw behind enemy lines we're like wow that's really amazing by the way I know if I mentioned here's all the other adventures in the escape the escape room the game series all these other ones are require real virtual or real world stuff including that gasma or get a gizmo gadget-gadget gizmo gasma but we're going into virtual reality we're going behind enemy lines so let's load this one up and write again I could be you need two phones or the gizmo I'm going go into the VR it'll take a little bit to load you remind you put put your airplane mode on cuz you don't want to run out of battery life this app does suck a battery life a lot anyway let's go ahead and start the VR environment put it in close it up and now if you don't want to see this at all folks I'm done all I'm going to do is just show you a different environment and how neat it is you can kind of start to see it a little bit if you don't want to see it you want to go in completely unspoiled hit the I go to final thoughts in 5 4 3 2 1 ok you stuck around you're very brave let's go in all right Jen is laughing uproariously about the Gaz Moe but that is the least of our problem folks because we are in a helicopter that has crashed and looking around we're stuck up in a tree or something like that it's kind of hard to tell you can look down and again you don't quite get that feel but for me this is totally 3d I don't know if that warning thing talks about it but this could induce vertigo in people who are susceptible to it I mean the door feels up close that branch feels farther away and then that stuff that feels that feels like it's miles down I mean I'm actually kind of leaning forward as I do this in real life and and I can it's it's amazing and then again yo here's where we are this is the escape room and this is the amazing thing this is an escape room you know the whole thing just shook and you know and our propellers kind of busted the whole thing just shook tight I heard it I could feel it you can do this with a real world escape room I mean you could put a bunch of TV screens all over the place but it wouldn't make you feel like you're there like this does and all the details there was a thing you can interact with here's the thing you and Rick Oh what that is nothing much or is it I won't actually talk anything more about it but yeah there we are there's some radio stuff and there's mountains off in the distance and this has got to be just about one of the coolest escape rooms ever I mean oh the whole thing's crooked and you've got an hour to figure out how to get out of here because you might imagine what's gonna happen in an hour if you don't pull it off that joysticks is like I can just reach out and touch it and the compass is going crazy what's going on folks oh it's a long way down but anyway that oh it just shifted again us to see that I know nothing's moving but I'm standing up and I feel it but anyway that's it this is the other escape room let's go on ahead now two final thoughts in five four three two [Music]
