experience when it comes to virtual reality it's an all-in-one system you get the little gamer remote control to go along with it you know we've been talking behind the scenes about how this will be the biggest gift of the holiday season this year and now you get early access to it if you got a birthday before the holidays for the early shopping for the holidays or if you yourself want to try it out you know I start thinking about with young children there are places in the world that unfortunately are no longer safe to travel to that I want my children to see and explore that the pyramids yeah Egypt you know there I don't know that I'll ever be able to take my children up to the North Pole or down to Antarctica it's a way to educate them it's a way to say you want to put on a gaming experience fine put this on but I want you to go explore the Great Barrier Reef I want you to go where the Great Wall of China this is a way that everybody can do it both from an education perspective and the safety way too from the comfort of your own experience something brand-new and the fact that you get control it's not like watching a movie you look at what you want to look at and it follows what you want to see I'm gonna go into water so I want to show you guys we've got this mirrored on to our television set because I want you to see how I'm gonna be able to look all the way around I'm gonna be able to see what's happening up down to the side to the left to the right it is so simple and easy and yet so fun and immersive look there's another diver right there hey buddy what are you doing there's some fish underwater all of this cool stuff going on so I hate to say it but I have certainly aged out of the space program there is no time in life that I will ever be admitted to astronaut school it just is never gonna happen I'm too old my mom and dad they've aged out of certain activities as well they've aged out of possibly going to see the Great Wall of China they may never get a chance to see the London Eye or right on that ride but I want them to be able to experience it and the great thing about virtual reality is you're almost looking back on it like it's a memory like you were actually there the other thing about it too is with all this great free content through YouTube online you realize that you could be watching a movie and nobody around you needs to be bothered you realize there will be movies that are shot in virtual reality mode where you can watch and look around and see what you want to do but it's also a totally completely secluded private viewing experience you could be watching that Wonder Woman film or just seeing the trailer - and nobody could hear a single word of it and you could feel like you were living inside of it this is your own personal viewing booth and for those of you that have gamers in your life this is what they're looking for this holiday season and the model that they think they want which has the same features and specs as this one does is three four or five times the price this works with Apple phones it works with Android phones the more advanced your phone is if it's got built-in gyroscope you know it's gonna be accessible to a ton of additional extra content and experiences sure but anybody with a large screen smartphone is going to be able to download thousands of hours of free content more and more and more is coming all you have to do really go to youtube and type in virtual reality VR be able to just VR you don't spell it crowd or space outer space you do an astronaut do you want a skydive I am never ever ever ever gonna jump out of a perfectly good airplane but now I know what it feels like to skydive and for those gamers in your life for your son for your grandson with that built-in or that included I should say Bluetooth controller this is that classic style controller it's super intuitive incredibly easy for you to use and let me show you some of the adjustments here with this remarkable headset so this is gonna accommodate phones up to about six point three inches and look as I'm moving you're seeing that image that visual moving on the screen this securely holds those phones in place you simply close it it's snaps shut you have individual eye control so you're gonna be able to adjust each eye individually plus the interpupillary so you have all kinds of adjustments to make this a customized experience for you I want you to see how everything is padded and luxurious you feel like you're in a little cocoon where you're blocking out the exterior world you know I found a guided meditation in virtual reality and I put this on and it helped me get sleepy when I had to go to sleep so many different ways you use virtual reality you can be out on the football field when the big play happens during the next bowl game you could be part of that movie you could be type touring high-end real estate you can be doing virtually anything walking down city street seeing the changing of the guard at the palace in the UK you can do all of that simply and easily right here and again with all of these adjustments and controls your volume control as I mentioned is right here so it's all seamless it's all intuitive no more opening up the headset to have to get to your phone to make adjustments you can stay in that inner peace and that place where you want to be ant the other thing I want you to realize this is going to work with your augmented reality as well all you do is pop off this magnetized cover and it opens up to your your phone's cameras so what that simply means is if you want to play pokemon go you're gonna be able to have that layer over the real world which is augmented reality but Apple recently made some really incredible announcements about augmented reality this headset plays right into that and really puts you ahead of the curve now you're gonna have that cool layer over reality if you think about a layer over reality snapchat filters all of those fun little ears and the fun little bunny noses and things that we do in our social media that's a layer over reality you're gonna be able to access all of that content too because of the augmented reality feature so cool I just start to think for a second for all of the gamers out there for everybody that wants great ways to be entertained sure what do you spend at just a little gaming console at the mall you'll put 50 cents in to play a game that's true what do you spend on a movie theater ticket this is 50 cents a day on flex pay to get it home and to try it out flex pays for everybody this could be your first purchase with us it's $15 we'll ship it to you instantly and immediately it's free shipping and handling and you have a 30 day money back guarantee if you've never tried it before and you want to see what YouTube footage looks like touring your city going to the Great Wall of China going up the Eiffel Tower going to outer space and you want to know how it feels on your head try it risk-free for 50 cents a day you think about what we spend on games you think about what we spend on films you think about what we spend on entertainment and changing the way you experience it for now and for forever whether it is exploring the depths of the ocean or like Laurie said giving yourself a cocoon for guided meditation that shuts out the rest of the world and actually gets you to a peaceful place it's a challenge to be able to do that and this one gives you sound stays comfortably it doesn't sit too heavily on the nose and competitive models are ten times the price absolutely and get this one home you know take a look at this visual look at what happens when somebody uses this and they look around as their flow lyza she's the pilot herself yes that's exactly what you can do you can control this we're including that Bluetooth controller a lot of the videos all you do is just simply move your head around look up look down look right look left you're immersed in that at that experience like you're there you can come tour our beautiful city st. Petersburg Florida we're so glad we're still on the map after the crazy hurricane scare you know in our heart goes out to everyone affected by the crazy weather lately but if you want to see what it's
