 good evening I'm Wendy Raymond vice president for academic affairs and Dean of Faculty it's our tradition at Davidson for really important guests and lectures to offer to introductions and so tonight it's my pleasure to introduce you to the word family the family that endowed the lectureship that brings us here tonight dr. karolina cruz Neera the Joseph Henry and John McDonald Warren lecture fund was established by the late dr. Joseph T Warren Davidson class of 1913 as a memorial to his father Joseph a former Davidson trustee and his brother John who died in France during World War one as a first-year student at Harvard Medical School dr. Warren attended a lecture delivered by a Nobel laureate that influenced him throughout his professional life he wanted to create a similar opportunity for Davidson College students and specified that the Warren lecturer should be chosen by the faculty for outstanding accomplishments in the sciences or exceptional statesmanship born in Charlotte in 1893 dr. Warren earned his Bachelor of Science degree from Davidson College and his doctoral degree from at Harvard Medical School he served as professor and Dean of Medicine and vice president of medical affairs at Western Reserve University and also taught at Harvard in the University of Pennsylvania he was a veteran of World War one and was awarded the medal of freedom for services performed during World War two the Warren lecture is administered by the colleagues colleges public lecture committee many of members of whom are here with us tonight previous worn lectures include Stephen Jay Gould Erskine Bowles Mary Robinson former President of Ireland and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Paul Krugman a Nobel laureate and Applebaum a winner of the Pulitzer Prize and Angela Davis the Warren family has remained close to Davidson College and we are grateful for their continued engagement with this lecture series I turn now to dr. Michael Mawson professor and chair of mathematics and computer science who will now introduce our speaker Thank You Wendy I'm Michael Moss sing-off I'm the chair of the department of mathematics and computer science here at Davidson I'm very pleased to introduce our two sauer 2017 were in lecture this evening this is a special time in the department for us we launched major in computer science just less than a year ago on campus and since then we've seen a great deal of interest in this subject you know with 36 majors declared on campus and many more taking courses in our subject to augment their their their their course of study so I'm especially pleased that we're able to mark the inauguration of computer science at Davidson with this Wern lecture dr. karolina cruz Nara is a pioneer in computer science in the fields of virtual reality and interactive visualization she's widely known for creating the cave automatic virtual environment known for short by its recursive and by its recursive acronym cave dr. Cruz Mira obtained her bachelor's degree in systems engineering at the University I'd metropolitana and Caracas Venezuela and her master's and PhD degrees in electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Illinois in Chicago in 2002 she founded the virtual reality application center as well as the human-computer interaction of graduate program at Iowa State University where she was the Stanley chair and interdisciplinary engineering in 2006 she became the executive director and chief scientists of Louisiana immersive technologies Enterprise a public-private partnership for data visualization and simulation while holding an endowed chair and the College of Engineering at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in 2014 she became the director of the George W Donaghy emerging analytics Center at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock where she continues to lead this today dr. Cruz Mira's work is highly multiple multidisciplinary and has been supported by grants from the National Science Foundation the Army Research Lab and the US Department of Energy among other she received the I Triple E virtual reality technical Achievement Award in 2007 has been named as an ACM computer pioneer and last year was cited as one of the top 25 innovators and virtual reality by the video game website polygon I'm looking forward to hearing more about her work in virtual reality this evening and its application in many fields so please join me in welcoming our David since 2017 warren lecturer professor karolina cruising ietter [Applause] well good evening everybody and thank you for having me here in such a special time because I was not aware who until last night about the computer science department or the computer science program being launched this year so I feel double honor to be here and special thank you to dr. Peck for bringing me here and thank you to everybody else that has made me feel so welcome since I arrived here last night so I'm gonna talk a kind of a combination potpourri of topics because when we talk about virtual reality realistically we don't know what we're talking about so I'm just gonna throw a bunch of things over there and and hopefully give you enough information so it's one of you can form your own opinion and those of you interested to follow this career path maybe you have some additional ammunition to decide your calling but things never start the way you anticipated we were talking about that at dinner time because my real calling was classical dancing had nothing to do who's going to college her nothing to go to engineering but due to my lovely parents which my mom is here tonight and they didn't think that our classical ballet dancing career was respectable enough so so they sort of twist my arm about going to college and since I didn't really honestly care much about what to do in college I was telling them well pick whatever you want to pick that is fast I don't want to waste time doing homeworks I don't want to spend a lot of time studying because I need to go to the dance studio so you know computers seem to be the career of the future I'm not talking in the 1980s you know and it has a lot of mass I know that I was like I can wipe out a math homework in a second so that will work so I ended up going to the to this systems engineering degree in Caracas Venezuela because that was where my parents business was at that time and because I was in such a hurry every day to get to the dancer studio I end up graduating you know laude and I actually end up being the top student in the country and and that won me the scholarship to come to this country to continue my education and initially I rejected the scholarship but unfortunately a month later I broke my knee there was my dance career out the window so fortunately enough they did not accept my rejection of the scholarship so here I am so that is color she took me to the University of Illinois in Chicago and over there I was very fortunate to intersect with some students that were in the computer graphics research laboratory the electron visualization lab because I was probably like some of you younger people in the audience you know trying to figure out you know I'm 22 years old I have a degree in engineering that I don't care about now I'm doing a master's and I have no idea what I'm doing here other than learning English and and suddenly you know when I intersect with the computer graphics a student I realized you know this is a branch of computer science a computer engineering that I was not aware of but I see a glimpse had glimpse of hope that it would allow me to intersect a little bit of my art interests with the more dry for me dry again don't take this as a negative by any mean I'm it's my personal experience you know aspects of computer science you know they I was very good at low-level assembly programming I was very good at doing things related to networking and all those because I was used to do it fast so I was probably the best hacker you will ever meet in my time in our hack away in ten minutes I will enter any network firewall that you want me to enter because I was late for the dancing studio you know so but but over there that's when I start thinking you know hey this might be an opportunity to do something and because I had a very strong discipline and self Drive that dance and and for those of you that there were sports you understand that you know you have to have that constant drive to keep yourself in very good physical shape never drop the ball because if you can do something today and you don't practice for a week you won't be able to do it and then you have to kill yourself for months to be able to do it again you know I had a very strong driven discipline once I came to this country I don't know a lot of things that are happening around me for example there was a competition for the for the scholarship to learn about high performance computing and it was hosted by IBM great research and now known as system connection machines and I entered a competition and I got the disc ology so I was very very fortunate that I spent a year of my life between the teacher Watson Center in IBM with Benoit Mandelbrot and a lot of the pioneers in computing also inside the heart of great research with mr. Cray himself and some only people like that and same thing in connection machines and that gave me a lot of perspective on the different opportunities that I was not aware of that computer science and computer engineering has begun perhaps before me were the more dry aspects so after I finished my Master's I was a little bit confused about okay now I have a master now I can do graphics now what do I do so I got an opportunity through IBM because they they know me at a time and they say hey you know we are releasing the RISC architecture system which for those of you a little older you know those were that was one day in a sense workstation and pcs really took off so they needed somebody to to do something exciting with that architecture then the den IBM could go out there and kind of brag about hey this new technology this is very helpful so they implanted me inside Wall Street so there you go totally career shift again so I was for many months in the middle of the stock exchange in New York observing the trace and the and the brokers and how they work and what could I do with my knowledge in graphics and my knowledge in low-level computer architecture and I developed probably the first three dimensional systems visualization systems for the financial market but at the same time I was in Wall Street and I was seeing people that were maybe 27 28 years old having heart attacks and having you know strokes and all those cuts of things because it's a very stressful life you know one day you are a multi-millionaire tomorrow you lost all the money of your customers so I was like this is definitely not my calling I want to live a very long healthy life and then when I was trying to decide what to do with my life again my professor that was my advisor during my Master's called me up and say hey Carlene I'm getting a very big grant to do this new thing called virtual reality and this I'm talking about 1990-1991 so would you like to come back and do a PhD with us on virtual reality and I'm like I have no idea what you're talking about but I am done with Wallis tree so yes I'm coming back coming so so then I went and he sent me to see something called tomorrow's realities in a conference called SIGGRAPH which is the premier computer graphics conference so they had an exhibit about virtual reality and what it was about and and I spent about two days I didn't really got when two papers presentations or nothing I spend those full two days which I'm sure the exhibitors did not appreciate that but I spent two days in the exhibits with my nose in pretty much every single both the hard virtual reality trying to understand what is this thing because I'm supposed to do a PhD on this and I don't know where it is so so this is why I start sort of kind of looking back now is what I'm I started when I probably start thinking like an innovator what I went and I look and I like this so my first reaction when I went to see this thing you know was like wow this is really really cool I really seen this is like so neat and I'm sure those of you that are working with dr. tech you will see a lot of that when when you have people that have never experienced virtual reality even today that's the first reaction Wow this is super cool oh my gosh I never seen something like this before but as I was doing that I was like okay this is very cool but they have not possibly done everything that has to be done because otherwise why would this professor wanted me to do a PhD so I have to figure something where there is I don't know a hole here missing something whatever so so that's in a sense like I said looking back is where I started to say more critical and things that I that I realize you know as you can see on the picture this is the kind of systems that were being shown I realized you know when I put this thing on my head I am alone I get into some virtual world and I'm not there by myself so why nobody is bringing their friends into virtual reality why is the technology not allowing me to bring other people so another thing that I noticed you know I'm a girl and you know intellectually I went for those of you that were chatting with me yesterday intellectually I'm a brain I don't have a gender but as a human yes I'm a girl and as a girl I don't like my hair messed up so this technology mess is my hair so I don't see if this is something that I want to deal with on a daily basis you know hey I pick what a lot of our my hairdresser - if my hair like this and I don't want to destroy it with that so so that was you know something that bothered me quite a lot some other thing is how do I look like to others when I'm in this thing you know I have this thing in my head and I'm doing strange gestures I'm a strain doing a stretch movements and I honestly I don't know if any I mean I was very young at the time you know so I was like I don't know if these guys are peeking under my skirt while I'm doing this thing you know so so there were a lot of these critical questions that came to me and then of course there was the question okay what's the point of this whole thing because so far all I see are games I am doing virtual surfing thank you very much I know how to do the real surfing so I don't need a virtual surfing I answered shooting penguins okay you know I prefer to look at them in the zoo so what is actually the point of this technology what exactly are all these people trying to do with it and then finally I was thinking you know if it's a technology that is allowing me to do some work I don't work alone my work we saw there so how can I do something where we can work together so these were sort of the very early preliminary questions that I had when I knew nothing about the technology that was my first impression but it was it was in a sense enough for me to say you know I think I can do something in this field I don't know what it is but there is all these questions and in these two days everybody's ready to sort of put me against the wall and shoot me but nobody has been able to give me any answers to these questions so maybe I will have a chance to actually get a PhD out of this thing so then I started thinking okay what is what is virtual reality and for me over the years that the answer to that question has evolved so today I'm gonna give you the answer that I think is today you asked me five years ago I will have probably given you a different answer but to me virtual reality as as is portrayed in the media or that it is conventionally thought in a lot of the courses including mine it's a technology that involves the user in a complete digital reality so in a sense removes you from the real world and embeds you in a digital world but we also talk about augmented reality and augmented reality people perceive it as a digital enhancement to the real world so you still stay where we are but you just enhance it a couple of weeks ago I was giving a talk in a high school and my example for augmented reality was I hey you know you have a house it's a beautiful house it's a beautiful neighborhood you have a beautiful garden but every morning when you're happily looking out the window enjoying the birds chirping I'm watching the nice sunrise you're extremely ugly neighbor just showed up and you're like you just ruin my day the ugly guy just showed up well you know with our mental reality you can superimpose a handsome face on your neighbor but I still keep everything else together so you enhance your reality so that was my my highschool explanation of that but what I mean is you know these two technologies a lot of people see them as disconnected completely separate fields to me actually they come together right now in 2017 as a technology that allows all of us to use digital content to enhance whatever activity we want to do in some cases depending of the context that we might be embedded and a particular moment depending of the role that we might be playing in a team on a project or an activity it might be something that requires us to be isolated from reality but in some other cases we might want to be embedded in the real world with just an enhancement so I really don't make any difference between the two technologies to me is pretty much a continuum of options on depending on what we to do but the main point is of course that is about that experience that you provide to your users what is what is that person or group of people need to accomplish when they are using this technology and how do you deliver that experience in a successful manner so does that's to me the main thing so having a little bit more of maturity then I revisited those first impressions so here are the sort of the driving motivations of my work through the year so we go back at the issue of being alone in the virtual space and yes some people say well you are not alone because you have now collaborative environments and there are avatars that share the environment with you and all those kinds of things and yes but it's not the same it is not the same and it's not the same to talk to me directly than to take to my avatar the avatars are getting better but there is still a lot of little things that we do little shoulder movements little head motions I don't know little wrinkles or something that when you're having especially in a business environment an avatar today is not a substitute for the face-to-face conversation so we're still a little bit alone in there things that are very important to me is to be me when I'm in a virtual environment I want to be me I'm used to my hands I'm used to my hair in my peripheral I ground myself through the little of myself that I can see in the real world and a lot of the systems take that away from me so it's very difficult for me to know if I'm actually standing on the ground or if I'm kind of hovering above the ground it's very difficult to estimate distance because as you see on the image that's a virtual arm but it's not my arm so I don't know if there are armies as long as mine so it is it makes it hard sometimes never knows what I'm doing sometimes and this is the famous picture of Palmer Luckey on the cover of Time magazine's and these are different interpretations that people did in the internet and are wondering what is Palmer doing we don't know it's the turkey pose but other than that we don't know sadly what's going on so when you're trying to work together you know trying to second-guess what your partner is doing probably is not very efficient some other other issues is I don't know I myself know where I am in the virtual world but I don't know what I am in the real world so that also precludes me from moving I remember maybe there was some furniture some walls some cables other people so that limits sometimes inhibits me from freely moving around in the virtual space and again all those things can be arguable by all of you here these are again my personal observations and like holders disclaimers you know no other people was tortured to get this information also with the technology for me it's incredibly hard in my head to see this scenario in this picture as a regular activity we are social animals we like to share experiences even when we go to the movie theaters how many times you do have to say quiet because somebody in front of you is sharing the movie experience with the person that they have next to them so it is a cool thing now it is a trendy thing now so some people put up with this theme but on the long run I don't see this as scenario imagine you know having Thanksgiving is coming up next week sounds giving dinner the entire family gets together and after dinner we say hey let's watch a movie like this I don't see that I don't see mom dad grandma grandpa baby in this scenario you know I just don't see it maybe you maybe some of you will I just don't see this a scenario I see it in some other settings but not as one-size-fits-all as we're trying to make it happen there's also the issues related to comfort and then of course the issues related to cyber sickness motion sickness and so on that we're still having a lot of research to be done to understand what that really happens so for me these have been my driving points questions challenges whatever you want to call it and what I normally you know the conclusion is that right now same as twenty twenty-five years ago the moment we said virtual reality the media scene that comes to everybody's mind is I need some sort of helmet or goggle to do virtual reality not really not really because virtual reality is much much more than just a head mounted display or a helmet or aura goggle virtual reality's is any technology that takes you there and that there could be some exciting fictional gaming environment or that there can be molecular system where you are watching some molecular reactions or it can be inside of an engine to understand how the engine works or some mathematical abstract space where suddenly math becomes alive so they so what we are confusing right now as well as we confused it many years ago is the concept of virtual reality with the implementation of virtual reality another analogy that I was doing to the high school students here is an example what is as sure as you is as a concept is a thing that allows you to go from point A to point B protecting your feet now here is my question to you do you own a single pair of shoes right now can you do your entire daily weekly monthly and life with one pair of shoes no you can't because you have your choose to come to work you have your shoes to go workout you have maybe your shoes you go hiking I'm not sure what the main sports are in this part of the country but you probably have you know three or four different types you know you might have your flip-flops to go to the beach or something like that so you have a variety of implementations of the concept of a shoe depending on the activity that you're trying to do and what I see that we're doing in virtual reality today is basically we are trying to go to the beach or hiking in there stiletto shoes that I'm using here to be with you tonight that doesn't make any sense because that is completely the wrong platform for that particular activity it is the perfect platform to be here and there is nothing wrong with a stiletto shoes you know they are fun they are great they're wonderful in this context but not in some other context and that's something that I tend to get a little cranky about every time I hope in a magazine because it's like you know guys this is a little broader thing than just that so one of the reasons why then I got into all these and all these thoughts and all these sort of analysis you know then it led me to develop one of the things that people know me around the world with the cave and now it's being called social we are so the mother of social press so so this was something that I did at the beginning of my PhD where I was able to take all those questions take all those challenges blend them with my background in dance being on a stage and understanding how you group as a group how you work as a group and in a sense how you choreograph several actions for within a specific purpose so as you can see here in the in this video for those of you that are not familiar with that technology is basically a projection room where the walls the floor and in some cases even the ceiling projects three-dimensional graphics the one of the users is struct to generate the correct optics and as you can see on this video is a very natural conversational space while you are all embedded in the virtual reality that you might be doing work in this case is three three architects and designers this is this is an actual project we did for the Oklahoma Tulsa Tulsa Oklahoma Zoo so this was a study with the last year for the new pavilion it's gonna happen in January so if any of you goes to Tulsa Oklahoma and since the snow leopard new pavilion this is what it is and there was a lot of a lot of controversy with this pavilion because of course there was the the the family that generously made the donations of the animals plus the funding to bring to build the pavilion but there was of course the people in the zoo trying to figure out how we do this design that is appealing to our visitors and there was issues related with certifications for safety and so on so these turn out to be a really good environment because a lot of different people could come together and explore this design and discuss the pros and cons from each one of their responsibilities and make some changes and come back and revisit it so so this is what the cave is about and and us in a sense one of my contributions to the field driven by those questions that I mentioned before just for kicks you know I put you this picture in here it was it was shown for first time in the conference see graph in 1992 they changed my name tag for cave woman and it took me ten years after that to remove that nickname because every time I went to any ACM or I typically conference my name always Camus cave come on and I'm like that is not my name so affectionately well maybe but anyway but as you can see here when they came was shown for first time there was lines and lines and lines of people people will wait as much as 5 to 6 hours for a two minute experience now as a student you can imagine what that was for me because I honestly did not expect these reaction I mean I I thought people were gonna like it you know but when people were literally you know slapping each other and elbowing each other to get in I was a mmmm this is a strange because it was just my little my little idea that I guess is a little not so little but anyway so but I think what happened when I did the cave at that time in again and this is just my observations I think one of the things that that I guess I did was break the statement that they feel had at that time suddenly many other researchers around the world realized hey we are trying to equal the concept with the implementation we can implement this in many other ways so after I did the cave as you can see in these pictures many groups around the world made all kinds of variations and there was actually a lot of progress in that window of time between 1992 and 1997 there was quite of quite a progress on that and it was actually a lot of a lot of fun so for me personally I was ok well I finished my PhD I have done this thing everybody like saying I was very fortunate I had a lot a lot a lot of job offers I did not seek any jobs and I did not do any interview it was just basically I just have to say yes to somebody to go there so so at that point I was you know I didn't expect this thing that I did to be so popular so now I feel responsible for those of you that I don't know you guys have engineering ethics as part of for your education but I had a lot of ethics hammer intermediate in my and they'd rather do this I was okay I did something and I'm responsible for the scene that I did so I really need to understand what asset that I did so that was my driving force to make a career decision from all the positions that were available to me so I end up looking okay where can I go where I can explore what the cave can do outside gaming I have never been interested on gaming so that's major disclaimer my husband plays games my child plays game IRA students around me plays game I'm not too excited about gaming so I just wanted to to see how I can make this technology work for others outside gaming and also try to blend the things that I know from my dance background and also my family has been traditionally for generations a business family and and I've seen the struggles of make business work and how to accelerate your business had to be first to market and all those kinds of things so then I realized hey you know university environment seems to be the right place for me to do this because if I can figure out how to get funded most of the administrators will leave me alone I hope they will not tell me what to do but also as been on a university environment I'll have the freedom to here and they are take some time off here and there to spend time in the business world which I did and then also in a university I will always be surrounded by young fresh creative minds that will keep me also hopefully know physically young but mentally young and stimulated and this is sort of that was I said well you know there are some universities that are calling me and one of them was uwah State University and of course everybody was like why would you even consider going to Iowa why don't you go to like Boston why don't you go to the Silicon Valley you know Iowa was intriguing to me because of course I have I I didn't know if it was Iowa or higher I was like looking on the map what is this place but at the same time I was you know this is gonna be very intriguing because I could go to a place that traditionally is not a technology place and I'm not sure what I'm gonna find in there but I bet I'm gonna find a lot of interesting people that might be as clueless as I am and at the same time they are not gonna have a lot of baggage in the sense of preconceptions and you have to do things this way or something like that so so I decided to go to Iowa State University signed up in Ames Iowa and is the first store when I went to him so I was like oh my gosh this is just three houses and corn I'm not sure that was the right decision but it was the right decision I met delightful people I met one of the most a smarter people I have come across in my career and we developed there a big initiative and the one on the top this one right here so when I arrived to Iowa 1995 and in 1998 I had a plan to create the biggest research center for virtual reality if not in the world in the nation I was extremely fortunate that the Dean of engineering the provost and the president of the university supported that plan and we did a big capital campaign which some of you know what that means and we raised a sixty million dollars bill of our building and put probably the biggest most concentrated infrastructure for this kind of research in the nation at that time and it was called the virtual reality application center and myself with two other faculty members we started being three of in 1995 and by 2000 we were 450 people 50 professors 400 graduate students generating quite a number of millions of dollars a year on research and we also created the first degree granting program in these technology doesn't they was so successful that then when Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana then Kathleen Blanco that was the governor of Louisiana at a time she called me in 2000 at towards the end of 2005 and called me and asked me to go to Louisiana to help on the recovery of the state the post Katrina state to initiate some sort of high-tech digital initiative similar to what I did in annua and that is this Center at the bottom there we see an immersive technologies enterprise or light it was not affiliated with the University was a it was like kind of like a startup funded through the government and I ran it as the CEO for three and a half years and basically we we contributed to the development of a lot of bringing both the film industry as well as the gaming industry to Louisiana and giving them the initial support to get set up and as you know Louisiana is is a focus of film production right now and many gaming companies have a lot of branches also in Louisiana right now and then three years ago the governor of Arkansas wanted to do something like that in Arkansas and it was the right time for us to relocate so we went to Arkansas so now we are in the middle of launching or creating the emerging analytics Center which is the building on the on the top left so we've been there for three years and we are growing at a very steady pace we are about 30 people now five adults like I call it and 25 for students anywhere from entry-level freshmen and the graduates to PhDs and postdoctoral and my hope is to grow it to maybe somewhere between 50 and 75 total because of course right now the economy is not the same as it was in the 90s it's a lot more challenging there's no so much funding out there but I think we still can be a fairly sizable team to do things and related to what is happening here in Davidson College the starting in January we are merging with the computing science department so I'll be the director of the center as well as the department chair of computer science so hopefully we can grow together and have a stronger focus on this type of technologies but what all this thing was happening on my on my personal life then virtual reality as you know disappear from the public eye so somewhere around 2000 2001 suddenly we didn't know here anymore about virtual reality and people kept saying that virtual reality was dead well I'm not sure how dead it was because in my 10 11 years at the in Iowa we generated over 50 million dollars on virtual reality grants on my years in Louisiana we generated over 8 or 9 million worth of not only grants but also corporate projects in virtual reality and now that I am in Arkansas we have generators somewhere on the in the 3 years that we have been there we have generated about three and a half to four million dollars for virtual reality so for me it's never been dead I have been always very very active we've been always doing what's the next thing and so on and I have a quick animation here for you to see these are things that happened between 2001 and 2012 that the media did not really cover now there is a very consistent aspect of this do you see any goggles in there and this is not my work this is the work of many people around the world so some of the technologies that I initiated continued and grew on their own so company is related to the oil and gas business use this technology on a daily basis the automobile industry use this technology on a daily basis the military training groups use this technology on a train on a daily basis more interestingly in businesses for example like the appliance industry especially in Europe EU want to see how your new refrigerator your new this washer is going to look in your kitchen a lot of these companies have this type of technology as showrooms so you can actually see how it looks like pharmaceutical industries many many other industries but somehow the public didn't know about this and still today didn't they don't know about it so so there was nothing related to virtual reality is dead for some reason it was just quiet now in 2012 sandayu who we had is back because our partner put his idea for the oculus rift in Kickstarter and also you know the story he was seeking for $200,000 investment and in 48 hours he surpassed two million dollars in endorsements and here we are so now no matter what you do no matter which country of the world you go any piece of press or magazine that Europe and there is virtual reality everywhere so our our landscape today for virtual reality looks like this yes no these are prototypes that are coming into the market I'm not supposed to show them but I'm showing them to you yes no am I kidding what about that one okay she has the kicker so what happened done in 30 years nothing we have done a lot but if I read the press we have done nothing because we even take the same shots for the cover of the magazine there's 30 years between the tabla and aloe vera so when you come new to this technology ooh innovation well hey look at that the little girl is me not really but to me I have a big big issue with this picture a major issue with this picture big issue because there is a tremendous tremendous tremendous body of work not only my own but many many wonderful and smart people around the world that have been working tirelessly tirelessly around the world that is not being recognized that is been ignore that nobody knows about it so this is serious this is very serious because we're heading on the same direction and we're gonna say two years from now we're gonna say virtual reality is dead and it's not gonna be done because that's not virtual reality does Maya stilettos that broke down because I try to go up on the Everest of course they broke down because it's not the right platform for me to go out there but that doesn't mean that we're not gonna use shoes anymore so so I have an issue because when you talk to industry right now the industry kind of is a little bit upset because they are like you know we've been doing this for years and years and years and years and years and years another so these people calling themselves pioneers well we've been doing that for the last 20 years you know and this person just did it yesterday and suddenly he or she is the pioneer on the cover of the magazine so so there's a lot of people cranky out there but but besides being cranky the other thing that is happening is that them market of VR and and again when I say VR is VRA /a are the market is really not listening to industry and a huge opportunity is being missed when you hear in the press saying you know virtual reality and augmented reality is going to be 200 billion dollar business by 2015 how how how if you're not listening to what industry needs how are you gonna make that market so this is a big issue because companies cannot there are sort of serious games and all those kinds of things that help a lot but there are many applications that are plain and simple nothing to do with gaming there are applications that have to be deeply scientific deeply technical that the techniques are different the knowledge is different also a lot of the companies for example when I when I did the cave a lot of people think I'm a multi-millionaire I am NOT because I donated all my royalties of the cave back to the University of Illinois for student scholarships I was very fortunate that I did my masters and my PhD without having to borrow a single penny both officially through loans or unofficially through my family so when I did they cave I thought I will give opportunities like that to other young people but by me doing those that act of donating my royalties away it also took away my opportunity to have a saying on how the cave is commercialized and salt so one of the problems that are happening today is a lot of the companies that distribute the cave continue with a business model that is no longer viable in today's economy there are very few companies that can afford several millions of dollars to acquire a cave as it is today and more importantly that can afford the maintenance of such a system where is depending of the complexity of your system could cost as much as two three hundred thousand dollars a year just to turn it on so this has to be some sort of evolution on a lot of these technologies to continue being useful so so we see people especially industry on a very toughest part because on one side they had to reduce themselves to use consumer gaming type technology which doesn't quite cut it at the professional level or make exorbitant investments on technology that is right now not financially viable so one of the things that I've been doing right now is really trying to understand what industry needs to do and how we can bring that technology into the competitive trends not only financial competitive trends but also ease of use and maintenance and operations and so on so the the little animation that you see there I actually showed it on Sunday before I came here so we are we are taking the the concept of the cave and we have in a sense revisited and we have come up with with a new way inspire on current trends like the way the HTC vive dancer with a steam VR and some other things like that so now this system is in the process of being commercialized we just got awarded the patent and hopefully this thing will go to market on the on the twenty twenty-five thousand dollars so now it's affordable now people can take advantage of this technology we're also splitting other technologies like the the picture here I personally think that something like the the hololens like technology it really has a lot of future because it brings the best of both worlds it been it brings the best of what you get out of a helmet or a goggle but it also brings the best of what you can get or something like the cave because you are in the world but you're also seeing the other people with you in the world granted a little funky with the with the visor but I can still see you on his geo is not a representation of you so a lot of my work now has to do with understanding all these things and how do we bring the most appropriate implementation to the right job so my approach and this is a picture of my current Center we have a very diverse set of platforms where when somebody comes with us to us with a need we understand that need and we figured out what is the proper implementation of the technology that addresses then it does my little son that he loves he's our guinea pig for a lot of things that we do so in the few minutes that I have and you guys can kick me out of here any time you want I have some examples of applications that we have done over the years so this this first slide is very dear to myself because these are my very very early projects as a young assistant professor trying to feel what to do so so for example this up here it was a success story because this was on data visualization there was a company was having problems with a product that brother was out on the street already and they couldn't figure out the problem we were with them we were able to do some visualizations in the cave as well as in the desktop that we showed the data in a different visual arrangement and they were able to find the problem and deploy it back to the field the one over there that was a project that we did with Procter and Gamble is also very dear to my heart because we were literally swimming in pee because we were computationally solving the dynamics of pee on baby diapers so those of you that have children you know that is a very important piece of equipment when you have a child because you want a nice and dry and not dripping all over the place and also there is a very serious difference on how a baby boy piece and a baby girl piece so that has a lot of implications in material design so we spent quite a number of years working with the baby division of protein and gamble doing very very very advanced high-performance computing work combined with virtual reality to understand literally the dynamics of pee to help them on on their material research so it was very excited and and of course what is excited about these things to me what is very exciting about these things is when I go to the supermarket and I say look the new pumpers are there I have something to do with it you know and then when I have my own son I was like ah this is the kind of one that we have to do because I know this has been designed in a cave and I know it's not gonna leak so so these are prices that are very very dear to my heart because those are my early success successes in my career this was another interesting project that unfortunately did not continue because of some change on leadership in the company that we were working with but it was very very promising and we're trying to pick it up now with another group along my life another thing that I enjoy very much is high-performance computing it just it just feels you know like this big thing I'm gonna get as much CPUs and as much computing as I can and I have three thousand in here but I know NCSA it has another five thousand oh oh whoo how long has 7000 Malraux keep it all down to me so high-performance computing for me is really the ultimate dream for computer science if you are like I am a systems developer you just want a hug as much CPU cycles as you can and check all those networks and get the last bit per second you can get out of that our networked cannot work so so we have a company that came to us and say hey we have to build these buildings all the time and in order to get fire marshal certification we have to build these buildings and burn them and then the fire marshals see whether or not our fire prevention mechanisms responded accordingly but sometimes the fire marshal is not looking on the right direction and tell us that we did not have something working properly so we had to go back and build the building and reburn it again so for any new building there are millions of dollars that are in a sense wasted on building and and these buildings are built are approximately not fully scaled but about 7075 percent scale so so so each one of these tests is usually to three million dollars or more for them to do this so they ask us you know can you guys do some sort of virtual reality simulation that the fire marshal can see the building on fire and also for us to know what he he or she is looking at so when we do the real testing because the real testing they have to do it by law there's no way to get around that but what they were trying to do is minimize how many building burning building burning building burning they had to do so we did this this simulation where we used approximately I think we were using like five or six thousand CPUs to do the fire simulation in real time with a dedicated I think forty gigabyte fiber straight into the cave and then have the fire marshal as you see in the picture walking through this warehouse and actually giving the person even the ability to set a fire himself and see how the fire evolved over the building so there was quite an interesting project and and he got deployed but then with due to some administrative changes in the company is got on hold and I'm not sure what it is right now we have done some performance stage performances because of my dance background this is a project that I was discussing with dr. Wendy at lunch I mean a dinner we had a very big grant from the National Science Foundation to develop network of sensors and that is a highly technical it's a hardware software type of combination research and I was going out of my mind because it was just a little too much dry for me you know like okay motion sensors if somebody walks into the building or heat sensors for this and on that and he's very kind of like too much for me so I had the idea to say well why don't we use a dance performance as our testbed for this NSF grant sensor network of sensors of course everybody thought I was absolutely nuts by doing that but it was a lot of fun because what we did is we created these special suits for the dancers that had a lot of sensors on them they had heartbeat monitors they had temperature sensors we put pressure sensors like on their feets and their arms and so on so we could determine how hard they were jumping and things like that and and quite a lot I mean they were really really covered from head to toe in sensors and then the performance what we did is using all the data coming up from those sensors to then generate virtual stages virtual props for the performance so the people in the audience of course have to wear 3d glasses that when you go to see a 3d movie or something like that and the dancers were dancing around these virtual props that the scenario the the stage was empty but to the audience it looked like he was very very full this was probably one of the most paper rich and successful projects that we did because by doing it by implementing the network of sensors on a human body that is jumping and sweating and in itself against the floor and all those kinds of things we actually develop very very robust very rugged Betty waterproof type of technology that you know you could pretty much run a semi track through these sensors and they will not break now I always acknowledge our lovely dancers because for six months day and your burns electrical zaps and stabbings and all kinds of things as we were cleaning this up and they were extremely extremely good at sports Elisabet is the lady in the picture so but it was really a little bit of a love enough shot but at the end my my more serious colleagues that had a really hard time understanding what am i doing they jump on board towards the end and and and I've been a really fun project I'm very very technical I mean they were about four PhDs in computer engineering that came out of this on the design of the network of sensors that they were very very very very robust this is probably one of the most robust devices that we have ever developed we have done some other things related to welding for example this was in Louisiana after Katrina there was a lot of need for welders of course to clean up all the damage on the on the oil rigs and the cities and all that and to accelerate the degree-granting for weldings we created a virtual welding trainer and you can see how it looks like here so it's it's is really none of the commercial none of the assistive technology in this particular case we develop the technology because we didn't find any commercial implementation of virtual reality that applied to this particular context so we develop that one I'm gonna go very quickly in the last few things here so things that we're doing more more currently things using for example a mental reality for maintenance training trying training and assistance I can show you the toy because this is been known for the military so I cannot show you the f-16 training but you get the idea what this is you know just basically guiding the the maintenance personnel through the steps of a particular repair I'm also very interested on incorporating physical motion in virtual reality so here are three different types of treadmills that we have been using in the last few years so the the one over here is a military-grade treadmill and it's embedded in a cave it's an interesting device but definitely non practical is about a million dollars breaks all the time every time you had to call the technician is 5060 thousand dollars to come fix it so so we have done a lot of things with it but it's not a device I would recommend anybody but now through the gaming industry these these other two technologies are available are a much affordable acquisition price but also almost zero maintenance so so we are doing a lot of work understanding how humans actually move inside the virtual spaces so other aspect just to wrap up that isn't right now keeping me thinking a lot is what we are calling context ribbon collaborative environments which is basically how the same application can serve different roles so here is a military example where the person in the middle is your soldier on the field train so he or she needs to be completely isolated from the reality because you need that person to be completely embedded in the battlefield so that person has to be cognitively immersed in that battlefield and reducing the trailmen's we give that person the ability to run and crouch and do whatever he or she needs to do now on the other sighs right over there Hyundai on the farther side you have the field commanders where they need to understand what's happening on the on the battlefield but they don't need to be that much in MERS they need to be able to understand where the different forces are the activity on the field and so on so we're giving them more like a controller station based on augmented reality and mobile devices kind of if you guys have seen the movie Avatar kind of like that controller station on Avatar but since we can now holographically project as Hollywood does that we simulate that through through tablets and cell phones which is devices that the commanders already have when they go on a mission in the field we have another device for example like this table and that does were the pilots the drone pilots utilized to guide the pilots the drones into the battlefield and then finally something like the cave is the space where the very very high-level commanders situation-room type of environment they are all life with each other of course they are all intercommunicating and and constantly in touch with each other and they see each other in this scenario so we're very intrigued about this direction of research and how all this is gonna work and there's a lot of work in there in user interfaces and things like that we have a strap elated for example to an archaeological project with dr. Krista Lewis one of our colleagues in Arkansas so she has an excavation in the country of Oman we have done something were for example the tourists on the ground when they see certain ruins whenever they see those blue markers if they put their cell phones or their tablets they'll see a representation or whatever was there on the prime time of that installation but if they go to the museum like were dr. Lewis is they can see an updated that is constantly being fed map of the status of the excavation and all these things are life so let me skip a couple of things here so this is some of our medical word that I know several you have asked me about it I cannot show you a lot of it because we are in the middle of a patent processing for this so this is what I'm allowed to show you but this is related to medical education anatomy education so this is the demo'd replacing to some extent cadaver laboratories that are much is much more than these but I'm not allowed to show it at this point but we developed this table it has depth perception so you can understand size and scales very well and as you are doing the different dissections is giving you the medical information and terminology corresponding to the different organs bones arteries and and so on it's starting to receive awards and many things like that I will see what they think take us so things just to wrap up you know that I have learned is that really to be a lot of the things that myself and my team has done that can be considered innovative is just based on knowledge and knowledge is really understanding you know what has been done what are people trying to do being analytical and critical about things that you that you see and now simply say hey I have an idea and this is a great idea I'm just an innovator because sometimes you know and it happens to me too I have a bright what I think is a bright idea and two days later you know I go home kind of hiding under the carpet because I'm like you know these people so so and so has done this before so my bright idea I guess it was not so bright but understanding that is is really key for then I also learn over my life that Media doesn't really tell you the story of virtual reality so please do more than just read in Wired magazine you know there is a lot more out there certainly I'm hoping that with what I talk to you today you realize that virtual reality was way way way way beyond gaming and we don't even know how far we can take it yet and the concept you know again one size fits all is not really what we are doing right now so my look forward you know it's this sort of diversity of platforms and and really understand that there is a difference between the concept of what virtual reality is and the implementation of that concept and finally you know the fun thing is that no matter what you do people are really happy every time they see it and this is extremely rewarding so with that I appreciate you listen to my ramblings I hope you learn a little bit with my talk this is a way to contact me and if anybody has some questions and it's not too tired I can go on a little longer thank you [Applause] please come up and use the mic so everyone can hear you one microphone here and the other one is over to my right I have a question about like you mentioned that a lot of like current vr projects are done by using the helmets and like I think it was I don't know what they call by like the remotes thing like magical wands like they the world and then they tried to use that to move the characters like the virtual characters around in a virtual world but you said that you were trying to like get rid of that and then do something like without helmets without like having the other sound things so were the technologies that would be like suitable for doing such job yeah I don't necessarily say that I want to get rid of them what I would like is for all of us to understand that there is a place for helmets and there's a place for caves there is a place for who knows what that we maybe don't know yet that we have to have a little bit of a brother might to the technology now my my sort of what I would like to do when we have done some experiments with that you know is taking the technology for example that is coming up from like the hololens and and why it's called islam where we can three dimensionally understand the space instead of having to put goggles on us what i would like to do is project directly over the space so no matter where we are you know this space will get transformed through projection there's a little bit of words that microsoft has done on dan and there's a little bit of word that some groups in france have done with that and we are also spare inventing with that because then that would be in my opinion almost total freedom from from having to put things on you you know suddenly i'm just transforming the space by shooting light into the space we're very far from that i can tell you that this is now something that is gonna happen next year it might happen in the next maybe seven to ten years because there is a lot of issues related to that based on if you are there and i'm here you're looking at the projection this way I'm looking at the projection that way so how do I give you proper optics without any attachments to your body so so there are a lot of interesting research problems on that and again the key for especially younger people like you is to understand that there is a difference between a concept on how the concept is implemented and there might be some implementations that are very cool but that doesn't mean that the only implementation and you just say oh there are helmets and there are caves and now there is this table so there's nothing else you might come up with something that is genius I don't know I hope you do thank you so much I don't bite by the way I do not bite with the virtual dissection table is it mostly going to be medical schools or do you think actual surgeons trying to develop new techniques would be able to use that that's actually a very good question right now our focus is mostly educational based on anatomic and knowledge in conversations with many doctors not only our direct doctor collaborators like I last week and I was in in the Baylor Medical Center in Houston so there is an overall you know like sometimes in computer science we say they the students don't know enough deep programming they don't know deep C++ they don't know deep assembly you know and that's not that you guys are not as smart it's just unfortunately our programs are so tight we are so controlled by the number of credits by the time that you guys need to graduate that we are unable to incorporate more material and there are certain aspects that you should be very proficient that you unfortunately don't get a proficiency until you become a professional and through years of practice you acquire that knowledge in the medical field that something similar like that is happening with anatomy students medical students are not getting enough not on me during their study period so so they want to incorporate through virtual reality a much deeper anatomical knowledge so that's our focus now our tools can easily be extended to surgical practicing because once you have a full correct anatomical body that you can manipulate it you know we are right now focus on anatomical dissections but there's nothing that will prevent it to do a specific sort of surgical dissections in the future is not our focus right now I wondered if those simpler omnidirectional treadmills will work very well for your research and given given that when we saw the people in the Tulsa Zoo they were they were maneuvering around the space but they weren't using a treadmill at all so so what what does the treadmill give you an in will those omnidirectional those simpler ones work for you just as well as the the multi-million dollar one yeah we are actually in the middle of of a series of experiments evaluating those kinds of issues and I was discussing that with dr. Peck at lunch today we are we want to understand the what we get and what we lose because for example when we do when we do work with the military military training especially for the army for the on foot soldiers as a training system that doesn't include physical exertion is not very helpful because a soldier has to make a split-second life-and-death very complicated decision and it's very different if that decision is being made in a simulator where the soldier is now physically tired versus when the soldier is exhausted because he run 20 miles with a hundred pounds on their back so the treadmills for certain environments are critical because they introduce the physical assertion that you don't get by exercising your thumbs with a joystick so there are again there are applications where in a sense it's almost a necessity to have your user getting tired now there are other applications like like walking through the zoo environment which it might be an enhancement to the experience but it might not necessarily be a critical component on the system so right now the series of experiments that we are running in in our Center and hopefully some that we will collaborate with dr. Peck here is trying to compare if I have to go from point A to point B in the virtual environment what do I get and what do I lose if I go on this treadmill versus using my my joystick to point and physically I'm not moving and navigating or would use dr. pecks techniques of something called redirecting ready director walking so we are in the process of evaluating those kinds of things because from my points in sum I work a lot of with industry as you saw in in some of the examples that I that I gave if for example walking with the treadmill on something like the zoo gives me maybe a 5 percent improvement on the quality of the experience on the overall quality experience I might not recommend to do that because introducing the treadmill introduces an extra level of technical complexity expenses again maintenance upgrades all those kinds of things and maybe I don't get sufficient benefits to do that but if at the end of my experiment is I seek and maybe introducing the treadmill I get 40% 50% increase on the quality of the experience maybe I will recommend that so we are in the middle right now of evaluating those kinds of parameters and hopefully you know about it because [Laughter] maybe a bit technical but I'm just curious what are you doing - like solve some of the mechanical limitations with VR like tactile feedback and motion sickness and things like that pending a question we we don't spend my group we don't do a lot with tactical with with tactile or force which is called haptics so we we don't do a lot of research on that ourselves we do keep an eye on what is coming it's a technology that is is very hard if you know how the human body works you know your eyes you can fool the eye are approximately 96 Hertz you can fool the eye thinking this is a continuous world and depth and all those kinds of things to do that kind of fooling on your skin you have to go over a thousand Hertz so creating a device that can go at that they say framerate is very challenging and there is a lot of extraordinary researchers around the world that are brave enough to attack that line of research right now there is really nothing out there that is practical there are some exciting technologies that if you close your eyes you can feel things but then there is a whole room of electronics there's a little thing like this and a whole of room of electronics behind it so it's not really practical all there are space like motion sickness the word that we do comes again from knowledge comes from understanding what our users have to do in that particular virtual environment and that drives the implementation so we are very very picky when we design our environments on things like framerate we want a guarantee that what environments run and a fixed frame rate not not 27 frames per second now now 24 now 32 now 28 because that for example is a factor that can provide can cause motion sickness we also try to the best that we can to control also the content of the applications some applications don't necessarily require six degree of freedom movement through the application you are doing an application where you're just for example like the zoo if I'm navigating through the zoo I'm not gonna be upside down so we constrain the navigation to certain directions and no matter how you move your joysticks or button presses or something we don't let you get upside down so there are things like that that again comes from knowledge and experience that we built into our design there are other groups that are more focused on the hardware so they are trying to design different type of lenses different type of materials that also contribute to improve on that so it's it's ongoing work thank you your PhD thesis thank you for your talk it's really great hearing about the early history of the our I wondered like how your background and dance changed your thinking or even challenge your thinking about VR my background in dance what I can tell you it has made me a lot less serious so I don't take my work as serious as some of my colleagues and again a lot of these comments please please please don't tell them in a negative way or take them as an offensive manner it's just you know I go with the flow which is more the artists way you know I take a lot of sometimes risk and chances that are my engineering Paris I helped me to do more calculated risks that if I were just pure artists and say you know here we go you know but it also it also like I said earlier it also my my background in dance has incorporated a kind of discipline and tenacity that sometimes I don't see on my colleagues I don't give up I go I do it I practice I try and if this way doesn't work I'm gonna try this other way so so there are things like that that influence my work also it takes me to pass that everybody sometimes things what is she doing ladies stage performance that I mentioned you know I was talking with the NSF program director many years ago that gave us the money and and she was you know never in my wildest dream I would imagine that somebody from my program which is network of sensors would use a stage performance as the testbed to evaluate the sensors so we tend to do a little bit of the wall project sometimes but but also it's good for the students because again it helps them to think differently it also gives a lot of adrenaline rushes because this is a very hard deadline you know you have people that have bought their tickets in ticketmasters and dr. crews my sensor broke doesn't cut it because I got three thousand people in the theater that are with their little ticket waiting to see so so it's art I think I think our our group is a little bit unique in the sense that we do things in non-conventional ways but somehow it all comes together like a performance you know it scales behind the curtain five minutes before before the the performance is there but then magically when the curtain goes up everything works you know everybody comes together and things just happen so that's that's pretty much how I run it and I have to acknowledge that not all the students in my teen make it in my team it is very demanding it's extremely demanding so not everybody is cut out to be in my group so there are some students that come with a lot of energy a lot of enthusiasm but they just cannot keep up and and again does that that that determination and perseverance that comes from you know I'm supposed to do eighth wettest and I'm only doing six so I'm gonna spend the next five days in the studio if one two three one two three one two three until I get my f wages you know were worse some other students well I do six that's good enough why do you want eight well I won eight you know you cannot give me eight then go with doctor so-and-so he'll take your sis but I want I won eight and when you do eight I'm gonna ask you for twelve you know so some my students know they come like oh there she comes you know and and and they come like well I'm afraid to tell you that I got this thing done because you're gonna tell me to do more on it and I'm like well of course what do you expect you know so those kinds of things I guess can you just talk to like because we're in the age of acceleration machine learning or deep learning or and how that's beginning to crossover with virtual reality and some of that and do you see things speeding up as you get older and you know as technology begins to take over more and more in where do you see virtual reality in like five years ten years twenty years and how does it cross over with everything well about machine learning and deep learning and all that we we use that because many of our virtual worlds require that you we do for example projects with the financial industry so we integrate a lot of machine learning and that's not my specialty we of course work collaboratively so so one of the members of my team is a faculty member dr. me lanova and that's what specialty so we do a lot of world where we make sense of the data and then we present the data visually so those are things that definitely influence what we do in virtual reality I mean the an influence an ism is bidirectional because with virtual reality in a sense we give a much bigger real estate than a computer screen to put your data so we are now limited by the edges of the other screen now we have in a sense infinite space to spread out your data and that's and that's another big challenge you know how to use that infinite real space on on the humongo sort of Big Data challenge that we have faced today you know so that's a big challenge where do I see a going in the future again with without the intention to get anybody upset about it I personally don't see a lot of future on the goggles I didn't see a feature in the goggles 20 years ago I don't see a feature in the goggles today it's a good tool to help us understand the concept of virtual reality I don't envision that all of us are going to come in the morning to our office and we're gonna stick a goggle on our face until 5 o'clock in the afternoon where we go home I just don't see that happening and that's just my perception I do see again technologies perhaps like something less invasive like like the type of technologies that the hololens the meta helmet the mixed reality technologies that are coming up and some other things that there are less invasive and allowed and there allow us to be humans you know allow us to just have the social interaction that we need you know we we have some interesting discussion not too long ago in another group about some of those things can potentially be implanted in our plain brain so it can be implanted in our eyes I don't know you know we just as a reference for example I were with with a physician that treats amputees people that lose arms or legs or something like that and there are there are therapies for pain control that require implanting some electrodes in the spinal cord and she has a fairly large number of patients that do not want to have that implant even though it will ease their pain so so that tells me you know if people that really need an implant do not want to have an implant will we have an implant for sort of recreational purposes so I'm not sure but to me I would say that we need to really to be successful we'll have to go through less invasive technologies and much easy sort of using a basset term you beacuse virtual reality that is there but in a sense you don't feel is there that's that's what I would like to do and that's why we have we we work we continue working on technologies that are not on the user but on the space what the user walks in that space yeah who knows you know maybe next year you will all be laughing no no what she told us last year is what's going on right now I don't know it's very hard to predict yeah well thank you all for coming and let's thank dr. Cruz near again [Applause]
