 [Music] imagine being able to immerse yourself inside a tumor and travel around looking at the different types of cells and how they interact this is what an international team of researchers led by Professor Greg Hannon at the University of Cambridge hopes to do with a 20 million Grand Challenge Award from Cancer Research UK using DNA sequencing imaging techniques and cutting-edge technologies they will gather thousands of pieces of information about every single cell in a tumor from cancer cells to immune cells they will look at how to murrs are structured and how the different cells work together to help tumors survive and grow this will enable them to construct a 3d version of the tumor which they can explore using virtual reality allowing them to study it in entirely new ways that aren't possible in 2d providing new insights into how cancer develops doctors and scientists at opposite ends of the world and with different areas of expertise will be able to examine the patient's tumor at the same time ultimately this could improve how we diagnose and treat cancer and help more people survive [Music] you
