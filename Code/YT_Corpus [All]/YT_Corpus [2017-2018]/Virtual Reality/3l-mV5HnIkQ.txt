 hey everybody final thoughts time for escape room the game virtual reality let's right off the bat talk about the main attraction the VR goggles which to me I'm amazed by I'm a total novice I've got no experience with this whole modern renaissance of VR that's going on but I had no idea it could be this good and I'm sure VR super fans will say yeah this is kind of a poor man's VR with the whole Google cardboard thing but to me I was really blown away the whole stereoscopic thing where one image is piped into one eye and the other the other and.and you know your peripheral vision is cut off so the entirety of your scope of view is this totally immersive world that has real 3d depth to it is absolutely amazing and of course put your phone so close you can actually hear the sounds as well um really really impressive you know and especially important too because this be our approach allows the developers the designers of these VR rooms to create stuff you wouldn't be able to do in a real world escape room I mean the first one you know the first setting submarine its III could see them if they use portholes and TVs behind it to give the impression of over under the ocean and stuff like that that would work okay but I mean because they didn't have to limit or restrict themselves when you're in this submarine looking through this again you're transported and it's really really impressive to be able to have a level of interaction with a space that you I mean you'll never be able to experience in real life but even more so than the first one the second one is really impressive because that room and if you didn't watch my run-through I'm not even gonna tell you what the behind enemy lines is when you first I mean the you should experience that totally not knowing what's going in the first time you put this up and you're like oh my gosh I mean that's how it was for me I can't believe where I am um but the scope and scale the the positioning the presentation I mean they wouldn't be able to create that escape room in real life it would literally be too dangerous to put real escape room players into that circumstance that this thing put you right in the middle of and makes you feel like you're there I'm and I'm and then on top of that you know so that verisimilitude you have you you know where you can see for miles and miles in the second one because of the scope of the world and in a way that you could really really impressive absolutely loved it definitely want to experience more of it actually I'm really kind of I didn't realize that getting this was gonna give me a Google cardboard thing so I'm definitely planning on playing more with Google cardboard cuz I've been so just blown away by that's been lots of fun but so the gimmick works it's really great if you like me have not experienced modern VR you're in for a real treat this is a great way to start but let's put all that aside and let's talk about the escape room element um here's what's really surprising to me I suspect this is gonna drive a lot of people to want to check this out and maybe even folks who aren't really used to escape rooms and because of that I am shocked that the developers identity games they they have um you know this is like I think the 12th and the 11th in the twelfth escape room they put out in this escape room the game system I think 10th or 12th something like that and they've got a one to five star rating scale for how challenging the puzzles are the first one of the two in here is a three and the second one the other events you have is a bore um these are the hardest ones they've ever released these are you know again based on their scale they've I mean because if you get the original version of this I think you get a two a two and A three and a four right off the bat they're giving you a three and a four and Jen and I I'll be honest we've done a few escape rooms now not we've done none in real life but we've done the deck scape games and the unlock games and the exit the room or exit the game games and the both of these were crushingly difficult compared to any of the other ones we've done I mean just completely stop you dead in your tracks oK we've sat here for 20 minutes I have no idea we give up we just give up I want to see the rest I want to see what this does cuz I didn't mention another thing that this can do that you can't do in a real escape room is fundamentally change the circumstances you're in because it's all virtual reality um you know you can make things happen you can pull levers you can do stuff that just fundamentally changes everything around and that's so cool has so much potential but unless you're real is really good at escape rooms you're probably not gonna see any of that stuff because you're just gonna get stuck and run out of time and get really really frustrated Jen I got so frustrated because the difficulty level for both of these is so high now we want to see it all so what we did is you can go to escape room the games website and you can download walkthroughs a PDF that basically walks you through step by step because here's the thing I talked about this in the main run through the hint card system they've got here it's neat it's really clever oh I can't really see what the hints are until I slip them in this thing and it drip-feed you these hints every 5 or 10 minutes or something like that it's interesting if you're doing really poorly these things are just caught they kind of spit in your face a little bit because like look we're still trying to figure out the first puzzle we're 20 minutes in and you're trying to tell us about this other thing that we don't even know exists yet I know and that could just heighten the frustration you're already having so ultimately we said fine let's just go on the website and download the PDF and then now to be fair some of the stuff we looked at he's like oh this is how we're supposed to do it okay I can see how if we if we just kind of looked at it crossways and and you know just kind of just connected our synaptic pathways and plug them back together a different way yeah I can see how maybe we would have thought to do that or if we had seen that particular thing in some other escape room or some other kind of puzzle we'd get it but I mean there were some of these things that I'm reading the describing okay here's how we're supposed to have done this and we still don't understand even though it's walking us through step by step this is how you should understand that all of this means take key number seven because it's the number seven or the letter B or the trapezoid or whatever it might be and we're like you're telling us the answer and we still don't get how you were able how you should have been able to figure that out and that to me again it's what I was saying before it makes no sense to me you're I mean these guys are gonna get such a huge influx of interest because for people who've never tried for a tryout for who never try this you know hey this is two birds with one stone let's try it all this sounds really cool I've got a smartphone I can do this and then they throw you into the deepest end of the shark-filled pool and say good luck because these aren't going to get you through it and I was just as defined by that I really wish they would have revisit a design for this and make these two adventures crazy easy or at least make one of them crazy easy and one of the medium difficulty as opposed to what they did one medium difficulty and one super hard it's clear to me that they assume that people who pick this up are already a fan of the series and have played to the other ones and I could certainly see if we play through some of the ones that came in the original box that only have like a two-star rating and we've worked our way that we we probably would have been able to jump in Yool feet forward and really work our way through these much much quicker but we didn't have that background so it was a real barrier to entry another thing there's actually is kind of a minor complaint when you go to the website to download the walkthrough if you're stuck they actually ask you hey what is the exit eyz and you could only know that answer and literally type it in if you have the thing because I guess they don't want people who haven't bought the thing to see what the answers are I don't know why but what worries and they want to do that and the tricky thing was we were stuck in the first room we were stuck in the in the first section we hadn't gotten to envelope - but when I went to the website to try and look it up it said here's this information you need it's an envelope - so I actually had to go open envelope - before we were even ready for it so I could get the information so I could download the walkthrough for envelope one that was really weird I didn't quite understand why that happened that just seemed really kind of a dumb little move it wasn't that big a deal it was just kind of unfortunate but yeah and here's the thing as well I mean I think this kind of harkens back to the notion that if we had played previous games in this series I don't think we have a problem as much your sinking is the first room is supposed to be a three the second room is supposed to be four we struggled mightily in the first room barely figured anything out on our own and you know maybe we're just idiots maybe Jen and I we just don't have the escape room gene and anybody else who looks at and say oh of course you do this this and this and this and you should be able to figure it out no problem but for us it was a real problem but actually made it through that pretty much having to look at the walkthrough for every single step and sometimes to be fair sometimes saying oh okay I can see how we should be able to figure that out but like you said other times saying look you're explaining how to do it and we still don't understand how we're supposed to know this answer but then we went to the second one the one that was supposed to be harder and we did significantly better on that one we did so much better we only had to use the walk through a few times admittedly at the end of the second one they throw you into this thing that I mean it feels like you'd have to be a NASA scientist to figure it out it's so it's really interesting in that it's incredibly grounded in the reality of the circumstance you're in and I don't want to spoil anything about that but what you have to figure out it feels like yeah to figure this out this is gonna be as much work as it was to actually plot an alternate route for Apollo 13 when everything went you know it's like that level of stuff I'm like oh no that's just a four star like ah we just want to have some fun with a VR and escaper why did you give us an easy one again it's absolutely it's bonkers to me and all that aside I am gonna say in spite of all these complaints I'm still so glad I did it even though we pre-much had to download the walkthrough and use it step-by-step and honestly I would suggest if you pick this up and you get frustrated don't be like me and Jen and say no we're gonna figure this out we should be you know and just get more and more frustrated as soon as you feel frustrated at all and but I know and these hints that you're supposed to use aren't helping you just go straight to the walkthrough it's let it be about the journey not the destination who cares what your final score is in your final time just have fun I think if we had been willing to do that sooner we probably would have enjoyed it a lot more instead of just being stubborn know we're gonna figure this out because we should be able to because we're smart people gosh darn it and no we're just not I don't know um at least you know this thing really put us through our paces and like I said in spite of everything I just complained about I'm still so glad I experienced it I want to do more of these I I mean I just want some that are a little bit more newbie friendly because I want to go to I want to have more virtual reality rooms that are impossible to create in any other way um you know and and the way that you can interact with them and change them and tweak them and they they can change right around you and pull you into that world and then still okay now let's take them off and figure out how this puzzle works so you still get that it's a great combination I see great things for this I just would like to see something maybe it's a bit more tuned to my elbow one more thing I should say that I'm actually very impressed by um and I I think I've forgotten now if I actually talked about this in the main run-through I might not have there are some elements when you open up these envelopes that when you take them out you're like oh I see we have to do something destructive this we have to write on it or we have to fold it up we have to cut it and you know you've seen these in other escape room in your home too and that ends up meaning that oh well this is a one-time thing I can never after I'm finished with this and I enjoyed it I want to give it to my friends I can't do that because they can't have the experience for the first time because I've already mixed up here's the interesting thing every time in this box that it presents you with a with a new element that you're gonna have to modify or destroy in some way on that element there's a little icon that is a picture of a printer it actually talks about this in the rules whenever you see this printer icon that means that particular element is one that you can go on to their website and download a PDF of it and then print that out so this is one where you have all the fun of being able to tear things up and rip them up and you know and devil-may-care attitude about all that stuff but then if you have a color printer you can just reprint it out put it back together and then use this as a gift to give to others and I thought that was actually really really cool I actually you know if you watch the run-through and saw the you know the elements that you see in the first five seconds you actually saw one of those and again I don't remember if I actually mentioned at the time or if I just kept it a secret I meant to keep it a secret but maybe I showed you but it works really nicely I could actually hand this to a friend now after I reprinted out the stuff that Jen and I destroyed and they could have a first-time experience forward - well done there and if you're a crazy escape room nut you gotta try it because chances are you won't get stuck with these things but if you're a new novice like us it's still worth checking out you just gotta know going in don't even try to climb that hill have the walkthrough ready at hand any moment you feel frustrated just go to it I I think you know there's particular types of puzzles you can do a good two thirds of the puzzles that were in here we felt we're actually really nice some of them we're absolutely brilliant and again some of them were puzzles that could only be done with this virtual reality and real world mix that you wouldn't be able to really accomplish any other way in any kind of feasible way so I loved him I think the ones that really hit us hard were the ones where like it's kind of a math problem you know because they give you all this information well for X to be true y must be something else and X plus y can't be this other thing but X minus y wouldn't be less than this other thing and if you bring in Z Z is a coefficient of xny and it's like ah okay I look at this and I understand I should be able to watch it all this stuff out but man there's nothing fun about that at all those ones they're a few of them came up and they're like oh really this is supposed to be fun I mean because there are so many cool fun things you do like you know craft project where you move things around and put them together and make stuff and then say oh because we've we've constructed this thing and now we look at it from a certain angle and boom those are the awesome things and I wish there were more of those and less of the really complex logic problems but heck maybe you're somebody who really likes those I just know particularly in the second one that the the end the last chapter ie the last envelope of the second adventure it is that wall to wall and it is absolutely insane I mean we got about halfway through it and to be fair some of the elements in it we felt really smart because we figured it out and Jen was doing most of the math and she was mostly way through it but then at one point I realized hey wait a minute okay we know this and we know this and I went back and I looked and I physically looked around where I was I said well you know what based on what I'm just forget about all the math and the equations and all the stuff you're trying to do based on what I'm looking at it has to be this or this you know what let's flip a coin and just try and plug them all in and we got lucky and that's how we won and that that was weird I had mixed feelings about it it felt like a cheat but it also felt really cool I kind of wish the real solution for that was supposed to be no forget about all that math stuff don't use your actual um you know your your your sense of place and your observation skills of this huge worlds that they've created for you in this virtual space and solve it that way that I felt really clever having pulled that off except that I realize yeah but that's not how we're supposed to figure it out we're a trio because they clearly set up so that oh yeah you can do that and you can eliminate some things but then you're still supposed to do the last bit of math and where'd I forget that last bit of math we'll just try both codes and yeah and it worked I don't know I'm talking about this a lot because man on the whole like I said I'm super happy I did this uh-huh and I just wish we hadn't been so stubborn because I think we would have walked away very happy if we just said as soon as we realized we don't get this fine let's just go to the walkthrough and we would had a great time I think we had better time if they would have made it more for newbies but they didn't that was a choice they made so it's just something I gotta warn you going in on the whole though I still recommend it because I love this thing and that's it folks thanks for watching questions comments concerns as always please let me know otherwise have a very nice day talk to you later so long
