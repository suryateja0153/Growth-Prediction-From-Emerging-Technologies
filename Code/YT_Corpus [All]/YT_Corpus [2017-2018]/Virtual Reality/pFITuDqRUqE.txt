 [Steven Goodale] Every time there's new technology, especially something as groundbreaking as VR and AR, there are so many things that have to be defined and understood. [Phillip Kauffold] So virtual reality actually places you completely inside a different world all together. [Crysta Frost] You're not looking at a screen anymore. You're not sitting in a chair anymore. You're actually in the game. [Kauffold] You can be flying in outer space and actually feel like you're in the cockpit of a spaceship. [Frost] It's really the most immersive way to experience any game. It's super cool. [Goodale] Augmented or mixed reality is taking or adding digital elements to your real world. [Kauffold] The first time i tried it, it really seemed like the technology I was waiting my whole life for. This was sort of the Holodeck from Star Trek. [Goodale] So the Cadillac experience for augmented reality is the HoloLens. The HoloLens has the ability to read the room that you're in. Cute little things might come bubbling out of the ground and talk to you. We might capture that wall and then remove it entirely, and make some other landscape there instead. It's a way of adding digital elements to your real world. [Kauffold] So if you're interested in VR, we're going to make sure that you have all the tools that you need to actually work with it. You're going to have scripting. You're going to have art. You're going to have 3D modeling. You're going to be a very well-rounded person by the time you actually get to actually designing for virtual reality. [Frost] I get to use all the same software I'll be using when I actually get hired. [Dillon Haight] All the teachers are industry professionals, and they have a lot of great insights into what is going on in the industry. [Kauffold] You get to blaze a trail. You get to go where somebody has never gone before. You get to try something that's never been tried before. And just the feeling of being in this environment that you've created is very powerful. [Goodale] So if you've been dreaming about building amazing virtual realities, amazing experiences for people, using the very coolest and latest technology and toys, the Academy of Art University's School of Game Development is the place to do it.
