 hi I'm psii and I want to tell you that our hands are unique and necessary to interact with the environment. After suffering a stroke you may lose the use of a hand, which is a disability in daily living. Therapies used for long-term rehabilitation include mirror therapy, biofeedback and observation of movements. Based on the motto we believe what we see these therapeutic approaches can be merged and put into a virtual world. With psii both the active hands and the paretic hand are perceived as active functioning hands in the virtual world. While the active hand can be used just like in the real world the virtual movement of the paretic hand are animated. If the affected hand is completely impaired the movements will be artificially animated. If some functionality remains in the affected hand the virtual hand is controlled by its EMG signals. Within this virtual world the patient carries out task oriented and repetitive challenges in which both hands are active. The aim of this interactive illusion is to provide the best possible stimulation of neuroplasticity to support the rehabilitation of the paretic hand. This is the idea of psii
