 101 WESTBOUND AT 35TH AVENUE, THAT LOOKS GREAT. YOU'VE GOT THREE KIDS, CHRIS. YOU'VE WITNESSED THE LABOR OF LOVE. ANY WOMAN WILL TELL YOU GIVING BIRTH, IT'S NOT QUITE A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE. BUT ONLY ON ABC15 MORNINGS, INSTEAD OF USING NARCOTICS TO NUMB THE PAIN, JOHN FOUND DOCTORS THAT WANT TO TAKE WOMEN TO A VIRTUAL WORLD.  THE MIRACLE OF LIFE DEPICTED IN MOVIES. FOR SOME IT'S NOT THAT FAR OFF FROM THE TRUTH. MORE AND MORE WOMEN ARE SHYING AWAY FROM PAIN MEDICINE DURING LABOR. FORGET THE EPIDURAL. BANNER UNIVERSITY WANTS TO TAKE MOMS TO BE TO ANOTHER WORLD.  THEY'RE SWIMMING WITH DOLPHINS, FLYING WITH THE EAGLES, SITTING ON A BEACH, LISTENING TO OCEAN.  DR. FOLEY IS LEADING A PILOT PROGRAM TO GIVE WOMEN VIRTUAL REALITY HEADSETS RIGHT BEFORE CHILDBIRTH TO ELIMINATE THEIR PAIN.  THE PAIN IS THERE, BUT YOU'RE DISTRACTED IN A WAY THAT YOU DON'T NEED THE MEDICATION, OR AS MUCH OF THE MEDICATION.  I'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT BEING IN LABOR IS LIKE, STATING THE OBVIOUS, BUT I WANTED TO SEE HOW IT WORKS. THE BANNER TEAM DEMOED WHAT THE WOMEN MIGHT EXPERIENCE. SANDY BEACHES PAIRED WITH SOOTHING SOUNDS. AT ONE POINT I ALMOST FORGOT I WAS STILL STANDING IN A HOSPITAL. IN PHOENIX, JOHN GENOVESE, ABC15 ARIZONA.  BANNER SAYS IT WILL BE THE FIRST IN THE VALLEY TO USE VIRTUAL REALITY IN THIS WAY. DOCTORS ARE STILL DECIDING EXACTLY WHAT VIDEOS THEY'LL USE AND WHO WILL BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE. BUT ANYTHING ELSE THAT CAN HELP NAVIGATE THAT PAIN, RIGHT?  AS A HUSBAND WHO HAS BEEN THROUGH THIS, THE ONE WHERE SHE'S HOLDING THEIR HAND SQUEEZING, I GUESS ANY DISTRACTION WOULD BE WELCOME. I SAY HEY, TRY IT OUT, PROBABLY NOT IN LIEU OF THE DRUGS. MY WIFE WAS ALL ABOUT NUMBING THE PAIN.
