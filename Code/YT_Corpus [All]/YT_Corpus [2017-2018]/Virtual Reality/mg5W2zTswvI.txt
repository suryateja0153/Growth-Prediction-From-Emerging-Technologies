 We've created this initial prototype for track cycling based on a Commonwealth Games Stadium in Chandler and it really gives users I guess the the experience of what it's like to go right in that environment. The banks and velodromes are really steep and quite intimidating. This takes it to a new level having the simulation there and being able to ride and have almost that augmented reality but in the virtual environment maybe it will inspire a few people to jump on bikes themselves and head down a local track and get involved by starting just maybe at a young age and having that virtual experience first and then moving to the competitive environment later on. From the elite perspective as well we get to give them an opportunity to train and have coaching feedback in real time online next to them. So it's a yes it's been a great success so far
