 virtual reality is very useful in science and in complex things but it also has a role to play in simple things such as the most the most mundane business tasks I believe can be used for you can use virtual reality to gaming science at the Idaho National Laboratory we started doing virtual reality of 2009 our first system was a cave that was planned to be deployed in the summertime in order to prepare for the cave we chose to bring some content to get some content ready ready through the use of a portable portable cave that that experience gave us great exposure to experts to the processes to the technologies and most importantly it gave us a working model of one of our nuclear reactor facilities the University is working on the blended reality space from augmented reality to virtual reality to really set a stepping stone of what is going to be their path or the roadmap to the education of the future the kind of technologies are going to impact all industry that of course depending on the industry we will see a bigger or smaller impacts in general is where this is going to happen versus in in those industry delivering services and complex services education is one of those works on all the health industry is going to be heavily affected by this kind of technology at Case Western Reserve University we partner with Cleveland Clinic in order to use augmented reality for our new health education campus this health education campus will house the schools of medicine dance all nursing and the Cleveland Clinic school of learner medicine all in one building really putting the disciplines together for one of the first times in education and this building is almost half a million square feet and so we are really looking at the state of the future here we decided not to put in cadaver labs to teaching at I mean we wanted to do something very new and very different so we were introduced to hololens from Microsoft in November of 2014 my expectations for that technology seeing at first were very low I had done some other virtual reality and some mixed reality and I just didn't think it would it would work and I went through the first demo that Microsoft did with us this is very very early it was still tethered it still had all kinds of wires going through your head and out but my first reaction was you just changed my life I came out of the first demo and told them you just changed my life this is technology I did not think I would ever see in my lifetime let alone my professional lifetime virtual reality right now is helping users analyze multi-dimensional data at the laboratory and the one example of this sort of data is electric vehicle charging information relative to your electric vehicle where it parks how it's how it charges where it charges that the data set that actually contains your electric vehicle charging information is multi-dimensional it has maybe up to 20 dimensions and data is embedded in the in each data in each point using virtual reality using a 3d display allows our researchers to display up to right now they're displaying 10 dimensions of data concurrently giving you insights into that into that electric vehicle but the behavior of the of the driver and the things that you can do to optimize the charging infrastructure we got really interested in how can we use this in in this new health education campus and have been exploring with Microsoft since early 2015 million when we started this technology development in order to be able to teach anatomy in a whole different way and with 3d and augmented reality which means I can see you two I'm not just in some world of my own it has really brought to light a new way of learning for our students
