 - Today, we're facing our fears in Virtual Reality. (spooky music) - So, we're gonna be playing the VR game, Don't Let Go. - And it's called that, literally, because you're like, supposed to hold the buttons, and not let go while all this crazy shit is happening to you. - If we do let go, we have to eat a real spider. (splat) - Which I refuse to do. I will not be doing that today. - I think, like, probably what I'm most afraid of, I don't like things in large quantities. - Any time there's like, a swarm of bugs. - Hopefully, there's no swarms of insects. - Anything with like, too many legs, I'm not into. - I also think VR, in general, is kind of scary. - It also makes me super nauseous. - I just hope that there's not a snake, and I hope that there's not a cat. - I've played scary games before, where I can't even hold onto the controller. Like, throw the controller at the TV. - I'm gonna make sure that my hands are glued to these buttons, and I'm not letting go. - I really don't want to eat a spider. Oh my gosh! Okay, This game can cause anxiety. Well, that's great. I don't have any of that. - Oh! Whoa. Whoa. I'm in a wha? Argh! Who's hands are these?! These are like, white people hands, it makes me nervous! - Whoa. Oh! Are those my hands? - This office is nice, though. It's like, oh, a little fax machine. - Hold both control buttons. Here we go. (buzzing sound) Wow, cool, right off the bat, bees. - This isn't bad though, 'cause there's only like, a few. We're friends. I'd like to think, I'm like, a friend of the animals. - Oh, whoo! Oh my God! There are bugs flying all around me, okay. - Oh, this is awful. Why is this a thing? - Someone should really call maintenance, though, 'cause there are a lot of (bleep) bees in here. - My hands are, like, shaking. I don't wanna like, accidentally let go of the keyboard. - I think the scariest part is like, that my hands are wierd and big. Like I can't move my fingers. That's weird. Oh, there's a bee in my ear. - Ah! Oh! Ooh! It sounds like it bit me. Ah! Okay, there's a dinosaur walking into the room. - Oh my gosh! Wait, should I be afraid of this? - What are you doing, velociraptor? - Hi! Oh, wait. No, now this is weird. Please leave. You're too close. - Oh! Ooh! Whoa! He's gonna bite me. It's okay! I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid of you, I'm not afraid of you. Yeah! What? Get outta here. - What the hell even is going on? I'm in an office building. - Cool. So, this is just casual. Another day at the office, and uh--- Ah! Oh! God! (splat) Oh! Whoa! - Whoa! - Someone is throwing knives at me from the ceiling. - Whoo! Ah, okay. That one was pretty good. - Now, the lights are dimming. And there's a spider warning. Cool. - Okay, I can do this. It's a friend. - This is, it's just unsettling. - I don't know where it is. I don't know where it is! - I don't like that. Please leave. Where'd it go? Is it on me? I don't wanna look. Okay, uh. - It's in my hair. It's in my hair. It's inside of my head. - The, spider in your ear, audio is top notch. - I'm just gonna pretend it's like, somebody eating potato chips. - Not seeing it is scarier than seeing it. - Ooh, it's dark now. - The knives are levitating? Why? Who's doing this? - This is some supernatural shit. - Oh, I guess it's virtual reality. I can't blow out the match. Oh, stop. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Oh. - Okay. - (giggles) Scary marker. - Please stop. Aah! - Whoa! - Oh! - Did I drool everywhere? I feel like there's spit flying. - Okay, let's be done. Okay. Victory. - I think it helped that I didn't have to like, do anything but just sit there. - (sigh) I just need a second. - I won though, right? No! No! - That was a good scare. - The way you're completely immersed in it, feels like you are actually in that space. - I'm mainly just happy I don't have to eat a spider now. - I don't have to eat a spider, which is great. - Let's bring it on. - (bleep) Oh my God! - Ew, why does it come in like, a tuna can? That's my least favorite part of this. - It's canned! - Ew, is it gonna smell? - Aaaaaah! Ah, oh my God! I'm gonna die! - Oh, okay, it's kinda cute. - [Woman] I was expecting something really bad, but this is much worse. Does it seem like you can cut it? - Yeah, let's try. - Aah! We're okay. You're okay, and so am I. We're both okay. Ready? - One-two-three It tastes like jerky. - I don't like jerky. - It wasn't that bad. - It wasn't that bad. - I loved that you freaked, no, I agree. The image of the spider was worse. - Rolling out of the can. This was much scarier than facing our fears in virtual reality. - One hundred per cent. - Nothing beats IRL. - Yes, that is the best way to put it. - That's the moral of the story. - Nothing is scarier than real life. - [Guy] This was really spoopy. Am I using that word correctly? Spoopy? Sort of? Cool, all right.
