 [Music] and today I have the distinct pleasure of introducing car scale a welcome crash to Google thank you guys so the first I started playing table probably when I was around 10 years old and I remember one of one of our family friends name is preadly Ben day he came to our hometown in Greenville North Carolina and then he sat down with us and in one time at dinner he saw some table which were there in the living room then he pulled him out and he asked my dad can you play table or can i play table and I said no I'm only 10 years old so so then he started playing and then I lo and behold he became my guru which started off really like a career with around 2 years of me playing but then I gave it up and then I didn't even think about how much love and how much like fascination I had with table how did you actually start learning to play fella and how did that how did that life well I mean the blob was kind of always in my house my father's very much into Indian classical music and build music and old Marathi folk music and all that tennis soso that since I was born this music was playing in my house and he actually had SS in the house since I think I was about 3 or 4 years old so I always kind of went over and I had a kind of natural inclination to the instrument but I rebelled against it it was awesome well because growing up in Long Island in the early 80s I was probably the only Indian kid in a school of about 2000 mostly Jewish kids and it was just not something that I could use as you know as a part of my identity so I was I mean I was a drummer I started playing drink it I was into heavy metal and hard rock and all that kind of what kind of music were you listening to that all about rush Led Zeppelin I mean those were my doorways into music was definitely Russian Led Zeppelin yeah and then I mean all kinds of different stuff becomes of progressive rock and and it wasn't so my dad kind of realized that you know I was listening to sophisticated music so he took me to seize occupy he took me to see Zakir Hussain perform in Columbia University and that was the first time I realized that you know you can you can take this art form and because I witnessed it I witnessed this guy come to New York and take this classical art form and turn it into a rock concert you know and everybody left there you know I mean this guy wasn't he wasn't just a classical musician he was a rock star is that when you knew that you could actually make a career out of it was I mean I was too young to think about it as a career I just knew that this was something that I all of a sudden was something I wanted to make a part of my identity as a human being not I mean I didn't really understand what how that was going to play out later on in my career but that was where I really embraced table and embraced the science of them and embraced what it had to offer to not just as a as a tabla player as a classical musician but to all the different forms of music that I was involved in because it was informing everything so that was the that was my doorway into playing double and then of course from there it evolved into becoming a serious student so I don't know how many of you in the audience have followed car so I've been following him since he first debuted and around like 2001 here's with the realize album I remember distinctly I was in my freshman year of college with my friend rocky and me though and we were in his car he puts on this track and then out of nowhere I fell in love with tabla all over again and that for me was when I knew that this is a completely different sound like you were doing things in music that no one else had ever done before it's just more than just special it was an awakening into a new movement tell me a little bit about the motivation for this album and kind of like what year where your inspiration came from for it well the first album is called realize for a reason realized was actually a line in a song that I was working on with a friend which wound up on the album call fabric a few years before the album came out and the line in the song is 1,001 designs intertwine which one is mine and then allies so realize was kind of the culmination of everything that I had done as a musician as an artist as an explorer of music and finally kind of finding that laser-like hole that I could send all of that information through so and it really had to do with identity it had to do with the fact that back then and this was at a time where we didn't have social media we didn't have access to anything so everything that we were hearing about was all kind of legend you know that in London this this stuff is happening in San Francisco this kind of thing is happening so that became a huge impetus to kind of get involved in this movement that was about defining a a new generations identity where we didn't have we didn't we didn't come we don't come from India in that way we didn't I mean Bollywood didn't necessarily define who we are neither did you know the kind of DC Bhangra parties that were happening at the time sort so we needed to create something else we needed to create a safe space for people to be able to come and express who it is exactly who they are and that's what this music was about it wasn't just about my music at that same time there was this whole movement going on in London with Alvin singing and Nitin Sawhney and the Anoka movement in Russia but marsh and tree and then there was there was a whole movement happening here in San Francisco yeah and then was stuff happening in New Delhi and in Tokyo and it all started happening at the same time so we all found out that we we all thought for a moment that we were the only ones in the world doing what we were doing and then we realized that this was actually something that was happening and we were just part of a time period you know where we needed to define something and I think what you felt was probably similar to what I felt when I saw is occupy perform which is just that yeah I mean this is me this is not you know and that's what I've learned I think as an artist ever since making that first album is that people when you make music you can be as specific as you as you want to be about your own story but it really only takes shape when somebody else's mirror is in front of them and it reflects off of their own story when people feel like this is this is who I am right so you perform regularly with artists of all different backgrounds right specializing in percussion strings coral different disciplines last night you played at the SF jazz blues s Center amazing performance things there what kind of emotion do you draw from your audience when you're playing I think I mean I'm less drawing from the audience and more trying to paint pictures that I think that the audience will resonate with and it's always different you know I just before coming to SF Jazz I didn't twelve dates in India where I was doing a DJ tour and we're really happy that you came all the way to Google as part of that yes part of me is still in India right now forgive this like jetlag but sorry I lost my my my spot over the last part of the last question oh yeah I was just saying like how do you how do you actually just draw from energy from the audio and how people are relating to you yeah I mean once again I mean back to what I was saying before I think it's it's really about in over the years I mean when I made the first album I was kind of shooting shooting in the dark I had no idea how people were going to react and it was overwhelming the reaction but what stayed after after the kind of the initial wave was that people would run to this day people from all over the world they write to me about the fact that the music played a particular role at a sometimes at a very difficult time in their lives or at a time where they needed to get through something or it was something that motivated them to be able to reach another level and I realize that for me that's the kind of music that I listen to as well music is medicine at its most potent you know so what I really try and focus on is the fact that you know people will dance and people will get into stuff and you know people have come up to me and say hey man it was some state beats you and all that kind of stuff but what really where I feel like I'm successful as an artist is when people come to me and say that that the music resonated in a way where it was transformative it really helped them through something I know my wife Ronnie she very much so indebted because he always listen to your music in med school and it's what I pretty much like gotta curse oh wow I think she can relate to that if you had the opportunity for one year to go back in time and study from one of the grades that you haven't already worked with so far who would it be Peter Gabriel okay yeah he's just somebody who I mean not just Peter Gabriel but I mean I've always been fascinated by artists who were willing to change the terrain who were willing to kind of whatever path was in front of them they decided to to go into the forest and completely change the perception of what music was someone like Peter Gabriel let me keep he was quite instrumental in introducing the world to what we call world music yeah any particular track of his that all gone albums albums I mean everything from Genesis all the wait till when he went solo into the passion soundtrack to all of his solo albums now he's just somebody who's he doesn't think in terms of a conventional format you know we when we make remaking a rock song you want to have drums and bass and guitar and maybe some keyboards and vocals but someone like Peter Gabriel will get else younger to play electric violin and have you so endorsing this one little line at the end of the song you know and create I mean the ornaments on the tree that he creates are so unique and so that's these are the kind of people that I grew up I mean still these are the people that you know I look to as inspirations I mean soccer by is another one term you know Bill Laswell another one staying there's no I mean these are people who when they make music they think so outside of the box that I think that when they're doing it they're probably a little scared as well in terms of I don't know how this is going to land but usually they land on their feet what's your message to all the young and upcoming artists I think this is something that you're very passionate about you try to be extremely proactive how do you suggest that they actually try to navigate the waters in this very competitive I think it's especially nowadays because we are so inundated with so much information and this you know you just go on YouTube and you can anything that you're looking for you'll find 16 hours worth of content that I think that what oftentimes happens is that we as artists or not just artists but especially young artists tend to want to fit into a mold and fit into a box or fit into a already tried and true path that's been created whether it be Indian classical music or techno or punk rock music whatever it is that so that they can immediately say this is what I do and I think that those who I mean the people that I've seen who have been able to create a lasting career are the people that create something that that no one's necessarily heard of before something outside of a genre something outside of a of a particular box you know that's I think that what I always when I meet young artists who come to me and say you know I've been listening to your music and if I listen to it and it sounds like me the first thing that I say is that so I'm just waiting for it to sound like you now you know you need to now find a completely different space and that is yours you know because the thing is is that there's so many different places that an artist can explore that resonate with people and this isn't foreign art we're not creating something that people won't understand but it's about having the courage to be able to step out of that you know if you can find it on YouTube then create something that you can't find you you know that would be my advice to any young artist is to try at least be that should be your pursuit because I think that in the end where you wind up is is at a whole nother space that's really good advice technology is a huge part of our daily lives today and you had harp you talked about this a little bit earlier especially for artists this is how you're able to produce you're able to record different thoughts and emotions which instantly can be shared with the masses reason I think YouTube's a great way of being able to distribute that kind of content what do you think that Google can do more of to try to help upcoming artists and people who are thinking of trying to share their music and get out there more I think I mean especially for for new artists I think when when when YouTube first started it seemed a lot easier to be able to find new because there wasn't been as much content available it was a lot easier to find new content I think now because there's just so much stuff out there it's very difficult for a young artist to be able to get hurt to be able to get and to find an audience and if there was a maybe a space where people could go to - only for and strictly for brand new presentations of whatever it is whether it be in studio presentations or videos that young artists have created or a new tracks or you know new artwork that that there's a dedicated space where people can actually go to that they know that this is old this is brand new fresh stuff you know and then of course there's all the other stuff that you can find the stuff that we've been watching for for years and years and now there's all the archival stuff you know that we can get to but it winds up getting so mixed up that people don't realize that this is brand-new you know we don't ever hardly look at the date the upload date sure no so I think one of the nice things is for instance like if someone wanted to learn even double off from the very beginning part of the very early stages now you can go and you can ask for something like ding tau and then you can go through and their hundred different variations of how to do this oh yes so many different teachers online you can actually do that - it's amazing I mean that was actually the other day my daughter came home and she's 15 and she played me some song and she was like I want to learn this on the piano I was kind of a little busy at the time I was like let's do it on Sunday by the time Sunday rolls around cheating she had learned the song already because she went on YouTube and found a tutorial and she played it for me and taught me the song oh you've been in the industry now I'd say what at least about 25 years in 25 years house technology changed the music in this world my god I've seen mainly how people create pieces I've seen this especially in the music world I mean when I was in college I was at NYU I was learning how to record two two inch tape and we were cutting editing my cutting tape and sticking it up on the wall and figuring out where the snare drum hit so that we can cut it at the right spot so we can bring in the you know another part or you know truncate one section and all of this stuff that I spent years learning and then the year I graduated Pro Tools was available in in your in your bedroom so I hardly I don't think I ever used that ever again so I mean it was I mean it's been a I think every year or two technology would just take a leap forward in terms of what you're able to do I mean I came from I came from a time where we needed to get together with 16 musicians in the studio we'd spend three days recording and if you messed up you have to start again and editing was a big problem and then when it came down to mixing a track there would be five of us sitting at a board and we'd have to you know all sit there and kind of also got to get the reverb out that you know at the bridge and if you miss it you have to start over again whereas now you can literally I mean I've I have been at the airport seeing something inspiring yeah worked on a track on my phone and landed and have made a video for the track that I made on my phone and have put it up on YouTube in within five hours I mean that's that's the power distribution well this is the power of what you know what's available now I mean I think the only thing that people need to me to balance is that D the human element in that the experience that one needs to be able to have it's not enough to just have the technology it's about marrying the the two and and if you're able to actually get access to that kind of knowledge to be able to help be able to you know be able to create something on the spot yeah and be able to share it and get feedback and you know end up in the manner that we're able to do right now that we also need to be able to have that library of information for people to be able to access so that they can keep going back and referencing what it is that they're doing in and where they're drawing their inspirations from so let's move into kind of like the VR unlike the things so you and I we've been working working together for about eight months or Sonia and kima share with the audience a little bit about kind of like our VR experiment kind of what we're working on yeah and so for those of you who may not know this is the Google VR jump rig it's it's a product that we have here where we're working with GoPro cameras to be the VR experience is something that Kirsch and I are very passionate about so give it to you to talk a little bit about kind of the motivation behind what were you well I mean I think I mean from for me I mean even going back to my childhood what I've always wanted to have is more access to the artists that I was listening to and back then we had vinyls we had magazines you know you occasionally we'd get to see them on television and that was about it so I mean I had videotapes that I've played a thousand times and studied just to be able to get into the intimate details of what these artists were doing you know and even now when my daughter comes and asks me she's a musician as well about a particular musician whether it be someone the Prince or David Bowie or and I always say to her that you know you need to spend the rest of your life sitting in that geniuses chair and figuring out what it is that they did wonder how it is that they came about what did what they created and when the VR world came came about I was the first thing that came to my mind was that what an incredible way to be able to give people access to let them step into the studio to step into the world of an artist and not just as a performer I mean there's obviously the performance aspect where people can actually be there and sit right next to the musician and and watch them and watch their hands and watch their expressions and kind of try and get that that vibe and even interact with them but there's also the the aspect of getting into the studio and and being in an environment where you can actually interact where you can while in real time there's a there's a track that's being created that's being manifested right right in front of you and then people leave the room and then you're able to actually go in and and play with that you know have the kind of unprecedented access that we've never had before with artists I mean that was the most inspiring thing about the VR world you know that my initial inspiration and then I mean then there's the the entire world of how to change the the whole relationship between I mean like we're on a stage and you guys are in the audience right now but that this we can change we can change this whole interaction we can change the fact that like you know musicians are are put on a pedestal and the audience sits in a place where you can only have a certain level of access so if you can actually step on stage and go behind the artist and and it just completely changes your perspective and I think about this when I was 7 years old and I went to see Zakir by if I could have went up on stage and sat behind him while he was performing and kind of gotten that kind of access of what I know how much information that would have been for me you know it took me years to just study whatever bits and pieces that I could get and I realized that like for young for young artists for young students of music and just fans of music to be able to have that kind of access especially in a day now where digital music has the one thing that it's done is it's also erased those artifacts that we used to get from artists the liner notes the information the stuff the stuff they'd write in albums and stuff the stuff that you little intimate details that you that made you feel like you're a little bit closer to the artist have kind of disappeared so in that place I feel like we are stepping into a whole nother world where we can give people a really incredible access to you know to what it and not just for music I mean this yes this is for anything all walks I'd like to take this moment and open it up for audience questions that people have any questions we have mics what are the challenges of effectively using spatial audio in VR ah well I think that that's just that's something that we're still exploring so I think that I'll to answer that question in maybe a few months in terms of what the challenges might be thanks how do you address like creative blocks like I think every artist experiences that and like what is sorry or I guess methodology of getting over that hump well I mean for me I mean if I get a creative block when I'm working on my own stuff I just stop I just stop until I mean for me and it doesn't work unless I'm inspired you know and sometimes I've inspired at 3 o'clock in the morning I'll get straight out of bed and I'll go start working on something if I'm working on something for say a film or you know something that requires a deadline I've I've amassed enough skills to be able to get it done you know but I think that the difference is getting something done that you know that you know will you know will do the job and then there's that inspired work that you know only works when you're inspired here use play a lot of instruments how did what were you like are you done all those instrument ladies how do you take your time learning those instruments like was it one instrument for specific specific period of time or how did force like ah well I mean I I when I was growing up I was a drummer so I had whenever I had band rehearsals they were at my house so all of the musicians would bring their instruments to my house and they would leave them there so I had a house full of at a bass and a bass amp with pedals I had a guitar with guitar pedals I had an 8-track recorder and a keyboard and all of the stuff that I never played myself but that's how I learned how to play it and I learned also because I had an 8-track recorder I started making my own music terrible music but it was my own stuff so I was learning how to know right bass lines and then how that worked in counterpoint to a keyboard part and how that worked with a guitar part and you know and then how that worked with a particular drum part that I was writing and so these were all you know that that was a way for me to kind of step into that world of making music on different instruments and I realized that my fascination with music was never only based on one instrument when I would listen to when I was growing up listening to Lenoir rush or queen or I mean I was always listening to really big music with a lot of stuff going on and I always wanted to be able to dupe all of it you know it wasn't about being you know a an expert or virtuoso at any of that any of those particular things this were means to be able to create that large sound to be able to so that's why I learned how to and I always excited started playing so I wrote for a little while played some Thor for a little while and I knew that I wasn't going to play these instruments for the rest of my life but there was something that I learned there was something that I was able to that I still apply in my own music by spending that two years playing several and those four years playing some Thor and you know as a tabla player as a composer you know all of these things come into play a lot of people a lot of musicians especially producers that you meet oftentimes are people who have been able to explore a lot of different styles of music and a different different instrumentation it's important to know the physicality of what it is that you're working with so now when I work with a guitar player I have a much deeper understanding of what it is that they're doing besides me just asking for something and then delivering it I know what to ask for I know what their physical limitations are I know the limitations of the instrument itself you know I'm not going to sit here and do a guitar solo for you but I know enough about the instrument to be able to work with great guitar players and get more out of that interaction for me I feel like you your fusion music was the first that kind of connected with me in a very like pure and specific way and yet it's always evolving and you're always pushing the boundaries on it so where do you feel that fusion music is today and where do you think it's headed well I think booking fusion music is I mean has always been happening right it was that's what music is I mean everything even Indian classical music exclusion you know it's it's it's a fusion of many different ideas that come together in in on one stage but you know these ideas come from many different places so I think that it's it's it's always evolving I mean Fusion is is is the process it's not a style it's not a it's not a particular of music Fusion is the is the process that we acknowledge as music is evolving in front of us you know and we might have had a moment where this was our time this was the time where we resonated most with that music but it's you know I think that what I've seen what's happening today is another generation of artists now who are they are already fused they're they're growing up with you know with you Srinivasan dr. Hussain and John Coltrane and you know the latest heavy metal album and the latest Anderson pack record and you know whatever new hip-hop record is coming out all happening at the same time and they're expressing that all at the same time you know and I mean some of the artists that I work with now in my in my collective in India are young artists who are really blowing my mind with how they're able to come in and be like oh yes this this is that right so it's kind of like a techno you meets budgin meets you know like classical thing with a little Carnatic twist and you know a dash of heavy metal done you know whereas for us it took us years to be able to kind of get to that point where we understood you know so I think that I mean if anything that's I think where we're at now is that the music that we're going to hear from now on is going to be on a whole nother level hi gosh huge fans love your work I would like to ask you about taste and if you from your own experience have any ideas on creating a rich journey of discovery new music well I mean that was what I was actually addressing before I think that there's they're still there needs to be a little bit more of a platform for for new emerging artists who have something new to say because oftentimes it gets lost in the mix you know there's so much stuff out there that it's hard to find the new stuff you know and I think that that also has to do with it's also a curators job to bring those things together and present new music in that particular way you know and I think there are people out there are people who are doing podcasts and people who are putting the other playlists that that a lot of people check out because they trust what it is I mean I remember when I was coming up back then it was it was people whose radio shows you know but there were a few people who were responsible for introducing the world to some of the you know like I remember when my album my second album n'cole play was still a new band you know that was being introduced as a you know a brand new artist you know in this in this compilation that I was a part of now they're of course the biggest bands on the planet but yeah that was it was because there was a platform like that so I think that that's that's the important thing is to be able to have and encourage people as well to to share playlists and and to share to curate you know these kinds of things where where people have access to new music and new artists so one thing I want to know because you've been in the industry for a while and you're with various artists from India or from elsewhere I mean how do they approach the music I mean what's the difference in their approach to the music which is I mean the Asian underground is still based on Indian classical up to next rent so how do they approach the music based on their cultural background I mean I can't really say that there is a particular I mean every and every musician is different you know I've been I've met artists that are purists coming from the electronic music world that don't really necessarily understand how to step out of that particular box I've met Indian classical musicians who've been playing for decades who have absolutely no issue with hearing some grimy drum and bass track and know exactly how it is that they fit into that context so there's no real answer to that I mean it really comes down to the individual artists I mean there have been classical musicians who I've worked with that I've had to completely mute everything that I was working on and just play a classical stubble apart just so that they could understand what the context was that I was trying to bring them into and usually those are actually younger artists and the older artists tend to be a little bit more versatile and because they've been there and done that I mean we assume when we hear musicians that this is what they do so this is the bubble that they live in but they hear everything there they've seen everything and the older the artists means someone like soccer boy who's not only seen but he's lived through is he's breathed through so many different genres of music that his own audiences still have no idea how much this guy has lived through you know so when a guy like that comes into the studio you know I'm hard pressed to throw him a curveball where he's scratching his head so thanks everyone for your questions so we have a very nice surprise that car setting is going to give us a quick little demonstration of the table so for those of you guys who have not seen these drums this is called the table traditionally an in classical instrument but now used all over the world and all walks of music whether it be in Hollywood films or hip-hop music or pop music or get on all kinds of stuff and it's also an incredibly versatile instrument in that it's not only a rhythm instrument it's also a tonal instrument a melodic instrument and it's just it's a talking drum as well you can speak you can have conversations so the way that the repertoire that we learn is based on syllables so these are syllables that we turn into words then these words we turn into paragraphs and we create stories there's a particular rhythm called Kihara which is probably the one of the most popular rhythms all over the planet and you hear it in devotional music you hear it in Bhangra you hear it in Bollywood you hear it in reggae music you hear it in all kinds of different music and it's a very simple rhythm that anyone can can learn and then expand upon so so the syllables of Guerra are and then not in dinner then not in dinner that's the general that's the general composition of Guerra but there's many many different interpretations of that so I'll kind of take you through a little bit kind of like type in with the typewriter and keep like moving it back but thank you [Applause] you
