 (Music) Hi my name is Sean Hauze, I'm an Instructional Media Developer here at San Diego State University in our instructional technology services department. (Music) We at San Diego State University have been getting into the beginning stages of using what we call XR or or experience reality so we've been working with a handful of faculty including faculty from astronomy, nursing, art and design and computer science to both create and consume content as as part of their coursework. Students are actually immersed in those simulations and can engage with the simulation directly. So a lot of universities around the country are just starting to, to imagine how they might use XR in their curriculum, we're starting an initiative called V.I.T.A.L. that stands for Virtual Immersive Teaching and Learning here at San Diego State and starting this fall we're going to have six different faculty teaching in our V.I.T.A.L. space with the XR technologies.
