 live from New York City it's the cube covering cyber Kenneth 2017 brought to you by Centrify and the Institute for critical infrastructure technologies out of control they were testing it okay welcome back and well we are here live in New York City for cyber connects 2017 keeps coverage that's presented by Centrify an industry event bringing all the leaders of industry and government together around all the great opportunities to solve the crises of our generation at cybersecurity we have a cricket Lou chief DNS architect and senior fellow at Infoblox Creek a great to see you again welcome to the cube thank you nice to be back John so we're live here and really this is the first inaugural event of cyber connect bringing government and industry together we saw the retired general on stage talking about some of the history but also the fluid nature we saw Jim from Aetna talking about how unconventional tactics and how about domains and how he was handling email that's a DNS problem yeah yeah yeah you're the DNS guru Dinah's has become a big role in this what is what's going on here around DNS why is it important to cyber connect well you know I'll be talking tomorrow about the first anniversary a little bit later than the first anniversary of the big DDoS attack on Dyne the DNS hosting provider up in Manchester New Hampshire and trying to determine if we've actually learned anything have we improved our DNS infrastructure in any way and the in the ensuing year class are we doing anything from a standards a standpoint on on protecting DNS infrastructure those those sorts of things it's certainly the one of the highlighted examples was mobile mobile users are masked by the DNS on say email for instance Jim was pointing that out I got to ask you because you know we heard things like sink holing addresses hackers you create domain names in first 48 hours to launch attacks so there's all kinds of technical things that are that are being involved with say domain names for instance yeah yeah that's part of the critical infrastructure so the question is how indeed AUSA tax in answers taxes are are coming in in the fat tens of thousands yeah well that that issue that you talked about in particular the idea that the bad guys register brand new domain names domain names that initially of course have no negative reputation associated with them my my friend Paul vixie and his new company Farr site security been working on that they have what's called a passive DNS far site far site okay yeah and and so they have what's called a passive DNS database which is a database basically of DNS telemetry that is accumulated from big recursive DNS servers around the internet so they know when a brand new domain name pops up somewhere on the internet because somebody has to resolve it and they pump all of these brand new domain names into what's called a response policy zone feed and you can get for example different thresholds I want to see the brand new domain names created over the last 30 minutes or seen over the last 30 minutes and if you block resolution of those brand new domain names it turns out you block a tremendous amount of really malicious activity and then after say 30 minutes if it's a legitimate domain name it falls off the list and then you can resolve it so that's essentially doing DNS signaling as a service for new name registrations because the demand is for software API is to say hey I want to create some policy around some techniques to sync whole domain address axes that was yeah like that yeah basically this is this goes hand-in-hand with with this new system response policy zones which allows you to implement DNS policy something that we've really never before had done with DNS servers actually it's not quite true they've been proprietary solutions for it but but response policy zones are an open solution they give you the ability to say hey I do want to allow resolution of this domain name but not this other domain name and then you can say alright all of these brand new domain names for the first 30 minutes of their existence I don't want like a background check for domain names like a wait list right okay you don't get resolved for the first 30 minutes that gives the sort of traditional reputational analyzers span house answerable and people like that a chance to look you over and say it's malicious or it's not malicious so that started being run by Paul vixie who is you know the contributor to the DNS protocol that's really know right and so we should keep an eye on that keep checking out Paul vixie all right so DNS is critical infrastructure we've been talking about that you and I you know loves our riff about DNS and the role what's in an able they'll see its ASCII but I gotta ask you all this Unicode stuff about the emoji and open source really highlights the Unicode phenomenon yeah so there's a hacker potential Haven DNS and Unicode distinction it's it's a really it's it's really interesting from a DNS standpoint because we went to a lot of effort within the IETF the internet Engineering Task Force some years ago back when I was more involved in in the IETF some people spent a tremendous amount of effort coming up with a way to allow people to use Unicode within domain name so that you could type something into your browser that was in you know traditional or simplified Chinese or that was in Arabic or was in Hebrew or any number of other other scripts and you could type that in and it would be translated into something that we call puny code in the DNS community which is an ASCII equivalent to that the the issue with that though becomes that there are we would say glyphs we most people I guess would say characters but there are characters in Unicode that look just like say Latin alphabet characters so there's a lowercase a for example in Cyrillic it's not a lowercase a in the Latin alphabet it's a Cyrillic a but it looks just like an A and so it's possible for people to register names domain names that in their Unicode representation look like for example PayPal which of course has two ways in it and those two ways could be Cyrillic a yes not truly the ASCII representation of PayPal which would resolve through the DNA exactly so imagine how subtle an attack that would be if you if you were able to send out a bunch of email including links that said W stack your PayPal account click here yeah exactly and if you eyeballed it you'd think well sure that's WWE Balcom but you know that it's actually not so Jim Ruth talked about some applying uncondition unconventional methods because the the bad guys don't subscribe to the conventional method right I'll buy into it he said that they change up their standards is what I wrote down but it was maybe it's their sort of security footprint 1.5 times a day how does that apply to sort of your dns world is that even how do you even do that well we're beginning to do more and more with analytics DNS the passive DNS database that I talked about more and more big security players including Infoblox are collecting passive DNS data and you can run interesting analytics on that passive DNS data and you can in some cases automatically detect suspicious or malicious behavior for example you can say hey look the this named IP address mapping is changing really really rapidly and that might be an indication of a fast blocks or you can say these domain names have really high entropy the you know we did an Engram analysis of the labels of these in consequence of that we believe that that this resolution a resolution of these domain names is actually being used to tunnel data out of an organization or into an organization so so there's some things you can do with with these these analytical algorithms in order to suss out suspicious and malicious and you're doing that in as close to real time as possible that's right Mobley right that's right okay and so now everybody's talking about edge edge computing edge analytics how will the edge affect your ability to keep up well you know the the challenge I think with with doing analytics on passive DNS is that you have to be able to collect that data from a lot of places the more places that you have the more sensors that you have collecting passive dns data the better you need to be able to get it out from the edge from those local recursive DNS servers that are actually responding to the queries that come from say your smartphone or your laptop or what have you if you don't have that kind of data if you've only got say big ISPs then you may not detect a compromise of somebody's corporate network for example I was looking at some stats when I asked the IOT questions you're kind of teasing out kind of the edge of the network and this with mobile and wearables as the general is pointing out is gonna create more surface area but I just also saw a story I don't was from Google or whatever but X 80 percent plus roughly websites are gonna have SSL HTTPS and resolving through yeah and there's reports out here that a lot of the anti-virus provisions have been failing because of compromised certificates and to quote someone from research partner we get your reaction of this our results show this is from University of Maryland College Park our results show that compromised certificates pose a bigger threat than we previously believed and is not restricted to advanced threats and digitally signed malware was common in the wild well before Stuxnet yeah and so breaches have been caused by compromising certificates of actual authority yeah so this brings up the whole okay SSL was so pretty solving this hehe that's just one problem think if the certificates well before stuck no so Stuxnet really was kind of going on before Stuxnet now you got the edge of the network who has the DNS control for these devices well so is it kind of like failing is it crumbling how do we get that trust back well the that's that's a good question you know one of the one of the issues that we've had is that at various points CAS certificate certificate authorities have been conned into issuing certificates for websites that they shouldn't have for example hey generate a cert for me Chinese do exactly i'm the i'm i run www of america comm they give it to the wrong guy he installs it we have i think something like 1500 top-level certification authorities something crazy like that Dan Kaminsky had a number in one of his blog posts and it was absolutely ridiculous the number of different CAS that we trust that are built into most common browsers like like Chrome and Firefox and things like that we're actually trying to address some of those issues with DNS so there are two new resource records being introduced to DNS one is called TLS a TLS a TLS a yeah and the other one is called CAA which always makes me think of a California automotive but TLS a is basically a way of publishing data in your own zone that says my cert looks like this you can say this is my cert you can just completely go around the CA and you can say this is my cert and then you DNS X sign your zone and you're done or you can do something short of that and you can say my cert should look like this and it should have this CA right this is my CA don't trust any of those metadata about the sir yes sir itself exactly so that way if somebody manages to go get a cert for your website but that they get that cert from from some untrustworthy CA I don't know who that would be compromised right or a compromised CA nobody will trust it nobody who actually looks up the TLS a record because they'll go oh ok I can see the Infoblox asserts that their CA is Symantec and this is not a Symantec sign sir so I'm not gonna believe it and at the same time this this CA a record is designed to be consumed by the CAS themselves and it's a way of saying say info box can say hey we are a customer of Symantec or whomever comodo and then when the search but we when somebody goes to the cert and says hey I want to generate a certificate for wwf/e XCOM they'll look it up and they'll say there are a Symantec customer I'm not gonna do that for you yeah so so it creates trust now has this impact the edge of the network because the question really is everyone's underwear and mine is does the Internet of Things create more trust or to create more vulnerabilities or how does that Bala mean everyone knows it's a surface area but still there are technical solutions like when you're talking about yeah how does this play out in your mind how does Infoblox eat how do you see it what's Paul vixie working on there's that tie into it is this gonna because out in the hinterlands and the edge of the network in the wild is it like a DNS server on the device it could be a sensor how are they resolving so what is the protocol for these yeah well I mean at least this gives you a greater assurance if you're using TLS to incur communication between a client and a web server or some other resource out there on the Internet at least gets you better assurance that you really aren't being spoofed that you're going to the right place that your communications are secure so that's all really good IOT I think of a slightly orthogonal to that IOT is is is still a real challenge I mean there's so many IOT devices out there I look at IOT though and I'll talk about this tomorrow and actually I've got a live event on Thursday where I'll talk about it some more with my friend Matt Larsen but I got to be here in New York actually we're broadcasting out of Washington DC were you streaming that it is streamed in fact it's only streamed looking for the URL if you go to www.hsn what embarrassed and embarrassingly called cricket Lou live your celebrity it's also it's also Matt Larsen live but it's called 12 you guys know you're talking about great so there's a discussion among certain boards of directors it says look we're losing the battles lose yet war we got to shift more on response and least cover our butts and get you know some of our response mechanism in place what do you advise those boards what's the right balance between sort of you know defense perimeter core infrastructure and response well I mean I would certainly advocate as a DNS guy that people instrument their DNS infrastructure to the extent that they can to be able to detect evidence of of compromise and that's a relatively straightforward thing to do and most organizations haven't gone to the trouble to actually plumb their DNS infrastructure into for example their sim infrastructure so they can get query log information they can use our pcs to flag when client looks up the domain name of a known command control server which is a clear indication of compromise those sorts of things I think that's that's really important it's a pretty easy win I do think at this point we have to kind of resign ourselves to the idea that we have devices on our network that are infected that's that that game is is lost right there's there's no more you know crunchy outer shell security it just doesn't it doesn't really work so you have to have you have to have defense and depth as they say right you have to Elser has been around for such a long time I mean it's been one of those threats that just keeps coming it's like a waves and waves so it looks like there's some things happening that's cool so I gotta ask you cyber connect is the first real inaugural event that brings industry and some you know I'll see government and tech geeks together but it's not black hat or you know I eat EF or it's not not those geeky forums it's really a business community coming together mm-hmm what's your take of this event what's your observations what are you seeing here well I'm I'm really excited to actually get the opportunity to talk to people who are chiefly security people I think that's that's kind of a novelty for me because most of the time I think I speak to people who were chiefly networking people and in particular that little niche of networking people who were interested in DMS although truth be told maybe they're not even really interested in TNS maybe they just put up with me well it means a really strong DNS community has always been organically grown yeah reliable but I love I love the idea of talking about DNS security to a security audience and hopefully some of the folks that we get to talk to you here will come away from it thinking oh wow so I didn't even realize that my DNS infrastructure could actually be a security tool for me it could actually be helpful in any way in detecting compromised what about just final questions only at a time to check here but operational impact to some of these DNS changes that are coming down from Paul vixie you and Matt Larsen doing some things together what's the impact of the customer and they say okay DNS will play a role in how I roll out my architecture obviously uncondition cyber IOT is right around the corner what's the impact to them your mind operationally well there certainly is some operational impact for example if you want to subscribe to our pz feeds you've got a become a customer of somebody who provides a commercial RPC feed or somebody who provides a free rpz feed you have to plumb that into your DNS infrastructure you have to make sure that it continues transferring you have to plumb that into your sim so that when something you get a hit against an RPC you're notified about it your security folks I think one of the all of that stuff is sort of routine day-to-day stuff nothing out of the ordinary a de Colombia changes if you were right but I think one of the big challenges is that in so many of the organizations that I go to visit the security organization and the networking organization are in different silos and they don't necessarily communicate a lot so maybe the more difficult operational challenge is just making sure that you have that communication and that that the security guys know the DNS guys the networking guys and vice versa and they cooperate to work on problem this seems to be the big collaboration theme that's happening here that it's more of a community model kind of coming together yeah for a security cricket Lou here DNS chief architect with DNS architect and senior fellow of Infoblox I've see a legend in the DNS community among with Paul vixie amongst peers really that community holding down the fort I'll see a lot of exploits out there to watch out for thanks for your comment are here at the cyber Connect 2017 inaugural event that's the cube we right back with more after this short break
