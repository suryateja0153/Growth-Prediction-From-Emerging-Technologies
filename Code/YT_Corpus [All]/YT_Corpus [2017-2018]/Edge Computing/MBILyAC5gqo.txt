 why don't I spend just a couple minutes talking about what we mean by digital enactment turning data into models and models into action and then we'll jump directly into I'll introduce the panelists after that and we'll jump directly into the questions so wiki bond silicon angle has been on a mission for quite some time now to really understand what's what is the nature of digital transformation or digital disruption and historically when we've talked about digital people talk about a variety of different characteristics of it so the thought we'll talk about new types of channels and activity on the web and any number of other things but to really make sense of this we kind of felt we had to go to a set of basic principles and utilize those basic principles to build our observation zone so what we started with is a simple observation that if it's not digital if it's not data in ink digital by that we mean fundamentally the idea of digital businesses how are we going to use data as an asset to differentially drive our business forward and if we borrowed from Drucker Drucker used to like to talk about the idea that business exists to create sustained customers and so we would say that digital business is about applying data assets to differentially create sustained customers now to do that successfully we have to be able to as businesses be able to establish a set of strategic business capabilities that will allow us to differentially use data assets and we think that there are a couple of core strategic business capabilities required one is human beings and most businesses operate in the analog world so it's how do we take that analog data and turn it in the digital data that we can then process so that's the first one that notion of a IOT as a transducer of information so that we can generate these very rich data streams secondly we have to be able to do something with those data streams that's the basis of Big Data so we utilize big data to create models to create site and increasingly through a more declarative style actually create new types of software systems that will be crucial to driving the business forward that's a second capability the third capability is one that we're still coming to understand and that is we have to take the output of those models the output of those insights and then turn them back into some event that has a consequential moment in the real world or what we call systems of an action and so the three core business capabilities that have to be built are this captured data through IOT big data to process at systems of an action also through IOT through actuators to actually then have a consequential action in the real world so that's the basis of what we're talking about we're going to take a Fabio's vision that he just laid out and then we're in this panel going to talk about some of the business capabilities necessary to make that happen and then after this David foyer will lead a panel on specifically some of the lower-level technologies are going to make it work make sense guys okay so let me introduce the panelists over down there on the end Ted Connell Ted is from Intel I don't know if we can get the slide up that has their names and their titles Ted why don't you very quickly introduce yourself yeah thank you very much I run solution architecture for the manufacturing and industrial vertical where we put together and and echo system solutions that solve our clients business problems so we're not selling silicon or semiconductors we're solving our clients problems which as audience said requires ecosystem solutions of software systems integrators and other partners to come together to put together at end solutions excellent next to Ted is Steve Madden of Equinix oh yeah Steve Madden Equinix is the largest interconnection global interconnection company and a lot of the ecosystems that you know you'll be hearing about come together inside our location and one of the things I do in there is work with our big customers on industry vertical level solutions by achieving one of them to warn from jail torn hymen Phuong I'm co-founder and tick strategy of a coming called data point and a date or our mission is really to build out solutions to allow enterprises to process big data in a streaming fashion so that whole theme around ingestion transformation and the limits and taking action in sub-second on massive data is what we're focusing on and you're familiar with Fabio folio take a second to yes thank you I am leading a company that is trying to manifest the region I highlighted here building a platform and not so much the applications we are hosting the applications intelligence the data management and so forth and trying to apply to the the industry verticals first big enough to keep us busy for quite a while so in case you didn't notice we have an interesting penalty of use case application technology and platform so what we'll try to do is over the next say 10 minutes or so we're going to spend a little bit of time again talking about some of these business capabilities so let me start off by asking each of you a question and I will take if anybody has really burning to have to ask a question about raise your hand I'll do my best to see yet and I'll share the microphone for just long enough you'd ask okay so first question digital business is data that means we have to think about data differently a tenth and Intel what is Intel doing when they think about data as NASA so Intel has been working on what is now being called fog and big data analytics for over a generation the modern Xeon server were settling the wire in the electronics if you will is 10 silicon atoms wide so to control that process we've had to do what it's called industry 4.0 20 years ago so all of our production equipment has been connected for 20 years we're running one of our factories will produce a petabyte of data a day and we're running big data analytics including machine learning on the stuff currently if you look at an Intel three we have 2,000 thick clients on the factory floor supported by 600 servers in our data center at the factory just to control the process and run predictive yield analytics so that's your itch our our competitive advantage at Intel is the factory we are a manufacturer we're a world-class manufacturer our front-end factories have zero people in it not that we don't like people we had to fully automate the factory because as I speak tens of thousands of water molecules are leaving my mouth and if one of those water molecules lands on the silicon it ain't going to work so we had to get people physically out of the factory and so we were forced by Moore's law and the product we build to build out you know what became fog when they came up with the term seven years ago we just came to that conclusion because of cost latency and security it made sense to you know look you got data you got compute there's a network between it doesn't matter where you do the compute bring the compute to the data or the data that compute you're doing a compute function it doesn't matter where you do it so fog is not complicated it's just a distributed data center so think about some of the technologies necessary to make this work it's not just batch we're going to be doing a lot of stuff in real time continuously so who talked a little bit about the system software the infrastructure software it has to be put in place to ensure that this works well I mean that's great a little bit about my background the company was founded by a bunch of Ixia who's that have been at Yahoo for you know 12 15 years from the early days and so we sort of grew up in that period where we had to learn about Big Data learn about making all the mistakes of big data and really seeing that nowadays it's not good enough to get inside you have to get inside in a timely fashion enough to actually do something about it and for a lot of enterprise especially with human beings care where our mobile phones and moving around all over the place and sensors sending thousands if not millions of events per second the need for the business to understand what's going on and and react and have insight and react sub-second is crucial and and what that means is that that used to be batch offline you know has a video content can kind of go down now has to be continuous 24 by 7 you can't lose data you got to be able recover and come back to where you were as if nothing has happened with no human intervention there's a lot of theme around no human intervention because this stuff is so fast you can't involve you in the internet then you're not reacting fast enough because I real quickly add one thing we think of data Intel in half-life terms now the data has valuable right now I stuff you wait a second literally a second the data has a little bit of value you wait two seconds it's historical data you can run regression and tell you why you screwed up we ain't gonna fix anything if you want to do anything with your data you got to do it now so again ultimately we need to develop experience to create experience about what we're doing and the stuff that we're doing in applications will eventually find itself in two platforms so Flavio talked to us a little bit about the types of things that are going to end up in the platform to ensure that these use cases are made available to of certainly businesses that perhaps aren't sophisticated Intel yes so in many ways we are learning from what what is going on in the cloud and has to come through this continuum all the way into the machine this is a break between what's going on inside the machine and old 1980 microprocessor and server and a cloud server with virtualization on the other side cannot live so it has to be a continuum of computing so you can move the same function the same container all the way through at first second you really have to take the real time very very seriously particularly at the edge but even in the back so that when you have this end-to-end continuum you can decide where you do what and I think that one of the models that was in that picture with a concentric circle is really telling what we need to learn first bring the data back and learn and that can take time but then you can have models that are lightweight that can be brought down to the front and impact the reaction to the data there and we heard from a car company big car company how powerful this was when they learned that the angle of a screwdriver and a few other parameters can determine the success of screwing something into a body of a car that could go well or could go very very bad and be very costly so all the learning massive data can come down to a simple model it can save a lot of money and improve efficiency so but that has to be hosted along this continue so from the continuum of these we still have to have machines somewhere to do so yes so touching that touching the ground touching the physical world requires machines absolutely absolutely so Steve what is Equinix doing to simplify with thinking through on some of these infrastructure issues yeah I mean the biggest thing that that people find when they start looking at millions of devices millions of data capture points transferring all this data real-time and streaming it is one thing hasn't changed it's physics all right so where those things are where they need to go where the data needs to move to and how fast starts with happening to figure out your your own topology how are you moving that data as much as it's easy to say we're just going to buy a platform and choose a device I'm appliqué them together there's still a lot of other things need to be solved physics being the first one the second one primarily is volumes so how much bandwidth since report you're going to require how much of that data you're going to backhaul to your centralized data centers before you send it up to a cloud how much of it you can leave at the edge where do you place that becomes a bigger deal and the third one is pretty much every industries has to deal with regulations regulations control what you can and can't do in terms of IC delivery where you can place stuff where you cannot place tough data that can leave a country go to the cart so all these things mean that you need to have a thought through process of where you're placing certain functions and what you're defining as your edge between the digital and physical world and Equinix is an interconnection company that's sitting there as a neutral party across all the networks or the all the enterprises of all the providers to help people figure that out so before I ask the audience a question now I'm down here so I can see you so be prepared last question when you think about the strategic business capabilities necessary to succeed what is the first thing that the business has to do so one it just takes Ted just go out right on down one yeah so I think this is really really important I work with many many clients around the world who are doing five ten fifteen pocs pilots and the Internet of Things and they haven't thought through a codified strategy so they're doing five things that will never fit together that you will never scale and the learnings you're using you really can't do that much with so coming up with what is my architecture what is my stack going to look like how am I going to push data what is my data you know because when you connect to these things I can't tell you how much data you're going to get you're going to be overwhelmed by the data and that's why we all go to the edge and I got a process that data real-time you know by the way if I only have one source of data like I'm connecting to production equipment you're not going to learn anything you've got to contextualize the data with either an inspection step or some kind of contextualization that tells you if this then that you need that then that without that your data is basically worthless so now you're pooling multiple sources of data together in real time to make an understanding and so understanding what that architecture looks like spend the time upfront well most of us are engineers you know 5% additional work upfront saves you 95% on the backend that's true here so think through the architecture you know talk to some of us who have been working in this area for a long time and will share our architecture we have reference architecture that we're working with companies how do you go from industry 2.0 or industry 3.0 to industry for tile and there is a logical path to do it but ultimately where we're going to end up is a software-defined universe I mean what's a cloud - software-defined data center now we're doing software-defined networks software-defined storage is ultimately we're going to be doing software-defined systems because it's cheaper but you get better capital utilization that our asset utilization so we will go there so what does that mean for your infrastructure and what are you going to do from an architectural perspective then take all of your POCs and pilots and force them to do that specifically around security people are doing POCs with security that they don't even have any protocols they're violating all this you know their industry standards doing pocs and that's going to get thrown out it's wasted time wasted effort don't do it Steve Thomas ensign yeah essentially it's not going to be any any prizes for me saying think into connections first a lot of our customers if we look at what they've done with us everyone from GAE to you know real-time facial recognition at the edge it all comes down to how are you wired topology wise first you can't use the Internet you know for risk reasons you can't necessarily pay for multiple MPLS bandwidth costs etc so late low latency 80% lower latency seven times the bandwidth said half the cost is a scalable infrastructure to move data around the planet if you don't have that the rest of the stuff starts to break down whoo well you know I would say that analytics is hard and as it is in real-time is even harder and and I think the you know with us talking to our customers I feel for them they're they're confused there's like a million solutions out there everybody's trying to claim to do the same thing I think it's both sides consumers have to get more educated together be more intelligent about their pocs but as an industry we also have to you know get better at thinking about how do we help our customers succeed you know it's it's not about old you know let me give you some open source and then let me spend in the next ten months charge you professional services to help you you know we ought to think about software tools and enterprise tools to really help the customer be able to think about their total cost of ownership and time to value to handle this thing because it's not easy for you yeah we're facing an interesting situation where the customers are ready the needs are there the market is going to be huge but the plot the solution is not trivial and is maturing and and we are all trying to understand how to do it and this is the confusion that you see in many of these half-baked solutions that secure and an elite everything is coming together and you have to go up to stock and down the stock with full confidence not easy so we all have to really work together give ourselves time be feeling that we are in a complete competitive world preparing for addressing together a huge market and try to mature these solutions that then will be replicated more and more but we have to be patient with each other and with the technologies that are maturing and they are not fully there and understood so but the market is amazing so we have a Twitter question so it's being live-streamed but audience is really engaged online as well Digital so we have a question from Twitter from Lauren Cooney saying would like to know what industries will be most impacted with digitization of the next five years which one won't be yeah all of them we've seen you know the business bottles the data I mean we're you know our our CEOs calling data the new gold I mean it's the oil so I don't know of anything unless you're doing something that is just physical therapy but that even data you could do data on that so everything yeah I don't know of anything that wealthy I think I think the real question is how is it going - how is it going to move through industries yeah obviously it's going to start with some of the digital native it's already deep in that deep in the media we're moving through the media right now Intel's clearly a digital company and you've been working even on this path for quite some time let me give you a stat Intel is 105 thousand people and 144 thousand servers so we're about 1.5 server - people that's what kind of computation how you're working but why did you write the networking started by scaling at the internet then content delivery and media but you know hard media etcetera is gone financial services and trading exchange is pretty much so what digital markets are going to be in the future clouds showed up and now I think he's right it's affecting every industry manufacturing industrial health and professional services of the top three right now but people who shop to to ask for help from everyone three on every and every country for that matter our customers are you know the top players in almost every verticals and then you know we thought out as a small company thinking that you're going to attack one vertical but as you start to talk about the capability everybody wings take the weight you're solving my problem leaders are following yeah what what business would say hey I don't want to know what's going on with my business and I want to take any action that might add to that that it's an ecosystem of ecosystems right no one by themselves is going to solve anything they have to partner and connect with other people to solve the solution so I'll close the panel by making these kind of summary comments the business capabilities that we think are going to be most important or first off when we talk about the Internet of Things we like to talk about the Internet of Things in people that the people equation doesn't go away so we're building on mobile we're building on other things but if there's a strategic capability that's going to be required it's going to be how is this going to impact folks who actually create value in the business the second one I'll turn around is that IT organizations have gone through a number of different range Wars if you will over the past 20 years I lived through IT versus telecom for example the IPO T of conflict or potential conflict is non-trivial there's going to be some serious work that has to be done so I would add to the conversation that we've heard thus far the interest we've heard thus far is the degree to which people are going to be essential to making this work and how we diffuse this knowledge into our employees and into our IT and professional community is going to be crucial especially with developers because flavio if we are right now trying to figure stuff out it really matures when we think about the developer world okay so I want to close the first panel and get ready for the second panel so thank you very much and thank you very much to our panelists and if we could bring David foyer and the second panel up we'll get going on panel - oh we're going to get together for a picture
