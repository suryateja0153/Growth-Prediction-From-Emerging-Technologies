 [Music] probably one is described as a pinnacle of motorsport relais on most compliments around the world we have the best drivers it's incredibly competitive formal won by default is constant innovation but the mana racing we have to be either more innovative we have to find competitive advantage in everything we do the aim is always to go faster it's very very important to have great computer and great link to the car for the engineer we have computers on the car logging the data for us and then we have lots of data analysis happening back in the pits and back in the factory here risk LRO cloud computing provider and they provide us with a computing resource that we can send our simulations to and we can get a massive gain in simulation capability so it's absolutely fantastic before we had race though an engineer would manually low the setup into the computer now we can put tens of thousands in and it comes back 20 minutes later at this point are now doing about four million simulations per weekend where traditionally you will have to buy a big datacenter to be able to cope with that situation our developers got to grips with it within a couple of days working with them they're very good at support they'll dedicate the resources to help you make sure that you get up and running but once you're up and running you don't really need I'm holding anymore rescale have lots of data centers spread all around the world which are basically centres full of computers and the advantage of being in different data centers around the world is we can make them run more locally so we're not susceptible to the internet link being slow in different parts in the world and it's very fast our data is massively sensitive and with rescale we have that assurance that our data is safe and very secure it's saved is scalable it's flexible allows us to do things we couldn't do before because of the scale of it and it's very easy to write software the first offer on the platform you're a very much cloud enabled company I can use all my resources for making the car faster and not for maintaining an infrastructure it's very cost effective because I pay as I consume so in the old way I had to buy Hardware now I just buy a service that makes everything possible restyle been a great partner there are smart people they are on the cutting edge of ideas and technology and we are always learning from [Music] you [Music]
