 Today, you can book a flight reserve a hotel, find the hot new restaurant nearby and pay for your car service all with your phone. No big deal, right? We expect to have all these things connect. It's how we live. But what about how we work? Changing the way your company operates to deliver connected digital experiences to your customers, partners, and to your employees can be very hard. Making it happen in today's enterprise landscape that includes on-premises private and public clouds, SaaS, and all kinds of hybrid environments is complicated. Making it happen fast enough to compete can be downright impossible unless you're built to operate in a multi-cloud world. But what does it mean to be a digital business in a multi-cloud world? It means all the value you've already built down here can talk to the new projects you're building for today even as today's projects are innovating much faster so fast that old technology can't keep pace. The only fast, affordable, and scalable path to digital is with APIs. APIs make it possible for developers to connect the experiences and apps we use every day and unlock the value of your data and assets for your customers, partners, and employees all this across any cloud. But how you securely deliver, manage, and analyze APIs' data and services both inside and outside an organization is the real advantage. When your app launches, are you ready for the storm?
