 live from Las Vegas it's the cube covering VMworld 2017 brought to you by VMware and its ecosystem partners hello and welcome back to live coverage this is the cube at vmworld 2017 our eighth year covering vmworld going back to 2010 I'm John Ferrier Coast the cube and mykos this segment Justin Warren industry analysts and our guest Alan Cohen chief commercial officer CEO for loomio great to CEO cube alumni special guest appearance guest analyst appearance but also chief commercial officer to lumineuse security startup growing thanks becoming a mostarda penny more it's technically yeah after five use it's not a start-up yeah start right you raised two hundred and seventy million dollars not exactly a startup yeah that's true well welcome back thank you so welcome back from vacation Justin and I were talking before you came on look at let's go to get you on and get some commentary going okay you're an industry vet okay I'm getting security some perspective but industry perspective you've seen this VMware cycle many times yeah what's your analysis right now obviously stocks 107 they don't do a cloud no big cap back so gains that good right made a decision what's just what's your take on this well you know it's you know if you I've been coming to the M world for a long time as you guys have as well and from my perspective this was probably the biggest or most significant transition in the history of the company so if you think about the level of dialogue obviously there's a lot about NSX which came from the Serra I'm always happy about but if you hear about talking about cloud and kind of talking about a post infrastructure world right about capabilities about control about security about being able to manage your compute in multiple environments this is I think the beginning of a fundamentally different error right so if I always think about VMware this is the company that defined virtualization right no one will argue with that point so when they come out and they start talking you know how your computes going to operate in multiple environments and how you're going to put that together this is not cloud washing right this is a fairly all right they have fully acknowledged that the cloud is not a fad the clouds not four-thirds here workloads like this is mainstream computing so I think this is the third wave of computing and VMware started to put its markers down for the type of role it intends to play in this transition yeah I agree I think that the we have to argue if you're gonna agree Oh mostly agree with you how about I that's good yeah I agree this is it this show VMware stopped apologizing for existing I think previously they've been trying to say no no we're a cloud to where act in fact we're better than cloud and you shouldn't be using it and if force customers to choose between two of their children really like which one do you love more and customers don't like that or is it this show I think it's finally VMware's recognized that customers want to be able to use cloud as well as use VMware so that they're taking a more partnership approach to that and it's more about the ecosystem and agree they're they're not about the infrastructure so much they're not about the hypervisor they're about what you run on top of that but I still think there's a lot of infrastructure in that because VMware is fundamentally an infrastructure you gotta get paid right yeah that's right and there's a lot of stuff out there there's already on a VMware so what do you think about the the approach like with cloud they have a lot of people doing things in new ways and you mentioned this is a third wave of computing that we're doing it a new way a lot of VMware stuff is is really the whole reason it was popular is that we had people doing things in a particular way on physical hardware and then they kept doing more or less the same thing only on virtual hardware what do you see about people who are still essentially going to be doing virtual hardware they're just running it on cloud now that's not really changing well I mean so the way I think about it is are you gonna be the Chevy Volt are you going to be a Tesla and and what I mean by that and by the way now GM has the bolt which is their move towards Hessler which is that if you think if you look at the auto industry they talk about hybrid and you talk about it and you talk veal I'm us he goes hybrids are right right other your your burning gas or your or your using you know electricity and to me this cloud movement is about electricity which is I'm going to use cloud native control I'm going to use cloud native services I'm gonna be using Python and Ruby and I'm gonna have scripting and I'm going to act like DevOps and so the cloud is not just a physical place where I rent cycles from Amazon or AZ or it it is a way of computing that's kind of distributed dynamic heterogeneous and hybrid so when you're in your virtualization on top of cloud you're still in your Chevy Volt moment yeah but when you say I'm gonna actually be native across all of these environments then you're really moving a bunch and smoke a little bit I'll pass it over to you because that's complete fantasy I mean right now the reality is is that it's legal here in the LA I don't think so yeah smokin is good stuff no I agree cloud obviously from you know as a future scenario there's no debate but the reality is like the Volt Tesla's one-trick pony so you know Greenfield uh well no but once again I'm not disagreeing with you Trump but my point is that VMware and most of the IT industry is not there and those companies don't have DevOps people you run up and down you go to all of these shows ask him these guys how many guys do Ruby Python reel scripting they don't do that right they're still they still have well I asked wise and management consoles and they have the old IT but this is legacy bag I mean we call legacy baggage and them in the business I don't know with that heritage system yeah well calcium is here I Alton remember one o'clock and I I kind of like sometimes VMware they make the technical technical mistake in PR they don't really kind of get sometimes where to position things but the Google announcement was very strategic intent right but they kind of made it a land grab and they try to overplayed their hand in my opinion on that one thing it's a strategic intent this audience you know they're not DevOps ready their ops trying to do dev yeah they're so they're not be fully ready yeah so it's okay to say here's Amazon great that's today if you want to do that's getting going checking the boxes we're hitting the milestones and then to dump a Headroom deal announcement that's more Headroom yeah oh but not but I've been hit many here on the here's the opportunity and here's the risk right if Amazon is a 16 billion dollar a year business it's a rounding error in IT spending yeah right when you take the hype away I'm nothing against it and I love that prices are cheaper in Amazon and you could buy a dot in the fruit aisle like that a totally margins are like 60% yeah my wife a rib steak and it said $18 now $13.99 I said fantastic thank you Jeff Beezus we're eating well and we're gonna have a little extra money but what I think that this transition is not about infrastructure it's about how IT people do their job right that's it that's a great boy yeah yeah okay in this show today doing your job Justin you I want you to come on this because we you were talking let's do about it yeah I'm a VMware customer what do I care about right now in my world a muscle today well in my world I've got conflicting things I need to get my job done now it's it's not there's nothing different about the IT job really which is a shame because some of it needs to change a bit but there is a gradual realization that it's not about IT it's not about building infrastructure for the sake of because I like showing the infrastructure it's I'm being paid by by a business to do IT things in service of the business I have customers who are buying apples or you know using your laundry your your nightie you're paid for an outcome yeah you don't create the outcome right this is why the way IT works is business creates the outcome IT helps fulfill the outcome yeah right unless you work at AG a department today or is it a department it's still a department it is it put its it's a department in the same way that well finance is important but it's not actually the business you know sales is part of its they're all integrated like in a really well run do you know what a real business is you go to a building you go to the main offices you visit the marketing floor you visit the IT floor tell me what the day core is like they'll tell you what they care about in a business right I've been in a lot of IT shops not the beautiful shiny glass windows and because it's perceived as a back office cost Center cost center yes but the thing that look the thing that the transformation is always about taking costs out that's table stakes but now some of the tech vendors need understand that as you to get more business-focused you got to start thinking about driving top-line but your Olson you have exactly badging in the product right so for example my company we have three the four top SAS vendors as a loomio clusters we do the micro segmentation for them we're not their micro segmentation we're a component in the software they sell you guys yeah and your input yeah yeah you you are a commodity in the mix of what somebody's building and I think that's gonna be one of the changes so the move to cloud it's not rent or buy it's not you know per hour per server or call Michael Dell and send me a bunch of q-series or whatever the heck it's called it's it's it's increasingly saying we have these outcomes we have these dates we have these deliverables one of my doing support that and be part of that and and that's it it's support function it's a very important support function but there's very few businesses like digital transformation I don't like that it does that mean it doesn't mean it means something to do with fingers you use a lot what does it really mean digital trail first of all I'm not a big hype person I like the buzzword in the sense that it does have a relevance now in terms of doing business digitally means you're completely 100% technology enabled in your business that means IT is a power function not a cost center it's completely native light electricity in the company yes so look here's the of micro so let's say I have two customers I have the yellow cab company of Las Vegas and I have uber or lyft as a customer my role as a technologists where technology provider is dramatically different what either one of the transformation social transformation to me is is a mindset of things like I'm gonna do blockchain I'm gonna start changing the game I'm gonna use technology to change the value equation for my customer yeah it's not an IT conversation in the sense of let's buy more servers to make something happen for the guy who had had a request in that saying let's use technology digitally yeah to change the outcomes so given that if we assume that that's true then what there's two ways of doing that either we have the IT people need to learn more about business or the business people need to learn more about is right so which one do you think should happen because traditionally I think they're on a collision course assume that you can survive as a senior executive in most businesses anymore by saying I'll get my CIO in here I would like to believe that that's true but you know when people say that it you know it should be a strategic resource and so on and yet we spend a decades outsourcing IT to someone else so if it's really truly important it's a great question I here's my observations just thinking out loud here one just from a Silicon Valley perspective looking at entrepreneurial as a kind of a canary in the coalmine you've seen over the past 10 15 years recently a past ten entrepreneurs have become developer entrepreneurs product entrepreneurs I've become very savvy on the business side that's the programmer when we've seen Travis with uber okay no VC it got smart because they can educate themselves angel let's venture hacks there's a lot of data out there so I see some signs of developer specifically building apps because user design is really important there are leaning into the what I call the street MBA they're not actually getting an MBA they don't read The Wall Street Journal there but they're learning about some business concepts that they have to understand to program yeah that's iti think it's still like getting there but not as much as the developers right here's a great question that I've learned over the years when I as and look I'm coming out of the IT side as we all are when I visit a customer and I tried to sell them my product I my first question is if I didn't exist what would you do yeah and if you don't buy my product what happens in your business and if they're saying well I have this other alternative or it's like out we'll do it next year I mean maybe I can sell them some product but it's do what they're really telling me is like I don't matter all right let's change the conversation a little bit just move to another direction one get your thoughts and I should on the Astro govern you more props Allen you were also involved in nasarah startup that VMware had you know this NSX I was finished the intro we've interviewed March incus honest to tussles all the time straight just been hearing on the other side every day Martine Quezada it's great interviews of course they're on the cube directory but you were there when when it was just developing and then boom Software Defined Networking was gonna save the world but NSX has become very important to VMware what's your thoughts on that what is the alumni from nasira and the folks that are still here and outside of VMware think about what is turned into is it relevant and where is it going well I mean look I mean I think what look its I look I could have not predicted five years ago when the Serie was acquired by VMware it would be the heart of everything their CEO and their team is talking about if you want to know if that's important go to the go to the directory of sessions and one out of every three are about NSX but I think what they're what it really means is there's a recognition that the network component which is what really nsx represents is the part that's going to allow them to transcend the traditional you know software-defined data center so I have two connections so Steve Harrods my investor right Steve is the inventor of the software-defined data center right that was the old kool-aid not the new kool-aid and we've left the software-defined data center right we've moved into this cloud area and you know for them NSX is their driving force on be able to extend the VMware control plane into environments they used to never play in before that's that's eminently clear what's your take on nsx is the compatibility mechanism for being able to do vmware in multiple places so I think it's very very important for vmware as a company i don't think it's the only solution to that particular problem of being able to have networks that move around it's possible to do it in other ways I know for example cloud native type things will do the networking thing in a different way but the network hasn't really undergone the same kind of change that happened in in server or indeed in storage it it's been pretty much the same for a long long time I mean you've had an industry structurally dominated by one company yeah you know and things don't change you have a security because we got time I want to get security you guys are in the security space thanks Jared yeah do you still don't know you didn't have only kidding Steve Harwich your investors a former CTO PM we're very relevant the folks watching guys security Pat Kessler said years ago it should be a duo we got to fix this now that's really happened what is the state of the union if you will of security where the Frick is it going I mean what the hell's going on in security well this two issues was said so if we put our industry analysts hat on security is the largest segment of IT where nobody owns five percent market share yeah so there's no guerrilla force that can drive that right VMware was the guerrilla force driving virtualization cisco drove networking emc in the early days drove storage but when you get the security you have this kind of dilute it's like the balkans right you know it's like feudal states it's too costly not man but what but what I think what Pat was talking about which we also subscribe to there are some movements insecurity which micro segmentation is one of them which are kind of reinstalling a form of forensic hygiene into a you know saying there are practices if they occur they will do reduce the risk profile but I think 50% of security solutions and categorize my teeth I don't get cavities that kind of thing going on well you don't like it so good it's good para doctor and you're making rounds in the hospital you wash your hands or you put on gloves and that's where we are yeah that it's the stage we are at with security is we're at the stage where surgeons didn't believe they should wash their hands because they knew better and that they say no this couldn't possibly be making patients sick people have finally realized that people get sick and you know that the germ theory is real and we should wash our hands your network makes you sick yeah your network is the carrier of do those but everything that's happening in network is effectively the typhoid mary of security right we're building flat fast unsegmented layer three networks right which allow virus is the move at the speed of light across your environment so movements like active was they called adapt defense app defense app defense or micro segmentation formal loomio and vmware are the kind of new hygiene and new practices that are going to reduce the widespread i mean from a from an evolution theory then the genetics of networks are effed up if this is what you're saying we need to fix some of those networks in getting back to what they were supposed to do networks move packets from point a 20 yes the dumb number the better okay dumb dumb them down dumb network smart endpoints well smart their works doesn't scale as well as smart endpoints and we're seeing that with edge computing for example this Jeff the network at that like distributed networking is a hard problem and there is so much compute going out there I mean every everything has a computer in it they're just getting tinier and tinier if we if we rely on the network to secure all of that we're doing better off in the endpoint grave and this fuels the whole IOT edge thing ioc raid on the th key wave slide we're going to have as a lot of telemetry points and you're going to have a lot of enforcement points our architecture is compatible with this vmware is moving in this direction other people are but the people that are clinging to the gum up my network with all kinds of crap and because because actually people wanted to go the other way I mean if you think about it the internet was built move packets from point A to point B in case of a nuclear war right and there wasn't a whole lot of other than routing there wasn't a whole lot might have that problem yeah guys we got a break ok segment Allen quick I'll give you the last word just give a quick plug to loom yo thanks for coming on at being ok guest analyst as usual great stuff go slow from vacation I usually listen at come on mark back in Italy fruit lntelligent Montalcino yeah for Lumia do quick plug so we're really great to be here so I mean John you and I talked recently I'm roomie loomio is growing very rapidly clearly we are probably emerging as one of the leaders in this Mont in this micro segmentation movement on a big gorilla what's that you're a wannabe gorilla go big or go home we are well you know gorillas have to start as little gorillas first I don't wanna be growler just a gorilla is growing really rapidly it takes a lot more you know it takes a lot more food at the zoo to keep us going about 200 people growing rapidly just moved into Asia pack we got a guy and you're part of the results not a zoo it's still a jungle the zoo is not yet established that's true well we're gonna establish the zoo so things are things are greater loomio we have amazing things on the floor here today of basically the system will actually write its own security policy for you it's a lot of movement into machine learning a lot of good stuff alright guys thanks so much Alan Cohen for the chief commercial officer just award analyst I'm John for a year more live coverage from VMworld after this short break [Music]
