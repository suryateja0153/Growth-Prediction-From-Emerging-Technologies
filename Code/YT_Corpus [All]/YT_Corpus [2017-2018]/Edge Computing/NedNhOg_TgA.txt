 in this episode of cloud performance atlas I helped some tax experts gain performance independence if their friends performance jumped off a cliff would they do too stay tuned to find out tax lemming is a start-up focused on making sense of purchases taxes and basic bookkeeping for your small business needs but they had a problem that was keeping them from going for their next round of VC funding they've got too many instances spinning up and it was breaking the bank see in a rush to put together a working prototype the tax lemmings client hit a Google load balancer which fetched content from a GC instance running Apache now to improve performance their lead engineer wanted to move to a very traditional solution for web-based applications adding a layer of nginx instances to acts as a reverse caching proxy to the Apache servers and then change the client to fetch static content directly from a CDN instead of the back-end instances now this is a very tried and true solution but before they started tearing things up I wanted to present them with an alternative way to get the same caching performance but with less instances and lower costs using GCPs load balancers see one secret that GCP load balancers have is that with the click of a button button the load balancer will cache requests and move them to a google cloud CDN to reduce latency on your behalf as long as the request is cached it will be served directly at Google's Network edge rather than going to the backend performance-wise this is a huge boost we can easily see the difference when comparing direct access to the resource through the instance versus allowing the load balancer to cache the request this graph shows that once the asset gets cached the response time drops significantly and all you had to do was check a box what's even better about this is that the cached content is served right from Google CDN without any need for caching instances to exist to use a new buzzword you could call this service I'm cool now another nifty feature that the load balancers allow you to do is create hosts routing paths for your domain which will serve content directly from a Google cloud storage bucket this way you don't have to modify the client to fetch new types of content from a different CDN location instead you can just treat the assets as though they were sub-directories and the load balancers will do the right thing and of course to improve performance further you can even cache those assets to the CDN as well so with a few button clicks tax lemmings was able to cut down their instance count and reduce their maintenance headaches long term if you'd like more details on this problem check out the full article linked in the description below and make sure to subscribe to our google cloud YouTube channel to get alerts when new performance videos comes out and don't forget when it comes to performance every millisecond counts
