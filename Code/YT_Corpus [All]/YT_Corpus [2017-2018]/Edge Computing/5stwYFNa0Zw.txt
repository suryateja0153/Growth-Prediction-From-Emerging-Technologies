 give Elena for inviting me today I really hope that that was not a negative Wow was a positive wall but we'll see discussion today we are trying to coordinate here a little bit so I got a semi connected to view and thank you to the technical team there that worked so hard to get it work Ellen I wanted me to discuss the day standards for clouds learning from our previous conversation and she mentioned that nest has been working very very actively since 2010 in the field and the US government is considered one of the pioneers in in cloud computing I don't know how many of you know that cloud computing concept was actually first time introduced by dr. kelapa from Emory University he defined had a vision he's a visionary IT visionary and he had a vision that cloud is an important new computing paradigm war boundaries stop existing that they will be determined by economic rationale rather than technical limits how true that is looking that has happened in 97 when probably many of us were still staying with oh thank you sweetie yeah then yo boss were staying who had the old technology the classical IT systems in since 1997 the international IT literature tried to define many in many ways the concept try to get a grasp of the concept but it was very difficult so for many years until about two thousand ten the world was not there the world was not ready the government in the u.s. decided to renew to to modernize the technology the IT infrastructure there for the CIA office mandated all gone agencies to adopt the cloud first approach policy what does that mean it means that if you want to modernize a system you must look first at cloud solution and determined that is suitable or not if it's suitable you must go and adopt a cloud based information system so in 2011 to be able to move forward with that concept and because NIST was a leader of the process helping supporting government agencies with the technological guidance and standards we started by defining cloud what cloud is a short and sweet document that became known worldwide and adopted by international community to the fact that we today's discuss about infrastructure is a service and we all know what that means software is a service or platform as a service a public cloud a private cloud we owe that to that document to these people to the authors that brainstorm based on the research that they've done the perception of the communities and settling on concepts they identify what is coming new than five characteristics of a cloud what how can we distinguish between classical IT and what cloud is basically the utility concept that was about the time when I was appointed to lead the security and later the forensic work at NIST and support the this mission when I had one morning I had my own epiphany so I'm going one morning to my eye doctor I've been seeing him no regular basis for years and in that particular day when I'm going his office was totally modernized was changed and I'm getting in instead of having you know the front desk there with lots of pretty ladies I only had kiosks one lady was directing me to go and check myself in pay over credit card at the kiosk then I'm getting it to the office i'm waiting for the doctor and the moment the doctor gets in he comes inside dr. your guys welcome to i would like to welcome you how do you see me in the cloud my jaw dropped because i thought that somebody told on me that i started a new job and I'm that's my expertise and said what do you mean doctor said yes I was told that I should greet all our patients with a statement how do they see us in the cloud okay I'm breathing deeply but I'm starting heart with a delighting in the same time and and he is I'm continuing because my attention was totally in the cloud world so that do you really know what do you mean said I know they told me that we are in the cloud right now but do you know what that means no I have absolutely no idea well I'm trying to explain to him and said i don't i know nothing about it my son that just graduated from school is our system administrator for my business so he decided that we need to go to the cloud whatever that is I couldn't stay there believing me or not because I knew with my expertise in the field what the implications are where you don't know what we are getting on I had to find I had to talk to his son i had to find where his business is and after my personal discussion I feel comfortable going back because I realized that going to the cloud his system and my data was protected better than the way he was protecting it before when his wife I had no password when he was transferring all the information via voice voice over IP to a center and so on so my value proposition because we are moving our lives to the internet online is that we need to have effective security for cloud to take maximum advantage of cloud but the other side of the coin is that we need cloud computing to help us to manage the security programs that the Internet of Things requires now imagine that our life is moving in the direction which you receive email from your refrigerator because you are running out of milk so the refrigerator will send you an email and then we'll put that on the list for the store that will deliver the email that the make the milk to you at home or your car decides that has a technical issue communicates with the dealer takes itself to the dealer and then comes back after is fixed and parts itself in the garage in such a world which is the world we are moving to we need to have better security [Music] I'd like to recap a little bit the world i'm coming from and what happened in 2015 and why is it important to have better security we have the office of personal management 22 million records that were exposed those were records of people that had clearance and that work for government you can see there that there is a report from crabs on security on all those incidents it's important and I will you figure out why we had also we had also anthem anthem is keeping all our medical records 80 million records that were lost that were exposed those were all bad news for me in 2015 because now you have information of people you add to that information their health records the good news for me in 2015 was I was not on Ashley Madison website so they couldn't Blake blackmail me for that that's a dating site for people that were cheating on their spouses but if you look up the structure of somehow it went faster than I clicked somebody clicked for me there it's okay [Music] here we are if you look at what those bridges where you will figure out that someone that this is pure Spanish because somebody will have your name your information your records your clearance information there will have your health records and if you dare to cheat on your spouse they will have all the information they need to blackmail you but we are in the IT world and refrigerators and toasters can be used to create one of the largest denial of service attack that happened just recently about two weeks less than two weeks ago was double in size 660 I think Akamai determined 660 kilobytes per second the largest now until now it was only half of this 320 I believe Caleb gigabytes per second I apologize gigabytes per second yeah gigabit sorry so you can imagine that we expose ourselves to a tremendous threats the surface the complexity of our systems increase and the surface of attack increase also tremendously the entire world brought about this because this was an attack against as you can see there crabs and the reason why is because he blogged against them imagine that the target has a much higher value is not just a revenge akamai for this attack for three days they resisted but it can get worse I would like to just brief you a little bit as Ellen asked me on the work that we've done that we are doing that we've done and continue to do admiss to provide guidance and develop standards for government agencies and the population of large to use the ones that are looking at adopting solutions I won't have time to get deeply into any of those projects but I like you to have to taste the wine and then you can come back to us you can contact me and I can elaborate on any of those so existing project we started with developing a security reference architecture that is in draft form and provided also a tool to be able to deliver the data that the document is associated with we developed a security controls and cloud-based for cloud-based information systems we also developed the risk management framework for cloud ecosystems from the consumers perspective and also current work as the forensic reference architecture for the ones that were here yesterday I posted to to mr. Jia no question regarding the forensic well that was what I had in mind we need all to collaborate to get a good to have a good outcome new project we are working and I'll go over all of them in more details but in the interest of time I like to go in very briefly discuss it's not changing how can we get a good cloud select from the Chinese menu that was the first thing that we did we try to help consumers to build a good cloud so we took a Lego approach when it comes to architecting a cloud environment we had to leverage standards that we had out there please work with me so we leveraged standards that we have the NIST reference architecture which was well known and two more important to people out here because we are in Europe with leverage to develop a methodology of how can you approach how can you develop this Lego cloud based on information that was already available there so we discovered the cloud security alliance enterprise architecture which allowed you to work with 346 functional capabilities to build in a cloud environment but system of your choice up to an entire enterprise that was critical for us because that help us start building a bridge between what we are doing in the government space and what public is doing out there close Security Alliance even though it's it's a partner competitive partner to Europe cloud they do good work and I like to look around and have collaboration and leverage everything that is good out there we don't like to reinvent we like to move faster forward by collaborating and producing something that is useful to the entire world not just to our world there are tools that we provide is that cubic group cloud security cubic a Rubik's Cube that I highlighted there so the entire data can be visualized this is the one is available for download we are trying to make it available through our general service and to be able to truly help government agencies was not enough to determine that you want particular functional capabilities so we have to go all the way down to low granularity to identify the security controls that you need to implement those are security controls from our catalogue 853 but because we were lucky and used the cloud security alliance approaching capabilities they do provide set of controls from other catalogs from I saw from PC I from shops they provide controls that are mapped to those capabilities also so what we are doing they are in the approach and methodology can be used by others at large good good was good but not good enough so we wanted to create cheap clouds but when i say chibi doesn't mean cheap and assess that doesn't provide enough so we are looking for approaches of getting for government space something that is the lower value so the idea was if we have an entity out there that the government agencies trust and this is FedRAMP that was great a federal risk management assessment program is on our behalf is going and assessing clouds for standards that were established that are a baseline for all government agencies then we can go and shop on their list and we need to pay only for the delta to negotiate what we need extra so that was a very important process but how you end up there how you end up to determine what is that you need is something that we had to work on and try to help government agencies and this was the risk management framework for cloud ecosystem we work for many years for systems that we were managing so from purchasing the hardware we were building the systems and we knew how to do that so the risk management framework for a classical idea was bible to us so we knew that this is the one that we see but if you look at what you have to do if you are a consumer and you play with the idea of moving or adopting the system in a cloud environment there are additional steps that you have to go through and those are the ones that are highlighted in green this image is just gives you a visual thing that gives you a flavor of the Delta the difference or extra that you have to do and how do those correlate one to each other so you have to have when you start the process you have to have the vision because you need to deal with that iceberg architecture type whatever happens below the water it's something that you need to gain visibility into to be able to trust the system whatever you manage which is above the water we know how to do that we learn and we've done that for many years is the upper part is the risk management framework that you apply to the top stack that she is under your management providers are doing very good jobs but are doing very good jobs with information that they have so they manage the lower part of the system having that vision in the wrapper and cyclic approach for the entire system is what you need and what fed room does for does is saves money and gives us confidence that this part here is well done and serves our purpose [Music] while we need to understand though is when a provider does a fantastic job to you know create the service they will build a system around a hole here an assumption of the type of data that you have you are the only one that knows what kind of data goes in there you are the only one that has to build a top layer here and you have to serve your Delta your day data here and properly categorize it in such a way that when [Music] you put the system together it works seamlessly and it inherits all the controls from the bottom without any problem that you can leverage them that they and if you don't you need to understand what's hot what's happening in the lower part and you need to compensate or tailor the controls you need to have this understanding because you need to build a boundary trust boundary around the system we're probably all familiar with the perimeter of a system the classical IT in which you can wrap your arms around and you put their big walls to all walls and you can protect your system inside and you keep perimeter all the enemies there we are no longer there this trust boundary is elastic it's a logical concept but you need to know and understand the system to be able to properly operate the system and to be able to authorize your data on the system we use the information that we had and forensic was a big challenge in the clown environment because of the nature because of the new technology and because of the model a utility model in which you the owner of the data don't have access to the stack all the way to the bottom and when there is a bridge you don't know probably four days is very much like cancer until it starts really acting or it's too late you don't know that you have a bridge you might not even find out what when it happened for how long it was there and how much data was exfiltrated so trusting the system is important knowing how to do forensic there is very important so we built we did a lot of research sorry I went backwards and and I didn't do the backwards but it happened so we created a document that is highlighting the challenges that forensic of forensic investigators are faced with but we are using this challenges basically to identify the elements the components in that building block approach of security architecture to see which elements in that architecture have forensic artifacts be able to create leveraging the challenges a forensic reference architecture [Music] the new projects as I promised the lady here asked me what am i working on there are so many interesting projects that i don't even know with with which one to start but i guess the one that i left at the end is the one that will make probably the biggest impact you forget it right definition of application containers and microservices many people are complaining that a vendor locking how can you get out of there probably containers is one of the approach application containers it's a new technology is different is not just the m but we need to see what's going on because containers operates with admin rights so we need to know what what they are doing on our behalf so identifying what application containers and microservices is putting the a frame to the concept and then looking at the challenges our projects that we are working on the definition is out there we close the public comments on that and we are currently working with the security working group which by the way I forgot to mention the security working group that I'm sharing has more than 900 people from around the world that have the kindness and to collaborate with us on a volunteer basis and so we can produce something that meets their needs and their expectations too we were called on federated identity many of the projects that will discuss here yesterday are critical and leverage federated identities but when that Federation happens in a cloud environment there is another entity there that can get access to your data to your identities what's the impact how the threat vector changes is something that we are looking at what are the challenges to implement [Music] this is work in progress new and interesting its definition of fog mist edge computing how many of you knows what fog computing is Miss computing edge computing fluid computing follow me cloud I heard that too let's see let's go and see what for computing is so open fog consortium has a definition for for computing comes the closest to our research shows that is the understanding of all computing so we have cloud which is [Music] we have cloud right so we have cloud which is centralized system it's huge its massive it's out there but it can have latencies for for Internet of Things devices might be too slow which is interesting right because we thought cloud is very fast so this is how the concept of fog computing evolved it's a service of cloud like that is delivered closer to the device to the edge and then it's miss computing MISD not an ISD which is the lower layer here is all the way at the bottom among your IOT devices so the idea is that in order to help your refrigerator to deal with the email to send you emails for your milk to help all the bulbs that need to communicate want to turn off and want to turn on they need to have a platform if you have temperature sensors you don't need those sensors to constantly every minute or every five minutes to communicate their temperature so this layer here the Miss layer can aggregate that and then can transfer that information to the fog which has analytic power which has computational and storage power and reduces latency but it's not as powerful is not as agnostic of the of the service if you wish or of the entity of the device at the end as cloud is so fog is more specialized but it gives you many of the features that cloud has and reduces latency those are things that are coming those are things that are supporting IOT and all this layer here people are referring to this edge computing for computing was introduced by Cisco miss computing was introduced by Cisco to but it needed so we need to look into it we need to define it we be able to address challenges to be able to evolve the concept here that's clogged this is fog this is missed the last project which is my baby is how to get the cloud to be faster if we look at the risk management framework that I showed earlier there are several of the steps there that can be automated if we are able to structure the information in such a way that and the differences imagine that you have a letter and you want to send a letter from here from Bucharest to your grand mine faulty chain if you don't structure the letter properly the post office is one will not be able to deliver that information is like the message in the bottle if you leave that message in pure language human language you cannot automate it you can do very little things about it so if we are able to automate the process of delivering and assessing security information then we'll be way ahead of the game so we are working on developing an open security controls assessment language abstract language think of XML set of schemas and framework how many of you are familiar with that great so it's a your article language I would like to take that that allow you to describe the catalog controls of your choice the one you want to use that help you create an overlay the overlays a concept that we are using in in our US government space meaning i'm taking this catalog but the controls their agnostic of the technology that i want to use the controls for think 27001 is not going to tell each cloud student it's for every IT system it's for mobile is for type of physical systems so you define the technology so you have to customize in a way those detailer in the way those controls so the language lawyer will allow you to describe that to be specific and then you can determine the purpose for that control to be implemented I show to you the capabilities that Lego approach so a control can be implemented like access control can be implemented at different levels in the step whatever implement that you have specifics about access control so you have to define how that is implementing the language layer will allow you to do that so implementation information who can benefit from that well from the implementation information consumers of cloth can benefit because they can define the implementation the providers can because they can describe in a better way now in a way that the consumer can automate the review and the description of the service that is provided we required and also authorities assessment authorities or certification validation authorities however you want to call them can use those schemas the implementation schemas assessment schemas [Music] assessment schemas can also be used by consumers and said well this is how I want those controls the BSS and you take that information and put it it's part of the service level objectives as part of the contract that you end up closing with the service level agreement that is part of your service agreement the contract that you are signing with I think I missed something there i click too soon and then authorities that are certifying providers can also specify how those controls how have to be assessed why is that important if I am an authority that is assessing a provider I want to make sure that I do it in a reputable way I want to make sure that nobody will come back to me and say hey you're biased because I'm a human so I'm going to go in a higher a third-party independent Assessor 2 i'm going to tell this is how you i would like you to go and do the job that has to be an entity that has no gain from working with me or working with a provider so he's very truly independent in this way I know that the process that I'm that I'm supporting the assessment process is its rigorous and is repeatable which is very important so I gain trust through that approach so when consumers are coming to find something from my less thereof assess providers they trust that I did a good job on their behalf [Music] but one other thing that is very important to have are the metrics there are controls that are measurable so you need to know what the latency and you need to be able to define that value and you need to be able to monitor that value and if you don't make that one you sleep better so you don't have to stay there watching it you just get warning when it goes off and the standard deviation from what you have in the contract is bigger or if you had a bridge information can be used by consumers information can be used by providers to define that this is what I'm offering to you this is what I want is consumer and we are around the table to negotiate it and that's information that is used for continuous monitoring because it's not enough to assess and authorize the service ones and then you go to sleep you have to continuously in the near real-time money toward the system it's your data it's your responsibility to secure it and the language also support any other kind of information that you want to use you want to provide you to customize you want to automate this is my baby the project that we started to a couple of months back and we hope that if we do it right we can apply this language to any technology not just cloud and to any standard so we're hoping that we can propose it to international standards therefore I'm calling for collaboration on this project and I do have I would like to know that we're doing is useful so if you want to collaborate if you want to see if what we are doing is useful to you too to give us a feedback in the process rather than waiting at the end to do the work and then redo it to satisfy the needs of a larger community then please come forward and contact me with this I would like to thank you all this is my contact information
