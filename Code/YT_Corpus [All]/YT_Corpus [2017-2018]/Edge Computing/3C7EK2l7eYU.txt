 live from Boston Massachusetts it's the hue covering OpenStack southern 2017 brought to you by the OpenStack foundation Red Hat an additional ecosystem to support welcome back I'm Stu minimun and if I'm sitting on this side of the table with the long hallway behind me it means that we're here for the wrap of the second day John Troyer's here day two of three days the cube here at OpenStack Summit John I feel like you know you're building energy as the show goes on kind of like the show itself yeah yeah get might get my footing here again first my first summit was a good second day Stu I think we made it through I was we had some fascinating stuff yeah fascinating stuff and Before we jump into some of the the analysis here do want to say you know first and foremost big thanks to the foundation foundations themselves tend to get you know they get beat up some they get love some without the OpenStack foundation we would not be here their support for a number of years our fifth year here at the show as well as the ecosystem here really interesting and diverse in ever-changing ecosystem and that fits into our sponsors too so red hats are you know headline sponsor here we had Red Hat summit last week and you know two weeks lots of Red Hatters and now lots of stackers here additional support brought to us by Cisco by netra gnome and by canonical by the way you know no secret we try to be transparent as to how we make our money if it's a sponsored segment it lists sponsored by that guest here and otherwise it is editorial day three actually has a lot of editorial means we have a lot of end users on the program we do have vendors you know full startups interesting people people like Brian Stevens from Google when I can get access to them I love to have it here so you know big shout out as always content we put it out there to community try to have it but back to the wrap um John you know we've kind of looked at some of the the pieces here the maturity you know where it fits in the hybrid and multi cloud world what jumped out at you as you've been chewing on day two well my favorite thing for today and we talked about it a couple times just in passing it kept coming up is OpenStack on the edge Jim so the concept of that the economics works today that you can have a device a box maybe it's in your closet somewhere maybe it's bolted to a lamppost or something but in the old days it would have run some sort of proprietary chip maybe an embedded Linux you can put a whole OpenStack distribution on there and when you do that it becomes controllable it becomes a service layer you can upgrade it you can even launch more services from there all from a central location the I just that kind of blew my mind so that's my favorite thing from today I finally got my arms around that ok great and we have right we saw Beth Cohen from Verizon was in the day one keynote we're actually going to have her on our program for the third day and right teasing out that edge most of it telecommunications is a big discussion point here I understand why telcos spend a lot of money they are a large scale in that NFV use case has driven a lot of adoption so you know Deutsche Telekom is a headline sponsor of the OpenStack foundation did big keynote this morning 18 tees up on the mainstage Verizon's up on the main stage you know Red Hat canonical I'll talk about their customers that are using it um you know we just talked to Netra gnome about you know telecommunications you know all everybody here if you do an open stack you probably have a telco place because that's where the early money is um and it tends to be there's the network edge then there's the IOT edge and you know some of the devices there so it was one of the buzzy things going in and definitely is one of the big takeaways from the show so far well Stu I also think it's a major proof point for OpenStack right bandwidth these are not going down that's pretty clear with all the things you mentioned right throughput is going to have to go up services are going to have to be more powerful and so in all these different kind of connected devices and qualities of service and video streaming video to your car so if OpenStack if they can build a backplane a data plane for OpenStack that can do that which it looks like they are doing right that's a huge proof point downstream from the needs of a telco so I think that's super important for OpenStack that it's usable enough and robust enough to do that and that's one of the reasons I think it gets talked about so much the nice thing is this year here to my comparisons of previous years of OpenStack summit telco is not the only game in town right Enterprise also got a lot of play there's a lot of use cases there too and just to close out on that edge piece really enjoyed the conversations we had with John and Kendall who had done they worked on the container space so talking about the maturation where cinder had gone how we went from virtualized environments to containerized environments and even we teased out a little bit that edge use case I can have a really small OpenStack deployment to put it at that edge maybe that's where some of the server list stuff fits in I know I've been I tell my team every time I get a good quote on server list let's make a gem out of that put it out there because it's early days but that is one of those deployments where I need at the edge environments I need something lightweight I need something that's you know going to be less expensive can do some fast processing and both containers and potentially server lists can be interesting yeah I mean even in our canonical discussion with the product manager for their OpenStack distribution right containers are all over that right containers are just a way of packaging they there are some really interesting development pipelines that are are now very popular and being talked about and built on in the container space but containerization actually can come into play multiple points in the stack like he said the canonical distribution gets containerized and pushed out it's a great way of compartmentalizing and upgrading that's what the demo on stage today was about also just with a couple of very short scripts container izing and pulling down components so I think again - my second favorite thing after after the edge today was just showing that that actually containers and OpenStack mix pretty well they're really not two separate things right and I think containerization is one of those things that enables that multi cloud world we talked another number of segments today everything from you know kubernetes with Brian Stevens as to how that enables that reminds me at Red Hat summit last week we talked a lot about open shift open shift that layer on top of OpenStack and sits at that application level layer to allow me to be able to you know span between public or private clouds and we need that kind of you know that to be able to enable some some real multi or hybrid cloud and yeah I mean containers and in fact that kubernetes lei I may end up being the thing that drives more OpenStack adoption yeah and the other thing that's been interesting you know just hallway conversations bumping into people we know you know trying to walk around the show a little bit as to people that are finally getting their arms around ok OpenStack from a technology standpoint has matured and you know they either needed to you know clean up what was their internal cloud or you know building something out so you know real deployment you know you know we talked about it yesterday and in the close though they're real customers doing real deployments and heartening to hear yeah I mean one of those conversations I ran into somebody at a hyper scale company a friend of mine and you know they are building out internal OpenStack clouds to use for real stuff right so way hyper scale come on John we can give away you know is this something we have on our phone or something we you know all by in use you know one of those big folks yeah yeah well interest there was you know a large Chinese company that you know anybody in tech knows that supposed to be doing a lot you know with with OpenStack we heard it definitely Asia you know very broad use of OpenStack been a theme of the whole show right is that outside the US where we tend to talk a lot about the public cloud on you know open stacks being used I mean in undertone I've heard is right certain companies that start here in the United States it's sometimes challenging for a foreign company to say I'm going to buy and use that absolutely that is a headwind against a company like Amazon ties back to we have the keynote this morning with Edward Snowden and some of those things what is the relationship between you know government and global companies that have a headquarter in the US and beyond yeah I think it's too soon to say where the pendulum is how far the pendulum is going to swing I'll be very interested in commentary for next year to see you know have we moved away from more of the centralized services dominating the entire marketplace and workload into more distributed more private more customizable for all those reasons out there there's a lot of dynamics that might be pushing the pendulum in that direction yeah and one of the things I've liked hearing is you know infrastructure needs to be more agile needs to be more distributed more modulized especially as the applications are changing so I feel like more than previous summits I've been at we're at least talking about how those things fit together with everything that's happening with the OpenStack days you know could the kubernetes Cloud Foundry SEF you know it is other open-source projects how those all fit together it feels like a more robust full position as opposed to you know we were just kind of building you know a software version of you know what we're doing in the data center before my impression was the conversation what at times had been a little more internally focused right it's a world unto its own here at this summit they're definitely acknowledging there's an ecosystem there's a landscape it all has to interoperate usability as a part of that and then interoperability and componentization as a part of that as well well the changing world of applications we understand the whole reason we have infrastructure is to run those applications so if we're not getting ready for that you know what are we doing yeah if I don't want to put words in their mouth I but III think the OpenStack community as a whole one of their goals is you know OpenStack needs to be as easy to run as a public cloud or you know the infrastructure needs to be boring we heard the word boring a lot actually today yeah and what we say is first of all the public cloud is the bar that you were measured against um whether it is easier or cheaper you know your mileage may vary because um you know public cloud was supposed to be simple they're adding like a thousand new features every year and it seems to get more complicated over time um it's wonderful if we could architect everything and make it simple unfortunately you know that that's why we have technology I know every time I go home and have some interaction with a financial institution or a healthcare institution boy you wish we could make everything simpler but the world's a complicated place and that's why we need really smart people like we've gotten to interview here at the show so any final comments Joan all right no I think I that sums it up those are my favorite things for today I'm looking forward to talking a lot of customers tomorrow yeah I'm really excited about that John appreciate your help here so there's the big party here at the show they're taking everyone to Fenway Park for the the stacker party last year it was an epic party in Austin Boston's fun Fenway is a great venue looks like the rains going to hold off which is good but it'll be a little chillier than normal but we will be back here with a third day of programming as John and I have talked about got a lot of users on the program so really great lineup two days in the bag check out all the videos got a silicon angle TV to check it all out big shout out to the rest of the team that's at the Dell EMC world and ServiceNow shows be able to check those out and all our upcoming shows and thank you everyone for watching the Q [Music]
