 live from Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco it's the queue covering IBM chief data officer strategy summit spring 2017 brought to you by IBM welcome back everybody Jeff freq here at the qubit is lunchtime at the IBM CDO summit packed house you can see them back there getting their nutrition but we're going to give you some mental nutrition we're excited to be joined by a repeat performance of Courtney Abercrombie come on back with the BJ BJ Shanker he's a GM cognitive IOT and analytics for IBM welcome thanks for having me so first off did you eat before you came on imagine a don't Courtney and I both managed to grab a quick bite excellent so let's let's jump into it cognitive a lot of buzz IOT lot of buzz how do they fit where do they mesh why is it wiring so important way another excellent question IOT IOT has been around for a long time even though we never called it IOT right my favorite example is smart meters that utility companies use so these things have been here for more than a decade and if you if you think about IOT there are two aspects to it that is the instrumentation right putting the sensors in and getting the data and the insights aspect which is making sense of what this sensor is trying to tell us combining these two is where the value is for the client right just by putting arbitrary sensors it doesn't make much much sense so look at the world around us now right the traditional utility will stick with the utilities to complete the story utilities all get disrupted from both sides on one hand you have your electric vehicles plugging into the grid to draw power the other hand you have supply coming from like solar roofs and so on so optimizing this is where the cognitive and analytics so that's the beauty of this world all these things come together that convergence is where the big value is right because the third element that you didn't have in your original one was what's going on you know what what should we do and then actually doing something right exactly gotta have the action yes and learning yes we go right the one thing that is available today with cognitive systems that we did not have in the past was this ability to learn as you go so you don't need human intervention to keep changing the optimization algorithms these things can learn by itself right and improve over time which is huge but you still need a person to help kind of figure out what you're optimizing for I mean that's where II can you have a pure machine driven algorithm without knowing exactly what are you optimizing for we had nowhere close to that today right so generally I you know where the system is like super smart by itself is a far away concept right but there are lots of aspects of specific AI you know optimizing a given process that can still go into this unsupervised learning aspects but it needs boundaries right system can get smart within boundaries system cannot just replace human thought it's just augmenting our intelligence right Porter you're shaking your head I'm completely in agreement we are nowhere near my husband's actually looking forward to the robotic apocalypse by the way looking forward to that he's like the less people the better though there was a lack of clear things people the better for him he's a finance guy he'd rather just sit with the you know the money all day but what does that say about me anyway yeah no I think we're never gonna really get to that point because we always those people have to be training these systems to think like us so we're never going to have systems that are just out there you know without having an intervention here and there to learn the next step you know that's how it works well I always like that the autonomous vehicle just example because it's just so clean you know if somebody jumps in front of the car this car hit the person or run into the ditch where today person can't make that judgment very fast they're just gonna react Yeah right but in computer time that's like forever so you can actually make rules and then people to go bananas well what if it's a gram on one side and kids on the other Christ ego or what if it's a criminal that this robbed the bank you take them out on purpose so now you get into a lot of interesting parameters to have it nothing to do necessarily with the mechanics of making that this new yeah and this changes the fundamentals of computing big time too right because the car cannot wait to ping the cloud to find out you know should I break or should I just run over you know this person in front of me so it needs to make that determination right away hopefully the right decision which is to break right but on the other hand all the cars that have this together have collective learning which needs some kind of cloud computing right so this whole idea of edge computing will come and replace a lot of vortexes today it's a serious disruption even behind the scenes on how we architect these systems so fascinating fact and in how much of the compute the store is at the edge how much should this compute the store in the cloud and then depending on the decision yeah and you said can you do it locally or do you have to send it upstream or breaking-in people if you look at that a car of the future forget car of the future a car of the present like this lab that has more compute power than a small data center multiple CPUs lots of RAM lot of hard-disk it's a little cloud that runs on these little ones in wheels let me ask you a question and here's a question we can talk about systems that learn cognitive systems that are constant learning and we're training them how do we ensure that Watson for example is constantly operating in the interest of the customer and not the interests of IBM now there is a reason I'm asking this question because at some point in time I can proceed some other company offering up a similar set of services hmm I can see those services competing for attention as we move forward with increasingly complex decisions with increasingly complex sources of information what does that say about how these systems are going to interact with each other something that I worry about all the time as we worry about what quiets to a couple of approaches by which this will existed to begin with while we have the big lead and in cognitive computing now there is no hesitation on my part to admit that the echo system around us is also fast developing and there will be a hefty competition going forward which is a good thing because if we look at how this world is developing it is developing as ap is right so api's will fight on their own merits very pluggable architecture if my API is not very good then it will get replaced by somebody else's API right so that's one aspect the second aspect is there is a difference between the provider and the client in terms of who owns the data we strongly believe from IBM that plant owns the data so we will not go in and do anything crazy we won't even touch it so we will provide a framework and the catalyst that is like very industry specific like for example if Watson has to act as a call center agent for a telco we will provide a set of instructions that are applicable to telco but all the learning that Watson does is on top of that clients data we are not going to take it from one telco and put it in another telco that will stay very local to to that Dell and hopefully that is the way the rest of the industry develops too that they don't take information from one and provide to another even on an anonymized basis this is a really bad idea to take a client's data and then feed elsewhere that it has all kinds of ethical and moral consequences even if it's legal absolutely and we would encourage clients to take a look at some of the others out there and make sure that that's the I mean what a great job for an analyst firm right but coming I want to build upon this point is I heard something very interesting in the keynote the CTO of IBM in the keynote this morning he can't he used to turn that I've thought about but never heard before trust as a service are you guys familiar with his use of that term yep okay what does trust as a service meaning and how does it how does it play out so that I as a consumer of IBM cognitive services I have a measurable difference in how I trust IBM's progeny services versus some would call that blockchain in fact what would - not to me called trust as a service and brought in is probably the most physical form of it that we can find at the market I distributed ledger where it's open to everybody but then no one transaction can be tapped by somebody else right but if we extend that concept philosophically it also includes a lot of the concept about identity identity all right I as a user today I don't have an easy way to identify myself across systems like if I'm behind the firewall I have one identity if I'm outside the firewall I have another identity but if you look at the world tomorrow but I have to deal with a zillion EP is this concept of a consistent identity needs to pass through all of them it's a very complicated and difficult concept right to implement so that must as a service essentially the like blockchain that needs to be an an identity service that follows me around that is not restricted to an IBM system of an Oracle system asana for the end of the day block changing mechanism yes trust reserve it sounds like it's a way of doing business yes so is IBM going to be a leader in defining what that means well look in all cases IBM heads we have all instructors what's the right word striven stroeve's thank you to be an a leader in how we approach everything ethically I mean this is truly in our in our blood I mean we are here for our clients and we aren't trying to just get them to give us all of their you know data and then go off and use it anywhere you have to pay attention sometimes that what you're paying for is exactly what you're getting because people will try to do those things and you just need to have a partner that you trust in this and I mean I know it's self-serving to say but I mean we think about data ethics we think about these things when we talk to our clients and that one of the things that we try to bring to the table is that moral ethical you know should you just because you can and we add just so you know walked away from from deals that were very lucrative on board right because we didn't feel it was the right thing to do and we will always I mean I know it sounds so serving I don't know how okay you won't know until you deal with us but but pay attention buyer beware just Courtney from IBM we know what side you better you know it's a great quick because the other kind of ethical thing that comes up a lot with data is you know do you have the ethical conversation before you collect that data and how you're gonna be used that's just today you don't necessarily know what's gonna you know what and how that might be used tomorrow that's really tricky beautiful thing is a very interesting concept for example vast majority of our analytics conversation today is around structure and structure you know those kinds of terms but where is the vast majority of data sitting today it is in video and sound files which it is significantly scary because the technology to get insights out of this is still developing right so all these things like posture and identity and security and so on like it needs and quantum computing for that matter right all these things need to think about the future where some arbitrary form of data can come hit you and all these principles of ethics and legality and all should apply like very non-trivial challenge that some country you know are starting to develop their own protections like the general data protection regulation is going to be a huge driver force in some countries are not I mean it's just like cognitive is just like anything else when the car was developed I'm sure people said hey everybody's gonna go out killing people with their cars now you know but it's the same thing you can use it as a mode of transportation or you can do something evil with it you know it really is going to be governed by the societal norms that you live in as to how much you're going to get away with and transparency is our friend so the more transparent we can be things like blockchain other enablers like that that allow you to see what's going on and have multiple coffee the better all right well Courtney Vijay great topics and that's why gatherings like this are so important to be with your peer group you know to talk about these much deeper issues that are really kind of tangential to the technology but really core to the bigger picture so keep keep getting out on the fringe to help us figure this stuff out all right Jeffrey booth universe we're at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco the IBM chief data officer strategies 20:17 thanks for watching
