 hello everyone this is kyle welch with RCR wireless news i want to thank everyone for attending today's webinar netting the best qoe trends and traffic management in mobile core optimization our sponsors today are a scum Aleppo and ritsu vib guavas and flash networks presenter today is Monica pollini president and founder of spoons of philly consulting and at this time I'd like to pass the presentation over tomorrow Vance Kyle it's a it's a pleasure to be here talking to you and I'd like to join Kyle in thanking our sponsors develop done a great job with the interview sir will be included in the report and I will get back to that later so QE it's it's really it's really hot topic now but how I got to start writing on this and oh and by the way this webinar is it's a preview of the report of the interviews that will be included in the report it is going to come out next week just ahead of Mobile World Congress and today I'm going to give you a sense of what's going to be in the report and then once the report is available you will be able to download it and thanks to our sponsors it's free and they will be distributed by our selves our Ellis so this is this is a companion report to a previous reported I wrote on optimizing duran so I start working on optimizing Iran and then moving and optimizing the core and the interesting well the interesting of the finding of the first finding was that it was very difficult to keep the two topics apart because when you optimize the ran you need to know what's going on in the network end to end and then the core comes in and similarly whatever you're doing the core to optimize the service delivery has an impact and needs to be done in sync with duran so that you can get the best results to some extent there is a sub common ground in the two reports but the perspective is different so you cannot separate the two but there is a lot of work that needs to be done in putting the two together in integrating it and to some extent as a technology issue on how you do it but it's also a cultural issue within the operators where they traditionally have two different teams that work on the core and on the run and need to start working more closely with each other so that's that's a cultural shift but the other finding is that as we look at how you optimize the core the concept of QE is really becoming central and that's that's what a new thing and so a lot of my presentation today will be about that and that it also explains the title for the report so let's get started and and by the way I'm going to try to leave time for questions at the end so feel free to type them in and then I'll go over as many as i can and answer those that I can now get to later so traditionally what has happened is that the wall operators since day one had as a goal to make their subscribers happy you build a network to get your subscribers to be the happiest you can possibly make them and you run the network to that effect so it in a way qe has always been the focus on the optimization of mobile networks because operators wanted to provide the best service so the question is why has this changed why all of a sudden we talked about QE all the time when we talk about how to improve the performance on the network and I think the difference now is that finally operators can measure QE explicitly and use it to optimize their network or the their network performance and that just wasn't possible before so what would happen in the legacy environment is that operators would indirectly try to get the best QE but it would be done based on an element based optimization of mobile hours because that was the only thing that was available so there was the best proxy to achieve basically the same goal so the goal has not changed the way you get to it hat is changing and it has not changed entirely or even we're just at the beginning of a trip out of transition and and in fact you probably hear me talking about learning a lot because we don't have a real ready-made solution but we have a lot of tools that we can use to learn as a transition to a different way to optimize and render networks so in it i guess the environment but you do have its that operators who try to maximize throughput minimize the latency so basically at each step in the network every every point in the network they will try to get the best performance locally that they could possibly achieve a gross of applications and everything and that that is it's good so you try to optimize the capacity the downside of that is that you do this in a sort of a natural brute force approach so you treat every packet in the same way and by doing that you you do not extract as much value from your network assets as you could otherwise and so now as we move to a QE based optimization operators are trying to measure and maximize QE paying attention what is in the performance that matter to subscribers and at the application level from the location at time different times and basically optimized base the on that so it's no longer pushing as much bits as you possibly can but pick the bits that matter the most and send them first now what that means is that also the way we test and monitor the network has changed so initially in the in the legacy environment or what app is mostly still today you test the admonitor to performance of in the individual network elements you put a probe you you see what goes on at each step and optimize it and he tested often time this testing and monitoring is mostly meant to make sure that the network events at the beginning when deployed and and then monitor it when a problem arises and this is this works if you have a static Network it doesn't really change much through time because you know you just is it a problem you try to solve it but this is no longer working because the network is becoming more dynamic and since the network changes all the time you need to continuously test it and monitor it and look at it added with an end-to-end view to make sure that if there is a problem from a QE point of view you're able to trace back what the problem is understand it and address it in in real time so if this changes the scope and the relevance of both testing and monitoring and in fact testing and monitoring become pretty much a single activity and in this continuous one to make sure that you can optimize the network as you go along you still have to optimize it at the beginning so in a way what you were doing what we are starting to do now is on top of this so I guess that one way to think about the evolution towards a QE based the optimization approach is that it's not moving away from the legacy approach but it's building on top so all the oldest steps all the tasks that work here they're still being used and another thing here is that because of this static networks and pushing trying to maximize capacity they run the core where kept separate now in this this separation doesn't work anymore as I told you before also there is a need to integrate ram and core and sort of a as a consequence you'd have the legacy optimization based on historical and average KPIs now provide a view of how good the network was you optimize those to improve performance again in a network that changes dynamically that's that's still important to capture the overall trends in our performance but you need to do more and you need to look at real time location aware application-aware r qo e data so what I'm going to talk about what I'm going to do today is to basically go through first talk about elements that matter that are driving the change which is basically a set of dimensions where the qoe data is through which the curie data is the finder become important and provide a way to differentiate traffic so that you can optimize on the business alviso queueing then different ways in which we can go to ensure that this information is the dimensions of information that a fine QE are taking care and used for optimization and then at the end I will go and give you a quick introduction on the interviews so that I still hope you will read them but i will just go through a quick summary of what the main topics where um so what is driving the change here so until recently as I said you know your operator for trying to maximize capacity so as long as everything was well behaved there were no you know malfunctioning items you just push whatever whatever company could we could accommodate but now it's towards that capacity is still clearly important capacity speed latency it's not like they're important as any it's reduced in any way but it's not just about that the crucial thing is how the capacity is used and now operators have the tools to choose how to use the network resources to finger strategy and then basically prioritize the way they use those resources as they did in doing so what's interesting is the marketing and operation priatians increasing will converge so it's not only Iran and the core people that have to work together but the marketing and the operations people that need to work together because this is a very crucial tool in the revenue generation or creating revenue opportunities lie so that operators can create and deliver services more quickly and that ties back into the marketing part so the marketing and operations can work together to to improve the opportunity to create new revenues I think that in all this the differentiation that we see in traffic which is what I'm going to cover in here in the first part of the webinar is it's an increasing complexity so the downside of this is that the traffic is becoming more complex there are more things to keep in mind ur is more data to analyze so all of this adds to the complexity but a complex it in itself it's actually a good thing because it creates the need for innovation but also it's creates the opportunity because it's only when you have diversity out there that you can prioritize a things as needed you can think about it in in the way it happens for instance in the real estate market right now in the the mobile world away services are priced in most markets is as if you sell houses just based on size it doesn't matter what the neighborhood of the house the polity of the house or anything it's pretty much you know you pay by by size and if you do that you're bound to leave a lot of money on the table because everybody pays the same there is no you know there is no variability so the people with a lot of money still wouldn't spend that much money because they don't need to have a huge the size of the house that they want is going to be just that much so they don't have the opportunity to spend more to desire house that is more expensive and i think that the complexity here basically creates market where which is similar to what you have a real estate where there are some houses and more expensive because they're in a better neighborhood because they're you know built differently or you know um and so you create the differentiation but you don't only need to have the differentiation out there but you need to also manage traffic accordingly to that according to that differentiation so this is this is important I think not only because it allows you to use the their net or your network in a more efficient way but also because you can extract a valid value from it so this I'm going to go through all of this rather quickly because I think it should be pretty clear what it is what is it I'm talking about but fundamentally the thing to keep in mind is that QE it's not it's not something like the you know when you look at the voice you have a mosque or you have a number which is subjective but it's one number and it's a you know it pretty much tells you all on when it gets to Curie there is a lot of variability there is a lot of factors that impact it and so you know ideally we would want to have an objective a very simple way to capture it but in practice there is other is a lot of variability and the performance of the network depends on many variables and then they need to take can be taken into account when you optimize the network because the network is at the end constrained in terms of capacity even if you go to you know many if you go to 5g you build a network to capacity so there is always you always try to squeeze as much as you can and so as you do that you have to take into account the experience or the user as of in the context of many other dimensions so time is one of them so here you know the difference the usage is different on the based on the time of day this is a you know just a new data from cisco vni and it's interesting because you use easily know there is the clear curve that you're familiar with but that really hides a lot of the variability that it's in there because this is a ver across a market but if you go into the specific locations you would you would see that there is much more much more variability so if you look at the downtown area you'd have you know probably around here have a peek when people get out of work and you that peak is sort of you know you don't see that peak here because you just look at the overall pattern Cisco thinks that these the pickiness miles my increase I think that you can you can argue both ways but it's not clear you know it might not increase but still at a local level there is going to be a lot of variability and then and then there is also the the spiciness that it's a microsecond millisecond level which is you to do the frustration in traffic so it's not a question of demand per se but it's just the nature of the application and this pattern interacts with time with location so it's not just time but it's not just the location but also time you can look at this in a Tokyo there is a movie that goes with this and you can see how much this pattern changes through time and you know you can think about you know just we just had the Super Bowl it's a you know there are all the pattern really depends on location and kind of a QE and the kind of performance you get it's it's highly dependent on location and the areas with extreme traffic are very few but that's where you know the value where as a subscriber we value the service most anything is devices now the clear growth scope for growth is on the other devices that non-cellular or about non phone and laptop devices there's just so many people out there a lot of the world has a ready a phone so there's just so much growth that is the potential for growth for mobile phone is limited but there is older the new IOT devices and they create a lot of opportunity because it's a very different service but at the same time it's a to optimize the network for those devices as well it's going to be a a challenge as well as an opportunity and then we have applications and them clearly hear the growth area is video video is growing a lot but I think we should start thinking a video of not just streaming video there is going to well there is and increasingly even more there's going to be conversational video of streaming video and broadcast video and they all have different requirements same thing for voice we don't have just volte or and obviously a circus fish but also we have Wi-Fi calling it again and also OTT was over IP so again there is more differentiation in terms of traffic and when you think of from the point of view of optimizing the network you makes it makes it more complex to understand wonder irrelevant queuing metrics are and how to use them so for instance for video there are different elements that come into play how do you define is if your video is good is it the stalling the quality the resolution the time it takes to start they're all important but how how are they important for different people they are important different ways now if you look at the overall application market here we see there is also a lot of fragmentation the top applications are well known but when you go down the list there is a lot of applications with different requirements as well rank condition is another element that it's a very m and it's very important so from traditionally from a core point of view you try to optimize a core performance but in order to do that if you know what's happening in the ran what are the right conditions what are what is their interface you're using how loaded it is are you indoors or outdoors is it as Marcel macrocell gasps all of this have bearing into how you want to optimize the traffic from the core point of view how you want to allocate resources so taking into account that information in the core it's quite important when you want to optimize it and again this is to some extent independent from the QE but it's all sort of it it's sort of it's all related they one of the main complexities of using q information to optimize the network is the fact that QE does not linearly relate to the performance of Duran or any other element in it in a reliable in a consistent way so you might have a bad curie at the handset level so you try to watch a video and it doesn't work it could be a problem with your phone it could be a problem with the ran it could be a problem with the back call it could be a problem some element in the core network it could be if you have a sin you have a signaling overload all sorts of things and but they all did my all sort of display or they might all be seen from the user in the same way so the user doesn't know and so if the user would say is it good or bad they would have the same answer and it but the cost would be many different things in fact you might have a situation where everything apparently works well but the performance from the end user is is nevertheless bad so let me move forward okay policy policy is the last the last element that matters and this is interesting in many ways because the policy is something that you traditionally set independently from the QE but their tourism in many ways the policy and the dqe base the way to optimize the network are really closely linked and this is because policy allows you to link the optimization efforts to monetization and that's really crucial because at the end of the day as an operator you want to keep your subscribers happy and generate a profit at the same time and trying to put the two together and policies really the link that allows you to do that and but at the same time you don't want to think about the tour's being destroyed they are they can a policy can benefit from knowing what the queue is so that you can refine how you set policy and then the policy itself allows you to optimize the network in with a view to improving Network you too well extracting value from your network assets and so you know I'm going to talk a lot about you know doing everything in real time and but policy clearly is not something you set in real-time the policies as a longer time frame but what it does in real time is it creates the framework infrastructure so that you can do the real time changes that are based on the policy in in real time so it is really a crucial element here to to tie everything together and I think that's that's really the challenging part at the same time as you know Sabbath it's the opportunity also the challenging part is to have all these different elements all these different dimensions all this different sources of information to to come together and that's the complexity this is what I'm going to talk about it later and enough is it to look at the way forward which is now that we see that there is all this complexity from a data point of view now that operators realize that they have all this data sit in there how can you use it just because you have the data there doesn't mean that you can use it so as much as it's difficult to capture QE as much as it's difficult to optimize the network in real time the information is all there the operators have all that information in their internet which the question is how to extract that information how to get to the relevant information and and how to use it to improve network performance so the fur the very first challenge is ok we want to from my point of view you want to focus on I QE use QE to drive optimization however Q is objective and it not only is to define this objective way but for different people what good means for two different people is different and what what is good for them depends on the context so in depending on where you are you might be willing to accept different levels of our experience so for instance you're in the Super Bowl if you realize that there is everybody's trying to use the network and so the network is slower you be more accepting of that and the issue are at home and it you know and some you know regular time and the service goes down and you must like you my question why is quality not good if it's reliable bad now the EQ also depends on the application so so for instance if you have video or even more so voice you're much more sensitive to latency and jitter then if you are browsing the web or texting so you know and then the bqe it's effectively silly that it's perceived on the vice side but it's also very difficult to measure anything on the device there are privacy concerns on top of everything but the you want to measure QE from the network as much as possible so you need a way to relate qe2 network performance so you need you need to have you need to have a perspective from the device but a lot of the data will come from the network and so and you need to trace back the cause of a problem so you need to have an interview of the network of how its performing how that is impacting qoe and then if there is a problem try to go back and understand where in the network you need to do something what actually you need to do to fix that problem now 11 other difficulty in measuring QE is that there are for a lot of data applications there are no standard metrics and not only the cure is subjective but how you measure it it also you know there are different time hmm different metrics to use for instance for video what's the most irrelevant one is it latency stalling times you know at the time it takes to get started decided the video doesn't go through so it's all it's all variable and in in an IP environment there is a lot of there is a lot of variability in your performance and so this this is this is really a learning process and I think that what both upward operators and vendors are doing right now is to try to learn as much as possible and we have the tools but at the same time it's going to take some time to refine and to get a good understanding so that it's everybody is going to become much clearer how to act on early signs of potential and potential issues another one is no need to do to over this in real time because the composition of the traffic changes because of the network's change especially with you know with addition of a small cells here on and other Oh order the use of unlicensed spectrum the network's the way that the traffic is routed the way traffic the composition of traffic changes continuously you need the QE is also going to fluctuate much more and and so what happens is that you need to make those changes in real time to really be a fifth effective you still need to do the long term changes you need to optimize for the long term or you know plan for capacity expansion and all that all that stays there that it does doesn't go away but on top of that you want to optimize in real time and so the question is how you do it and one one way is that you need to constantly monitor and have it more on you know end-to-end in-depth view of what goes on in the network at all time and this allows you to find out what goes wrong possibly ahead of time before it happens to see the first signs of a problem is arriving so that you can predict what what was on and and take care of any potential emerging problem before it affects their subscribers and but basically testing and monitoring are no longer an extra man external activity but they really become part of the operation so they become much more integrated with the orchestration of the network and the fundamental running and optimizing of it now said that because the question it often comes up is also about what is real time how how close to the millisecond you need to be basically to call something real time and I think this is a very important question and it's important to answer it appropriately in the sense that for different tasks different different time resolutions are appropriate and if you go to a situation where you just try to go down and down to you know close to the millisecond level as you can not only you don't gain anything but you just generate too much complexity too much overhead and at the end you're you're not getting anything out of it so so the in the move to real time you have to be careful of picking the real the definition of real time that it's relevant for you for your application so it is important to understand what is that you're trying to achieve and what kind of depth you need to go into in same thing is same is not just for time but also for detail you don't want to be to detail you don't want to be not not have enough detail you need to get the right level and and this is this is actually what the analytics that helps operator doing as they deal with you know big data so they have a huge amounts of data that they need to look at because they don't only need to look at the performance level but you know other information that we saw like for instance a location where the subscribers are what application you're doing so there are different ways to basically horizontally look at the data so you can go deeper depending on the need so it's important for the operator to have the ability to go deep but at the same time you don't want to go deep any more than you have to so it's really a crucial to the success of the transition to a QE based optimization to have a way to make sure that you have access to the data when needed but that you're not overwhelmed by it and so and it is important to first start with an end-to-end view of the network look at what what goes on identify the problem and be able to then focus as needed and have the agility to do so now agility it's one element but the other at the same time you also need automation because you cannot have a sufficient number of people that are there looking at every single thing that happens in to your network so although this has to be automated and and so this this is really a crucial tool in order to enable all those over all the changes of the shift to our aqe based optimization that looks at different dimensions in traffic um no the next one against were really down a little bit to hear of its virtualization virtualization allows you to act on suggestion that the new testing monitoring and analytics give you because if you as an operator you know that you should you can do and you should optimize your network in one direction in real time you need to be able to act real time to Andhra virtualization does is to give you the opportunity to adapt with in a dynamic environment so I think that what we're seeing here is that the this changes happen at the same time because they're mutually enabling each other and mutually reinforcing each other so that virtual you are in a better position to access and use the the this new set of information that you have is a QE II or application based in all the all the different things we discussed before and at the same time provides an additional reason to move to a virtualized environment because you see what is that you can do that you couldn't do before so it's it's something that it's just a mutual reinforcement type of situation and and and so but at the same time when you have this kind of environment a lot of things that work in differently so for instance you know physical problems that used to be very much important and they're still important again this is this is sort of it in addition to what we had before you cannot in a virtualized environment some some places you can you can have some physical probes but you also need over to approach because you want to measure performance where needed you also need to have a more active types approaches to testing where you generate you simulate data and this what that allows you to do is to focus on specific areas where you have a reason to suspect that there is something that might be creating a problem already creating a problem or creative problem in the future so that you are you can target so you can forget in terms of focusing on different parts of the network simulating data reproducing the problems so it's a much more active way of controlling or having a sense of having a view of what the network does it's not just by letting the network tell you oh there is a major problem here but as an operator you try to understand and investigate things before they happen or how they happen so that you can react to that and that requires a lot of flexibility that virtualization will provide but also will require away from way to run the network now end-to-end integration is another interesting aspect of it and this is what i was talking at the beginning is a traditional separation of ran and core optimization or run and core elements of the network is no longer works the two are becoming more depending on each other and the boundaries are disappearing and that's that's good because you can optimize for both at basically at the same time and then you can have you can use your resources more efficiently but what this does is it doesn't mean that everything is going to be more centralized revert realization and with the sort of blurring out bit of the boundaries between Corran and ran but it gives operators the freedom to pick the location that they want so some function are going are becoming more centralized and some are becoming more distributed and that's that's quite interesting and that's very again it's it syncs well with the with the interest in QE because depending on what you're trying to achieve are you in terms of maximizing QE is some some of the functionality might be more my may be advantageous to have some functionality to be more distributed and as I said before this is a change it it's not just an organization it's not just a technical changes organizational as well and they interviews that we have in a report talked a lot about this need to get the different teams to work together way that they're not used to to do in the past now the final thing here is that as you get n 2 and integration instead of looking vertically a different elements in the network and optimize their performance what operator sisters to do is to look at the horizontal functional split so that you can optimize the network based on different slices and and each slice has a different it carries a different type of traffic so this is a way to think about it then it's a it's a new way to basically operate the network and finally the mobile edge computing it's an interesting new development that puts it in report all of this together and so you have a virtualized the mobile network ran and core our mobile edge computing have a way to put the functionality where it needed as I was just talking about so basically any seed pushes the core functionality to the edge goes to the rad now when that happens at the same time when you have a see Randall vram architecture you see that the edge is moving towards the core and a quarter with the edge and oftentimes it makes sense to have a functionality co-located especially for video and not a real time traffic because this approach allows the network to have a better throughput lower latency and more scalable map networks so so this is this is all in so what I'm trying to get here is the fed that you have a much richer set of data that you can use to optimize the network it allows you to do much finer work much better work at optimizing the network but at the same time there's a lot of learning to do and there is a lot of there are a lot of tools that are out there but we also have to realize that this is this really the early early days and it's very encouraging to see that operators are really committed to that but at the same time it's also true that we do not have well not only we do not have the clear answers it's not like you know you have an LG specification you know and you know what the network bears with our requirements you go ahead and you deploy it this is not quite anything quite like that it's more we have the opportunity to do something we have to learn how to do it and it's not a specification it's it's a choice is it strategy that operators have and it's a way for them to differentiate from each other so it's it's a huge opportunity but it's also quite a lot of work now said that i'm going to give you a very quick preview of the interviews the interviews in in these reports are quite interesting in Porton and fundamental because the report talks about the high level trends but then in the interviews we have a way to to see how those trends are take place I mean are actually used or implemented in different products or by different companies or different operators so it really just allows you to go to to to go down deeper in in this specific in specific areas so then I just give you very quick overview so it's time for questions but do read the interviews are already available for download so the first interview is a lipo and we talked about a service creation monetization and policy as i said before policy is an essential link for optimization even though we might not think of you know using a policy for optimizing the network special when you talk about think about duran but i believe it's absolutely crucial to establish the link between optimizing the use of resources extracting as much value and keeping the subscriber happy and that's really what are the choir at the bottom of all the monetization if efforts it is then we ever talk to a ritsu and looking at qoe and try to understand how how the how to capture the Curie because the what is good experience what is bad experience and so it is again this is as I said before if this really is really not trivial so you need to have a combination of extracting the best data you can from the network is relevant to you and then have you analytics to look at it and analyze it Aspen telenet we're testing here we talked more about the testing and monitoring and how you can be having more active approach to it and emulating the data so that you you have you can explicitly explicitly test and explicitly go and look for specific issues and that's a that's a very powerful thing to do especially if you as you try to predict anticipate the emergence of potential issues and take care of them before they happen with flash networks we talked about how you optimize what's happening in the run from the core so it's basically trying to increase the the network utilization the performance in in daram as you move from the core and try to to optimize the network so that by the time he reaches the ran you have an easier job there to transmit the data guava is talked about analytics before that's what they they work on and they are really we talk to them about how you do it how you find the information that it's relevant to you and this is really a crucial issue when you when you're dealing with big data you have so much data how do you find what what is what is important to you so that you can actually find the solution to whatever problem you have in in the short time and how can you avoid not having to look through data continuous wait and the final interview with the sponsor is brb and here I we looked at how you go from the end to end a view of your network that you need to have first and how you can then go and go deeper as needed to to identify issues and I think here we talk a lot about you know the multidimensionality of the data that you're dealing with the more data you're able to combine as you optimize the network and more efficient you can be but you have to do it properly otherwise you're just submerged by complexity and then finally we talked to two operator operators about their experience three okay I talked to moni and he has the best title here's a head of matter of perception and it's actually I think it's very fitting with the what we talked about the dipper is it's a perception of the on the service and that's just really a good way to look at it how do we improve the perception so it's I think that calls attention to the fact it's more than just performances more than just bits and and and the question here that we discussed a lot is how do you put together the profitability the happiness of the consumer could go the customer with with the network performance you know things like throughput latency and all that how do you establish the link and then with a dhryn a telephonic Argentina we talked about the need to have an end-to-end approach to optimization so Huey is important but you also need to relate it to the own network end-to-end and understand if there's an issue how to improve it and from again from a revenue point of view how to improve curie and then well what QE is and move it back and try to understand how what to do in a network in order to do that you need to have rancor people talking together and derived class core people talking to the marketing people as well and that's we talked about how they have done that at telefónica argentina and i think that's all for me so their part is going to be but out the next week and you can download it for free and now i believe we have some time for questions now back to you thanks Monica yeah so we've had a few questions come in and any questions anyone has please submit them via the Q&A chat so first one we had was even all of this on the quality of experience and operators ability to offer quality of experience well operators then also be able to address specific verticals with tailor-made KPIs and as always yeah so I assume without you you're referring to vertical so I OTS and the machine to machine services right yes yeah actually I only briefly touched it but unless when I talk about the devices but this is actually um a key driver well it will be a Creed driver as you optimize the networks in the future right now it isn't because there's just so much I OT out there um but as you move forward one way to think about IOT is that ink is going to increase further the diversity of traffic and the diversity of the devices that you have out there so for each hi OT applications you're going to see a different type of device the different type of requirements and all that and so what that allah what would a QE base the optimization approach allows you to take all this differences into account and provide a different service SLA and all of that to different applications on announce needed basis now I don't know whether q is the best term here because when you have a sensor it's not a quality of experience Perseids but but it is kind of lead you can think of it as the experience would not experience the performance for that device for that service so operators will have it the opportunity to differentiate on on both ends so you might have a IOT service that it's very has very low requirements in terms of low throughput low latency and you know but but at the same time it's it's it's an application for which they can only extract so much in terms of revenue so it's a revenue constraint but also doesn't have a huge requirements and on the other hand you might have an IOT application that is mission critical and uses a lot of throughput and whoever is interested in that is willing to pay more money so um by doing this by managing traffic in a more active way you can accommodate the two and you can use for instance the times in a network where you have more capacity to to transfer to transmit all the data for the low you know low requirement will be in high latency type of application so you can put together different services so we're the same network in a much more efficient way and and obviously to do that with the you know the usual subscriber market so that the smartphones tablets and things like that that's great um so the next question will come in it's pretty pretty pointed so what are the three most important things operators need to do now to correlate their qoe to network performance three the three most important things um I think that I would say that the very first one is to try to capture QE based on on the application and traffic type um because the the way we judge performance as a friend from the subscriber point of view it's really highly dependent what we are trying to do and again it's not just video versus web browsing what kind of video is it is it conversational video is it a you know streaming video so I would say that the ability to look at the application level is application level in traffic type level it's crucial um other one I would say is to look at the location of the subscriber depending on where you are well I guess I'm say location / time the combination of the two um the kind of performance that you're going to be able to provide to the subscriber is difficult different so if you are in a situation where you are in a deep indoor location well you're going to be constrained you're not going to be able to have top speed on the other hand if you're a peak hour same thing so that's it not another crucial thing um third one um I guess that the other one would be well possibly understand more about your device because that's also another element so if you look at the the subscriber point of view and that I guess it goes more into the service assurances to you know if you know that there is a problem make sure that the device is not is not being the bottleneck there all right thanks so we have a couple more questions here to get you so is virtual core and ran necessary to achieve better keowee and small networks and data systems uh what so it's a question of what is it what is different from small cells and Iran I'm small cells and ass yeah what role does virtual corn ran play in queuing me for small cell networks and ass oh the area virtualized rad well yes that is a that is going to make it easier to act on any potential QE issue so on one end you know if everything works fine it gives you the more flexibility to allocate resources so you're you're you're in a better position to to change it to change the network so the network is more dynamic because you can you know direct your resources where they are most needed but also in real time it allows you to be to address any issue in much faster way because they all the elements in the innocent virtualized the run are much more closely related to each other working with each other so it's easier to to change the parameters of the network so that you can you can adapt you can more quickly react to any issues that arise in in in decades and then we let me see where you have much more functionality so it's basically what we say more intelligence goes to the to the edge but basically you do more processing ID at the edge then you have a better way again to control so you have more control over the QE in that way all right thanks that's about all the time we have today I want to thank everyone for attending today's webinar getting the best keowee trends and traffic management and mobile core optimization again sponsors of today's program was a scone Aleppo and ritsu the Abbey guavas and flash networks and again Thank You Tara Monica politi founder of sons of philly consulting Thank You Monica Thank You Kyla the pleasure
