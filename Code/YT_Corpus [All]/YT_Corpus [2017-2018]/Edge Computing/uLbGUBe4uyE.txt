 Good evening everyone Thank you for attending our anniversary event This talk will be given by Álvaro and myself. Álvaro is one of the hackers here at LUCA We will talk on innovations We had some drama, we almost didn´t arrive on time for the event Firstly we had to find my hat as I only just got back from travels and I had to change in the bathroom I arrived from Brazil And Álvaro had to make sure his hair was an appropriate color for the event And he almost burnt it... but no it was a lot of drama But eventually we were able to arrive on time and prepare the talk in a little while, Álvaro will show all of the demos As he is one of our key engineers He is one of our experts in visualization And many of the things you will see are done directly by him He can do it with much more care... everything I touch breaks In this talk we will discuss what we are doing in innovation LUCA was born as a unit that helps us to share our internal actions within Telefónica with clients And this has been an intense year where we have been working within Telefónica Proposing new ideas, challenges Trying to go beyond what we have infront of us So in this session, this chapter on innovation that has taken place this year we will show 4 technologies that we have built Firstly though, it has been one year since we launched LUCA with loads of doubts people said "why would Telefónica, a Telco, want to enter into the world of Big Data?" The truth is that during this year we have undertaken many projects We have made lots of products and we want to say that you can trust in us Because it is thanks to you, all of our clients that you have trusted in us, that you have helped and challenged us on the products we have made so that we can call the year a success and we have done many things, that you have maybe seen in the media including one of the most striking by Synergic Partners on the Museo Reina Sofia or the work with the Movistar Team or our analysis to help cities make decisions like you would have seen in our study with Line 5 of the Madrid Metro or how you will see here with motorways Most importantly, the unit has established itself and this allows us to think about the next steps Think on a large scale as to what we will create And before starting, I would like to return to the beginning - what is data As at Telefónica when we speak about data, it seems as if we are selling or doing something bad with our clients' data but this is not the case I want to go back to basics and talk about what data is and debunk this myth by saying "hello I am data" in order to explain what we do and how we generate knowledge from the data that we have Everyone can understand this first part, right? the data is that My name is John, I am 27 and I go to London at 7am on Mondays Very simple to understand as it has personal information and for us this is sacred For us it is very valuable And as we have already publically said, it belongs to the true owners, who are our clients Secondly there is anonymous data I am 27 and go to London on Mondays at 7am which is timely information where we have removed any reference to the person But this is not what we use After we have aggregated data which say something such as We are 100 people under 30 and go to London on Monday at 7am But what we use in order to gain knowledge whilst maintaining the privacy of all data and being able to respond to real world needs are insights which is something such as 27% of people under 30 go to London on Monday at 7am and that insight generated from anonymous aggregated data extrapolated from the population Upon these insights, we are basing our technologies that help with decision making In any other case where a personal data point was used it would only be used by the owner of this data point We would never make a service or technology that was not based on insights here at LUCA With this being said, in the world of data and Big Data life is changing and evolving and this is accelerating more each day We are are now faced with many challenges We are faced with the challenge of GDPR which obliges all companies in Europe to put more emphasis on data protection policies And we will have it here by May 2018 We are very close to it And everyone responsible for data have had to work very hard during this year to ensure that all of our sistems and technologies are adequate for the new laws. And furthermore, we are focussed on the arrival of PIMS where it is required of all companies that their own users have control and access to all the data that the company has on them You would have already seen that some companies have started to take small portals where they can partially revise data Curently the level of granularity is not exactly defined that the data will have or how long since it has been updated But it is something that companies have to be preparing for Of course, within these PIMS we will be faced with the challenge of data portability Something that, here at Telefónica, we have already said we will allow a user who leaves the company to take their data with them So when someone decides to leave Telefónica (the worst decision in the world) not only will they take their data, their telephone number but also the data generated by their service In addition to all of this, we find ourselves in a changing market We have the inclusion of Open Data where many data sharing initiatives are appearing where they create technologies from the open data from companies and where many of you are contributing to the sharing of this data and you are obliged to create systems for the publication of Apps to have a secure system for accounting when sending this public data And not only this also that the world of IoT has hatched always generating more data in more corners of the physical world and it is allowing the arrival of new competitors who are challenging our traditional businesses And not only this also our own clients are demanding that we give them more All of this means that if we do not move, if we stay at a standstill we will lose competitivity And at the moment at the heart of this competitivity is Big Data okay then We have to move towards a world where we make decisions based on data Making decisions based on intuition has been good There have been great visionaries who have made decisions using intuition and also we have had for many years companies doing what they know, using experience for business But this is becomming more and more complicated as we are entering a time when decisions are made in real time based on data We have IoT generating real time data on a massive scale raw data that needs to be understood and analysed We have Big Data technologies which already allow the stocking up of the data that is being generated We also have cloud comupting technologies such as cloud computing, edge computing, fog computing which is allowing us to process all of this data in real time in order to undertsnad them in a useful way and of course automatic learning technologies and technologies that support artificial intelligence such as machine learning or deep learning are getting easier to use, more powerful, better trained and it is possible to incorporate them in all processes This shows how all Big Data technologies are helping the decision making process There are three levels of decision making Firstly, describing the world around us, what is happening within a determined business sphere It is descriptive analytics We are simply narrating what is happening So that experts make the most appropriate decisions most appropriate decisions in terms of having a better vision of the world Secondly, predictive analytics is allowing that Big Data techniques show us in real time assessments of the decisions that we make The famous "What Ifs" What would happen if, like you saw, we were to close Line 5 of the metro? What would happen to the air in Madrid if we suddenly closed of some streets? What would happen to a motorway if it is closed for roadworks for certain hours during the day? All of these hypothesis assessments are giving us predictive analytics And of course, we are taking steps forward We are arriving at a point where Big Data technologies are prescribing our actions What should we do? Technologies are giving us alternatives, They are helping us to create these decisions so that we can use them and make decisions in the most appropriate way And as you can imagine this is the base of the future Artificial intelligence which will become part of our day to day life We started this journey of transforming ourselves not as a company that uses Big Data because as Javier said before we have some years using Big Data technologies but we are still in the first stage, the stage of exploration Using it on fixed projects Years ago we decided that we wanted a more aggressive transformation here at Telefonica that we wanted to be a data-centric company It is said that to have data at the heart of a company does not make the company seem like a data business but rather as a company that can use them and better manage resources in order to better manage our services And at the same time, being data-centric means that decisions are made based on data what we call "data-driven" Last year we said this was our work This year, as it is an anniversary, a special date I want to share how we approached this internally within Telefonica to make the transformation, to become data-centric Here is our strategy that can e seen here on the powerpoint When we speak about our companies we are talking about companies that already undertake business It is not a blank page where you would have to be an architect of Big Data to build it It is not an empty system that you can build up from nothing We have many years of history, we have many clients, we have services in production and the change has to be achieved without affecting any of them This is the true challenge The true challenge that we, a company that is 94 years old with an enormous amount of technologies of all types as we were born in an analogue world and this was challenging Also we have the characteristic that we have presence in many countries and we are the product of acquisitions we have not grown together But instead, most of the time in terms of acquisitions of other telecomunication companies we have allowed ourselves to have presence in other countries Like Vivo in Brazil, in Spain, UK, Germany, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Nicaragua In loads of corners of the world and when we had to face the questions "how are we going to achieve the change in becoming a data-driven company" "How are we going to ensure that data is made available" and we have to understand how they work We realised that we had to build a common interface or a common language for data Common semantics throughout the whole Telefonica Group Internally we call this URM It is one of our projects It is the Unified Reference Model of data within Telefonica And what we are doing is move all of our data systems to a big data environment From application-centric environments to a Big Data environment This data is translated to URM, our data model And doing this involves all teams removing their daily work routine and move data And if we realise that there is no incentive to do this the company would not need to move We have to make sure that the company sees positives in all areas from the movement of data to URM at the same time as them receiving a benefit and if we happen to work with this that we call the "Joyas" (jewels) Which is nothing more than offering tools thats extract the best of Big Data Tools using machine learning, deep learning that are very easy to use it is not an R Algorythm or a script in Python We are talking about end-to-end with interfaces and graphics which can be managed by any user which can be used by our colleagues in marketing, business, sales etc. And they are always maximizing the potential of Big Data technologies They are called the "joyas" and what we do with them is to give them to each of the countries and these "joyas" only speak in URM In this way we have added incentive for our colleagues to move It is not easy and I am sure that you in your companies have similar situations, you have crucial applications that you cannot use you will have databases that you cannot access you will have budgetary limitations But if you don't start to walk in a decisive direction, you will never reach where you are trying to get to In our case, in the case of LUCA when we started to think about how can we help our clients with this phase of transformation? It occured to us that a good idea would be to work with this model of "joyas" extracting the maximum from Big Data technologies extracting the maximum from Machine Learning, descriptive analytics, prescriptive analytics, predictive analytics in order to create these small "joyas" that our clients can use as a way to catalyze the transformation And in this session, Álvaro and myself will talk on 4 of them some that started as an initial idea and today they are a reality and they are working and we have developed many of them directly with you Firstly there is LUCA Comms We will speak about our first idea about a year ago It was one of the things we saw clearly had to be done Communications are part of our ADN And we saw in what way we were able to offer the best to our communications Extracting from them the greatest benefit from Big Data Technologies Here, we are working with many clients including Iberdrola I would like to express gratitude for for all of the work done by the Iberdrola teams Challenging us to make the product better And where we are using the power of Big Data to get the most from communications And so Álvaro it is your time with lots of care and caution to show the demonstration As Chema said, let's go back ti the information that we generate using our services We will see how the project is structured At first, from our services and client needs Each company will have personalized models The first model we will look at quickly it is a summary, a descriptive analysis as Chema mentioned of communications It is a summary based on the type of communication that we choose but we have a more detailed view on this window We can see from the yearly evolution the organization showed by these lines etc. But here we can also put in more intelligence and extract a future prediction (of a few weeks) This allows us to see if current usuage is too high and we can raise a hand and say this appears strange Also these algorithms allows us to extract use patterns from the lines which allows us to choose specific tarifs If we choose a tariff with more data or more minutes depending on user needs Looking at specific countries it is important to understand how communication between different offices work In the case of Iberdrola, where they have offices in many countries And also they have presence in other countries where they do not have a main office So it is also important to look at the volume of communication and if this is also related to the final volume in these countries where they do business We can go one level deeper, and see how the company works on a departmental level We have all of the departments in the company and we can see the total number of calls made And if we click here, we can see how different departments communicate between eachother We use this to understand the company as well as to find points of improvement If we click here on the sales department, we see that they receive lots of calls but We would have to see if this makes sense For companies like Telefonica with their 1004 service A customer service number for Telefonica we can monitor the number calls received each day and also see if the base is well structured But we go deeper as we can know where the calls we receive are coming from what demographic, what country, what city, if it is a company or a private number and also in this case, some details about their lives If they are partners, if they have children etc. We also use this to create marketing campaigns focused on the needs of our clients but also if they call for any problem, the response can be more aimed towards their needs And the last model that we want to show you is focused on companies that have a wifi network for example a hotel group that has a wifi network that allows clients to connect and another for their workers We can monitor the use of these networks to see if we are over the limit that we have set and to see why and to see if we are inflating the network and if we could be saving money or on the contrary if we need more network capacity This information is a little superficial We also have a summary on the main page All of the most important messages are marked And also as Chema mentioned at the start, we offer recommendations The product is intelligently undertakin some prescriptive analytics and it is giving us some recommendations of things we can do in order to improve operation very good This is the first service of the products that we wanted to comment on What we are trying to do is help to better understand our clients and how they use our services in this case, communications whether it is mobile calls, fixed line calls, use of wifi communications and ultimately what we are offering is better decision making that saves money that better plans the time when systems are burnt out and old that detect resources that are employed and are not put into use that are capable to detect "lineas muertas" that are capable of detecting non-appropriate uses of communications etc. The second product that we would like to comment on is LUCA Verify This case is something very individual It is a product where we wanted to give the user control over their data In this case, for the contracting of mobile lines we are allowing users to manage this information and make use of it And at the same time, if the users wants to use it we are making it so that digital advancements are much easier when you interact with companies through the internet In this case what we are doing is giving our users their data that we have delivered by the contracting of services as we are a regulated company, we are obliged to take data in a secure way from our clients Every time we sign a contract, we have to verify the information a specific telephone number, and who requested it And what we do is make them available to you so that at any time when you want to use them on an online service to make life easier, you can do so In this case the service is LUCA Verify and companies can use it in order to offer the user the possability so that they can decide if they want to use the data for example at the time when they want to register for a service or to fill out a form And here we are going to see how it works in a bank We will see online so that you can see the principal features here is the video  We will show a demo of registering on a banking app using the LUCA Verify service In order to complete registration normally the client writes their telephone number name and surname we press continue and using LUCA Verify we can confirm that that the given mobile phone number is the one given by client originally when the telephone number has been verified in a secure way on the mobile network The registration is completed in an instant secure way Let's watch the same LUCA Verify demo, but this time let's compare it to the experience of a traditional client let's go We are going to time how long it takes to complete each registration and we will see which one is the winner In just a few seconds, using LUCA Verify Jim is authenticated through his mobile phone and can enter his bank account We already have a winner Whereas on the left we see a normal registration Where a passcode has been sent to Jim's phone through SMS and afterwards he has to enter the passcode manually in the registration process The passcode is verified and Jim is registered But the experience has clearly been much slower This shows that with LUCA Verify we improve the customer experience maintaining at all times the security With LUCA Verify, you can have the best of both worlds LUCA Verify is faster more secure allows smooth registration and works both on mobile web and in apps  What we were doing, as you saw is using our authentication technology on the network connected device in order to make the user experience more easier when registering And as you saw it is quicker, safer and gives the user control over their data and the experience is better for everyone it directly implies that there is a boost in business Because as you know With more time, which always implicates an extra step we see a fall in the number of clients The third product that we will speak about is LUCA Fleet In this case, we have chosen within the world of IoT Afterwards you will see various examples that we have been working on But in the IoT world, the possibilities are almost infinite Telefonica is a company that has a large part of its business in IoT communications And we have been working with parts of these industries That already trust in Telefonica for IoT communications to take them further In this case we are going to speak about LUCA Fleet It is a product where we have been helping Different transportation companies, in this case we are going to speak about Hertz as we have been working with the automobile company It's your turn Álvaro to show the presentation and demo As Chema mentioned, the demo we will show is with a vehicle-hire company As you know, when we hire a car it will have a connected device That will be monitoring us, It will send our position, speed, if we are wearing a seatbelt, if we make sharp turns etc lots of info Up until now, this information has been used in an individual way The case study is; if a client was to steal the car then where is it? Here, what we want to do is aggregate all of the information in order to extract the value After having everything aggregated Right now we only have a descriptive model that I will show you With the information But we are developing one on driving behavior and another on fuel consumption Below we have a display that shows this last month for this company and the current state Now I'll enter the first model We are showing the aggregated information from all of the users for the most used roads and hotspots as well as our client's offices and points of interest Which could be monuments, beaches, garages etc. The idea of this is to give a view on what points are commonly passed by our clients To see whether offices are well located and on larger routes we have to keep an eye out for any breakdowns to avoid a situation where clients are stranded we have a series of filters with which we can refine the search For example the Airport in Cancun To be able to see the traffic at these offices The final idea is that if lots of clients pass or stop at A specific petrol station brand or a hotel group They could try to do business with them Another thing that is very important for a company of this type Is to understand what happens when the cars are not available because they are out of order Because they are in transit between offices for example And the idea is also to understand if we need a garage and there is not one close by We can find one instead of crossing Mexico This second demo is one of the most important and we are applying many algorithms in order to detect when a vehicle is in an unavailable condition We can use filters to understand how long vehicles at determined offices or days are unavailable And also to understand if we can reduce this time For example in the case of a garage we can find one closer But also during analysis we realised that some times unavailability cannot be explained We would have to see if it is a type of fraud etc. that could be reduced  Let's go back to the presentation In this case we applied descriptive analysis to provide support to the decisions of experts who are understanding things sold by their business understand why things are not available understand why people use longer routes to garages To detect situations of fraud Or that cars are going to a certain garage as there is an agreement with the garage that is unknown to those in charge of the fleet etc. We are using descriptive analysis in the IoT world This is helping to understand the client What is their business, how can more be known from the extracted information We are applying loads of IoT industries And we already have trials with other companies in the energy sector where we are using the IoT world in order to better understand energy consumptiion within their plants and to improve consumption, efficient management of all resources etc. The last of the "joyas" or demos of innovation products That we have worked on this year are all to do with location We understand the location of the devices connected to our network simply because they are connected to our antennas that are distributed across our coverage areas From the user's data-enriched information We generate insights and we can use these insights in order to help with the decision making process With this, we can respond to all types of questions But in particular those who look at smart cities or infrastructures to understand what would happen or how a given anomolous situation in infrastructure would affect the other citizens In this case we will see a demonstration with Álvaro We will also show a demo of AURA And we will launch the application speaking about AURA Show the traffic in Manchester "Now showing the information on current traffic in Manchester" This is AURA As Chema mentioned, we see what users are connected to our networks and this is shown here From this we can see whether our users are in a car or metro etc. The demo is for Manchester and the surrounding motorways And until now at LUCA Transit what we have done is use historic data in order to understand flows and movements on the motorways This is what we have done until now we have the differrent motorways that enter and leave Manchester And we have the average time that people take to get from one point to another If we click on one, we see just the individual route For example in this case we have a peak at 7 for entering the city and in the evening in the level drops somewhat This is what we had until now but the final goal is real time We want to know what is happening right now We will refresh to take the most recent data, its one hour earlier in London So we can see all of the events that we are seeing in the bottom section And you can see the current situation, not only aggregated historic data You know on the radio in the morning they say let's look at the traffic report but what happenbs is that we don't only want to stay here we might concentrate on motorways but we don't only want to stay here we have information on these users We can compare where they live and where they work We have the origin and destination of the route and we can concentrate on one of the motorways And understand where the motorway users are coming from And in this way, it can help us with decision making as mentioned at the start And if we close this motorway what group of users will be most affected by their profile From the other public transport options, what can we use to substitute the route What timings are best for closure, as we know when there are more or less people and with this we make decisions our idea is to use more intelligence in making decisions on projects Chema, do you want to add anything? To finish, in this case what we are doing is using insights using anonymous, aggregated data extrapolated from the whole population We are able to generate insights and we use them to help the decision making process for infrastructures Not only do we have the descriptive analysis but also we help to predict outcomes from decisions We are using predictive analytic techniques to help the decision making process This is most important when we are speaking about Smart Digits and infrastructures that affect the lives of citizens In this session we wanted to show you the most innovative part that we are working on What are the products that will shortly be in your hands What we are doing here at LUCA And throughout the session you saw some of our client's products and them working in the real world Also one of our clients will be here on the stage to explain their experiences But I would like to finish with a message for those in the digital transformation stage at their companies And the message is that Sometimes it is not easy Sometimes it is very complicated, and I´ll share my hardships What were my problems in building this strategy Allowing me to help with the transformation here at Telefonica But I always saw it as a journey I love the technology in Tron, the film Everyone has seen the original Tron, if not please leave the room I love the technology in Tron where the protagonists are computer programmers And their creator or God was the programmers who wrote the programms within their CPU And from here is where my journey with technology started Firstly, with my friend, opening my firtss company "Informatica 64 SL" And here you can see the logo, any see a similarity with Tron? You don't see it right? And the truth is that from "Informatica 64 SL" which went really well, it was an incredible journey within a small company We started with 2 friends and finished with 50 and when I arrived at Telefonica and the opportunity to incorporate us into the process We saw this as a continuation of the journey Firstly the journey included Talentum to attract engineers to Telefonica Attract people with talent in the digital, technological world And it was a journey where I am now wnjoying other things With the cybersecurity part of Elevenpaths, with LUCA and the world of Big Data and the 4th platform which is our internal transformation Or with AURA, the artificial intelligence that we are building and will be put into production in 6 countries at the start of the year In the end, things are not easy nothing is easy If you hope that, when making a digital transformation, everything is prepared for you that everyone is aligned That everyone wants to do what you want to do and that everyone understands what you want to do You will never find the moment, because this will not happen so, despite it being dificult in the world of technology the most entertaining this is that you enjoy the path of transformation step by step And now I will leave you with the CEO of LUCA, Elena who has spent the last year at LUCA And she is in love with what she does Many thanks
