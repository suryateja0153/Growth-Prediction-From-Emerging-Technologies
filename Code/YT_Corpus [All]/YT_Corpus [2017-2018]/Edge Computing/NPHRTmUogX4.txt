 I work in the EAVI research group in computing at Goldsmiths and this is a device called the Haptic Wave which we've developed with audio engineers with visual impairments and it allows them to feel the audio waveforms when editing music There is a lot of people when editing audio whether they are visually impaired or not don't want to have to look at the screen and this sort of frees you up and you can take that information through your hand this allows you to move from left to right through the song from the beginning to the end and as it moves through the fader will move up and down so when it's down at the bottom you have a silence and when it's up at the top it's when there's a peak in the volume so someone can hold this and just move through a recording and find all the loud and quiet parts very quickly we have only just started to scratch the surface of what haptics can do in this case it's telling you when a sounds too loud but it could also tell you whether a vocalist is in tune and you could feel the tuning of the vocalist and sort of adjusted it with your finger and kind of different ways of interacting I think would be interesting to explore technology's always been a part of how I make music anyway but a lot of people see technology and creativity as being two quite separate things it's really good to be in a place where they just bound up together and it's often the most exciting way to start learning about and engaging with technology, through making fun things with it
