 so what is the unified access gateway it's a platform that provides secure ed services and access to defined resources that reside in the internal network typically this is done to allow external users to access internal locate resources in a secure manner usually unified access gateways are deployed in the DMZ to provide this functionality unified access gateway runs on a hardened versions of SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 and is currently undergoing Phipps and Common Criteria certification it is intended as a replacement for older gateway solutions such as the horizon security server the AirWatch stand-alone tunnel or the content gateway stand-alone installer the unified access gateway can be used for multiple use cases including providing secure remote access to Horizon desktops and applications you might want to do reverse proxying of web servers or services such as the VMware Identity Manager (aka VMware Workspace ONE Access) service it can also do ear watching workspace one pair up tunnels or tunnel proxies that's usually done to load mobile applications to securely access internal services or servers and it can also run the content gateway service which allows content Locker access to internal file sharers or share port SharePoint repositories you can mix run and run multiple services on the same unified access gateway appliance or you might want to separate them out depending on which type of architecture you're trying to achieve or on the scale of the environment but we'll cover those use cases in a bit more detail to enhance security options the unified access gate we also Robards many integration options for authentication such as smart card certificate sam'l pass-through radius or RSA SecurID with this architecture it allows the unauthenticated traffic to be kept in the DMZ at the and then traffic is only allowed through to the internal network once the authentication process has been successful so as a sample of the architecture we run one or more unified unified access Isis gateways in our DMZ and I can rent run multiple edge services they might be provided in reverse proxy into something like VMware Identity Manager (aka VMware Workspace ONE Access) or secure edge services into my horizon connection servers or it might also be running a service name such as the VMware tunnel or the content gateway and so again providing multiple aid services into my internal resources so first let's look at horizon so we've had an edge service for many years called the security server and this is seen as a direct replacement for it key advantage over the security server is we've removed the need for a one-to-one mapping with internal connection servers so the old architecture of security servers used to need a one-to-one mapping one security server mapped up to one internal connection server and they don't say that that architecture was that internal connection server then needed to be set into tunnel mode so it was no longer appropriate to use that connection server for my internal users so I ended up with two sets of connection servers one for my internal users one for my external users and paired with those security servers unified access gateway removes that demand and need for the architecture completely I can now run one set of connection servers no tooling required the unified access gateway is not paired up one set will then address my internal users and my external users coming through my unified access gateway so we mentioned unified access gateways caused a lot of authentication options so in this manner we can provide a stronger security stance instead of passing it through an authenticated traffic to my connection servers we can know how the unified access gateways process that and then only when the authentication process is successful well we've passed through to the case in servers with all the enhancements in horizon we've driven a lot of benefits into the protocol Blastoise dream to use this externally and to get the best enhancements using the UDP at protocol and the ueg is really required the new UDP stack that we've developed is built into the unified access gateway appliances and so only using this you're gonna get the benefits security server unfortunately does not have that new UDP stack as we mentioned it is a hard appliance is running Susy Linux at 12 so again it's a lot more secure to put that into your DMZ than the older security server which was windows-based terms of deployment you're going to deploy one or more unified access key trees into your external facing DMZ and then have them forward all the traffic to your internal load balancer that stands in front of your connection servers so they use that as a target and essentially you can think of the unified access gateways acting like a client to the connection servers and you notice we can also have a mismatch the internal connection servers don't need to match up to your number your UE GS and if you will then need to scale either side we can just halt them independently another use case for unified access gateway is to provide reverse proxying services for internal web servers now a reverse proxy is a type of proxy server that retrieves resources on behalf of the client from the internal server these resources are then returned to the client as if they originated from the web server this allows a level of abstraction and control and we're really anonymizing securing those internal web servers with the reverse proxy sitting entirely in between them unified access gateway can be used as either a plain reverse proxy or it can also perform authentication in that chain as well with reverse proxying we also have the ability to do what we call identity bridging this allows us to give access into Lexi applications that might be using Kerberos authentication and use a more modern authentication method over an external connection so one of the methods we can do here is sam'l authentication where we're at entik ating / sam'l and the unified access gate we will basically convert that into Kerberos authentication allow access into the web application alternatively we can also support certificate authentication into the unified access gateway and we'll convert that again into a Karass authentication allow access into that web server the benefits here are we're protecting that internal web servers using Kerberos identification we don't have to expose the KDC onto the internet and we're providing a unified and single way of authentication we also know allow the ability to run the VM or tunnel on a unified access gateway and this removes the need to do a separate server install to provide access into internal applications this allows us to run the Parra tunnel to low mobile applications access into internal resources and also the tunnel proxy another mobile use case is ability to get access to internal file sharers sharePort sharepoint repositories and bulk shares etc and the AirWatch solution that allows us to do this is a Content Locker to get access those resources we need to run the content gateway on a server somewhere and prior to unified access gate we needed a separate installer and a separate server to host this we can now run the content gateway as a service on the unified access gateway
