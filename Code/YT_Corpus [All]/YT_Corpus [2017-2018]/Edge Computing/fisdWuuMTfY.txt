 from the Computer History Museum in the heart of Silicon Valley diss the queues covering food IT spork to farm brought to you by Western Digital hey welcome back everybody Jeff Rick here with the cube we're at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View California at the food iishe Oh about 350 people from academia Doozer somebody came all the way from New Zealand for this show - a lot of tech big companies and startups talking about applying IT - food everything from AG to consumption to your home kitchen - what do you do with the scraps that we all throw away we're excited now to get to the big brain segment we've got our PhDs on here we're excited to have dr. Glenda keema Stan she's the vp agriculture and natural resources for the university of california welcome and also dr. Helene Dillard she's the Dean of the College of Agricultural and environmental sciences at UC Davis welcome thank you so first off we're talking a little bit before we turn the cameras on neither have you been to this event before just kind of your impressions of the event in general I love seeing the mix of the folks here that you were saying in your intro there there's quite a diverse array of people and I personally believe that's what's really going to help us find solutions moving forward that that cross-pollination and I've enjoyed it just seeing all the different people that are here but then the interaction with the audience was very uniquely done and I just think that's a real big positive right for the show so you guys are on a panel earlier today and I thought one of the really interesting topics that came up on that panel was what is good tech know everybody wants at all but unfortunately there's no free lunch right something we all learned as kids there's always a trade-off and so people want perfect organic this free that free cage-free at the same time they want it to look beautiful the economical and deliver to their door and Amazon Prime within two hours so it's interesting when we think of the trade-offs that we have to make in the food industry to kind of hit all these pieces or can we hit all these pieces or how to get prioritized well I think for us it's going to be a balance and trying to figure out how do you how do you provide the need for all these different audiences and all the different things that they want and I don't think one farmer can do it for all these different groups that have different demands on what they're looking for and some of the trade-offs could be as we go away from pesticides and some other things we might have more blemishes and those are still edible pieces of fruit and vegetables it's just that maybe it's curly maybe the carrots not straight you know maybe it's forked but it's still very edible and so I think that we have to do a lot more to help educate consumers help people understand that it doesn't have to look perfect to be a give you perfect nutrition right right yeah Helene is absolutely right some of it's just education but some of it's also us finding the new technology that is acceptable to the public you know part of the problem is we sometimes have researchers working on their own trying to find the best solution to a problem and we're not we're not socializing that with the public as we're moving forward so then all of a sudden here's some new type of technology and they're like where did this come from what does it mean to me do I need to worry about it and that's one reason we talked earlier on the panel too about the need to really engage more of our citizens in the scientific process itself right and really start dealing with that scientific illiteracy that's out there because there's a lot of talk about transparency in the conversation earlier today about what is transparency because you always think about the people complaining about genetically modified foods well what is genetically modified all you have to do is look at the picture of the first Apple ever and it was a tiny little nasty little thing that nobody would want to use compared to what we see at the grocery store today well a different type of genetic modification but still you know you don't plant the ugly one and you plant the ones that are bigger and have more fruit guess what the next round has more fruit so it doesn't like a big education problem it is then yet for the average human being out there all you have to do is look at a chihuahua next to a st. Bernard none of that was done with the genetically modified technology right and yet people just they forget that we've been doing this for thousands of years literally right now you talked about going to the vine earlier on in the panel what is the vine what's the vinyl well it's brand new it's still getting rolled out in fact we announced it today it's the Verde innovation network or entrepreneurship you know you got to think of the club to get that acronym in there which comes first the chicken or the egg basically it's our attempt from University of California to catalyze regional innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystems part of what's driving that is we've got a fairly good amount of resources scattered around the state even in some of our rural areas on small business development centers our community colleges our County Cooperative Extension offices and a host of other resources including lately the last several years incubators accelerators makers last but they don't talk to each other they don't work together so we're trying to go in region by region and catalyze a coalition so that we can make sure that our innovators our inventors out there are able to go from idea to commercialization with all the support they need be it you know just basic legal advice on do should they be patenting something right access to people to discuss finances access to people that can help them with business plan opportunities to partner with the University and joint research projects whatever it takes make sure that for anybody in California they can access that type of support that's interesting is obviously it hot and it's Stanford not far from here you know a lot of the technology success companies come out of a kind of an entrepreneurial spin with a business focus grad and and often the tech grad in the tech world and you know kind of stuff at Berkeley on that yeah this is only over in our area right right you're in a large urban area or you're near a major campus you've probably got access to most of that if you're in agriculture natural resources and particular are more remote rural communities you typically have access or very little right right so biggest question Helene so Yura Davis right obviously known as one of the top agricultural focus school certainly in the UC system if not in the world I mean how is the role of academic institutions evolving in this space as we move forward I would say it's evolving in that we're getting more entrepreneurship on campus so professors are being encouraged to look at what they're working on and see if there's patent potential for this and also we have a group on UC Davis campus called innovation access but looking at how can they access this population of people with money and you know the startups to help them bring their thing to market right so that's becoming that's a very different campus than years ago I think the other thing is we're also encouraging our students to look at innovation and so we have a competition called the Big Bang and students participate in that they do hackathons they do all these kinds of things that we only tend to think that only the adults are doing those but now the students are doing them as well right and so we're trying to push that entrepreneur spirit out into all of all of our campus everyone on the campus it is and I do want to emphasize that this isn't just for our students or our faculty one of the key focuses of the vine is all of our external partners don't just the farmers the landowners the average citizens were working with out there if they've got a great idea we'd like to help them break and what's nice about tech is you know tech is a vehicle that you can't change the world without having a big company and I would imagine in an Ag is kind of big big AG rolled up a lot of the small or mid-sized things the pride isn't feel like there was an opportunity that you can have a huge impact but as we know sitting across the street from Google that via software and technology you can have a huge impact far beyond kind of the size and scope of your company so I start imagine this is a theme that you guys are playing off of pretty aggressively absolutely and I think there are people on campus that are looking for small farm answers in mechanization as well as large farm answers we have people that are working overseas in developing countries with really really small farm answers right and then we have people that are working with the Driscoll's and partnering up with some of these other big companies we talked a little bit before we went on air about kind of the challenges of the academic institutions in terms of resources and scale these are big complicated problems I mean obviously water this kind of the elephant in the room at this conference it's not being talked about specifically I think they've had other water shows and you know just drive up and down the valley by Colonel Walker Merced and you see the big signs you know we want the water for the farms not for the for the salmon in the stream so weird environmental impact so these are these are big hairy problems these are not simple solution so it does take a lot of kind of systems approach to think through what are the trade-offs again there's no free lunch it really does take a systems approach and that's one thing here in California we're doing some very innovative work on a great example that both UC Davis my division and other parts of the UC system are working on is Central Valley AG plus food and beverage manufacturing consortium which is 28 counties the Central Valley and up into the Sierra and what's exciting about it is it is taking that holistic approach it's looking at bringing around the table the folks from research and development workforce trained workforce adequate infrastructure financing access to capital supply chain infrastructure and having them actually work together to design what's needed and leverage each other's resources and I think that offers a lot of possibilities moving forward group and I would say that at least in our college and and I would call the whole UC Davis there's a lot of integration of that agriculture environmental space so we've been working with the rice farmers on wind could you flood the the rice field so that there's landing places for the migrating birds because this is the Pacific Flyway and how can we grow baby Salman it's in that rice water and and then put them back in the bay and they figured out a way to do that and so and have it actually be like a fish hatchery right only even better because we're not feeding them little tiny pellets they're actually eating real food whole foods so and how is kind of evolution change we see it again this is no different than any place else from kind of the old full school intuition the way we've always done it versus really more of a data-driven scientific approach where people are starting to realize there's a lot of data out there we've got all this cool technology with the sensors and cloud and edge computing and drones and you know a whole lot of ways to collect data in ways that we couldn't do before to analyze it in ways that we couldn't do before to start to change behavior be more data driven as opposed to combination to intuition driven I would say what we're seeing is that as this data starts to come in precision gets better and so now that we understand that this corner of the field needs more water than the other side we don't have to flood the whole thing all at once you can start on the dry side and work over to the other side so I think that the precision is getting much much better and so with that precision comes water efficiency chemical efficiencies so to me it's just getting better every every time and frankly we're just at the beginning of that right you know we're just starting to really use drones extensively to gather that type of data new ways of using satellite imagery new ways of using soil sensors but one of the problems one of the big challenges we have back to infrastructure is in many parts of your agricultural areas access to the Internet you know that pipeline broadband if you've got thousands of sensors zapping information back and forth you people fill up that pipeline pretty fast right it becomes a problem at the soft underbelly of cloud right yeah the Nexus yeah exactly all right well we're out of time unfortunately we want to give you the last word you know for people that aren't as familiar with the space new to it myself included now what would you like to share with people that kind of raise their awareness of what's happening with technology and agriculture well I guess I would start off by saying that not to be afraid of it and to look at the technology that has come remember when we had the rotary dial phone you know my son doesn't even know what that is why we say dial Oman and well why do you say dial so I think you know looking at your rotary foam and now looking at your smartphone which has more computing power than your first Macintosh did you know so it's just the world is changing and why do we expect agriculture to stay in the 1800's mindset it's moving - and it's growing - and it's getting better just like that iPhone that you have in your hand I think I would add to that back to the citizen science I would love people out there anybody average citizen general to know that there's opportunities for them to engage if they're concerned about the science or the technology come work with us we have week we have over 20,000 volunteers in our programs right now we will happily take more and they'll have a chance to see up close and personal that what this technology is and what it can do for them all right well that's great advice we're going to leave it there and dr. Houston dr. Diller thank you for taking a few minutes out of your day thank you thank you all right I'm just Rick you're watching the cube we're at the Computer History Museum food IT learning all about the IT transformation in the agriculture industry also to the kitchen your kitchen the kitchen to the local restaurant and all the stuff that happens with those scraps that we throw at the end of the day thanks for watching we'll be right back after the stroke break
