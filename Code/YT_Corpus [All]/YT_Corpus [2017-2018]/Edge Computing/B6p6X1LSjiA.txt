 from Santa Clara California it's the q's covering the open networking summit 2017 brought to you by the Linux Foundation hey welcome back everybody Jeff Rick here with the cube we're in santa clara at the open networking summit 2017 we haven't been here for a couple years obviously open is everywhere it's in Hardware it's in compute its in-store and it's certainly in in networking as well and we're excited to be a joint first off by Scott renovage will be co-hosting for next couple of days good to see you again Scott and our next guest is Ahab Taurasi he's the EVP and CTO of Equinix last time we saw it yet was that the compute project last year so great to see you again yeah thank you very much chef good good to be here I always I really enjoyed the interview last year okay thanks for having 99-cent the tie bar so hopefully they're gonna pull it off again we don't do it all right so first offer folks that are familiar with equinix give them kind of a kind of an overview cuz you you don't have quite the profile of Amazon and Google to the other cloud providers but you're pretty important piece of the infrastructure yeah absolutely while we don't with no work close to the size of those players in our play the place we play in the in the universe is very significant we are the edge of the cloud I would say we enable all these players they're all our biggest customers as well as all the networks our biggest customers we have over 2,000 clouds in our data centers and over 1,400 networks we have one of the largest global data center networks we have 150 data centers and 40 markets around the world and that number is going to get a little bigger now we announced the acquisition of verizon data center assets so we'll have more data centers and few more markets that's what i heard about the verizon acquisition so congratulations just adding more infrastructure but let's unpack it a little bit yeah two two things i want to dig into one as you said you have clouds in your data centers so what do you mean by that yeah the way the cloud architecture is is is is deployed is that the big cloud providers will have these big data centers where they build them themselves and it hosts the applications and then they would put an edge for the cloud either caching edge or compute edge or even a network edge in data centers like ours where they could act to all the enterprise customers and all the networks so we have a significant number of edges we have 21 markets or so around the world where we have just about all the big list of names edges that you can connect to automatically okay from AWS Google Microsoft salesforce com or call anybody else you think of so this is kind of an extension of what we heard back a long time ago with you guys and like Amazon specifically on this direct connect you are the edge between somebody else's data center and these giant cloud provider absolutely and since the last time we talked we've added a lot more density more edge nodes and more markets and more new cloud providers or everywhere from the SAS to the infrastructure as a service providers and why should customers care what's the benefit to your customers for that yeah the benefit is really significant these guys want direct access to the cloud for high performance and security so everybody wants to build a hybrid cloud now it's very clear the hybrid cloud is architecture choice you want to go private cloud then you want to deploy in a data center and connect to the cloud and the second thing that's happening nobody's using just one cloud everybody's doing a multi cloud so if you want 40 50 clouds like most companies do most CIOs then you're going to want to be in a data center that has as many as possible if you're going to go global connect to multi-cloud and have that proximity you can have a hard time finding somebody like equinix out there okay yeah I got a question I there was a Trent you mentioned the verizon deal there was a trend for a while where all these big service providers were buying data centers yep and including ATT CenturyLink and now the trend appears to have reverse tell they're selling the data centers that they bought okay I love your insight on that why that just wasn't their core competency why are they selling them back to people like equinix yeah that's a good question what's what's happened over time as the cloud materialized is the data centers are much more valuable if the neutral if you can come in and connect to all the clouds and all the networks and customers are much more likely to come in and therefore if a data center is owned by a single network customers are not as likely to want to use it because they want to use all the networks and all the clouds and our model of neutrality and how we set up exchanges and how we provide interconnection and the whole way we do customer service is the kind of things people are looking for so you're like you're the Switzerland of the cloud yeah and so the same assets become much more valuable in this new model right it almost people understand quite how much kind of direct connection and peer-to-peer and how much of that's going on especially in a this is the business context to provide a much better experience versus you know the wild Willy internet up back in the days of old where you're hopping all over the place lord knows how many hops are taken a lot of that's really been been locked yeah I I think the most important step people can think about is by 2020 ninety percent of all the internet or eight at least eighty to ninety will be home to the top ten clouds therefore the days of j wild internet while that continues to be significant the cloud access and inter connection is very critical and continues to be even bigger so then yeah well so i tell us what the logistics are managing the growth like you opening how many data centers a year and how much equipment are you moving into these data centers and yeah we we manage a we spend over a billion dollars a year on on upgrading adding capacity and building new data centers we usually announce 56 new ones a year who usually have 20-plus projects if not more active at any time so we have a very focused process and people across the globe will manage this thing we don't want to go dark in any of our key metros like a washington DC the DC market or or let's say San Jose Silicon Valley etc because customers want to come in and continue to add and continue to bring people and that means not only expanding the existing data centers but buying land and building more data centers beside it and continue to expand what we need to and then every year or so we go into one or two more emerging markets you know like going we went into to buy a while ago and we continue to develop at and those kind those become long-term investments to continue to build our our global infrastructure the last few years we made massive acquisitions between Telus city in Europe bit Island Japan and now the verizon assets that expanded our footprint significantly into new markets Eastern Europe give us bigger market in places like Tokyo which helped us be get to what we are today right one of the one of the themes in networking and cloud in general is that the speed of light is too damn slow yeah you know through at the end of the day stuffs got to travel and it actually takes longer than then you would think yeah so does having all these increased presence increase Gio's increase physical locations help you address some of that because you've got so many more points come in into this private network if you will oh yeah absolutely that the content has become more and more localized by market and the more you have things like IOT and devices pulling in more data not all the data needs to go all over the globe and also there is now jurisdiction and laws that acquire some of the content to stay so the market approach that we have is becoming the center of mass but where the data is sides and once the data gets into our data center the value of the data is how you exchange it with other pieces of information and increasingly how you make immediate decisions on it you know with automation and machine learning gray so when you go to that environment you need massive capacity very low latency too many many data warehouses or data lakes and you want to connect that to the to the software that can make decisions so that's how we see the world is evolving now mm-hmm what one thing we see though is that complementing that would be a new edge that will form a lot of people in this conference we're talking about that a lot of the discussion about the open networks here is how we support the 5g all the explosion of devices and what we see that connecting to that dense market approach that we have what the data is housed yeah yeah that's interesting you just mentioned all the devices which was going to be my next question so they the Internet of Things how will this change the edge of the data the data center edge is you refer to it yeah that's that's the biggest question in the industry especially for networks and the same discussion happened at Mobile World Congress here you know low while ago people now believe that there'll be this compute edge and the network will be a compute edge because you want to be able to put compete keep pushing it out all the way to that right and that edge needs to support today's technologies but also all the open wireless spectrum all the low power networks open our which is one of the frequencies for the millimeter frequencies and also the 5g as you know so when you add all that up you're going to need this edge that supports all these different wireless options plus have some amount of compute and that problem is very hard to solve without an open source model which is where a lot of people are here looking for solutions it's interesting because your definition of the edges feels like it's kind of closer to the cloud where there's a lot of conversation we do a lot of stuff with GE you know about the edge which is you know right out there on the device and the sensor because as you said depending on the application depending on the optimization depending on what you're trying to do the device is some level of compute and store you know it's going to be done locally and some of it will go you know upstream and get your process and come downstream but you're talking about a different edge or you kind of see you guys extending all the way down to that edge I think of the world we don't see how it sounds extending at this time but definitely it's something with spending a lot of time analyzing to see what happens I would I would I would say a couple of big stats is that today our edge is maybe a hundred milliseconds from devices in a market or a lot less in some cases the new technology will make that even shorter so with the new technology like you said you can't beat the speed of light right but with more direct connections you'll get to 40 50 milliseconds which is fantastic for the vast majority of applications people want right it will be very few applications that need much lower latency all the way down to the sub 10 millisecond for those somebody like a network would need to put compute at the edge to do some of it so that that world of both types will continue but even the ones that use that need the very low latency for some of the data it still needs to compare it to other sources of data and connect to clouds and networks with some of the data will still come back to our data centers so I think this time we see the world evolving but it's early days right and a lot of pain power will be spent on that yes so as you look forward to 2017 what are some of the big items on your plate that you're trying to take down for this calendar year yeah I the biggest thing I want on our list is that we haven't we have an explosion of software model everybody who was a hardware is now has a software platform when we were at ocp for example you saw netapp it should software as an open-source every single company from security storage even networking are now creating the platform available as a software well those platforms have no place to go today they have no deployment model so one of the things that we are working on is how we create a deployment model for this as a service model and most of them is open source so some of it needs a decoupling of software and hardware so we are really actively working with all these player to create an open source software and and just software in general ecosystem Plus this whole open source hardware so you guys have a pretty aggressive software division inside of equities especially in these open source projects or how do you know that we love is our our our model is to enable the industry so we have we have some of our tools but mostly for enabling customers and customer service okay as well as some of the basic inter Connection we do the vast majority of all this stuff is our partners right and these are our customers so our model is to enable them and to connect them to everybody else I needed echo system to succeed and help them set up as a service model and as the enterprise customers come to our data center how do they connect to them so I would say that's a one of the most sought-after missions when we go to conferences like this is everybody who announced today is talking to us about how they enable the announcements they make and it given our place in the universe you know we would be a very key player and enabling that ecosystem do you have like a special lab where you test these new technologies or how do you do that yeah that's the plan and we we connect by this effort to also what we're doing with ocp and telecom infrastructure project where we have a leadership position and highly engaged we are we are key 8 a lab environment where people can come in and test not only the hardware from tip and ocp but also the software from from open open network but many other open source software in general under the next linux foundation or others and in our in our situation not only can they test it against each other but they can test the performance against the entire world how does this work with the internet with the cloud and that will debt leading us to deployment and go-to-market models that people are looking for all right that sounds pretty exciting equinix a company that probably handles more your internet traffic did you ever thought that's pretty true ha right well thanks again for a for stopping by will look for you at our next open source show thank you very much alright very much thank you hob Taurasi from Equinix he's got ready I'm chef Ricky you're watching the cube from open networking summer 2017 see you next time after the short break
