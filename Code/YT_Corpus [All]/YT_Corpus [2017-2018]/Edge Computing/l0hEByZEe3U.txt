 hello this is Jeffrey T for tiller back with another service management leadership video we thank you for joining us on our YouTube channel hope you'll look around some of our other videos we're in the sixth video and a series on cloud computing how do we learn more about it and this is the series adapted from a salesforce.com article and if you go any thing about salesforce.com it is a cloud company so it has everything to gain by promoting the use of cloud technologies but I want to talk about insight insight is something that cloud computing offers that maybe you don't have in your traditional data center environment but it would be helpful to you in insight if we think of an item view we have data we've been if it's enriched its information and knowledge and then wisdom this insight that we can gain from these professionals in a cloud computing environment may help us work our way towards that wisdom because many times we have so much data so much information we don't know how they leverage it and I want to share one story that this salesforce.com article uses and it has to do with the beverage company Sunny Delight for those of you in the u.s. you know what that is it's a sugary drink it's a fake orange juice if you will kids love it because it's high in sugar parents don't like it because it's high in sugar but for those of you not in the u.s. it's basically a beverage that's supposed to look like it tastes like orange juice it's just sugared we'll hundred for the most part I don't want to get in trouble by anybody but that's a parent's point of view but sunny delight for Sunny D is some people called on its brand was able to increase profits by about two million a year and cut a hundred ninety five thousand from its staffing costs through cloud-based business insights let's talk about how that could be done maybe through their cloud they see hey we don't need all of the staff we normally have because you know in the cloud we don't have to worry about maintaining servers or or patching all that other stuff but also it allows us to track our shipments track our inventories things of that way that nature in a more efficient effective manner and so when we look at insights from the cloud it could be utilization of our servers and our memory it could be our storage it could be anything but we are transferring knowledge to the we're transferring workloads to the cloud in hopes of taking advantage of their economies of scale their knowledge all that fun stuff this is jeffrey t / tiller thank you for joining us on our youtube channel please like or share this video subscribe to our channel leave me feedback below I'd love to hear from you I appreciate you connect with me on LinkedIn hope you have a great great day it's great hearing from you in any capacity bye you
