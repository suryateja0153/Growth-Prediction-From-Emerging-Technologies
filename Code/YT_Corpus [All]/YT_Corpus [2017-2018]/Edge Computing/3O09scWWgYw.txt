 from the Fairmont Hotel in the heart of Silicon Valley gets accused covering when IOT met AI the intelligence of things brought to you by Western Digital hey welcome back everybody Jeff Rick here with the cube we're in San Jose California the Fairmont FL at the when I a team at AI show it's all about the intelligence of things a lot of really interesting startups here you know we're still so early days and most of the technology and facial recognition gets a lot of play iris recognition got to get rid of these stupid password we're really exciting our next guest these lotar allow e he is a CEO and founder of iris and it says here what are the you guys are as a face analytics and emotion recognition first off welcome thank you thank you so much for having me so face analytics I'm a clear customer I love going to clear the airport I put my two fingers down I think they had my iris they have two different things but space what's special about the face compared to some of these other kind of biometric options of people so yeah we go beyond just the biometrics we do pretty much the entire suite so face analytics anything from I open at age gender emotion recognition headphones gaze estimation etc etc so it is pretty much anything in everything you can derived from the face including non-verbal clues yawn and head nods head shake etc that is a huge range of think so clearly just a face recognition to know that I am me probably relatively straightforward a couple of anchor points is everything measure up and match the prior but emotion that's a whole different thing only are there lots of different emotions but the way I express my emotion might be different than the way you express the very same emotion right everybody is a different smile so how do you start to figure out the algorithm to sort through this right so you're right there are some nuances between cultures ages genders and ethnicities and things like that generally that being universalized for the last Brina has decades by just Connors as the psychologist etc so what they actually have had a consensus on is that there are only seven or six Universal emotions but on April right so another six joy surprise anger disgust fear sadness and neutral okay and everything is some derivation of that you can break kind of put everything in that is correct so save them as the seventy seven Universal colors we have in primary colors okay and then everything else is a derivative of that providing the other ten is up you know emotions are hardwired into our brain they have been in a you know fifteenth or twenty fifth of a second particularly micro expression and they can generally give up a lot of information as clearly their person has suppressed a certain emotion or not or whether they are thinking about something negatively before they can respond positively etc okay so now you got the data you know how I'm feeling what are you doing with it it must tie back to all types of different applications I would set right there a number of applications initially when we created this what we call enabling technology we wanted to focus on two things one is what type of application can have the biggest impact but also the quickest adoption in terms of audience today we focus on driver monitoring AI as well as artificial entering AI to be closest most economists the semi autonomous vehicle and the second application is social robotics but in absence if you think that the car we hold for another robot that social robotics are Joe's potentially AI engine or even you know AI engines in a form of an actual robot that communicates with humans therefore the word social right right so I can see a kind of a semi autonomous vehicle or even a non autonomous vehicle you want to know if I'm dozing off and some of those things have been around it's in a basic form for a little while but what about in an autonomous vehicle is impacted by my emotion the is really a passenger right not necessarily a driver if it's a 11-5 that's right so when we talk about autonomous vehicle I think what you're referring to is level five economy where a vehicle does not actually have a steering wheel or that old or anything like that and we don't foresee that those will be on a road or at least another ten years or more the focus today is on level two or three and four and xmi economies even for autonomous fully autonomous vehicles you would see them come out with vision sensors or vision AI inside the vehicle so that these sensors could together with the software that can analyze everything that has been inside cater to the services towards what what is going to be like the ridership economy right once the car drives itself autonomously the focus shifts from the driver to the occupant as a matter of fact if the occupants that would be right in in these vehicles or applying them or sharing them not the driver and therefore all of these services will revolve around who is inside the vehicle by age gender emotion activity etcetera interesting so of all these things age gender emotion activity what what is the most important do you think in terms of your business and kind of where as you say you could have a big impact we can group them into two categories the first one is safety obviously I open it headphone blinking yawning and all of these things are most important especially for focus on a driver at this point but then there is a number of applications that relates to comfort and personalization and so those could potentially take advantage of the emotions and directly analytics okay look like so that where are you guys iris of the company word yes we have some installations I assume out there you still early days kind of where you in terms of the development of the company oh we have a quite a quick quick it's quite some mature product what I can disclose is we have plans to go into mass production starting 2018 some plans for q4 2017 has been pushed down so we'll probably start seeing some of those and you want you to 2018 okay we made some announcements earlier this year at CES with Toyota and Honda but then we'll be seeing some matte volume starting 2019 and beyond okay I assume your cloud-based solution we do have that as well but they are particularly a local processing solution oh you are out of line yet so think of it as an edge computing psychophysics okay and then do you work with other people's sensors and existing systems or you bore but kind of a software component that plugs in or you provide like the whole system in terms of the I assume cameras so it's a water source company only okay we however our Hardware processor camera agnostic and of course everything for everything to succeed it would there will have to be some components of sensor fusion right and therefore we can work and do work with other sensors companies in order to provide higher confidence level of all the analytics that we provide pretty exciting so you're not so that is it commercially available to UGA now are not quite yet will be commercially available you'll start seeing on the road or on the market sometime early next year so if there are my next year all right we'll look forward to it very good very exciting time thank you all right he's bode are Alawi and he's going to be paying attention to use make sure you're paying attention to the roads you know fall asleep in doze off and go to sleep so I'm Jeff Rick you're watching the cube when IOT met AI the intelligence of thing San Jose California we'll be right back under this real great thanks for watching ah
