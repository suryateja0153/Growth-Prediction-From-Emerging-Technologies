 live from Las Vegas it's the cube covering VMworld 2017 brought to you by VMware and its ecosystem partners welcome back I'm Stu Mittleman joined by Keith Townsend happening welcome back to the program a multi-time Cuba law and Patrick Osbourne who's the senior director of product management with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Patrick great to see you great to be back thanks for having me yeah what number vmworld is this for you oh gosh it's it's I can't count it at this point to now yeah it's like I've been working with VMware for 15 years it's the eighth one of these for me Keitha III know you've been yeah so what you take so far the show you know big ecosystem you know a lot of news going on what do you think so yeah so I mean from my perspective VMware has been such a huge ecosystem partner for HPE for forever you know it covers everything from you know from perspective on the compute networking storage side certainly services so you know for me it's always good to catch up with you know old colleagues and kind of understand what's going on in the industry a lot of talk today around private cloud multi-cloud you know what people are doing around automation you know certainly a lot of things around software-defined offer to find networks offer and find storage so a lot of good topics it's always good to see the customers here too as well yeah that the joke a few years ago was VM world became storage world you know in your space of availability and data protection you know on a walk through the show floor yeah you know HP's got a big booth but I see a lot of companies that are attacking different angles that you brought up cloud being sure you know increasing peace what's top of mind for customers that are coming to you and what sort of things were you working on these days yes so from our perspective on the storage and data management landscape I think that you see a lot of vendors in the space right now some of them are you know certainly part of our ecosystem you see folks like veem and you know other folks that we partner with out on the floor there is an increased look from the customer perspective on availability it's the segment's changing the requirements are changing I don't think people are tackling availability is in the same way with sort of traditional data protection architectures so we see customers especially when they're looking for certain inflection points and their infrastructure like I'm gonna go to all flash or you know deploy some new storage they're definitely rethinking the way they're doing availability from an application standpoint so we're we're trying to you know meet those market demands through our own technologies as well as having a pretty robust ecosystem here that we partner with so a lot of talk not just at this show but it previews HPE shows about hybrid I team it is obvious the data center isn't going anywhere for the majority of covers but we have the complexity of cloud how does cloud impact practically data protection data availability yeah so from our perspective it's certainly an opportunity right to help customers out we have we've you know from a strategy standpoint we've put a couple solutions and things in the market that we hope address some of the use cases so you know when you talk about nimble cloud volumes right being able to have your data in a co-located facility very close to you know public cloud so you can do some compute arbitrage and ultimately be able to you know control your data and then we do other things for example store ones cloud bank being able to backup to the cloud which is a pretty established use case I think for for from our perspective helping customers make that move in terms of you know you can set up the data path and make the bits move but when we talk to midsize especially large enterprise customers the governance around that I think is really important in the in the user experience to make sure that what you're sending out to the cloud is certainly protected it's audited we even have customers coming to us we just had a big customer that you've had on here before 21st Century Fox right a big customer of HPE talked last week about I want to backup workloads that are in the cloud to the cloud right there's not a lot of great tools for that today and I want that audited I want you know a paper trail around that for their own internal you know capabilities so I think there's a lot of opportunities in the space it's very nascent you know Patrick I think you bring up a great point we were talking a lot of this show kind of a multi cloud world yeah I've got my maturation of what's happening my data center to plain bunch of sass I'm on one or multiple public clouds and there's certain things like security or you know data protection and availability I need to get my arms around all of it HPE s looking to fill some of those you know gaps and help customers you know what's the overriding story and you know how you're not you know one of the big three public cloud providers sure why why does HP have a position in this discussion and maybe you can help us kind of round out that story a little yes so I mean we have a position in that discussion because of you know we are a very large infrastructure provider to a lot of customers right in terms of providing on-prem hybrid IT experiences you know we from from a public cloud perspective you know you don't were you know very sort of public in our strategy of not having a public cloud within HP but we certainly partner with folks and we've got a very long-standing partnership with Microsoft we you know come to market with you know things like Azure stack and we have a number of integrations we do with things like nimble and in that area we resell you know asher from from from an HPE standpoint so we're really looking to provide you know a full experience for customers in that space and you know the end of the day we you know like you said before people are still going to buy and deploy in their data center right but they want to buy and deploy in their data center with the thought that you know multi-cloud is going to be a possibility and they want to have infrastructure that's going to allow them to do that so what we're doing is incrementally in our product portfolio I care about storage right is to be able to provide those experiences I buy a 3-part all-flash I want to be able to tear that or back that up to the cloud I have nimble right I want to be able to replicate that to a co-located provider that provides nimble cloud volumes and then assign compute to it from the cloud right so a bunch of things that we want to get customers ready for and make it easier for them so can we talk a little bit more about that nimble story yeah you know the three we understand it is a covers a great death of use cases in enterprise what does nimble fit in the strategy yeah so we are super excited to have a nimble in the portfolio for three reasons they have they have a great team number one they bring a really good go to market engine and the sales team you know with that and they have great products so from from the product angle which we're very interested in is a couple different areas info site predictive analytics right it's something that we want to apply to our entire product line hands down so the things that they do around VM vision right with with VMware we want to apply that the three par right and you know essentially give people the simplicity that it takes to manage a you know a very large virtualized environment they have a lot of things that they've done that are very unique I mentioned nimble cloud volumes before that's a use case for primary storage but can easily be extended to backup data protection object storage right as as a as not only just a technology provider but as a way to price it and consume that type of storage and then you know they also bring a number of things around the in the availability space which we find is very interesting secondary flash right so you think all flash as high performance maybe a higher cost rate but certainly is gonna help you with that application acceleration they've just we just released the nimble secondary flash array for workloads that are test dev cloned workloads you know things you can automate and that you need some performance on it but it's more performance than your backup storage not as much cost and not as much storage as your primary so think about secondary flash is flash for secondary workloads very cost optimized more performant and maybe a little bit more expensive than your backup to your so there's a lot of things that they bring to the table from a technology standpoint that we want to take advantage of Patrick HPE got a broad portfolio but still to meet all the needs of the customers especially in like the virtualization ecosystem quire's a lot of partnerships yep where are kind the deep integrations that your team's been doing where are the places where customers been asking you to kind of pull things in any any solutions that you want to highlight specifically yeah so I think more and more what you start to see is portfolio vendors like HPE they bring great technology that we build you know organically or that we go and acquire I think one of the big things that customers rely on us as well that doesn't get a lot of airplay is that we bringing a vetted ecosystem to a customer you know so the whole kit and kaboodle from compute networking and storage services to bring that all together and an ecosystem that's supported and you know we basically put the HPE stamp of you know quality and support behind that so you know when it comes to VMware obviously this has a huge ecosystem so we do a lot with you know innovating with VMware I mentioned nimble VM vision things were doing there to make hypervisor environments you know quite a bit more easy to implement for customers from a storage angle you talked to Jesse you know from from the simplicity standpoint we do a lot around data protection with certain things with 3par and nimble so there's a lot of integrations that we do in for VMware specifically and then in other areas of the portfolio especially automation right so we've got fully supported solutions I think we got one of the best docker implementations for storage with nimble huge partnerships with puppet and kubernetes and chef all these great things around the automation side so when we go out and partner somebody you know we're gonna go provide a whole solution a complete solution to a customer that's vetted Ras supported so for a month from my perspective you know partnering is actually one of the most important things we do at HPE so from a customer's perspective HPE hugely important key industry player for most CIOs you guys are still very very trusted in that year you have a huge ecosystem huge portfolio what should CIO CTO [Music] high level architects be focused on at this point what's like the the consistent theme that you're telling your customers you really need to pay attention to this part of the industry so I mean if from a corporate perspective we've got a couple of things that we're that we're working on right so we you know we talk about hybrid IT right and that sort of transformation from you know I will call it established methodologies of application at development to you know sort of a new style and we're definitely helping customers along along that along that journey and a lot of it is around bringing to get this vetted portfolio and ecosystem along with the services so the services I think is one thing that you know HP is very unique in the fact that we've got a very very broad set of services in terms of you know we can go and help CIOs and and CFOs and and CTOs understand you know where are you along that journey right all the way to implementation I think one of the things that we're gonna be very very focused on over the next couple of years is providing everything in our portfolio as consumption based pricing right so all the things that you like about the cloud right the things that are implied there our elasticity right agility consumption base right moving from a capex to an OP X model making that more predictable so we want to be able to model that and provide those experiences definitely one of the things that were really focused on HPE is is IOT and in the edge right so that's that's a very fundamental part of our business that we're going to be looking at to make a lot of investments in big data certainly some of the assets around edge line in Aruba and all the implications around security for that so those are those are some some of the key areas that we are you know where we talk to CIOs every day about that Patrick from from an availability and data protection standpoint yeah what is something like IOT mean I I have to think we're not gonna store all the data Sheriff it's gonna be just processed at the edge we're talking a lot about edge so I'm curious what are the things that you're looking at maybe start there I think about like you know containers or a lot of times gonna be something that yeah at that kind maybe even serverless at the edge so you know I seem to think back you know when we talked about like oh we're gonna go to object store and therefore the way I do everything changes share though you know what what are we gonna you know a couple years from now is this guy a very different discussion or well I think yeah it's I think it's a it's a it's an interesting topic right when you talk about that volume of data right and the fact that it's very dispersed right being able to do apply traditional availability techniques or something like that is it's it's difficult it's next to impossible right so you know what we see is customers buying in these type of ecosystems you're not buying along horizontal lines right you're not buying a you know specific server vendor or a networking vendor or you know a storage vendor and then going best to breed and trying to integrate that yourself a lot of these things are vertically oriented now in terms of you're buying a stack you know from from a portfolio vendor or or going to a service you know an integrator and I think with the volume of data that it takes to to do some of these implementations so we we have very large customers autonomous cars you know big big implementations of Hadoop and analytics I mean a lot of that stuff is built in I think one of things you're starting to see is that that those type of deployments are outstripping or outpacing they're you know running away from the support of the traditional IT folks so we have customers that are operationalizing very large a doob custer's for example who don't have methodologies for backing that up and replicate it so i think there's a lot of technology that needs to catch up with some of these implementations we see it all the time so you know I think there's different techniques from a technology standpoint you know when we try to approach these from a customer perspective we want to provide a full stack for fore-edge IOT and but you know from a data protection availability standpoint so that's a difficult problem solved all right well Patrick Osbourne always a pleasure to catch up yeah thanks for all the updates here looking forward to tracking some of those you know emerging areas that you were doing yeah we look forward to talking to you guys in discover in Madrid absolutely so the cube so many events check out Silicon angle or actually the cube net is where you're going to be able to see everything nice shorter URL you know keep the branding in the cube for Keith Townsend on Stu minimun stay with us lots more coverage here still to come VMworld 2017 you're watching the cube [Music]
