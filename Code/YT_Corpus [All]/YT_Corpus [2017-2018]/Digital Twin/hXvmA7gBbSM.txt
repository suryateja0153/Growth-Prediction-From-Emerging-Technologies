 [Music] our next presenter from McDermott international you know McDermott is a leading provider of integrated engineering procurement construction and installation services for offshore and subsea field developments operating in 20 countries worldwide they deliver fixed and floating production facilities pipelines and subsea systems from concept to commissioning and they help oil companies safely produce and transport hydrocarbons so joining us today from McDermott is vice incon vice president of global engineering for seam is going to share with us how they're using the platform as the single source of truth to transform their business and disrupt the industry so Vicey welcome to the stage ah here we go thank you thank you so much for being with us thank you so I'm gonna start with a mere culpa a confession and an admission of guilt the oil and gas industry doesn't really like change we're not into this digital stuff this transformation industry 4.0 the cloud and so on what we believe in is what we invent ourselves because enough let's be honest about it all of you sitting in this room you don't have very much to offer us I mean we've been around we've been producing all for 150 years we'll probably produce it for another 150 years so good morning ladies and gentlemen my name is Vicente I am the global head of engineering in McDermott we've already introduced McDermott so we've been around 94 years so why the heck do we need to change 94 years is a long time how many of the people in this room have are working in companies which have been around a hundred years that's one two three see why do we need to change we're brilliant we do everything right so then one day we realized in McDermott that the industry does need to change the days of a hundred and forty dollar oil is well and truly gone oil is at fifty five sixty today with renewables coming online with cars in Europe becoming more and more focused on electrical rather than petrol engines we do need to change and what we need to do is bring a sustainable transformation in the cost structure of the upstream oil and gas industry we need to adapt the technologies that all of you have the automative the aerospace to healthcare in the retail and the way we have chosen to do it is to design all of our facilities around a digital twin a digital twin is a digital representation and manifestation of the actual physical facility so it looks like the physical facility but more than that it has all the tributes of the physical facility and how we are doing it is we're taking all of our normal authoring tools what you see on the top the tools we use the software we use to design our structure to design compressors to design control systems all of those we will use in an integrated manner but the real difference what we're trying to bring to the industry is to use these tools as a feed in into a PLN now most of you know is a PLM as a product lifecycle management tool but we renamed it and we're lucky because project also starts with a P so it has now become for us a project lifecycle management tool a PLM typically is used when you build to stock we build everything bespoke but we believe that using the deso systems 3d experience platform and remember we've been building platforms for 95 years it's just that our made originally of wood now of Steel but using the data systems platform we are bringing all data into one single place and we are then using that data the information to improve our work processes to the extent that we can deliver facilities faster we can deliver them with fewer mistakes and we can deliver them at a lower cost what we do is produce within the Tasso system a new way of doing engineering so the data systems the 3d experience platform our digital twin allows all of the users access to the same information database so the project manager the project engineer the mechanical engineer the clients consultants everyone is looking at the same information user interface the information they may see may differ on the screen but the source of information is the same the single source of truth which we believe is absolutely essential if we are to achieve efficiencies in the industry within the platform we can measure progress we can measure we can see where all the data where all the Meishan is and i think which is really a game change in which data systems is probably more advanced than any of the peer group in the industry is the ability to visualize our brains are tuned to work in 3d we we can understand things when we see a 3d picture a real-life picture when we look at an Excel spreadsheet we look at a document a Word document for us to be able to construct an image it's very difficult put all that information in a 3d platform put all that information and a digital model give someone some fancy glasses and you can visualize how liquids are flowing through a pipe you can visualize how data is being generated from a compressor a typical offshore facility has in excess of a hundred and fifty thousand tags so a hundred and fifty thousand distinct pieces of equipment how we have built our digital twin and we our user the collaboration between McDermott and data systems so how we have built it is that everything for us is tag centric so we generate a tag as a piece of pipe it can be a pump it can be an instrument and then we associate with that tag all of the information you will ever need for the life of that tag so you can have during the design stage the progress of manufacturing for the tag you can have design data for the tag you can know where that piece of material is is it in transit is it at the warehouse is it in the yard about to be fabricated again everything is sitting in one single place one thing that the PLM s do very well is part management one thing that the oil and gas does very poorly is part management we have a yard in jabulani which at the beginning of last year had well over seven million dollars of surplus material pipes flanges cables because how do we manage materials when think changes we normally tend to forget to cancel the previous order and we go ahead and order some more and then when we order some more we order more than we need and for the next project we order some more again so what happens in five years we've got surplus material which we sell for ten cents on the dollar so there's your obvious savings if you can manage your parts like parts are managed in the aerospace industry in the automotive industry in retail if you can manage parts like Amazon managed its but it's good what they all sell us we could save millions of dollars in the industry and the park management is not just management of the physical part it's management of the documents related to that part so with that talk with associated documents its management of changes related to the part and if the part is used on one project we can use it on another project we can actually physically see the part there's a 3d simple rendering of that part on the same screen and that we're looking at we know where the part is we know the design documents for the part we know the expediter assigned to make sure the part gets delivered on time we have all the inspection data for of the part we know what welding electrodes are needed to put the part on the platform single source of truth the change we want to bring in the industry is what I tell my younger engineers is we want to change the principle of working on a rectangular table to working on a circular table so rather than having the client sitting on one side of the table and we sit on the other side of the table and you know early part of my career in a company I worked in in a country I worked in neither of which will be mentioned I was told that tables are designed so you can't reach across and grab the other person we want to change that relationship to a round table and the way you change that relationship is to ensure transparency and what the system that is being developed with Daiso systems does is give you that transparency because not not only do our our procurement our management have access to the single source of truth but so does the owner or the owner's consultant the regulatory bodies or anybody associated with that project so the dashboard that is created is pulling information from the same database that dashboard can be visualized differently the client may wish to see the visualization at a very high level but the client has the ability because we are ensuring full transparency in the system the client has the ability of going into the system and formatting that dashboard to see the information that the client that he or she wants to see so if the client wants to know what is the progress of the project Tuesday morning they don't have to come to us and say can you tell us the progress Tuesday morning and they don't have to worry are we actually telling them the truth are we hiding information because they can do that from the same database the same single source of truth that has been generated for the project we are pulling in into the system p6 Primavera data primer River is the planning tool that is the most commonly used in not only in our industry in the upstream oil and gas but in most industries so we're pulling in that data we're pulling in risk dashboards so we may use our pet or various risk management software all of that information is coming in and the system that's been created allows communication rather than sending emails you associate an issue with a tag so let's say I've got a query on the metallurgy of a seal or metallicy of a bearing on the pump so rather than sending an email I associate a query with that tag was the pump and I send out a request for information or I send out a query the client the the supplier will then respond to that query so I've created a chain of communication but it's associated with the tag for all times to come so five years later if you want to know why someone did what they did you know so transparency is key to what we're doing and transparency we believe breeds collaboration because once you are in a transparent operating environment once you have changed your rectangular table to the round table you will collaborate the system will force you to collaborate you will have real-time data live data coming in you know what the status of each piece of equipment is so when an expediter goes to a supplier shop to do an expediting to do an inspection he or she will upload that information in real time on to the digital twin and that information through the digital twin is immediately available to everybody so it's available to the client it's available to the project manager it's available for the CEO if he or she chooses to look at the information so two keywords collaboration and transparency going further so we've been talking about the use of the 3d digital twin the 3d experience digital twin during the project phase but I think we want to go beyond that because when we do an offshore project or a subsea project we typically spend a million man-hours of effort sometimes more complex projects you know up to 20 million man-hours of effort to design to procure and to supervise the building I'm not including the man-hours related to the actual fabrication so million hours of effort after that million hours of effort what have we done we have given you hopefully a well-designed and well operating facility a physical facility we have given you a digital twin of that facility a normal digital twin is a static digital twin not the digital trail we want to do with the 3d experience platform and we've given you a container load of documentation the facility will hopefully operate for the next 3040 years it will produce the new profit profit profit for the client for many years to come the digital twin 90% of the case will never be updated it big it'll be static on the day it was handed over so it's like a photograph in black and white which over time will fade and you'll forget about it remember we've just caught a million hours of effort into building that digital twin and the container load of documents they will become food for rats fungus will grow on them and eventually you'll throw them away and when you want information you're going to have to go to a plant operator who's been on that facility for 20 years who has the information in his bottom right drawer and when that plant operator retires the information retires with him so what we want to do is change that and there's three key changes we want to bring to the industry one is to create a true digital twin not the digital twin that we hear about you know and just a picture a 3d picture of the facility but a true digital twin a true digital twin is a single source of truth all information all data or documents anything that you will ever have needed used consumed will be in that digital twin the processes we use and these are processes in terms of how you run the plant need to be optimized using the platform again we will we believe we can do we can either design or use third-party applications to optimize these facilities so can I run my compressor at a lower rpm consume less fuel and still get the same output so if I can simulate that using artificial intelligence using data which is sitting in the digital twin I can increase the or lower the effects cost and increase the year ability of a consumer and people um I love people I'm part of that group but when you take people offshore you are putting people in harm's way and frankly it's very expensive in the North Sea it costs upwards of a million euros per person per year and a typical operator in an eight-hour shift or a 12-hour shift depending on which facility he or she is on is actually doing two to three hours of I don't want to call it useful work but of work which requires that person to actually do something and the other six or eight hours are spent looking at the screen waiting for something to happen what we want to do is give enough automation using again in our world the 3d big layered 3d model the 3d digital twin will allow you to automate processes so using the three digital twin you will have enough confidence to take people who are sitting offshore and move them on shore not only do we save money but we have them doing more useful work and we are letting the intelligence of people feeding into the artificial intelligence systems the third area we're looking at is use of robotics and these are not robots you'll see on television with arms and legs these are basically very simple devices which can do the sort of things that people are doing as routine inspections on offshore platforms or in subsea facilities all of this is why because we now understand all of us in this room is that the oil price the price for gas is down and it'll stay down the world is going to start consuming less oil as time goes on even with the development of countries like India and China marginally less gas gas probably has longer to run than oil does but we understand that the we are the industry demands more efficiencies more productivity and it demands a lowering a sustainable lowering of costs and we believe that putting these putting a true digital twin in will achieve that but to go to go further what we need to do is to use what we are doing at the design stage and carry it over into the operations phase so we see the 3d experience platform as being our enabler to efficiently operate efficiently maintain offshore and subsea facilities we believe that using digital technologies which are available today were not inventing anything but using digital technologies which are available today the operators can lower their op X and their capex for brownfield by 10 to 15% and these numbers are not our numbers these are numbers from Gartner which is an IT consultancy which has done surveys over the last two years of how to lower operating costs we believe that the 3d experience platform is unique in the industry in its ability to do this we went through a very extensive sourcing process until we settled on the 3d experience platform we have and we see in it not only the actual platform but all of the applications that are used with the platform so ladies and gentlemen in conclusion we're not different we are the same as everyone else in the room we aren't unique and we have to learn from all of you in this room we have to learn from the industry to bring the sort of efficiencies that Amazon has brought to retail that GE has brought to aerospace that Tesla is now bringing to the electrical vehicles all of that technology all of that efficiency we need to bring to our industry and we believe that the 3d experience platform is going to help us in a long way to get there thank you ladies and gentlemen [Applause] [Music]
