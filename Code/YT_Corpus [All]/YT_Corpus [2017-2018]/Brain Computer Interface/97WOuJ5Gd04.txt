 A brain to machine interface is a system that allows a brain to directly communicate with a robot or computer A necessary part of a brain to machine interface is an external eeg, or For a more advanced connection a brain implant. The computer or robot controlled by a brain to machine interface can be very local Such as a computerized prosthetic arm or extremely distant. Experiments to date have included paralyzed individuals controlling robot arms and typing on computer screens with their thoughts And even featured rat neurons piloting flight simulators Communication does not need to be only in the direction of brain to machine Information sent from machine to brain has already been used to create sensations of touch In theory brain to machine interfaces open up the possibility of avatar technology Not simply controlling an external limb or a computer screen, but controlling an entire artificial view Allowing you to be effectively in two places at the same time But for long distance travel Be warned it might be a bit disorienting as you experience an eight minute delay between your thoughts on Earth and your avatars movements on Mars Would you want to explore paris with a robotic avatar while your biological body lounged on the couch? Or take a nice hike while you mentally controlled your work computer Watch where you're going! Even if you are in two places at once your attention might not be. More modestly maybe you just want to change the TV channel without searching for the remote? What would you want to do with the brain to machine? That looks delicious!
