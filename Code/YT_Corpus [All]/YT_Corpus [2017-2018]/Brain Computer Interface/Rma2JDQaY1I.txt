 In a Stanford-led research report, three participants with movement impairment controlled an onscreen cursor simply by imagining their own hand movements. The clinical research has demonstrated that a brain-to-computer hookup can enable people with paralysis to type via direct brain control at the highest speeds and accuracy levels reported to date. The study participants with severe limb weakness had one or two baby-aspirin-sized electrode arrays placed in their brains to record signals from the motor cortex, a region controlling muscle movement. These signals were transmitted to a computer via a cable and translated by algorithms into point-and-click commands guiding a cursor to characters on an onscreen keyboard. One participant was able to type 39 correct characters per minute, equivalent to about eight words per minute.
