 greetings this videos for the clinic project brain computer interface controlling the IOT IOT refers to the interconnection of computing devices embedded in everyday objects via the Internet enabling them to send and receive data the issue at hand was individuals that suffer from paralysis that due to their condition have difficulty completing simple tasks like turning on a lamp or cooking food because of this we created an interface that even people that can use their limbs are able to control using only their eye movement for this project we used an emotive EEG headset EEG refers to using small electrodes attached to the scalp to record the electrical activity of the users brain each electrode monitors a region of neurons or node this is an electrode map of the headset the emotive software provided us with the electrodes we were interested in we row 1 and O 2 the O stands for occipital lobe the brain region in question this is because we used VSS EP visual steady-state evoked potential a phenomenon that occurs in the occipital lobe when the user focuses on a flashing light source the frequency at which the light flashes is mirrored in the occipital lobe here's an example of that in video so by measuring the brain activity in the region and performing a Fourier transform on the signal data we are able to determine the frequency of the light source the user was looking at this is an example of the initial graphing we did the user was staring at an 11 Hertz light source which was the frequency we obtained building on this principle we created a webpage with 4 flickering lights at different frequencies the controls that allow the user to maneuver through the icons representing rooms and devices within these rooms the user is able to control these devices and toggle them on and off here's a video demonstration our algorithm determines if the user is looking at the button by three criteria if the peak frequency occurred at the same frequency for five seconds straight if the peak frequency had a magnitude at least four times the average of the other frequencies for five seconds straight and if it occurred at one of the four frequencies of the buttons once a peak is detected the website index is updated and a signal is sent out to an IOT device if necessary an index was used to simultaneously change the website on all devices so users can switch on the fly on any device that has access to Internet and a browser the this basic web site can be expanded to control any number of devices so here we will see soon see the light turn on because the user is looking at the select button the user was looking before at the left button so it switched to a different device or different lamp so in a bit the user will turn on the device just by looking at the select button there we go we concluded that our goal was definitely feasible but wasn't consistent enough for practical use for the future ideally we would have access to a more accurate headset as it did have some inconsistencies on a day to day basis and we would also like to conduct tests on more subjects to get feedback for actual usability instead of just functionality I hope this video was informative we would like to thank dr. paula car for his continued support throughout the semester
