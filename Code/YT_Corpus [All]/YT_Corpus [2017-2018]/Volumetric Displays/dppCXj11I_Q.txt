 so thank NE for introduction I'm sure and in this talk I will introduce glass free DIY 3d display that can now you can easily build at home and it can make an object appears as if it were right in front of you so this is how it looks from the best perspective and this is the whole setup our work is inspired by YouTube videos showing how to achieve similar effects with those pyramid reflectors these are often referred to as the Pepper's Ghost illusion so back into the 19th century Professor John Henry pepper he managed to put a ghost on top of the stage and the ghost can move can act and it's really cool so the trick was the actor or the actress is actually underneath the stage and it was its reflection that's on top of the stage so that's also why our work is called the peppers cone these peppers goals the illusion with those pyramid factors are surprisingly compelling however they only support up to four several points and introduce distortions one view from the wrong perspective and so basically it looks very plainer and it's not really apart from these DIY three displays there are also many other display 3d display prototypes from the lab settings these are all very cool and creative work I just listen feel hear and with those 3d displays you can really visualize 3d objects in 3d and you can do cool stuff like head conferencing and Sarah however typically they are large complicated and expensive wouldn't be cool if we can create 3d illusion but with simple available materials and you can do it at home and that's our goal here we seek to provide glass free 3d illusion while maintaining a DIY setup our setup requires only an iPad a thin plastic sheet that costs about like a couple of dollars some tape and the nickel here's how it works so we start with placing the cone and the center of the iPad suppose this is the image you want to show if you just show this regular image on the iPad screen its reflection will appear distorted so some sort of distortion calibration is required therefore what you can do is you can first pre distort the image so that its reflection appear on distorted one view through our display so how should we do the pre Distortion let's consider a single pixel from the iPad a ray from it got reflected and reaches the eye if we consider the eye as a camera and taking some picture then what we want to know is the mapping from the iPad image to the camera image to capture this mapping we use the method similar to the environment manual technique so this is the display we placed an iPhone at desired eye location and we capture and we captured a sequence of green magenta stripes using a knife using the iPhone and this is the iPad so the video has some problem but this is the I've I've had this is the iPhone capturing it this is a reflector and it captures the reflection this is a sample image from the iPhone the green and the magenta stripes here as service binary code so zero and ones and after you play a sequence of them each iPad pixel is assigned a unique binary code and if you look at one camera pic so for example you can decode this binary code and then you can figure out from which I pick so it comes from so in this way we know the mapping and we know how to create your story for one orientation and since the cone is rotational symmetric we can apply the same pre-distortion for all the angles and by using the gyroscope to track rotation we can figure out the correct view from that orientation and we can pre destroy the image and show you on the iPad and what's really important here is that we want the rotation estimation to be to have really low drift and low latency otherwise after several round of rotation the object would drift away or the object will appear to follow you instead of you feel like you are rotating the object and we can also show animated 3d scenes and that audio all the only point so this is this supposed to be my voice saying I'm a virtual assistant I don't know what happened we can also show real object captured with camera and turntable a variety of reflector is possible even something as simple as a plastic cup can work so a comb can work as well as many other reflector shapes so what is the best reflector shape well whether it's a comb or something else if a comb what's the best parameter what's the best angle radius height etc and what's the notion of best how do we define best so to answer this question we analyzed a set of reflectors we focus on rotational symmetry reflectors because we want seamless rotation and we want and it can provide simpler collaboration because the pre distortion can be the same for all the angles and in particular we focus on corner reflectors including ellipsoid cone paraboloid and hyperboloid and we found that different reflector shape can affect people's ability to fuse the images received from the left and right eye so to really understand this we need to introduce a concept called break or parallax when you look at our display this is the left and right images you will see by your left and right eye and ideally corresponding points should lie on the same horizontal line however with curved reflectors it's not necessarily the case and they are typically exist such vertical parallax previous research has shown that when vertical parallax exceeds half a degree for example it's hard to choose so we analyzed the vertical parallax of a cone for instance and so so this is the cone and given the viewing points and the display size we can figure out within which region we can receive reflection and we can compute the vertical parallax within that region the color here indicates the vertical power so blue means good low vertical parallax easy to fuse and red means bad large vertical parallax hard to fuse and typically within the center the virtual parallax small and as it approaches the boundary the vertical parallax is larger and this real black curve here encloses the region where it's vertical parallax is below half a degree so this is the like the feasible region if you want to display an object it's better to for its reflection to appear within this region and or at least it's important part should be within this region so this region is actually indicative of some notion of effective display size because beforehand we do not know whether the object to display is tall or white we use a circle the maximum inscribed circle within this region as the effective display size so here's another reflector which is effective display size and you can see that the size is different for different restrictor shapes so our goal here is to maximize this effective display size and to maximize this circle here um is it okay that restart because somehow the so we also analyze the vertical parallax of other reflector shapes other a conic reflector shapes so now you can see how the effective display size changes as the reflector shape changes so here I just give some examples and with our method and criteria we can figure out what's the best reflector shapes for different configurations so for example for top in 1209 inch iPad pro 51 degree cone is the best there are some limitations of our work the crucial you look crucial a crucial in illusion we want to create is that the object is actually floating inside the reflector so it's very important that our sterols depth perception reinforces that however it's true that our display does not show the depth that you would expect from the object to display but in our paper we should we'll show that your stereo cue to tell you the object is actually inside the reflector so to address this stereo depth perception problem we extended our display with rasayan anaglyph glasses to show the correct binocular images so here we show a red and assign image and the two images are calibrated towards your left and right of right eyes separately although this display can show the correct depth but based on our user study we discover that people still prefer the previous system because of its simplicity convenience and color quality and more interestingly users reported the three deenis they perceive from the system and the previous system is actually very similar another limitation is that the system works the best one view from the best perspective the cab rated perspective but as long as your head is centered horizontally changing the distance to the display or changing the height does not affect the distortion much so you will still see the image on distorted but when you move your hand horizontally you do perceive sound tilting in fact despite the limitations a variety of applications are possible including medicine so doctors can explain to the patients their heart disease by showing the 3d models of their heart in react interactively it can also be used in animation archeology education and product exhibition an extension through our system is adding camera based health tracking if we can do have tracking really well this is the effect you would expect so as mentioned one limitation of our work is that it works the best one view from the camera position but if we can do the habit head tracking like really real time and really good accurate accuracy then you can see the 3d illusion even while moving your head freely and it would be cooler if we can do it we can achieve very low latency low drift while maintaining a simple set up some other some other work can be explored for example interaction like how to scale it for large display as Sarah so our call will be over so soon and a tutorial on how to peel the comb yourself will also be released at the web page if you're you're interested and want to be notified when it will be released you can email me Pepper's comb is a very simple DIY 3d display that you can easily build at home and we really want to spread this experience to everyone so if you're interested in our work we invite you to follow the instructions and feel the peppers calm yourself thank you I think let me just use the mic I think one of the interesting things about this this work in the paper is actually the paper is actually a really nice exposition of a lot of different camera calibration techniques and although I think the the overall effect here is quite simple the the paper actually has a lot of value in how it presents all the different things that come together and so I think actually if you're if you're out there kind of teaching these kinds of concepts I would suggest taking a look at this paper and the fact that you have something that's easily replicable I think as it would be fun for students as well the the interaction part I think is in sort of an obvious one because I see you touching the display and so that's sort of a one thing and then the I wonder if you've thought about how much more complicated would it be to add camera tracking of our person tracking using the built-in front-facing camera if you think that you can actually do that I'm trying to imagine what that image would look like with just the simple materials that you have today just you're not using sort of fancy reflective materials but just the sheet of I guess it's a acrylic plastic yeah so I'm wondering if you would try that and what that sort of looks like I have tried the front-facing camera and I even added a fish eye camera on top of that so some problem with that I still haven't solved this first when the camera is fishing looking up most of the image is cap is occupied by the scene for example so the resolution of the boundary where you can see the face is kind of limited and the head is have very strong distortion so we need to understand that to account for that so it's still possible that it can be done but I'm still expects mentoring with that another possibility is that at the center of the comb you can add a like a simple camera and it has a mirror on top and you face up and it receives the reflection from the surroundings and you can have some faith camera face tracking yeah what is sorry to do I'm honest University what's the largest display size you could create with this technique it really depends on the size of the plastic sheet that you can but the one I have created is like so it depends on the pluses sheet size and the display size it can be larger but then you will need a larger display size so it's an interesting direction to see like if I explore other reflector shape will it be what I can be able to have even smaller display size well a larger display size a larger effective display size I guess also the the brightness of the display limits the effective range of you really it's to voice it yeah sorry I guess to make it significantly larger you would also need to make the display much brighter so not just make the display bigger but also brighter yeah yeah yeah it's also very important yeah so in the environment like how bright the surrounding is so different materials can be possible for example something less transparent or we do want the transparency but it can be a little bit less transparent so that you can have more reflection so the material can also be explored to to see how to achieve better contrast yep thank you thank you
