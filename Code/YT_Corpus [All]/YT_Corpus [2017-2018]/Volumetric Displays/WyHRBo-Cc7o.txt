 Hi, I'm Gavin from Voxon Photonics and today I'm going to show you how to use Blender to make an animation that we run on our VX1 volumetric display I'm using blender 2.78c in version 2.1 of the Voxon SDK. So let's get started. For this tutorial I'm going to be using a cloth physics demo from Littlewebhut.com The animation is 250 frames long and we're going to export each of those frames as an STL file To do this, first we'll need to install a free script and you can download from https://goo.gl/WkNX4F Once you have downloaded it navigate to the user preferences menu and click Install from File Select the Script, click the install button and finally save the user settings. You should now be able to find the script by hitting space and typing export and selecting exporting frames as mesh of files. When you hit enter you might think blender has crashed, but don't worry it's just very busy exporting your frames. After a short wait, you should find that your project directory is full of STL files along with your files you're going to need an info.ini file which looks like this this file has some extra information about the animation like its speed and playback mode. The next thing to do is select all the STL files and the info.ini file and zip them up I'm using the free 7-zip archiver. Once complete copy the zip file to the media section of the SDK and run VoxieOS the volumetric file browser. If you then navigate to the animation folder you can find and run your animation. Because the animation is made up of STL files you can use the density slider from the render menu to adjust the brightness. This function subdivides the triangles in the file. Ok, that's enough of the simulator let's transfer the animation to the VX1 on a USB stick and see how it looks. Thanks for watching.
