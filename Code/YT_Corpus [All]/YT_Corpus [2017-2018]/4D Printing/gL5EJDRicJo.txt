 hello I'm Odin and today I'm gonna make a tri-dimensional chess set from Star Trek the original series I'm gonna use the very first Star Trek technical manual this is the 1975 Franz Josef manual and it has one of the best drawings of the tri-dimensional chess set near the back I enlarged the artwork so the squares would be two and a quarter inches which is tournament size for chess it made that being a little big but you know what the hell I use my foam ruler that had made for Hellboy's right hand of doom to measure how long the curves needed to be and then I cut some pieces of 5/8 inch aluminum square stock to use for the upright supports I need to bend the aluminum so I picked up a compact bender from harbor freight tools now this is meant to be mounted to the floor but that was not an option at this place so I mounted it to a large piece of plywood now this worked really well when I tested it on some rebar but the 5/8 inch aluminum was not really interested in getting bent it took some odd stretching to hold the tool in place brace opposite corners of a plywood base and then actually bend the bar with my hip then I need to trim the ends of each of the curves now my bandsaw only has a wood blade so I used a hacksaw and then finally a reciprocating saw to make all the cuts I needed the ends to be smooth and level to each other so I did fine-tuning of each cut on the belt sander and rounded off the square end of the middle board support now in the show you can see the screws that hold the curves together so I was not worried about hiding mine I clapped my pieces into a vise and line them up as they needed to be and then I could drill out the pilot holes my drill press and I use a quarter twenty tap to add threads so I can screw them together and it took my time and it cleared the shavings as I tap the holes because it is very easy to add too much torque on a tap and break it off inside of the piece that you're working on which is a real pain in the ass to fix oh dammit I knew I was gonna do that oh I'm really now after the two supports were attached a drill at the support ends and tap them as well to hold the three main boards in place lastly I ground out that broken tap piece of the dremel and then I drilled the hole large enough to fit a carriage bolt so I could mount be upright to a base so I got the stand done what I need is a base what I found that I think would look really good for a base was not what I was expecting to find so I looked at lamps looked at your it stands for holding things in the bathroom and brush holders and whatnot what I found was a showerhead and my thought is if I can pull the end off pull this part here off and get this set flat I can then use that as my base but it still kind of looks like a showerhead and I want to hide that and I lucked out in the plumbing department they had what's called a deep flange this fits directly over my showerhead parts and then how you put this on top of it put it on a bolt through all this and put some tension on it my hope is it'll actually stay in place first I have to disassemble the showerhead getting the plastic face of the showerhead off was easy but the guts of the showerhead were not interested in coming out so I did the sensible thing and hit it with a hammer I ran the carriage bolt through the aluminum added a washer and a nut and then cut a piece of PEX pipe that fit over the nut and it fit just inside the flange then I needed the biggest fender washer I had and one more nut to attach the base now because the hole the showerhead attachment is bigger than a text pipe I actually had some wiggle room to move the upright so the board supports would be level I'm gonna start working in the chessboard what I have are three pieces cut for the main boards and four pieces cut for the attack boards now these are all cut from 3/16 inch thick acrylic plastic sheets and the sheets come with a protective film on both sides so you don't scratch them up while you're working with it I'm going to leave that on for right now because the first thing I want to do is actually round off the corners just a little bit on the belt sander just to make it a little bit nicer I just carefully round it off each corner on the belt sander being careful not to sand the whole edge then a sanded each edge by hand to remove as much of the marks left by the table saw when the pieces were first cut my plan is to polish the edges now I do need to remove the protective plastic and wipe off the crud from sanding and use a torch to flame polish all the edges of the plastic that he had to be careful not to burn the edges of the plastic just heated enough so it starts melting and it really doesn't take that long to do and the results are worth the effort with all seven boards polished I started to wrap them in tape so I could paint on the checker boards I covered all the sides protect them from both scratches and overspray I just made cuts every two to quarter inches of the tape and the act of cutting actually does scratch the plastic and it's right on the edge where I want my paint so you won't be able to see it with every other tape square removed I painted the exposed plastic with a candy apple red spray paint that I got from an automotive store so all the board's are painted plus I've done a clear coat over all the pieces to try and help protect the paint a little more and keep it from being scratched I really want to peel all the blue tape off at this point and see how they look but not yet first I'm gonna drill holes in all these and I don't want to scratch them up with a drill press now the drill the Centers is easy because with the checker boards I've got them already marked to get the corners to all look the same I'm gonna make a quick jig out of wood and set it up in the drill press I just clamp the jig to the drill press and drill out the corners then I can move it back in order to hit the attack board centers and then I move it back again to drill out the three main boards and I'm using a step spit or Unibet to drill the plastic because a regular would drill can break the edges of plastic when it drills all the way through now you can buy special drill bits just to be used on plastics but where I was they were sold out of quarter-inch drill bits so I had to improvise and use a step bit instead now I could remove all the painters tape and I can actually see the squares I was careful to keep all the edges of the masking tape down flat which avoided having paint run underneath the masking tape and as I uncovered each board I stacked them between paper towels because plastic is really good at scratching plastic to make the stamens for the attack board I'm going to use an acrylic tube and an acrylic ride the tube is cut to be just under four inches and the rods are cut to be just under four and a half inches the rods are a quarter inch in diameter and they're a snug fit in the hold in the attack ports and the tubes have a quarter inch inside diameter so they slip right over the rods I glue all the parts in place with some weld on for which is a water thin solvent glue and it'll seep in between the scenes of the plastics the extra been a rod that sticks out of the bottom will fit into any corner hole in the main boards and a tapered the end of the rod on the dis sander so it's easier to move it into the different holes while actually playing the game before I put all the playing boards on I want to go ahead and use acetone to erase all the marks that are on the aluminum and I wanted to keep the acetone clear to the plastic because if I spill acetone on the plastic it'll actually melt it and Mar up the surface which I don't want to have happen I just screw on the main boards of the quarter 20 screw but not too tight it's easy to over-tighten plastic which will crack it then place on the attack board and set your playing pieces [Music] [Music] the 1975 technical manual shows the starting positions of the king and queen is actually up on the attack boards but unlike this starting position much better it's the classic one and it's more familiar in fact there's never been official rules written for tri-dimensional chess now there's been fan rules written since the 70s but nothing officials been put out and there are lots of different ways that you can make tri-dimensional chess in fact Star Trek The Next Generation made one completely out of clear acrylic but I like the aluminum and acrylic look of the original series and this is how Odin makes I have a patreon page where I give away props and I've made right here in the show and September's winner is Paul Wight Paul won the matrix of leadership from Transformers the movie if you liked the video or have ideas or something for me to make please leave them in the comments below and if you make any of these projects you can send me a picture so these pieces are from the Franklin Mint set they're just a little bit smaller just just a will
