          WHAT ARE WE DOING?   WE'RE BACK, NOW, WITH WHAT  COULD BE THE FUTURE OF FOOTWEAR. WHAT IF YOU HAD YOUR FEET MAPPED AND WALK OUT WITH A SNEAKER  THAT'S BEEN PERFECTLY CUSTOMIZED FOR YOUR FOOT?     THAT SOUNDS GOOD.   THAT'S THE CONCEPT OF A NEW PAIR OF SHOES RESULTING IN A   COLLABORATION BETWEEN ADIDAS AND CARBON.      JOSEPH C. SIMONE IS THE FOUNDER AND CEO.     AND TORI BOWIE IS SPONSORED BY ADIDAS AND A LEGEND.   HOW DOES THIS WORK?   THIS IS A 3D PRINTER.    YOU'RE MOLDING THE SHOE TO OUR FOOT?       THAT'S RIGHT.   THE MID SOLE FOR THE SHOE WAS  MADE ON A PRINTER SIMILAR TO THIS.      WE'RE PRINTING SOMETHING THAT'S SIMILAR TO THE MID SOLE IN  MID-TIME.     THIS IS GOING TO BE ABOUT SIX  MINUTES.     WE CAN MAKE COMPLEX STRUCTURES,  TAILORED TO PEOPLE.   YOU'RE TEAMING UP WITH   ADIDAS.     WHY CAN'T THEY DO THAT WITHOUT A 3D PRINTER?     THE COMFORT AND THE STRIKE  ZONE HOW YOU WALK.   YOU DON'T WANT A STANDARD SIZE  9.      YOU WANT A SHOE FOR MATT OR   SAVANNAH OR TORI.    TAKE DATA AND USE MATHEMATICS TO DESIGN A SHOE FOR ABINDIVIDUAL. AND IT'S FINISHING IN REAL-TIME.  YOU'RE WEARING A PAIR OF  THESE.      DOES IT FEEL DIFFERENT FROM  OTHER SHOES YOU'VE WORN IN THE  PAST?      OF COURSE IT DOES.    THEY FEEL AMAZING.   I MEAN, THEY'RE TAILORED JUST TO FIT MY FEET.     DO YOU THINK IT WOULD GIVE  YOU AN ADVANTAGE?    IT GIVES ME AN EXTRA BOOST,  AN EXTRA BOUNCE.   MORE ENERGY.     I THINK THIS IS OUR FUTURE RIGHT HERE.       THIS ONE HAS BEEN COMPLETED. AND IT WAS JUST AT THE BEGINNING WHEN I WALKED IN THE STUDIO.  WE PRINT SHOES IN TENS OF  MINUTES.     WHAT THIS MEANS IS ABOUT   QUALITY, SPEED AND SCALE.  YOU CAN DO THIS NOT JUST FOR  INDIVIDUAL HIGH-PERFORMANCE  ATHLETES BUT EVERYBODY CAN GET A CUSTOM SHOE.     IS THE VISION THAT YOU GO  INTO THE SHOESTORE AND THERE'S ONE OF THESE.     AND YOU WALK OUT MINUTES LATER WITH YOUR CUSTOM SHOE?    YOU GO IN A STORE AND GET MEASURED.      AND WITHIN DAYS, THEY CAN  PROVIDE THAT SHOE TO YOU.    WOW.     WHAT ELSE CAN THE TECHNOLOGY  DO?      AS WE LOOK BACK HERE -- WHAT  WE CAN DO IS GO BEYOND FOOTWEAR. WE'LL MAKE THESE IN THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS AND MILLIONS AND  TENS OF MILLIONS.    BUT THIS TECHNOLOGY ALSO LENL L ITSELF TO APPLICATIONS IN   AUTOMOTIVE, AEROSPACE, AND  DRONES.      ALL THESE INDIVIDUAL PARTS.  THIS PART WOULD BE HARD TO  FABRICATE THINGS LIKE THIS.  AND THIS CAME OUT OF A DIGITAL  PRINTER.      YOU'RE ALSO A
