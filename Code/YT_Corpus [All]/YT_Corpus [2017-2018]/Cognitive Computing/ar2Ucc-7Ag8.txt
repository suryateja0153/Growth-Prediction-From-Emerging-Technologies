 preserve thanks a lot for I didn't realize you are going to actually give a long introduction so I actually sometimes forget who I am I an academic and industry and now actually I don't even know that I know I seem to be some combination of an academic who seems to be in an industrial R&D setting and not an entrepreneur and some mixture of that and so what I thought I will do today is [Music] tell you a little bit about what I have been learning over the last few years as to where this entire our industry is going and what are some of the opportunities what are some of the driving factors and what opportunities it is actually offering to us as sort of an innovations community and I want to end with some probably open challenges so I want to start sort of very high level and I'll keep drilling down as we go through so and lot of what I'm going to tell you is a lot of lessons learned so I came so as Hooser mentioned a when I came back to india in 2005 I was working deeply into network protocols network architectures ringing all kinds of things in joined TCS and Tre DC which is our largest R&D center and had the opportunity to probably go and see some of the largest companies globally and I understand where the problems are and what are the problems that they're facing n so that whole learning experience has sort of brought me where we are and I'll sort of walk you through their journey but let me start by actually saying that today we live truly in interesting times it's probably unprecedented in at least history in terms of the rate at which things are changing if I actually look back and last 25 years in 25 years you've seen many things come and go disappear and they're actually in astonishment list just to actually put this in context oh by the way this is the this discussion today is a little bit broader than networking but you will actually start seeing the ripple effects of that across the entire ecosystem that we live in so let's start with simple examples things that have disappeared right and within the last 20 years right today there are no phone boxes anywhere it's interesting right fact just two months ago I landed at an airport and my phone didn't work I had no idea what to do because I have no numbers are forgotten no no record of anything and no such phones are available anywhere right and at a place where I don't speak the local language starts becoming an interesting challenge but this is disappeared there are many such things that have disappeared right your film based cameras or photography has actually disappeared maps have disappeared in that form in fact maps in digital form are also actually somewhat disappearing because they are actually getting substituted by recommendation systems which are essentially telling you what to do nobody actually sees maps you simply follow who will advise nobody questions right so that's it's the even the skill to see a map is probably going to disappear very very soon right so very interesting you keep following CDs right have come and are rapidly disappearing right so in fact there is no physical media for black very interesting right the first generation of smartphones have come and gone 2007 or 2005-2006 i should say this was their dominant platform less than 10 years ago correct has disappeared fact back various top manufacturing and this list actually goes on right i mean most interesting recent one the most recent 2012 SMS is you actually go back and look at a lot of the telecom providers business plans of 2012 it's a very interesting graph that you would actually see they're all projected that the voice calls we are actually not going to be interesting from a financial perspective and a lot of growth was actually projected based on SMS and that was skyrocketing then something happened and that skyrocketing has thought what happened whatsapp happened today whatsapp is carrying more number of messages then all telecom co providers combined growing it since interesting the point is that the pace of change is just incredible and what is was considered sort of the foundation of growth three years ago a simply disappeared right and there are many many many examples I mean and there are many many success stories right so there are everyday disruption examples that you can look at right from Amazon to Airbnb tuber and others and each one has an interesting story behind it in terms of what led to that disruption and what has actually caused that disruption to happen if you look at Wilbur it's certainly an interesting technology it's an intelligent solution that is making it extremely easy to sort of do taxi rental or rent a car but perhaps the biggest disruption that ruber has generated is that it has democratized if you will a closed system right so the entire supply chain of taxis was a closed system you had to have a license to actually be a taxi driver in most large metros and it's uber that has been completely destroyed the supply chain has been opened up such that anybody can become a part time driver and actually and that has completely disrupted that industry right with autonomous cars another disruption is eminent and so on so forth so very interesting right i mean if you just look around intelligence software is everywhere and in your rapidly moving into what people are calling the AI first world so i'll explain what this means in a little bit here are some very interesting numbers or statistics right today every two weeks so S&P 500 is basically some of the largest that the top 500 companies and every two weeks a company is actually falling off that list it's an interesting number right 25 of the 500 will actually no longer be there on that list at the end of 2017 and it's an alarming rate of how fast things are actually changing the other statistics is actually these actually DC two things corroborate well forty percent the companies that we're in the top of the the top 500 in 2001 we are no longer there in twenty ten and several probably have disappeared completely and several are struggling right so these are staggering numbers and I don't think we have ever seen this space of change ever in the history so this is very interesting time so the question that we should all be asking is what is fueling this change and we've been doing a lot of analysis of water what is the heart of a lot of this change in at least I have come to the conclusion that there are two only two things that seem to be driving a lot of these companies or a lot of this change the first one is what i would call hyper instrumentation everything is actually been instrumented to a point where you have unprecedented level of visibility into any system these systems could be human systems these systems could be industrial systems I mean you talk about IOT it's essentially giving you unprecedented level of visibility if you look at the cell phones that all of us are carrying the smartphones they are heavy instrumentation of us as people right the mobile provider probably knows more about me or all the apps know more about me then probably myself I have forgotten things but it is not forgetting so that's a brilliant level instrumentation of each one of us which is actually generating vast volumes of data and I mean you look at the entire REO T's discussion if you look at all large enterprises data centers networks and so on the level of monitoring the level of instrumentation has gone to a point where you have immense visibility into what's happening so that's the first thing that is actually happening across the board the second thing that is happening is what i would call dematerialization or software-defined everything or there is an app for everything essentially what that says is that on one hand we have created an environment which is we have such a great level of instrumentation that is generating so much data on the other side we have created an ability to drive actuation in virtually anything whether it is the door of your house the security system the thermostat in your house or whatever alright everything there is an app for which means there is an API for which means that I can essentially invoke that API and take interesting actions right if you look at uber is actually exactly these two things if you look at the uber app that the driver is carrying on his or her cell phone is hyper instrumentation because it's using the GPS location of that car to figure out what's actually going on and the app itself is software-defined because it's essentially is used to send commands if you will or instructions to the driver and that's the combination that's what that app is it's actually creating instrumentation on one side and it's creating actuation possibility on the other side and when you combine these two things amazing things happen right what this is basically enabling is the ability to create what is popularly known as cognitive solutions cognitive systems but essentially what they do or what these things are are that they are highly intelligent systems that have the ability to create real-time adaptive and personalized experiences if you look at for example dynamic pricing for an e taylor is a brilliant example of exactly the same to hyper instrumentation what is the instrumentation there every retailer today is actually seeing and collecting vast volumes of data about every customer journey whether it is electronic journey or physical journey in the store and the journey brakes are essentially analyzed in real time to now determine what to do because that's an anomaly detection that then you actually take corrective actions near real time so each one of these examples if you just take a step back and look at what's happening underneath the cover it's actually exactly this to combination right and that is what is fueling generation or solutions that are fundamentally transforming each domain right so I mean what did amazon do amazon can change prices a million times a day and most retailers today struggle to change prices once a week exactly the same problem no visibility no ability to take intelligent actions but that's what is actually resulting in substantial disruption across the board in different industries right so there are obviously many many many solutions and industries are actually getting disrupted as we speak and there are some obviously very popular examples I mean automotives or driving is a great example which is actually getting disrupted and but I thought I think this is an important slide to understand because when people talk about cognitive solutions or cognitive systems there is actually different levels of cognitive abilities that actually you think about that the lowest level of sophistication are simple solutions that simply provide facts so this is if you will the conventional [Music] business intelligence solutions or bi solutions right they basically provide facts you can essentially search you can do sort of interactive drill downs or whatever it is just continuously for providing you facts that's the lowest level of sophistication the next level up is provide suggestions this is so at Google Maps is a great example of that next level of sophistication where it is leveraging a lot of data that is being collected from all cell phones of the drivers to determine where there is traffic congestion and then essentially provide inputs in terms of what row to take and how long will it take the next level of sophistication is autonomous activities perform a particular task so in this example automated parking is a perfect example of that third level of sophistication which is using whole bunch of sensors and actuators to perform a very well-defined task and the most sophisticated level of cognitive solutions actually take responsibility right the ability of the solution to not only understand the context reason about that context and take actions decide what to do when to do why to do and then take actions in order to make the system nearly autonomous and you're starting to see if you sort of look around you probably have been seeing a lot of news coming in that talks about this different solutions that are emerging that are at different points in this sort of maturity levels for different domains right so obviously today you know an automotive domain we are definitely somewhere in getting close to this right but many other domains are actually no not far behind and they're all actually doing things that are actually going to cook and as you can realize if you go down this path it is transforming everything right in this case it's transforming driving experience right i mean i think in pittsburgh uber has already launched these autonomous car so there are basically driverless uber cars so there are no drivers and that has far-reaching consequences right this is an interesting book I would recommend some of that you probably look at is a book called the future of professions so I forget the name of the author there are two Oxford faculty members and it's a very interesting book because it's essentially talking about what is the implication of all of this on virtually every profession which profession will survive is actually a good question with the pace at which this is actually changing is just unbelievable right and there are some many many many examples right so in agriculture precision application of pesticide is actually one of the first things that you are actually starting to see education grading essays all right legal finding the most likely win strategy this is actually if you go back and if you actually look at each one of these examples you can probably map them onto this maturity level so if you look at for example legal finding the most likely win strategy is essentially suggestive the second level of sophistication is unlikely it will probably go significantly beyond that because of liabilities and so on right so different domains you'll probably see this line move at a different pace and probably different target point but it's very very interesting medical medicine early diagnosis in treatment oil and gas [Music] most of these oil and gas companies all over the world they have these humongous these oil rigs and these drilling machines and first of all they are in middle of nowhere there is no human insight and if something breaks on that machine it is days of voltage and tremendous business loss so there the ability to predict and prevent is actually where the name the whole notion of preventive maintenance the ability to predict something is likely to go wrong based on what you have you're observing is actually where this is actually starting to see and each of these problems are very complex problems because but if you go back to the previous chart there are all examples of hyper instrumentation and software-defined everything that combination coupled with intelligence is what is changing each of these games in an interesting manner so with that context I want to actually take one interesting example which all of us will immediately probably relate to I want to take the example of the world of IT and ask where are we right and is this world of IT the wall that we all live in the world of computing where are we and what is the future the first interesting point to observe is that all the things that you have talked about today I mean until now are actually examples where technology or IT is at the heart or driving all these disruptions or transformations right interestingly though so having this combination of whether you call it IOT network censors machine learning reasoning smart algorithms actuation software-defined everything this is all IT right and we are using all of this to transform everybody else's lives it's interesting but we are not applying that to ourselves it's a very interesting observation I mean I mean at this years I've been looking at this right i mean if you look at every large service provider today across the globe what we do in the world of IT whether it is running enterprise IT large networks humongous storage environments and so on it's still very very very manual in most organizations and interestingly the reason why it is manual is first of all it's very complex but we have also in every organization this world has been divided into so many layers and silos that everybody has only a small narrow view of what's actually happening so people who understand lets the databases they only understand database is nothing left to offer it right of it right and people who understand networks only understand networks and nothing left or top or bottom and that's actually an interesting problem which is a big challenge right so this is why what is happening in our industry is that there is significant reliance on people to connect dots but the scale and complexity of most organizations is so large that this is becoming a big challenge in fact this is why I mean the way we are solving this problem today in the industries by throwing people at the problem you just keep throwing more and more people as the complexity rises higher more 10,000 people of course this is a perfectly good revenue generating model for people centric businesses but this is exactly a problem a problem a domain that is interestingly ripe for disruption because if you once again go back to my points that I made hyper instrumentation software-defined everything I T is hyper instrumented already and everything is software defined by definition yet you're not able to solve the problem interesting right so there are many many I mean that is something i mean i can get can give you many many examples because i've seen these examples in some of the largest companies globally so the first problem every organization sees is operational risk just humongously complex environments that everybody runs some of the large banks that i get a chance to actually look at they run something upwards of a million batch jobs every night bad jobs are basically just signed alone if you will applications but they process instead of 11 transaction at a time a batch of workload and their process um they they have a million bad jobs with complex relationships precedence relationships control relationships across them and there is no one in most of these organizations that understands the complexity of the magnitude of what they are dealing with as a result you always do constant fire fighting something breaks you throw bodies at the problem and you hope that they can resolve another interesting statistics eighty to ninety percent of the time it takes two to resolve our repair an incident that happens in a large IT systems is actually spent in figuring out where the problem is and in fact you know how it works in most organizations it is always starts out so the common mode of operation is gather everybody who could possibly know what's happening into one room virtual room it is called incident bridge so everybody joins that call and then you start blaming each other and you know who gets blamed first the network guy all of it is always network guys problem this number one and the poor guy always fights are so you know no it is not my problem no no no it is not my problem he will generate all the logs from various routers switches and say no no no not my problem then people you say okay okay maybe problem and then so this is the common mode of operation right across the globe you pick any company including your own companies but this is what happens today nobody knows actually so it is unbelievable actually staggering these things right you know sixty to seventy percent of the outages that happen or change induced why nobody knows what is the impact of change the way we we call it testing right in computer science you keep testing and finally we don't know whether we have tested we simply give up and say okay enough let it go right and that's how it works and you find out three days later something has gone wrong and by the way by that time you've forgotten the changes you have made because it's not that most organizers do not make one change and wait for something to happen right you're introducing thousands of changes every weekend give no clue what is the cause for what effect it is virtually impossible in most organization today to actually connect a symptom to a cause without involving exactly that room full of people starting with networking I but this is exactly what is happening in every organization so what this is an interesting challenge for all of us right I mean this is a domain we should be disrupting it right but it is not that easy to disrupt I'll tell you some of the reasons why also anyway so what is everybody doing every organization in the world is actually facing this problem is everybody doing what is generally called robotic automation or sometimes people call it robotic process automation or runbook automation or whatever what this is is actually very simple you take a procedure for performing a complex activity and you convert the procedure into a little program our workflow set of rules with actions and so on and you feed that into what is often called an orchestration engine and that orchestrate registration engine will actually execute that more or less deterministic sequence of actions when you see that particular event or tasks needed to be performed and that's what essentially happens this is if you will the state of the art today so when we and I said about five years ago when I got involved and we started seeing this in essence this is disastrous so I can't be actually if I t or if technology if computer science is used to disrupt others why can't we disrupt ourselves that's how we started this whole thing and then we obviously realize that this is the state of the art and this doesn't work why does it not work there are two interesting reasons that I want you to actually appreciate the first one is that most enterprises or most IT environments that are fueling every business today is becoming more complex by the minute in fact as we go to software-defined everything right essentially what that does is you are obviously get lot of flexibility you can introduce changes quickly but it also means that everything is changing all the time today just imagine with when things are not changing that fine you still are you using armies of people to figure out what's happening if everything is changing so frequently the armies will have to multiply in order to keep up because it's just the problem complexity just is actually scaling through right some very interesting so when we started this journey and we looked at this sort of robotic approach because of the diversity and complexity that exists within an enterprise every action you perform and that technology action may be relatively deterministic but there is a there is a if you will a judgment based or intelligent step before you perform that action that says what should I do why should I do when should I do and then only how should i do comes it right and that part is there are so many variants that you cannot write a program just imagine 1 million bad jobs it was very interesting one error condition in these bad jobs that the job is running longer than expected for one of the large banks that I was limited they had over 500 different scenarios and we painstakingly recorded everything he said oh my god but the time we finished 100 more showed up right I mean other than guaranteeing the employment for life it is not actually doing anything I mean as IT professionals we are actually safe because we are creating more complexity more mess hence more employment but it's not really actually helping anybody very interesting right we just don't know how to deal with some of this the second thing is very actually is actually in retrospect sasur sort of obvious but it probably hit us quite badly this whole concept of robotic automation works and this is how actually by the way our automated factories work automated factories work on the concept of robotic automation and that model works beautifully if what you are doing is not changing over time right but if what you have to do changes every day then the robotic automation fails and it changes every day for us why everything changes right you look at a typical bank or a typical network environment your workloads change or attack patterns change or turn underlying technology technology versions change right even regulatory and security requirements change every day so what used to be the procedure yesterday becomes obsolete today and that is why you continuously rely upon people to actually solve this problem so what do you what how do you actually solve this problem so the basic realization was that if you just think about how our brain works it doesn't quite work in a robotic manner right just take a very simple example I want to meet one of meet you guys for a coffee at a cafe coffee day two blocks from here after this you and I don't have a procedure coded in our brains that says how do i need loser for coffee right and yet i am able to do this why how we just think about it our brain actually is creating the procedure for carrying out that activity on the fly by combining three things first i have the ability to become context-aware i can see i can look around i can know where am I I have the ability to remember I know I remember that I sort of climbed down two stairs to come here so I have some notion of where am i right that is context awareness the second thing that our brain uses are patterns that we learn over time for example let's say I am on the fifth floor of a building an hour to go and meet him for coffee the first pattern I have learned is the first thing I have to do is get go downstairs that's a pattern another pattern I have learned that there are at least three ways of going downstairs right I can walk down stairs I can take the elevator down or I can jump out of the window and then of course a pattern that we have learnt is that the third option is not a good option unless the building is on fire right so that's patterns and then the third thing that we are brain uses are skills that we have acquired over time I know how to walk I know how to read a sign I know how to pull the door push a door and so on so forth and it continuously pieces these three things together to construct a procedure that's why you and I don't have to worry about how many doors will I go through whether there will be pulled or pushed those revolving door sliding doors you basically get out you look around become context-aware you apply a pattern a skill and this is exactly what happens continuously this is why we adapt and yet what we do in the world of ID is actually very robotic right and that's what led us to words and potentially developing a completely different way of approaching these class of problems so first thing we realized is that when you want to build a cognitive system year to go significantly beyond procedure or robotic and there are at least three types of interesting activities that you and I do every day the first one is what i would call investigative and investigative basically says it is you are observing a symptom you have to identify a cause and then determine an action right that's an investigative activity the next one is analytical where you basically are looking at the historical data finding trends patterns to identify what is likely to happen and so on so forth and then the last one is planning to basically answer what if and if what questions what happens if I introduce this change or perturbation and if what says if I want to accommodate that that change what should I do this combination of activities covers ninety ninety-five percent of what you and I do on a daily basis right and each of them actually have some sophisticated set of algorithms that are actually underneath the covers which are a combination of machine learning reasoning and so on so forth enjoy in fact to build these kinds of systems you need three types of intelligence you need what are called recognition intelligence which is the ability to to become context-aware so process large volumes of data mostly unstructured semi-structured to derive interesting pieces of information from it to basically reason about the car will become aware of the context the next level up is reasoning intelligence once you have understood so if you took a look at the first category this is exactly what you would consider i mean the all your text mining sentiment analysis extraction of objects from images videos deep learning algorithms and so on they all fall in category one right the second category are reasoning intelligence which is basically derive inferences and actionable insight so now that i have observed something what should i do when should i do why should i do and then the last one is operative intelligence which is now that i have decided what when why how should i actually perform an action in the context of a particular system so that's what you need actually in order to so if you look at this it's an interesting amalgamation of if you will machine learning a lot of pattern recognition reasoning algorithms that traditionally you would call it to classify under a lot of the AI and this operative intelligence is actually it's the best way to describe it in computer science terminology would be model-driven software engineering you want to actually take knowledge about operating in a on a complex system basically you want to convert everything into software defined actions which allow you to actually perform actions in that I mean you combine the three you essentially get get a cognitive system that is significantly an orders of magnitude away from sort of if you will non-intelligent system so this is what we did with igg neo igneous as was introduced it's essentially a cognitive platform and a specific solution that we are built for the world of enterprise IT and operations and what it does are these four things so in simple terms sense think act and learn so sense is essentially what I said the recognition intelligence mine lots and lots of data that is actually coming from sensors and build a 360 degree view of the world that you are living in this essentially self learned enterprise context think is basically reasoning intelligence the ability to derive patterns ability to take desire to take decisions and then you operationalize those decisions using that component which is essentially the operative intelligence and then you continuously keep learning not only what the environment is but also the the the quality of your reasoning decisions and actions such that you can keep improving what's actually going on so underneath the covers it's essentially doing these four things but the impact is enormous almost 10x improvement can fold we are not talking ten percent twenty percent we are talking tenfold improvement in the overall quality risk reduction cost reduction and so on which is and these are the types of things that are likely to be disrupting and this is just example for one domain but you will see this happen in many other domains and the moment you get sort of a 10x or a 5x kind of change immediately that industry gets disrupted and that is exactly the you are more or less I think we are all likely to see this happen in front of our eyes the next five years right and it's just it's a little bit scary at times but it is it's not a question of if this is going to happen it's more or less a question of when this is going to happen and that when is not that far away which is basically this is one other point that I want to make here which is actually very important I mean being an academic and how we teach people and what should we train our people are students or with these kinds of systems like AG neo Watson is another one of these it fundamentally changes the role of people in an organization the role of people changes from doers of work to creators and curators of knowledge it's a completely different level of skill to be able to actually capture knowledge and describe knowledge well is where the the name of the game is likely to shift because most of the work that people do today will actually be done by engines like agnya come three four five seven years right it's a very interesting transformation it completely changes as I said what we actually teach our students and so on so let me conclude by just pointing some interesting thoughts I think a multi-billion dollar question or whatever don't call it C today if you look at this whole journey that I have talked about and you look at every example that I mentioned each one including igni oh that we build for ignore variety operation has taken many years of effort with a decent-sized team to get there right you look at what Watson is doing in health care it is once again taken years of effort hundreds of phd's domain experts doctors actually working together to get it to that level of expertise the biggest opportunity and challenge that is facing all of us and as technologists as computer scientists you should be asking the question what will it take to dramatically shrink the time required to do this because that is what is going to happen you cannot really do five years one solution five years one solution that model will not scale question is what is the equivalent of a 3d printer see if you think about a 3d printer right it takes a model 3d model as an input and it prints a 3d object as output what is the equivalent in the world of cognitive systems so actually an fascinating thought what if I could build a cognitive system for a domain simply by describing the domain to something pressing a button and out pops a highly intelligent real-time adaptive cognitive system for that domain once again it's not that far-fetched it is not possible today but that is the challenge that I think if we solve it will completely disrupt many of the industries that we see around us and that is what is the foundation of this book that I talked about a future of professions because many professions will disappear new professions will come up as a result of now if you want to answer this question I've been pondering about this and I don't have a perfect answer but I believe that the name of the game is not technology the name of the game is knowledge management which most of us don't well so it's very difficult for an expert to actually describe knowledge you if you go and ask somebody who's an expert in an area tell me about that area that person find it difficult to actually concisely describe knowledge about that domain so how to structure knowledge about a domain how to acquire that knowledge quickly how to validate or verify the knowledge that you are getting about a domain consistency completeness comprehensiveness there are all hard problems but they are essential and last but not the least how do you actually ensure safety so this is why if you look at actually what is taking so long for autonomous cars to come out it's actually not a technology problem it's actually a safety problem after you have reached a certain level of maturity the question is is this safe can it go berserk in fact the number one question people ask me about ignor when we have gone and talked to some of the largest enterprises everywhere in the world is can EG neo bring my business down in a matter of minutes and if so what are the safeguards against it so actually when the somebody asked me this question the first time I actually as well I said well actually you have people running your enterprise today and they will make mistakes and they can bring something down I thought about it for a minute and said yes you're right you know my people are slow takes them for them to actually cause catastrophic problems takes a long time and before that I will catch you can you run way too fast and that will actually bring everything down in a relatively short amount of time so how do you actually safeguard against what is the notion of safety how do you prove for a system like this is safe these are all incredibly interesting and really hard technical challenges or so my humble request to all of you is that first of all I think we are indeed at a very very interesting juncture I think if you are a lost all my hair now but I mean if I was a PhD student right now or a young assistant professor it's a phenomenal time to actually develop things that are going to completely disrupt things in the next five years ten years you will see it in front of you right and in a very very very very short amount of time but these problems are hard and the consequences are actually far-reaching so so that let me stop once again I want to thank you very much for inviting me for here and indeed a pleasure to be back with a group of people in the the the sort of my if you will academic close to my heart but my world has changed as you can see from what I talked about today I have gone from building network protocols and congestion control algorithms to cognitive system so it's a little bit removed from that but I think it is an important point to realize for all of us that we are actually at this very interesting China time and both a threat and a significant opportunity so thank you very much i'll be happy to answer some questions [Applause] a little bit more discussion I wanted to pick on you know get your thoughts on the following so you know the your motivation for developing this in some signior is that there is a complexity in the system which is for sake for lack of better word that debugging problems is actually hard right and that's where the network guys get all the blame so then we build another system which sits on top of it so my guess is ignore is at least has to be an order of magnitude more complex than what it is trying to manage so have you just move the complexity of then now the ignore guy will get the first blame instead of the networking yeah that's a great question I don't know whether I have a perfect answer I think you're right the only thing I can say is that if I mean lot of these problems if you actually look at [Music] some of these more if you will systems that have been designed with the principle of maintainability in mind are actually designed very differently see what is happening today in most organizations is that people who design are not the ones who run and we run who have no idea about design and a lot of knowledge is dropped between the two designs happen under assumptions of operating conditions because those are very rarely actually captured and documented their lost then never maintained so when something happens in run you have no idea so I guess the point I'm trying to make is I mean to answer your question eat near has been in some sense design with the concept of run in mind so in some sense this is actually going towards self-describing systems see basically when you build anything complex you want to actually capture in information about that system such that you can use that self-description to actually run and feed that thing back what igneous actually doing is unearthing the self-description through a combination of machine learning and so on so forth and it says if you will almost retrofitting an existing system with that self learned knowledge such that it becomes self managing right so that's where the game is I am sure that we will realize that you have we have not fully understood the problem yet and I'm sure we will encounter surprises but your point is well taken in fact I mean you're right so the second most frequently asked questions about egg in you know first is how how can you prove to me that it will be safe so actually what we have built is actually a little you're interesting we have built what we call as action firewall you'll see my network background right so we have built a layer 7 firewall essentially and this layer 7 firewall actually captures commands it blocks and it actually does impact analysis in real time of that command on the entire residences AHA should this be allowed or not and if it says no no this is too dangerous it blocks right so that's how we are actually doing safety but there is an another problem which is actually free second most frequently asked questions saying this is critical infrastructure now if it goes down I'm dead so the problem that you mentioned are already hit us so now i have an ignore looking at igni oh so that's a different problem altogether so have three level hierarchy I have a system he is looking at the system or another you can you are looking at d this ignore to actually sell feel that igneel now of course you can ask what happens to gardenia I don't have an answer yet but that's actually but that is a good business plan the wedding is great for ya you can sell tending new yes so changes involve people and people are not really prepared yes they are not actually about it so that creates a lot of social tension around the world well it's I mean yes I think you're right i mean i can say that that creates a lot of tension within every organization and eventually social absolutely I so you're right i mean i wish i could give you a good answer i mean if you're asking me the question how can you do all of this without creating social or our challenges within an organization there is no answer that the reality is that i don't think you can stop this train this train has left the station and it is only accelerating so as I think I mean in fact that's why I actually gave some of the statistics of one out of every SMP 500 companies actually dropping out from that list every two weeks the reality is actually that right i mean if you look at every retailer globally right they are all trying to reinvent themselves because they know they are going to be out of business if they don't right so that is the reality and it has implications far reaching consequences no questions about that is why i think i think this community in particular has to actually and start asking some of these questions because i think 10 years from now i think the world will be very different than it is today I mean you just imagine it is even in India I mean some of these consequences are quite of course I mean India autonomous cars would be a difficult challenge I mean because India driving doesn't not go by whose so then it's a little difficult you can't look at each other's eyes and decide who goes first and that model is I think autonomous cars will have a long way to go before that so maybe India drivers are safe but actually if you just look at that right i mean it's just I mean look at the consequences of autonomous cars on not only people but companies auto insurance i mean is going to be a this is this unbelievable number and everybody is starting to actually read think their business models there people strategies in line with this so as I said it is not a question of if it's only a question of when but these are hard questions I don't have I wish I had good answers for every question but I far from it nobody will be in that train which has already left station it will be like the autonomous cars right I mean this is running there are no drivers and maybe no passengers also I don't know so yeah I mean it's an interesting challenge but this is the reality I mean you just look at I mean I mean 2007 in some sense this is an interesting here right first iPhone was launched before 2007 after two thousand seven the world is a different place and today we take today's world for granted right and so I I think this is just going to happen it's a matter of time so anyway
