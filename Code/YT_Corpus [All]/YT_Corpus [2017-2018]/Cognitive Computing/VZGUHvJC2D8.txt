 [Music] [Music] [Music] by now we know that various forms of AI and machine learning are being baked into a lot of our online experiences we see and hear it in our daily online interaction with peers after having seen that Facebook is heavily invested in AI across their entire organization it is now becoming clear how this works and what some of the unintended consequences have been this episode looks at how AI affects what information we are given and predicts how we react to it [Music] according to a recent research by pew we're getting our news mostly from social media and news websites these days on Facebook things just start showing up in our feed I bet we all wonder how that gets selected where new articles get sorted and what effect do likes and comments have on future feed articles Facebook is constantly changing the algorithm that selects news for your newsfeed you're seeing IBM's Watson news Explorer at work it's like a carnivorous newsreader that performs natural language processing on data it finds in a massive web search and some that is already on its Big Data cloud database I gave it net neutrality and FCC as input parameters and it came back with a denser network of interrelated news articles that had keywords topics or subjects relating to my search criteria it apparently uses deep learning and whatever magical AI elements are part of Watson and this app is free and open to all to use [Music] we used to get all of our news from the big news and TV outlets news was printed or produced and broadcast live to us from the metropolis online and social media has transformed the origination selection and production of news to such a profound state that almost every kind of news story can be found online columbia journalism school describes how journalism can be automated the graphic reproduces the algorithm on the toe Center website using this method the machine learning algorithm is trained to perform news gathering from the mass of articles crossing the web supervised machine learning enables the wisdom of journalists to be combined with automation in machine learning known data with known responses are used to derive a training model that model is then applied to new data yielding predicted responses when we spend time online we generate a lot of personal profile signals these are easily analyzed and responded to by numerous companies wishing to sell us some product or service our political social and religious positions also generate valuable signals others can use to predict elections or support of a new policy one of the most common and reliable vehicles for generating profile signals is through the news we read comment on and rate once analyzed those activities that correlate with how we eventually voted or what products we purchased provide training data sets for self learning AI the AI algorithm can then run this at scale on a large number of people combined with automated news gathering this resembles high-frequency stock market trading on a personal level for large numbers of people without limits the field of cognitive computing encompasses machine learning natural language processing and deep learning it is evolved and progressed to a state where computing power can be brought to bear in the cloud this is where we have exposed all of our personality traits activities / shares and personal networks our travel buying habits and work histories are also there for the taking since we are somewhat open to exposing our preferences online activities are remembered and we are served ads and news articles that reflect our profile Facebook uses this social graph algorithm to personalize ads and news for us individually in mass [Music] in a recent article on scout the rise of the weaponized AI propaganda machine Anderson and Horvath study this seemingly unimportant or otherwise obscure corporation Cambridge analytica profiting from massive manipulation of public opinion what makes this dangerous is that it has weaponized AI and machine learning to allow it to micro target individuals but on a large scale if you provide enough likes and dislikes the algorithm can learn all about you and then manipulate your political commercial or personal behavior by feeding timely and exactly appropriate new information to fit your profile the Cambridge CEO presented in September of 2016 after having failed to get Cruz the nomination at the end of his presentation he mentioned that at least one of the two remaining candidates was using this technology watch this video of Molly shorter of CA presenting how social analytics and media manipulation led to the truck victory [Music] the research done in writing the story benefited from a lot of insightful authors around the blogosphere right now many of us are hyper aware of social technological and political news coming across the web at higher frequencies than ever if the algorithms that select news harvest our social media profiles it is likely that the process will become compromised or can easily be gained at some point information will become too unreliable for civilized society to accept this is already in evidence by the serving of micro targeted ads at scale on the web what is behind this are the very sophisticated analytics being done by social media platforms like Facebook and research firms such as Cambridge analytica using AI and machine learning to power their conclusions these programs are educational and for the benefit of society your comments are appreciated as all of you I like to keep learning not only are we evolving but the way we learn is as well at some point I may ask you to offer patreon support but for now I will keep the channel add and sponsor free share with friends family and anyone who wants to find insights along with us
