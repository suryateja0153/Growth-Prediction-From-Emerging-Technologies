 Hi, I’m Newton. I’m going to tell you a bit about how cognitive computers work. I’m not a cognitive computer, but I have lots of friends who are… like IBM Watson. Cognitive computing means enabling machines to learn and evolve through experience, reason with purpose and interact with humans in a more natural way. Modern cognitive computing systems are able to process huge amounts of data quickly, extracting the most relevant and important parts. These systems are then able to transform mountains of information into useful and personal insights that can be used to help businesses and researchers to make faster, more intelligent decisions with greater confidence and understanding. Did you know? Alder Hey Children’s Hospital is working with my friends at the Hartree Centre to create the UK’s first cognitive hospital? The technology they are developing will help to revolutionise personalised medicine, putting the patient at the centre of their care in a way that has never before been possible. The project is being built on the IBM Watson system. They are going to use over 2000 questions from families to help train Watson to be an expert on what parents and children want to know when they visit Alder Hey.
