 hi welcome once again to action item on Peter Burris and this is Ricky Barnes weekly research meeting where we bring together some of the best minds in Silicon Valley to talk about some of the trends that are most important we're broadcasting from here in the cube studios in beautiful kala Palo Alto California in the studio I'm being joined by George Gilbert and David foyer and on the folly of needle Radin Jim Kabila's Dave Volante team thanks very much for being part of this conversation today what we're going to do today is we're going to bring forward some of Ricky bonds predictions for 2018 in a previous show we discussed what we learned in 2017 so some of the trends are some of the expectations that didn't play out as expected this year we're going to dig a little bit deep into what we think is going to happen in 2018 and it all starts with the proposition that even as we go through significant industry change we're not necessarily going to see the economics of the industry change as fast which leads to prediction number one David for what is it so my prediction is that volume is going to take a key role in the evolution of disruptive technologies so for example in AI and IOT and in true private cloud volume is going to be the key determination of when it starts to take off when it starts the hockey stick so this has been something that's been featured in the industry for a wild day but give us an example what's the relationship between volume and AI so if we take the relationship between AI and volume AI is going sideways and and I would predict that it's going to go sideways in 2018 because every implementation is a snowflake until there are solutions out there which can be delivered in volume by vendors then that'll be the point at which you'll take things will take off so an example for example automated cars they are AI they when they start to come out in volume there'll be volume manufacturers volume of the sensors volume of the assessors the the armed processes volume of everything that will drive down cost and make those implementations and it's still software so we're still worried about support and service on a very very broad scale that leads to our second quick prediction Dave want a build on this notion of volume what's going to be the impact on a lot of the innovative smaller companies in 2018 so my prediction is you've got a go scale or go home aka you're out of business so we expect massive industry consolidation is going to take place in the next two years certainly through 2019 if the business models of vc-backed tech startups are getting smashed by cloud and to a great extent open source in a turnabout from the historical norms innovations and cost reductions from the largest cloud players are moving at a pace that's faster than than many if not most startups are able to deliver so finding right space is much much harder we see private equity as playing a key role here providing capital for M&A and doing roll ups that are going to create scale and large portfolios that can compete so new latent as we think about what Dave just said one of the key things that's happening is a lot of money is being put into some of the new technologies that are intended to provide more intelligence in a lot of different places one of the large company leaders at indicating or describing how this was going to play out was IBM of its Watson story what's been going on with Watson what's our prediction for how that's playing out and likely what's a likely 2018 scenario for IBM and Watson well not the sugarcoat it but Watson's been a dismal failure and I think that iBM is going to reassess their whole approach to cognitive computing in 2018 numbers don't lie let me give you some numbers from 2016 I obviously don't have 17 yet but these are reliable numbers from some institutional clients of mine their goal for 2016 was over 8 and clients they achieved 500 their goals we're business partners was over 4,000 and they achieved 329 so you know the numbers speak for themselves Watson hasn't caught on it's a solution in search of a problem it was a it was a marketing stunt really that someone thought could be turned into a twenty billion dollar for your business there's not even a product really it's dozens of subsystems that are linked with API some of them are interesting but most already are available in the open source world well what is we one of these we talked about last week Neal was the idea that we're gonna see more by as opposed to build and we talked about the volume play there and then we asked the question is going to be more software's are going to be more services it sounds like IBM's play to be a dominant player in AI related services has not gone as well as expected is that kind of where we are right now well yeah if you look at one of the more public failures of Watson which was MD Anderson Cancer Center they pulled the plug on the project after sixty-two million dollars but IBM only got about twenty million dollars about the rest of it went to PwC so how they intend to split that business between global services and their partners I really don't know and and the failure of Watson and MD Anderson wasn't entirely IBM's fault a lot of it had to do with PwC's project management and a lot of it had to do with the people with Anderson who basically started the product project by looking at a very well understood type of leukemia that had a well understood etiology and treatment options so when the auditors looked at if they said we haven't learned anything for 62 million dollars and that's been repeated at other projects so it sounds like this is again tied back to the idea of scale volume and and related issues but it also sounds like there's a lot of question ultimately about what is AI what may I what role is Watson going to play is it going to be private data is going to be public data a lot of questions are going to emerge over the course of next year but there are domains where AI ml DL are likely to have some important success and George we've got a prediction about where they're likely to be successful in 2018 what are we thinking or what's one domain where we think at least machine learning is going to have a significant impact in 2018 well keying off David's point about volume volume economics we think that IT operations management is going to be one of the first horizontal applications that embeds machine learning it's not about presenting modeling and tools to developers it's just part of the application the reason it's important there's really two two key reasons we've built now we're building out shared ephemeral infrastructure which is very different from the dedicated silos that we had for mission-critical applications and this this infrastructure is extreme and the application landscape on top of it is extremely hard to manage and machine learning machine learning can help greatly and I think investment in that will be driven also by a realization that this is training wheels for IOT in the sense that you're monitoring machines through data telemetry that they throw off and you're using models to figure out how they should be operating versus how they are operating so this is significant implications across IOT ml and how we get to volume because it's a controlled and pretty well-defined space by that I mean but nonetheless it's it's related to the problem space and by that I mean that bespoke applications whether they from AI or whatnot are going to create new needs for new types of monitoring but the classification of the tools and the classifications of the devices that will be modern are pretty well understood and they're controlled by the IT industry so they ought to have pretty good definitions is that what we're thinking here George yes precisely and the bespoke pieces can be modeled because there's a they fall within a well-known domain but I just want to add on the on the go-to-market side that keys off of what of what Dave Valente said which is that these IT operations management applications they can come from cloud vendors they can come from enterprise software vendors but especially the ones that are gonna be hybrid cloud they're going to need enterprise sales forces to get them to market you hear millions of virtually millions of startups say our go-to-market strategy is land and expand that doesn't get you enterprise wide and for that you need an enterprise Salesforce most a most expensive migratory migratory workforce in the world and startups don't have them and that's why one of the reasons we will see roll ups for scale so we've talked about the need for scale the impact on startups the impact on big companies like IBM one of the domains we think this is going to play out most successfully is an item in IT operations management for some of the these new technologies but underneath all this is a lot of new complexity because of distribution of function distribution of data distribution of application and there needs to be a new technology concept that allows for that distribution to take place under control and we talked about this a few weeks ago but Jim Kabila's what's our prediction for the world of blockchain or blockchain like technologies are going to take in facilitating this new distribution of capability around digital business yeah it will be as fundamental to the growth of the worldwide digital infrastructure and digital markets as three plus thirty to forty years ago tcp/ip was to the growth of when the internet and when why is that well you know when you look at the basic principle for development of any infrastructure when there is an innovation on the infrastructure side that is shared or standardized robust meaning secure and distributed it quickly becomes a common bond enabling growth of sharing and teaming and markets and so forth so really it's a layering process where we have tcp/ip and you know DNS and you are all providing this shared address space we're done half of that was public key infrastructure which is the foundation the security that makes watching so strong PCI and SSL and all that is an enabler that's another robust shared common infrastructure and then on top of that we see now is a distributed robust share record of transactions s blockchain it really blockchain as an enabler for the new generation of digital crypto currencies such as Bitcoin enabling a shared robust and distributed currency or means of exchange can be so in many ways blockchain is an enabler for this new generation of truly robust and shared currencies and transactions with a mutable secure a shared record it's definitely made a growth accelerator for the world economy in the 21st century going forward so many respects technology takes off when Network formation occurs tcp/ip was a foundation for network formation for distributed computing more basically saying is a blockchain becomes a crucial feature of how application networks get constructed over the course of the next 10 years if I got that right day before absolutely that's the key is a the the guy have sold his first telephone was a genius the second was easier and it gets easier and easier as that network grows and brought chain is a key contributor to the development of those networks and a one-to-one relationship many many one-to-one relationships that are taking care from that away from centralization and to a much more distributed environment so I think we got time for one more prediction really quickly and and I'll bring it up and then I want to open it up for conversation because this is an interesting one we come back to this notion of global network formation blockchain being what we think we're blotching like technologies being a crucial element of that but let's talk about how the relationship between technology the cloud and global economies are likely to evolve for the most part when people think about the cloud today we think of us-based companies Amazon Microsoft Google Facebook IBM also in there but there's some other companies they're going to have a say on how the cloud industry evolves over the course of the next five years Alibaba $0.10 Baidu so our prediction is that in 2018 we're going to see a lot more conversation about the role that China plays in establishing some of the new rules for how cloud application networks and security plays on a global basis and that's going to facilitate the emergence of Alibaba Tencent and Baidu also on the global stage as cloud computing companies what are you guys thoughts Dave want to let me start with you we're gonna see the emergence of the we've seen the emergence of the China cloud we're going to see that seep through other parts of Asia Pacific as we discussed earlier as a team in our private meeting Europe is going to be a very interesting pivot point because if if China can control these portions of Europe and use that as a lure for China that's going to give them a leg up on global cloud so that leads ultimately to a car series of questions about what will be the relationship between formation of cloud industries the evolution of the cloud industries and geopolitical concerns and I think what we need to do guys is dedicate an entire research meeting to that question because it's going to be one of the most important dictators of how the industry evolves over the next few years and ultimately how businesses and enterprises need to start establishing crucial partnerships with their of key and strategic suppliers so look in the last couple minutes we want to do our action item around now what we do here at the action item show is we start off having a conversation and then we go into the action item what are you going to do differently Monday as a consequence of the information we're talking about so let's do that now hits and action items what you heard from the five six predictions that we talked about David foyer what's your action item so my action item is for CIOs and CTOs is to take a pause on IOT and look for vendors that have solutions which can be put in easily and quickly and span o T and I T in the IOT space we are waiting what's your action item I think a lot of activity around AI and there's going to be an explosion of it in 2018 but most of it's not really going to be AI it's going to be machine learning and machine learning is really just math and floating points is different like AI know science it's neurology it's biology and physics and sociology it's all science and I think that summer steam learning is there on the horizon that life that it's not so we need to make sure we're clear about what announcements and what not is machine learning versus artificial on top Jim Camillus what's your action item I think is to revisit IBM's prospects in the AI market and deep learning going forward and if we visit on a positive note actually does IBM essentially turned around their cognitive strategy in the last year when they focus on the power AI approach which is really framework agnostic and so forth the AI space that's actually shaping up it's different for women IBM others envision at the start of this decade so really 2018 we're gonna see IBM come out so I believe as a provider of the core where the providers of the core framework agnostic data deep learning a development of platforms new industry that's my prediction David Ronn Terry what's your action item I think if you're a startup you really have to take a hard look at your business and the value that you're bringing to market and be honest if you're not delivering something that the cloud guys can't deliver or don't want to deliver then I think you really got to think about either pivoting or exiting the business that you're in and as part of that I think you've got to find to George's point distribution channels and distribution partners that can help you with go to market at scale or you're in big trouble George Gilbert action item we've been talking about sort of the cloud wars and my recommendation to CIOs and senior IT leaders would be that when you if you want to hedge your bets you don't want to be all in on one cloud it's not dividing a workload across different clouds pick a cloud for a workload or for an application because it's portability is it's sort of more of a dream than a reality it's not about moving containers around you're in an API ecosystem you're subject to data gravity so it's almost like if you're going to do the equivalent of distributed computing you're going to put some part of the application on one cloud and some part in another cloud so the action items be smart about the relationship between new style of applications and architecture and cloud choices okay let me summarise meeting very quickly there's been a great conversation about predictions in 2018 you expect to see more from us over the course of the next month this is going to be a major theme of ours in November and into December so quickly the findings of these the technology industry made a major mistake with the dot-com boom and the mistake was a presumption that technology change necessarily meant economic change that is a false assumption the economics of Technology have been pretty well understood for quite some time and they're going to assert themselves even as we go through this significant transform a transformative period in the technology industry and the economics of volume are going to continue to be important and we expect that those economics coupled with the three factors of what's driving cloud architecture decisions the realities of physics geopolitical concerns and electric property concerns are going to lead to some significant changes in 2018 that we've only just conceived of what we expect that we're going to see an emergence of true private cloud that will continue to be crucial to how businesses think about their information technology overall infrastructure and plant and that's going to have an impact ultimately on where AI gets developed more from software vendors based on volume 2 we expect to see a significant impact on ultimately what happens in the VC funded world startups which have historically just presumed that there was no need for go to market that everything was going to be try and buy and then we'd scale from there start to hit the business realities of the consistence a consistency of the economics of volume 3 IBM we think is repositioning and somewhat paradoxically is likely to become more successful as a consequence as a provider of the technologies and make possible some of these new comprehensive complex a related oriented technologies and not just as a service provider very importantly i tom is going to become increasingly important and will see AI machine learning be an essential feature that in fact one of the places where we learn how to do it right and the pilot one is lots going on with blockchain but we expect greater distribution of applications greater distribution of data and the security technologies and the technologies for bringing that together and supporting the network formation of data and applications must be in place and that's going to be a major area of technology innovation in 2018 all right so this closes out our action item for this week once again on Peterborough's I'd like to as always thank the wiki bond team for participating with me today and we look forward to once again visiting with you from our from the cube studios here in Palo Alto California on the next action item thank you very much
