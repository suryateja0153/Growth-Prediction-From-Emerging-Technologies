 I'm Denver Colorado it's the cube covering supercomputing 17 brought to you by Intel hey welcome back everybody Jeff Rick here with the cube we're getting towards the end of the day here at supercomputing 2017 in Denver Colorado 12,000 people talking really about the outer limits of what you can do is compute compute power looking out into the universe and black holes and all kinds of exciting stuff but we're kind of bringing it back right we're all about democratization of Technology for people to solve real problems and we're really excited to have our last guest of the day bringing the energy our mcgunn Ahmed he's the SVP & GM hybrid cloud and ready solutions for Dell EMC in a mini time cube alumni aren't great to see you yeah good to see you Jeff so first off just impressions of the show 12,000 people we had no idea we've never been to this show Wolff yeah this is this is great I mean this is this is a show that has been around if you know the history of the show this was an I Triple E engineering show right that actually turned into you know a high performance computing around research-based you know analytics and other other things that came out of it but it's just grown and and we're seeing now you know yesterday the supercomputing top petaflop swirl released here so it's fascinating you have some of the brightest minds in the world right they actually come to this event right at 12,000 of them yes well in Delhi MC is here in force a lot of announcements a lot of excitement what are you guys excited about participating this type of show Jeff so when we come to an event like this right at HPC we know that HPC is also evolved from you know your traditional HPC which was around modeling and simulation and how it started from engineering to then clusters it's now evolving more towards machine learning deep learning and artificial intelligence so what we announced here yesterday our press release went out was really related to how our strategy of advancing HPC but also democratizing HBC's right so on the advancing on the HPC side you know the top 500 supercomputers list came out and you know were powering some of the top 500 of those one big one is tack which is a Texas Institute out of out of UT University of Texas and they now have I believe the number 12 spot and the top 500 supercomputers in the world running in 8.2 petaflop s-- off computing zeros no idea and and it's a bit it's available for you know machine learning but also you know eventually going to be available for deep learning but more importantly we're also moving towards democratizing HPC because we feel that democratizing is also very important where HPC should not not only be for the research and the academia but it should also be focused towards the manufacturing customers the financial customers our commercial customers so that they can actually take the complexity of HPC out and that's where we are you know we call it our HP c 2.0 strategy of learning from the advancements that we continue to drive right to then also democratizing it for our customers it's interesting I think back to the old days of Intel microprocessor was getting better and better and better and you had spark and you had soaking graphics and these things that were you know way better yeah this huge differentiation but the Intel you know I 30 teachers kept plugging along and it really begs the question where's the distinction now you have huge clusters of computers you can put together with virtualization yeah where's the difference between just a really big cluster and HPC and and supercomputing so I think you know if you look at HPC HPC is also evolving so let's look at the customer view right so the other part of our announcement here was artificial intelligence which is really what is artificial intelligence it's if you look at a customer a retailer a retailer has you know they start with data for example you know you buy beer and chips at Jay's retailer for example right you come in and do that usually used to run a sequel database oh you used to run a our DBMS database and then you know that would basically tell you okay these are the people come purchase from me you know their purchase history but then you evolved into bi and then if that data got really very large you then had an HPC cluster which basically you know analyzed a lot of that data for you and show you trends and things and that would then tell you okay you know what these are my customers this is that this is how many times they are frequent but now it's moving more towards machine learning and deep learning as well so as the data gets larger and larger we're seeing data is becoming larger not just by social media but you know your traditional computational frameworks your channel applications and others we're finding that data is also growing at the edge so by 2020 about 20 billion devices are going to wake up at the edge and start generating data right so now internet you know internet data it's going to look very small over over the next three four years as the edge data comes up right so you actually need to now start thinking of machine learning and deep learning a lot more so you ask the question how do you how do you see that evolving so you see an AR DBMS traditional sequel evolved into bi bi then evolves into either an HPC or Hadoop and then from HPC and Hadoop what do you do next what you do next is you start to now feed predictive analytics into machine learning kind of solutions and then once those predictive analytics are there then you really truly start thinking about the full deep learning frameworks right one clearly like the data in motion I think it's funny we used to make decisions on a sample of data in the past yeah now we have the opportunity to take all the data yeah in real time and make those decisions was it with Kafka and spark and flink and all these all these crazy yeah systems that are coming to play makes a dupe look ancient tired and yesterday yeah but it's still valid right a lot of customers are still big customers are using it and and that's what we feel we need to simplify the complex for our customers that's why we announced our machine learning ready bundle and our deep learning ready bundle we announced it with Intel and NVIDIA together because they feel like our customers either go to the GPU route which is you know your accelerators route we announced rah you were talking to Ravi from our server team earlier where he talked about the c40 140 which has the quad GPU power and it's perfect for deep learning but with Intel we've also you know worked on the same where we worked on the AI software with Intel and why are we doing all of this we're saying that if you if you thought that our DBMS was difficult and if you thought that building a Hadoop cluster or HPC was a little challenging and time-consuming as the customers moved to machine learning and deep learning you now have to think about the whole stack so let me explain the stack to you you think of a compute storage and network stack right then you think oh yeah that's right the Holy Trinity of our data center then you talk about our you know these frameworks like piano cafe tensorflow right these are new frameworks right they're machine learning and deep learning frameworks they're open source and others then you go to libraries then you go to accelerators which accelerators you choose then you go to your operating systems now you haven't even talked about your use case retail use case or genomic sequencing use case all you're trying to do is now figure out tensorflow works with this accelerator or does not work with this accelerator or does cafe and piano work with this operating system or not and that is the complexity that is way more complex so that's where we felt that we really needed to launch these new solutions and we pre launch them here at supercomputing because we feel the evolution of HP scene towards AI is happening right and then we're gonna start shipping these ready bundles for machine learning and deep learning in first half of 2018 that's what the ready solutions are you're basically putting exactly solution together for the client then they can start and you work together to build the application to fix whatever it is they're trying to do that's exactly it but not just fix it it's an outcome so I'm gonna go back to the retailer so if you are the CEO the biggest retailer and you are saying hey I just don't want to know who cuz who buys from me I want to now do predictive analytics which is who buys ships and beer but can who can I sell more more things too right so you now start thinking about you know demographic data you start thinking about you know payroll data and other data assets around you know you you start feeding that data into it so your machine now starts to learn a lot more of those frameworks and then can actually give you predictive analytics but imagine a day where you actually the machine or or the deep learning AI actually tells you that it's not just who you want to sell chips and beer to it's who's gonna buy the 4k TV and so that's that's important right and and that is where our customers need to understand how predictive analytics are going to move towards cognitive analytics so so this is complex but we're trying to make that complex simple with these ready solutions for machine learning and deep learning so I want to just get your take on you kind of talk about these three things a couple times how you delineate but you know AI yeah machine learning and deep learning yeah so so as I said right there is an evolution well I don't think a customer can achieve artificial intelligence unless they go through the whole crawl walk run space there is no shortcuts right what do you do so if you think about you know MasterCard is a great customer of ours they do with incredible amount of transactions per day as you can think right in millions yes and and they want to you know do facial recognition zat kiosks or you know they're looking at different policies based on your buying behavior that hey you know Jeff doesn't buy $20,000 Rolexes every every year maybe once every week Buddhist Emirates yeah exactly you're in Dubai and then and then you think about well you know his credit card is being used where and based on your behaviors that's important now think about for even for MasterCard right they had traditional RDBMS databases they went to be a bi they have high performance computing clusters then they developed a Hadoop cluster so what we did with them and said okay all that is good that that data that that has been generated for you you know through customers and through internal IT organizations those things are all very important but at the same time now you need to start going through this data and start analyzing this data for predictive analytics so they had 1.2 million policies for example that they had to crunch now think about 1.2 million policies policies that they had to say take decisions that did that they had to take decisions on one of the policies could be hey does Jeff go to Dubai to buy a Rolex or not or does Jeff do these other patterns or is arm gone you know taking Skaar didn't having a field day with it so those are policies that they feed into machine learning frameworks and the machine learning actually gives you patterns that they can now see what your behavior is and then based on that eventually deep learning is when they move to next and deep learning now not only you you actually talk about your behavior patterns on the credit card but your entire other life you know data starts to also it starts to also come into that and then now you're actually talking about something before it's you know for catching a fraud you can actually you know be a lot more predictive right and cognitive about it so that's where we feel that our ready solutions around machine learning and deep learning are really geared towards so taking HPC to then democratizing and advancing it and then now helping our customers move towards machine learning and deep learning because you know these buzz words of a eyes are out there you know if your financial institution you're trying to figure out who is that customer was going to buy the next mortgage from you or who you're going to lend to next you want the Machine and others to tell you this not to take over your life but actually help you make these decisions so that your bottom line can can go up along with your top line right revenue and margins are important every customer it's amazing on the credit card example because people get so pissed if there's a false positive but the amount of effort that they put in to keep you from making fraudulent transactions if your credit card ever kids deny people go bananas right the behavior just is amazing yeah but won't ask you we're coming to the end of 2017 yeah which is hard to believe things are rolling at Dell EMC Michael Dell ever since he took that thing private you could see the sparkle in his eye yeah we got it on the cube interview if you guys back a year from now Johnny 18 what are we going to talk about what are your top priorities for 2018 so so number one I mean you know Michael continues to talk about that our vision is advancing human progress through technology right that's our vision we want to get there but at the same time we know that we have to drive IT transformation we have to drive workforce transformation we have to drive digital transformation and we have to drive security transformation all those things are important because lots of customers I mean Jeff do you know like 75% of the S&P 500 companies will not exist by 2027 because they're either not going to be able to you know make that shift from Blockbuster to Netflix or you know uber taxi you can think about any customer that's what Michael did Michael actually disrupted right Dell with Dell technologies and the acquisition of EMC and pivotal and VMware in a year from now you know our our strategy is really about edge to core to the cloud we think the world is going to be all three because the rise of twenty billion devices at the edge is going to require new computational frameworks but at the same time people are going to bring them in to the core and then cloud will still exist but a lot of times let me ask you if you were driving a autonomous vehicle do you want that data you know it's not gonna go right you want it at the edge because data gravity is important and that's what that's where we're going so it's gonna be huge we feel data gravity is gonna be big we think core is going to be big and we think cloud is gonna be big and we really want to play in all three of those areas and that's when the speed of light is just too damn slow the car you don't want to send it to a data center you want those decisions to be made at the edge you know your manufacturing floor needs to make the decision at the at the edge as well you don't want a lot of that data going back to the cloud I think all right thanks for bringing the energy to wrap up our day and it's great to see you as always always good to see you guys thank you Jeff Rick you're watching the cube from super keating supercomputing summit 2017 thanks for watching we'll see you next time [Laughter]
