 I just want to keep my options open. When I was doing my A-levels it was the same thing. Always just looking for the broadest avenue that I could take. My undergrad, I did a psychology degree which I actually did here, at the University of Bath. It was a good all-round degree that allowed me to explore lots different things. So I went looking for jobs  and landed myself in a summer job. I liked the work I was doing but at the same time a lot of the software that we were using,  they're quite outdated, very little support for them. I found that quite frustrating. I'd always been sort of interested in computer science and it definitely inspired me to learn and maybe find myself in a role one day where I could be building systems that could help people. The course is quite collaborative and fosters this sort of environment where you're always sharing ideas and talking to people and everybody on this course wants to do well and wants everyone else to do well. The lecturers were always made themselves available. I chose to do the module called  Intelligent Control and Cognitive Systems and we were building robots out of Lego and setting them off so to roam around the room and I've enjoyed all the coding that we've done on the course,  I find it a good challenge. A Computer Science degree is just so sought after, so valued. And think that's what I've found pretty much everywhere that I've gone. Now people are like knocking on my door. The world thrives on data these days, you know. It's the most valuable asset that you can have. The study of computer science holds the answers to the questions that you might not even be facing yet. You're designing something that's making someone's life in some way, easier. You do something that you  have a sense of ownership over. Just how can you top that as a feeling?
