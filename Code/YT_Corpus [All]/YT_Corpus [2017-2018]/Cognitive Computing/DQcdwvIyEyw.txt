 all right so thank you for the introduction and thank you for sticking around to the last session of Friday and so my name is Desiree and I'm Coeur D as said in Northumbria New Castle but I will present today fireflies - which was done as part of my master's at the idea of University of Technology together with Saskia Barker and very FM and to start this presentation I want to share with you the motivation for this work so for teachers we see that they are required to do multiple activities at the same time often simultaneously to be operate to do so and and we also see a more increased request or an increase in personalized education meaning more personal attention for each individual pupil and think of the difference that people's have in learning mathematics learning language skills or the difference in how they learn so individually more classroom based or more activity based so this all requires teachers to adapt his or her teachings to a really diverse classroom and often with different cultural backgrounds as well so in addition we do see more social and collaborative activities which can really help in the information retention or in a development of social skills so there are some technologies that are being developed to support the teacher with this aim and think of peer tutoring or more adaptive learning materials or help in administrative tasks though our second motivation is that often these technologies require a graphical user interface or they introduce additional actions or activities to be to be operated or to be done within their already busy everyday routine so we are interested in whether and how we can develop supportive technologies that can relieve some cognition so the teacher can redistribute this to other activities at hand so we approach this with two things in mind so firstly we're interested in the distribution of our cognition into our environment so to aid our cognitive processes and as is argued in cognitive science this cognition can be distributed situated or extended within our environment among among multiple people multiple persons or artifacts think of the example of writing something on a post-it so you don't forget groceries while shopping so secondly we believe that if these devices or these technologies are accessible within our periphery such as ambien devices or peripheral interactable devices we think the integration of classroom technologies would barely interfere with current teaching activities or current teaching loads so a starting point for our work was done by a la Viennese colleagues and bucer and her colleagues and on the Left students can rotate a lantern to indicate their progress where do they have a question how long they've been waiting for help and on the right which is clearly our predecessor of our work we present today are the fireflies and they enable the teacher to send short messages to the pupils using a tangible to place on the hip and we believe these system designs although they intended to achieve something different than we present today they show an interesting and suitable way to distribute some information within the classroom within the environment so we present today the redesign of this first Firefly set which is called fireflies - and it enables or exists out of one tablet for the teacher to send signals to pupils and exist out of multiple light objects each one for one individual pupil so using the tablet the teacher can send or change the color of all the bottom halves of each of the light objects either individually or they can change them all at once and the pupil can use the top half they can change the colors of the top half were either rotating to change the color or by pressing them down to turn them off I'll show you a short video clip later on so each light object exists out of a battery because the PCB to make this wireless connection four LEDs with a divider to make up the two colors of the light rotary encoder to measure the pupil actually rotating the object and also a 3d printed shell - to finish the light object we also have one additional microcontroller which enabled the communication between tablets and all the light objects so as set the teacher can change the bottom half individually of each light object using a tablet or if they prefer they can change all the light objects at once and on the other hand the people can change the top half of each light object by rotating to change the color and pressing down would actually turn the top half off so as the adaptation of such a technology can take up some time and because we were interested in how it is to work with such a set on on the long-term everyday we conducted a long-term deployment in the field and used to Firefly two sets in two different classrooms of one primary school so we had two classes with each two part-time teachers both female or over female and the one of them work from Monday to wednesday in the other work from Thursday and Friday so the same class and we had a fourth grade with pupils aged 7 to 8 and we had a third grade with pupils aged 6 and 7 and our approach was as follows we conducted the 9 weeks user study in the field over deployed them in the classroom two weeks were holidays so we had 7 weeks of use we conducted the starting interview before - evaluation interviews in between and one exit interview at the end unfortunately we had one teacher who refrained from participation after the fifth week but I'll come back to that in the results and we also conducted a pupil session we wanted to get some sense of experience from the pupils themselves it was a drawing activity but due to time it's more explained in the paper so you can look up there so let's first take a look at how the set was used by both classrooms and I should mention that the meaning of the colors was not predefined so the teachers and the pupils could choose them the meaning of the colors themselves but we did request them to choose within the first week so that in the second week they started with the fixed set of meanings of the colors so here we see in overview what the colors meant so on the Left we have the bottom half which is the teacher's ability to change and on the right the pupils and both classes used red and green to give either or the teachers use red and green to give a warning or a compliment and though the fourth grade used blue to get the attention from all pupils and the third grade grade used blue to get the attention of one pupil and ask them to come forward and on the student side the pupil side they used red and green both classes to indicate whether they could be disturbed and only the 4th grade used a yellow and blue to either indicate they joined a classroom instruction or whether they had a question for the teacher so this more complex overview gives an idea of how the teachers use the tablets and so what is clear from this graph is that the 3rd grade used more individual second signals so they only send one they change the color of one light there are more stripe bars on the right the fourth grade used more classroom signals so there are more wide bars there's more area there so what is interesting to point out here and what was also confirmed in interviews is that the third grade said all the light objects are green for starters so everyone was doing an okay job you can see the taller white bar on the right here at the green light so when the pupil would misbehave or not behave as as wanted they changed that individual light to red though they changed it back to green once they recovered from this misbehavior and you can see the two large tri bars on the on the right with red and green and a set in the fourth grade so on the left side that class used blue to get the attention of all pupils they changed it back to false when it was no longer applied and there is where the two large white bars are presented on the left so next I would like to share with you more qualitative findings of our so we transcribe the evaluation interviews and did an open coding session with the selected quotes this means that we didn't have predefined clusters the clusters emerged from the open coding the quote grouping themselves I'll present five clusters so the first cluster revolves around the more self-consciousness of behavior and those of the pupils in particular so it seemed that the lights offered some way to assess the behavior of the pupil so for instance a red light would indicate misbehavior and teacher could use this red light to start a discussion with that pupil on its behavior though the pupils also seem to use that light as a representation of their behavior as well and in this example teacher 3 experienced that the pupils were bringing their lights with them if they needed to go to the teacher and a teacher thought teacher 3 in this case thought that they were doing so as they wanted to see the light turn back to green when they were behaving in a good way or they were doing the right thing so the second cluster focus more on cognitive offloading we saw some examples where during deployment where the fireflies had seemed to aid the memory of things so teachers would not have to remember something's so to illustrate the fourth grade teachers used when the pupils turn them on blue the lights they had a question and the teacher could see where she was needed in by just looking in the classroom though not a clear example is that it's also in a fourth grade that during some Mobile's moments people can choose whether they work individually or they join the classroom instruction if they did they turn their lights on yellow and this allowed the teacher to see who was participating so she didn't need to remember this and in previous cases she often makes a mistake of grabbing the attention of a pupil who was not participating so now she could see you rather and try to remember and the third grade the third cluster revolves around class management so aside from the teachers indicating they walked a lot less or that the lights and their preference of the pupils motivated some to work together we also saw that the deployment introduced some additional tasks so one of them escorted by teacher two is that the message the color of the light objects displayed their message for a longer time than compared when this was done vocally this meant that the teachers are required to change the color back or to another state when the message no longer applies which was not the case in the previous situation where we only did vocal messages so the 4th cluster more focused on awareness of rules and an example here is that the third phrase used a traffic light on their smart board and if this traffic light would be in a red all the pupils were supposed to work in silence and now with the fireflies set they ask the pupils to also turn their light objects on red meaning that they were not supposed to be disturbed and teacher 3 felt that that when the pupils turn the lights themselves the emphasis on this rule was or it was more emphasis on this classroom rule and she also thought that it might be the case due to doing it actually physically setting the rule for themselves lastly we have a crystal on facial cues and as each light object represents and represents some information the whole classroom can represent some information as a as a dis player and as teacher to puts it as you could see in one glance if there was help needed somewhere or whether some people was not supposed to be disturbed by looking or glancing in the classroom so aside from these findings we also have a few limitations we we notice so one of them was that the teacher from the tablet would occasionally freeze and the teachers were asked to restart the app when this would occur and though in addition is the limitation we had was a charging station as displayed here the light objects could only be placed in one particular orientation which took some fiddling and three teachers let the pupils put them on the charging station themselves but it required some time the one teacher we didn't want it to do that way so she did it by herself introducing additional time she needed to take at the end of the of the day and this these two limitation was actually the reason why one teacher refrained from participation after after the fifth week so I just want to look at out of fireflies too can be used as classroom supportive technology so firstly we believe that the fireflies were able to extend some cognition into the classroom as it allowed some teachers as it allowed the teacher to not remember some information and thereby relieving some of this discarnated float though it does seem to be more effective when we use more individual signals just to illustrate when you send a signal to one pupil compared to when it was done vocally it wouldn't disturb any other pupils at that moment and in addition the overview of all lights can only represent some additional information if each light can have a different color if they are all the same the overview doesn't really represent something on its own and we really saw this moreover in the third grade where they used to set more on an individual basis however this third grade was also the youngest of both and they were still learning to cope with rules in general and this questions the ability of the fireflies set to act as some performance measure for teachers or for pupils so and in addition we do believe that by being able to show your preference to be disturbed or not it allowed some means of expression and we think stripe pupils might not have done this before without a set having yourself and secondly the pixels got some meaning through their location as a distributed display and we we think this helped as the teachers could see where they were needed by glancing in the classroom so compared to the previous design the Firefox one I would say this and set also enabled two-way communication and we believe this shows more information in general general such as having a question or participating but also or hidden information such as this preference to be disturbed or not however improvements can be made and we think especially on terms of the cognitive demand to operate the system so the tablet the freezing of the app or the charging station so there we can improve definitely and we are as some colors were not used we are interested but also working on adding more implicit data such as from the online learning environment as a homework progress or anything else that we do envision more ways how we can deploy this set in the field so thank you and please let me know if you have any questions on assets [Applause] I see what you mean Tech this is really interesting work it's good to see the growth from Dillon Birds Lantern I had some questions I was wondering if you observed any changes in attention and focus within the class when when these tools were around and then the second thing I wanted to see was did you see any buddy use these tools as surveys or participation in the class to do like a vote what do you think is a DC yeah so thank you for the question so the first one focus on the attention and we didn't really had a really clear answer from the teachers from the interview though they did say that or did occur that as the light is on their desk even though they're focusing on their work they might perceive the change of color in their lights object compared to a nonverbal communication from the teacher though in the previous cases the teacher would use some words or language so verbally and that then they would also grab their attention that this might then again disturbed other pupils so there was some difference there but yeah I wouldn't go too far into detail in that sense and so I hope that answers a bit the first question the second one so we totally did not implement this kind of functionality as a questionnaire thing and I think maybe because it's the first thing we tried with this set and and the age of the pupils is quite young so the third grade in the Netherlands at least is the first grade from kindergarten I think so they were still needing so they were still learning with any rules in general and and you could notice when walking around or being there they're they're really their attention drifts quickly so I'm not sure if if it would be possible for that age but it's especially compared to the lantern example there could be more functionality in different stages of school so yeah thank you good afternoon I'm Jamie from the US Embassy I have a few questions going back to the performance measure so did where the teachers interested in the metrics from the back end at the end to see you don't to use it as a performance measure to see how many times that I tell this child to behave when you care about that at this point so maybe but we didn't talk about it so I guess it didn't came up as a as a request or a suggestion I'm not sure why maybe as we introduced it as this is the way how you can use it only not saying which colors meant what though in functionality we didn't really discuss any other ways to go into so that might be where we could have gained a bit more interesting future steps and that's yeah also did you have any issues with colorblind children not reported no that's a good question how do we research the hard-of-hearing schools deaf and hard-of-hearing schools what they're using and perhaps this would be something useful for them as well what kind of schools hard-of-hearing for children that are deaf all right we didn't think about it so it's a good suggestion yeah so we we fit especially for I think if you would call them special interest groups in that sense they might have more potential yes but that we should do something separately in that that case I'd say a good suggestion yeah thank you there's thank talk
