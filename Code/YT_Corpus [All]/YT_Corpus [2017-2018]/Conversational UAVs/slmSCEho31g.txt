 hello welcome to a new video series about chatbots so this series is going to find itself in my programming with text quartz which I started about a year ago and made a whole bunch of videos for now year later I want to add some content to it and so what I want to add is about check BOTS so I want to okay so first of all what is a chat bot so I'm gonna use the Wikipedia definition which says a chat bot is a computer program which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods so this is the kind of thing that's already in a lot of my examples where you know users are typing in text and it gets processed and some other text comes out maybe on a web page I have this whole series on Twitter BOTS those Twitter BOTS you could consider chat BOTS that conversation might be just one way it's a bot that just tweets once an hour says something to the audience nobody replies or it could be a one-to-many conversation where anytime somebody tweets at the Twitter bot the bot replies with something it could be two BOTS talking to each other so the chat bot is this is a brook this is a broader term than things that I've actually looked at before I've just looked at specific kinds of chat BOTS without mentioning the word chat bot so now what I do is say like well what if we really think about a computer program having a conversation with a human and can we achieve that with in the browser with open source tools can we also then once we do that think about oh we could make stuff for a commercial medium like Twitter or it could be a voice conversational interface with hello Siri apparently these markers are not smart markers somebody will invent that though where I can just ask my marker a question but no problem alexa expo what is the weather today in new york okay apparently my little expo whiteboard spray marker it would have been nice if this was really spontaneous but i did this earlier and I'm remaking this video trying to make this jokes Mantes it's not working okay so but I forgot that I had appreciation that I was doing a chat pod is a computer that's the conversation via auditory or textual method so I want to get to all this stuff on a look at some open source tools mix up having the browser I want to see can we do stuff with voice and speech recognition can we interface with commercial products that I'm now apparently buzz marketing for free beautifully in this video so there's there's a long history of this tradition of computers having conversations and by no means is this I'm now about to give you a presentation of the history of this and I'll try to include some links in particular to a an article that that actually gives you a history of chat BOTS that it's a wonderful article that I'll link to in this video's description but lives are probably being one of the most famous ones from 1966 and it's simulated conversation using pattern matching and substitution so this is something that I want to type what are the different techniques for making a chat bot how do you determine how does the bot the computer program understand what the person said how does the bot reply is it hard-coded typed replies is it machine learning neural network generated replies these are some things that I won't explore in these videos another famous example is Alice from 1995 artificial linguistic internet computer and Tina is the best acronym ever well this is why I want to mention Alice is with Alice came something called AI ml artificial intelligence markup language so a markup language essentially for writing a script for a chat bot so if the user says this the chat bot says this that the user says this the chat bot says this and the script looks something like this so there can be this idea of a pattern as well as a there could be this idea of setting a topic or reply templates this whole kind of so this is a I encourage you to investigate this at Alice pot org the reason why I'm mentioning this is my first video is gonna start using something called rive script which is an open source chat bot brain making tool kind of similar to with the zones from markup and syntax similar to Alice so these are some important considerations this is that article that I was referring to so I highly recommend you go and read it if you want to kind of learn a bit about the history of chat bots and also where this idea of deep learning neural networks could possibly fit in which I will get to in a future video but some things you really want to think about are models of conversation so retrieval versus generative so I'm gonna start with retrieval based systems which are much simpler meaning I just have like this script of what the bots can say and I'm trying to match some sort of pattern of what the user is saying and reply in a given way versus a generative system where I might have an algorithm that spot that generates what the what the bot says in any way whatsoever long versus short conversations I want to stick with short conversations so how do I make a bot that just can tell a knock-knock joke or respond to a knock-knock joke that's a short conversation or guess a guess a number that's actually one of the examples I'll make in a future video of that's already been hey that's what I'm able to reference it about a chat bot that you that thinks of a number and you try to guess it open versus closed domain so are you making a chat bot that's like just about how to order you know ordering a pizza versus I am a psychology bot and talk to me about any of your problems I will respond so completely open domain so again I want to start with to learn about chat BOTS and be able to prototype and make things quickly and easily I want to I'm gonna start with short closed retrieval based systems but hopefully as this video series expands I might be able to investigate generative systems longer conversations more open open domain conversations and again a lot of my refresh my learning and references about this came from this wonderful article here so write script this is where I'm gonna start I like to try to use open source free things as much as possible although I think to really push experiments in this conversational interface direction a voice stuff we're gonna have to at some point use some things made by large company as an interface with their API is similar to what I did with Twitter so rice Script is great because it's a simple scripting language it's based off of this idea of artificial intelligence markup language but it's slightly different and even simpler it just has a handful of simple rules I'm gonna try to go through some of them with you but honestly I'll show you the page where it just describes all the rules it's kind of thing you're gonna want to read yourself it's open-source license to MIT so you can use it for it's very open-source permissive license and you can use it with a variety of programming languages go java javascript perl python maybe more but so I'm going to use it with JavaScript so in the next if you keep watching this this is why I've last look at this I made a slide presentation aren't I aren't ia good presenter of things on the internet with my slide presentation so if you continue to watch these videos we'll have a slide presentation again I will start by just talking you through the basics of arrive script I will then make a look at using write script in the browser with JavaScript and eventually I'm going to look at it with some a library called p5 speech which allows me to further for me to use speech to text and text to speech from the browser and then eventually move past that as well so I hope you watch some of these chatbot videos and make some stuff and give me your feedback [Music]
