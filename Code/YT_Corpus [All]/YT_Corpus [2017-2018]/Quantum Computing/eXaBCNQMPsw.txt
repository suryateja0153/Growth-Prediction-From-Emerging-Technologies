 It's wonderful opportunity to be here, and you know coming back to Canada again is Wonderful. I You can see from this I wondered if we're actually the opposite parts of the Earth, but it's a little bit off obviously you know where your Antipode is and so I'm somewhere down there. Is where I come from What I'm going to talk about is quantum theory of time it's my theory It's I have to be quite courageous to present this work. It's stuff I've been working on for about ten years I've only published three papers on it Doing other work at the same time It's controversial, but it's very Fundamental so you might think about time the direction of time, and this is a big issue In physics about why are we seemingly moving towards the future? Philosophers have a lot to say about you know there is no flow of time We have this model of you might have heard of it the block universe where there is no time. It's a four-dimensional space-time block and There's no present although I feel like I'm standing here before you but The objectives are view of this as there is no flow And what people tend to do is they look to thermodynamics to give us well these things that are called arrows of time for explaining the direction now if You look at this slide to what I've got here is an analogy Imagine there's a tree, and there's some wind blowing and the wind blows the leaves on one side of the tree now what you would say is the pattern of the leaves on one side of the tree would tell you that the Direction that the wind is blowing but the Pattern of the leaves Doesn't make the wind blow and what people do with some entropy Associated increase in Entropy the Sedona Germanic arrow They think that it's sort of creates time it creates the dynamical nature of time But it's just evidence so an increase in entropy is just evidence that there's something dynamic going on But it doesn't create it okay, so it's really kind of dead I've been thinking about an entropy increase is really gonna tell us nothing about the nature of time at all and That's probably the most Controversial thing I can say because so many people are convinced they found the entropy is is what you need to really focus on I Published a paper last January that kind of went viral which I'm really happy to say So that's the reference quantum asymmetry between space and time what I was interested in is that From relativity we would like to think where space and time being interconvertible, but there's something that really makes them different And that's dynamics. I'll talk more about this later, and I wanted to see why we have that difference. Well, I published that paper last year reddit or if you Look at Reddit, but it was voted 5000. So there's a lot of discussion there. I didn't really I didn't reply to anything but People were really getting into it and trying to understand it which I thought was really really nice So it has had 50,000 reads 8,000 downloads and new scientist voted is one of the best five theories of time So I mean at least I've got a fan in new scientist I think it's the best theory because the other theories were very sort of old Been around for some time seem to do with entropy where's the low introduced they come from and things like that They don't really solve an anomaly though. They're just other ways of trying to Make a more satisfactory Approach to time or thinking about time in a more satisfactory in a satisfactory way what I'm doing is actually solving an anomoly so You have to identify these things so my message today to young people is to always look for these anomalies If you come across one, it's going to be Well, it's very difficult to go through and solve them. I mean that's huge anomalies aren't there. There's a dark energy You don't even know it's dark energy. Chandra just gave a wonderful talk just before The Dark Matter problem that's an anomaly. We've solved these anomalies by changing our paradigm Einstein solves an anomaly to do with the speed of light concepts being light and so on There's other and well not so much anomalies with incomplete lists like the quantization of gravity But there's so many people working on these things you have to be really clever to compete The best anomalies the ones that people don't even know that they're anomalies and If you're clever enough to find them then that's the thing to go for and what I've always done right from my student days is You know how when you the best way to study is not to look at the answers to work things out for yourself? Well, I've done that all the way through not look I see a paper. I try and work it out before I Before I read what the authors have done and things like that, so I've really tried to to keep this But when the but what you would call it some sort of creative process of thinking trying to solve things It all comes down to t violation and Chandra mentions the K the K on an anti K on and problem before this is CP violation a Related to CP violations t violation so t violation is the violation of time reversal symmetry all our laws are refer Time Reversible there you have exactly the same dynamics in both directions but this K ons and b mesons Exhibits Dynamics, which is not time reversible, but there's quite different from Entropy Entropy is not the kind of thing, entropy you can have entropy increase with Time symmetric laws It's really about boundary conditions, but here. It's really about dynamics so if you look at and this particular experiment is lots of different experiments, but you have a and Anti-B. Meson neutral b meson evolving into a minor superposition of b meson and it's anti particle. You know the anti B. Because it's a superposition of the two and This other experiment here is looking at the that superstition changing into a b The anti b and they take different times and this is evidence that there's two Hamiltonians one for forward direction in time and one for the reverse this is the time. I'll talk more about the time Reversal operation here there, so there are two hamiltonians the problem is is So t violation tells us there are two hamiltonians Two versions of the Hamiltonian, but all our physical theories only have one Hamiltonian I've got a Hamiltonian formalism, or there's only one Dynamics they only produce or model one set of dynamics, but there should be two So this is an anomaly most people don't like to to talk about it There's all these ways that. I'm talking about t violation and dismissing it as something that happens in Little particles Can't affect us on a large scale but when you think about time looking at Things like entropy, which is the standard way of looking at these things is talking about? using time symmetric laws with time asymmetric boundary conditions an asymmetric boundary conditions it seems like you know low entropy to begin with and large entropy later on an Asymmetric boundary conditions won't help us understand. What time is they're just very easy to talk about but if you've got a time a symmetric dynamical law that's going to tell you something about time and It's just been really on dismissed and not really looked at so I was asked to write a paper for a book or chapter for a book This really discusses the anomaly I highlight. What the anomaly is So there's a link it's open access and Easily downloaded so it's it's written for the non physicist So the idea if I just go back to this slide here so is you've got two hamiltonians if we're going to develop a theory to include two hamiltonians if There's two sets of dynamics associated with those hamiltonians then maybe we need to rethink what dynamics is So that's my approach is to rethink Dynamics and we might need to throw some things away and justify them justify it Later on so it's Rethink Dynamics Well you know from special relativity that space and time are somehow inconvertible are interconvertible The minus sign which tells us. You know we treat space a little bit different from time It's not really saying that they're different. It's really a speed limit or a ratio between the two so Apart from that speed limit at space and time can you know take two take on well? It's interconvertible The Dynamics however if you look at dynamics there What they what dynamics, it-it's about evolution Over time so you can have things that are localized in space But because of dynamics there can't be localized in time for example. You can have a particle. That's got a wave function in space That's fine It doesn't exist over here or there and you can normalize that wave function But over time you can't have a wave function like this that there's no particle here It's a particle here that there's no particle there Okay, so this is idea of localizing in space, but not localizing in time And that's because we have dynamics that carries particles all of all through time and conservation laws That's what a conservation law is it's telling us about dynamics. It's a well. It's a quality of dynamics the symmetry of dynamics But if we really want to stick to this idea that space and time are interconvertible Then shouldn't we be able to have this that shouldn't particles be able to be Localized in time what that means we have to give up Conservation laws we have to give up equations of motions and conservation laws So I want to tell you how to be so courageous to do that So when we started this work? I sort of felt like well. I don't think I call myself a physicist for a while I'll just put that aside if I'm not if I'm putting aside Conservation laws and dynamical equations of motion then it's not really physics in the way that we think of it But so this is the idea We have at a fundamental level this is how particles should be They should come into existence and disappear in a sense in time so it's not that they're not conserved and So they can be localized in both space and time and what we want is something else to take us You know some phenomena to give us what we see so this is what we normally see if you have a particle that's located at a position It'll be located somewhere around maybe somewhere Maybe it's the same position that will be located in time in this conservation of mass that keeps this Wavefunction going through time and so you get so this is what we want some phenomena some phenomenally Phenomenon To give us this so we want it to emerge with what this set of basic structures are normally what we do is that when? We have a theory we assume that there's an equation of motion and there's conservation laws. We don't they know to merge their assumptions They're axiomatic one of the what I'm saying here. Is that I don't want them to be axiomatic I want them to come from somewhere, and I think this should help us understand. What time is Now if you look at the generators of translations in time and space what you notice is that? generators of translations in Space Well That's just the momentum operator it generates translations in space the generator of translations in time is a Hamiltonian Now these are very different very different generators these discrete symmetries like charge parity and time the charge conjugation party inversion and time reversal both discrete symmetries are violated by the Hamiltonian only But there's something really interesting about this generator of translations for time that you don't have for generation generators of translations over space, okay So we can get back to work hopefully we can get these symmetry violations For these generators to give us this phenomenological emergence of Dynamics and conservation rules so that so that's what I've tried, so this is the the idea if you look at generators of a Translation in space it's a momentum operator if you want to do the translation in the opposite direction with a minus sign here One way to do it is to well if you This is a translation in that direction, but we want to go in this direction. Well you can do a parody Inversion agent' Translation it in the same direction the positive direction and then a parody inversion and that gives you the opposite direction, and that's what this Combination here is okay. It's just translation the opposite Direction and the same thing for time in Time we have to be prepared that we've got two hamiltonians. Here's one, and I've got it like forwards Direction That's the one that we measure in experiments, and then there's this backward one Which is at the time the first time so here's the equation for the time? Unitary time operator translating a wave function forward in time to do the translation in reverse You know backwards in time. We would have this operator the other Hamiltonian now if we've got Paths that have a lot of reversals in time Then it'll expose the difference between the forward Hamiltonian and the backward Hamiltonian if we've only got if you've got no reversals in time, so if you've got a path just in One direction We'll only see one hamiltonian if it's in the opposite Direction We'll see the other hamiltonian if we want to see the class with the these two hamiltonians then we need lots of paths going backwards and forwards now if both Firemen introduced the idea of Sums over path, so that's the kind of thing. I'm talking about okay, so What we need is lots of reversals to see this phenomena of you know exposing the difference between these Two Hamiltonians and To see the symmetry violation so what we really want to see if then where maybe we should you know throwing away dynamics Why not look about Situation where we have partisan time that though backwards and forwards so we can have part of the backwards and forwards in space That's not a problem. So it should also happen in time So, so this is the idea so just a recap Current theories are not symmetrical in time because they have one set of dynamics, and this says they have one director time direction The universe can't decide on which direction and time to take it's got no reference for that And you can't just go in one direction of time. It's got to be symmetrical so something is wrong there We've got two Hamiltonians. So we need it if we have a Theory it should be Incorporate two Hamiltonians, and it should have two sets of dynamics and The approach, I'm going to take it's a cast aside these dynamics and conservation laws would have just said And I'm going to treat time and space on the same footing because that's the message we get from That's a message. We get from our special relativity and On to see this difference between the two hamiltonians we're going to look at lots of Reversals and And these reversals will have these two hamiltonians and the justification for doing this for throwing away these fundamental assumptions is that we would need to account for dynamics from this deeper cause from t violation and We need an experiment to verify it, so I'm not interested in just developing a theory That's just nice way of looking at things it's what theorists often do I really want to do something that maybe it would lead to an experiment and we can ask nature of what's the answer? okay, so There's four principles that are used to to to build this model this formulism But states should have the same construction and time and space okay, so repeat them on the same footing so you can have Particles of mass localized in space and time the time evolution is directional you've got two hamiltonians So one should be associated with this direction of time, so if we're moving in this direction This is an evolution in the for which direction we use this evolution operator if it's evolution the opposite Direction It's that evolution operate at different Hamiltonian these other things are just mathematical inverses. They're not evolution So there are is a difference between evolution and just in moving along a timeline evolution is something physical and this this idea Which no one's thought about doing that before of thinking about these hamiltonians talking about evolution which is something physical as opposed to just being operators that take you across and We need states, but to put in all these on reversals in the you know to get reversal so we can see different Hamiltonians Operating we use sums over paths So the idea is to have many reversal so here's a binary sort so here's the thing these operators to sum or forwards and backwards so it's just a binary tree taken to the power of N, and What that means is that we start at some point on this spatial axis? And then we go where you go into a superposition of one step forward and one step backwards. That's just one turn The square would be four terms and so on Okay, and we allow n to get very very large which means that the step size becomes very very small And eventually goes below the resolution and this is the kind of thing that you do in path integrals that Fineman introduced us to and that will then lead to a wave function So this part going backwards and forwards on space gives us a wave function. Which is a gaussian which is a you know standard description Of a path particle that's localized in space. We do the same thing in time with throwing away conservation laws so that doesn't matter, but now we've got our generator of translations in the forwards directions in the backless Direction So on exactly the same and we end up with being able this is a wave function for localizing a particle in time That's when these two hamiltonians are equal. It's localized in in time And then there's another part because we actually end up with some sequences which don't converge We need to think about the resolution limit eventually this Step size gets so small That we end up with lots of states that look exactly the same so what we want to do is when the step size does go below a certain size goes below a certain size Like the planck scale or something like that. We want to collect all those states that we get Into a certain so they're all physically equivalent. They can all equally represent the state of this particle Okay, so we have these quantum virtual paths representing the same localized state if we do that in time So now this is the quantum time So there's maybe it's the planck time that we're looking at It's just something small that we can't get to it doesn't really matter. What it what it is When the step size is smaller than that And the step size that this Delta t. Here is getting smaller as n gets bigger we collect them into a set and Here's the set, and they're all all the states that you develop from this Expansion all those states are equally able to represent this Particle localized in time. That's when The two Hamiltonians are equal and that means that there's no t violation. That's just time symmetry Okay, so in this theory, so just this is under formalism mass is not conserved, and there's no dynamics when there's no t violation But if we put on teeth, so that's the original thing that we wanted. There's no dynamics That's done. It now if this t violation, what's important in sorting out all these parts is that you find that there's many paths to the same place and When you have t violation you get phase differences, and you get destructive interference, so there's destructive interference here but constructive in other places and that comes into a the commutator of these two Hamiltonians and Then with this destructive interference what we get is not one gaussian, but two gaussians that are separated and So there's a sequence now in this set now. We said that said when there's no team violation We said that that set should every state in that set should represent this particle It should be equally likely to represent this particle now a teen violation all those states in this set a coordinate sequence where if You know bimodal is too gallant a superposition of two gaussians, and those gaussians are getting further and further apart And it's unbounded they just go out forever in other words. It kind of like explodes, but it's really an unbounded sequence so So you find that these are the two things you can write it as a superposition of two the RCMP's and so there's one Gaussian here, and this minus sign represents the other one now if I said Does that particle exist, but look before if I said over here with there's no t violation if I can just go fast if I said Just a particle exists at t equals naught you look over here And you'd say well all the states in this set are there. This is a collection of them Yes they say that there's a high probability finite at the origin if I ask if the particle going to be found Over here on the time axis. You'd say no If there's no probability so mass is not conserved But now look what happens with t violation in this set? So here's the set of states each of them has made up a superposition of two gaussians if I ask for a given time So I'm looking over here somewhere Is they're a state that represents the mass being at that time well. Yes, there is There was and that doesn't matter where you find it on the time axis there will be But I've got this little problem about the symmetry that what are the same You know for the minus value, I'm talking about a point on Positive time if there's a 50% chance it will be at minus as well the same value at minus time That's a little detail, but we can something to talk about Presumably if this is matter than that's antimatter, and there's a symmetry there and we can't really tell what we are I could go on and talk about that But I really want to really focus on the idea that that mass is now in One of these states and every time in other words we can recover Conservation of mass okay, so you can get that out of the theory of conservation of Mass and Dynamics if you just look at each of these states that you get here and look at a difference between them Then you find you get the schrodinger equation the hamiltonian is a little bit different because these Gaussians They have an average of paths going forwards and backwards they kind of average the forward Hamiltonian with a little bit of the backward Hamiltonian so this phenomenological Hamiltonian is a little bit different from what you'd expect So that's a possibility for experiment to determine that all those it's certain problems associated with that. I want to go into So there's a Schrodingers equation associated with each of the sets in fact It's an ordered set you can show that this set is ordered. There's an order there don't have to worry about entropy It's ordered automatically both Well it takes too much to describe it, but it's actually ordered by the time evolution evolution evolution operators So it's an ordered set of States And they get further apart and move along the time axis You can write down the schrodinger equation to derive it from here. So that's actually derivabil from it and and mass is concerned, so So I've got now this this idea I mean, there's another branch over here, but if we just focus on the positive benefits of that one and I've accounted for the discarded assumptions of dynamics and mass conservation by a deeper cause I've never recovered Other thing is that Is it's verifiable by experiments and well yes in principle it is There's a number of ways one is looking at the Hamiltonian with another. It's just looking for variations in t violations, so the Peak of those Gaussians with t violation It's inversely proportional to Lambda where lambda was having lambda is this commutator the expectation builder commutator now if that commutator varies locally then Lambda will change and the people appear at a different place Okay, so this is like a quantum time dilation really controversial So the idea is that the peak The point where the peak in the Gaussian would be would depend upon How much local t violation that's going on if you look at a nuclear reactor There's a lot of anti neutrinos is from Beta Decay and neutrinos are assumed to normal neutrinos assumed to Exhibit our cp violation from flavor mixing and there are experiments to see that directly, but we assume that they exhibit CP violation and if they exhibit CP violation they should exhibit t violations and There's an enormous amount coming out of these these are commercial reactors, so something like four gigabytes Reasonable size not too big there are bigger ones and they have about ten megawatts some neutrinos and power coming out of them falling off as one over r squared and that means that the t violation Is really high at the core and decays well and in fact? Because of the commutator you get the density of one of our squared But the commutator brings it up to one r 4 so the gamma Factor that I would predict from this goes something like this it's about 1 but it's got this other factor here that decays it's 10 to the minus 4 and the sort of numbers looked at Nuclear reactors and this Lambda Factor here probably less than 10 to the minus 3 but we thought measurements of times are looking at time dilation that you know like mose pow spectroscopy goes down to 10 to the minus 11 and The atomic clocks can take us down to 10 minus 16. So there's quite a few orders of magnitude Checking this out So this is where experiments should be now all I said cook them completely be wrong kind of It's been nice doing this kind of work and they have to be quite courageous to actually talk about it because If you think about you know throwing away conservation laws and thinking about time in this really Remarkably different way, but the point is it's not me that decides whether it's a good theory or not its nature and if nature If this is found I mean, there's no reason to expect. There's any time dilation near a nuclear reactor if nature is showing this this would be quite remarkable so this is where the effort should be I think and there's other things that this doesn't work on really if it's the Maybe we need even bigger nuclear reactor than what we can We currently have I don't know but maybe stars are the thing to look at maybe there's some other effects out there anyway So I'm just telling you about my work. Which is really controversial I don't think everyone should be controversial because then it would be kind of madness And we don't have to talk to each other, but it's something to look out for little irregularities that Can really spice up your career and if you something to think about anyway, so that's that's that's my talk. Thanks for listening
