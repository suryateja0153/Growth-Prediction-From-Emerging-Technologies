 [Music] [Music] we are coming towards the end of this series of lectures for this course we have already covered ten weeks of learning about quantum computing and its implementations and in the last week we were going over some of the basics to make sure that we understand the concept of implementation again based on some of the basics and as we have been interacting more and more with the students we have also come to know that there are certain aspects which would help if we relook at them a little bit more one of the key elements of that happens to be density matrices and density operators so we start this week's lecture with this concept of density matrices and density operators we have introduced this earlier and mentioned certain aspects of it in relation mainly with respect to NMR and here we will be doing a little bit more understanding of it so that the missing elements or the implementation parts that we used density matrices implicitly can become clearer so when we talk about density matrix a code comes to mind that again is related to Richard Feynman where he made this statement that when we solve a quantum mechanical problem what we really do is divide the universe into two parts the system in which we are interested and the rest of the universe so this was quoted from his statistical mechanics lectures back in 1972 essentially stating that whenever we are going to talk about density matrices we are going to discuss about the statistics and the collective aspect of the part when we include the part of the universe outside the system the motivation of using the density matrices becomes clear so that's the basic idea that whenever we are going to include the part of the universe outside the system alone then the motivation of using density matrices become very clear and actually this is very pertinent to quantum computing as we will discuss here so essentially let us look at what these mean so most cases density matrices and density operators are used reversibly and often are used in one and the same way for both the cases so in general the statement that was made in the last slide is sort of more clearer in this term of the Venn diagram where we have an ensemble of the states that we are talking about with some probability for each of the states and that essentially forms the quantum system and that interaction of the quantum subsystem as a result of probabilities and their interactions is the fundamental point of view that we are taking so let us see what we will be mostly doing in this lecture and why we are doing it most of this lecture will be spent on mastering density matrices and the density matrix and so we would need to master a rather complex formalism in some sense and that's the reason why I thought I will go back on to this now where it has become an important point to understand might seem a little strange in the density of it is never essential for calculations it is a mathematical tool introduced for convenience and in our particular case the convenience meant that we were more inclined to use it for implementation aspects and mostly we have to bother with it as already we know because we have gone through the influencing processes but let me actually point it out again that the density matrices although it seems to be very deep abstraction but once you have mastered the formalism it becomes far easier to understand many other things including the concepts of quantum entanglement and quantum communication which we have already gone through before so that's the reason why we are relooking it and that's the reason why ad initially introduced it but never really got deeper into it but before closing our entire series of concepts on quantum computing I third we need to really look at it once motion so mathematically if we consider says Phi I and theta I to be the complete set of vectors in vector space describing the system so mathematically let phi i be a complete set of vectors in the vector space describing the system and theta i be a complete set for the rest of the universe the most general way to write the wave function for the total system is generally written in this form where both Phi I and Phi Theta J are composing the total system now let a be an operator which acts only on the system that is a does not act on theta I then what will happen is the operator a acting on the system would give rise to a result which would be given by this form of equation so when we apply this then we will have the observable would be having the form as given in this equation wherein we will find that this particular part can be represented in terms of the density matrix as we call it and that is the definition in how we start discussing about it so once again we have the vector space describing the system by Phi I and the complete set of the rest of the universe as theta I then the most general way to write the wave function of the total system is a composite of the two sy then we use an operator which acts only on the system which is how most of the operators that we choose work and then what we find is that we will be having a situation where if we find its expectation value for the wavefunction it will end up producing a result where we will be having the resultant coming from the part where the system is being interacted by the operator resulting in a part corresponding to this kind which is the density matrix that we are looking at so we basically have defined the operator row to be such that it is going to be having a form of this kind with the understanding that Rho is going to be hermitian so once we look at this one again where we have defined this part then we get doing a little bit of math as we show here that the trace of the operator for all the density matrix will give rise to the expectation value of the operator that we were looking at so due to the hermitian nature of Rho it can be diagnosed with a complete orthonormal set of eigen vectors with real eigenvalues WI so that the final density matrix would look like this Rho so we have essentially stated that the expectation value would be the trains of operator a with Rho and Rho which is our density matrix will be of this form and if we let our operator to be just identity then what we will get is the sum of all the eigen functions would be equal to just the expectation value in this case it would be 1 because it's the we have taken the operator to be 1 unity and if we let a to be of this form then we will have the eigenfunctions to follow as a result of this trace application a form which would be of this kind which means that our eigenfunctions are going to be either equal or greater than zero and the sum total of each of the eigenvalues would be equal to one so it is an orthonormal set of eigenvectors and real eigenvalues as the solutions which are with respect to the density matrix that we have defined Rho so that is the first criteria that we have to understand that the density matrix would always give us orthonormal set of eigenvectors and real eigenvalues so that is what we are getting any system is described by a density matrix Rho where Rho is of the form that we have just now defined summation all over I for the eigenfunction wi-with for the bracket notation that we have used the set K ty is a complete orthonormal set of vectors so these are the rules that we finally get out as a result of this mathematical understanding and given an operator the expectation value of a is given by a trace of Rho of a and we also noticed that this can be rewritten in this format which gives rise to the fact that WI is the probability that the system is in state I if all but one WI are zero then we say that the system is in a pure state otherwise is it not mixed it so this definition allows us to find out that the probability of the system and its weight edge factor and if it is only one state as we have just discussed that WI is the probability if all but one is zero then that particular state is the only one which represents the state and therefore it's a pure state otherwise it's in a mixed in that's the basic idea so in that sense there in city matrices of pure states are then represented as in terms of the vectors that we are doing the ket vector sy and all such states are called pure states an alternative way of representing quantum state in terms of density matrix therefore the way that we have just introduced and it is also as I mentioned reversibly used with the term density operators so the density matrix of a pure state is the matrix written in this form which as summation can be written in terms of the weighted factor for the states which are composing the size stick this is a particular way of representing density matrix which we'll get into more in detail now as an example the density matrix of say alpha 0 plus beta 1 can be written simply in this terms and which will then be the coefficient squares along the diagonals and their products along the off diagonals so the summation part of the statement that we had shown at the very beginning it can also be summarized in the matrix notation as we show here for a clear state for example we have conditions where we can have a wave function which is a composition of 1 over root 2 normalization factor upward spin and downward speed if we take this wave function then the density matrix can be written in this form and we find that the square of the density matrix is equal to itself and it's stress is equal to 1 traces by the way the sum of the diagonals if we consider a mixed state of 50% upward spin and 50% downward spin then we have a case which looks like this and in this case the the matrices will turn out to be in this fashion such that the final result of the density matrix will come out as this and in this case the Rose Square is not equal to Rho although the trace Rho is equal to 1 as before again if we take a 50:50 mixture of cat's-eye as we had shown before of spin going one direction versus the other direction and another wave function get Phi as 1 over root 2 and spin going upwards as spin going down and the negative sign between them then if we take the if we look at the density matrix we were once again fine it comes out to be a density matrix as given in the last case which is a mixed case and we find that Rho Square is going to be not equal to Rho again and the trace is again going to be equal so now the diagonal elements are always equal to 1 essentially that is the reflection of the fact that this diagnose elements are essentially giving the populations of the state so the total population is respective of how we look at it which is the trace is always going to be 1 and the off diagonal elements are the ones which will indicate something else and as we come to this is known as the coherence how much they are correlated to each other the correlation between these states because they are essentially corresponding to the coefficients of the two different states and their complex conjugate product and therefore when they have some correlations then that will represent the coherence of these states it's important to note that in both the cases we describe a system which we know nothing about its total of total ignorance because what we have done is we have put mixed it's in case of the second and the third case whereas in the first case where it was a pure state where row squares in the first case this was a case where we only had one state to look at so superposition state but it's essentially one state of spin going up or down but this is the state which is a pure state however in the cases where we looked at later on there were all mixed States and therefore we know nothing about those states it's a state of total ignorance and that's why it is important to get into the concepts of density matrices because for pure states it perhaps would not matter much as to what we talked about their properties and things like that but for mixed States the difficulty is that we cannot really come up with a way as to how to understand them so density matrices are ways where we can get to know about mixed States first of all identify them because whenever we find that the Rho is equal to Rho square which is our density matrix we know that it is a pure state whereas whenever it is Rho equal not equal to Rho square then we know that it is a mixed it and so that gives us some indication as to how to look at these things now the case of a matrix which we have been using a lot I just wanted to say um is give the clarification as I mentioned before it's the sum of the diagonal elements which for example in this case has been identified as the diagonal elements and it has some interesting properties which is that it's associative it has so a times B and B times a and all these laws for multiplication addition these things work and and also the unitary laws work with this so unitary operator acting on the state inside that race would make it remain the same and the trace of a matrix essentially can also be represented as the expectation value or of the wavefunction as long as this is an orthonormal basis Phii for instance so in terms of notation of density matches and then the traces this is how we go about doing it we generally represent as we have been saying a ket wave function as a superposition of two other states with with their coefficients and we can have them written as we have shown here that these coefficients are nothing but the which can be written in these terms and because they are also normal sets so the probability of getting zero when measuring this can be found out by using this kind of a mathematical form and what we find is that in this form also when we arrive at we get that the density matrix is the form that we are get arriving at where we are getting that the density matrix is what we are using when we use the trace so whenever we have going to make a measurement of a particular state and that's where the density matrix appears we we have this is a definition which we had already used that the probability of a particular measure is always the square of the coefficient and that's what we are utilizing and we can always find that in order to get the value of that we can always use the density matrix and that's one of the ways of saying that the density matrix would automatically help us in finding the probability of the or the contribution of a particular state to the composite state so the eigenstates of density matrices form complete bases for subsystem block that we have already seen the eigenvalues give the weight of the state and that is what we had discussed earlier and we can keep the m eigen States corresponding to the M highest eigen values M is just the running number here running digit eigen states of the whole system can thus be given by for instance the wavefunction which is equivalent to the route since the weight edge factors are the weight edge of the stator essentially the probability the amplitude of it would then be square root of this weight edge times the individual states that they are made of and this is the famous method decomposition that has been sometimes alluded to when we were doing our steps or processes in quantum computing or quantum information processing the this is an optimal approximation however because we are making a statement that we understand that they can be made to be decomposed in this kind of a state in case of entangled states the mutual quantum information is carried in terms of the entropy of the state which is often written in terms of the way how entropy is often defined and since the trace allows the logarithm to go through this kind of a process so we can dis the property of the trace that we looked at earlier so we can instead write the chase as in this form minus Rho log Rho and this will be equivalent to the weight edge vector terms the log of that so density matrix can be defined for pure coherent superposition or statistical average States and so it is a very powerful approach whereas in case of looking at the state alone it might often be difficult to find out what to do with them so the idea that these kinds of definitions work for all the cases whether it is pure whether it is having a coherent superposition or whether they are a statistical average of many states it gives us the advantage of using the density matrix formalism now when we have the concept of pure States it is much easier to understand because as we said that they basically represent one particular state however when we have mixture of pure states the state is described by a state vector and is called a pure state if we have a qubit which is known to be in pure state sy 1 let us say with probability P 1 and in situ with probability P 2 what will happen so that's the question to us when we have a state which is described by a state vector but can be in a mixture of pure states so more generally we consider the probabilistic picture of pure States called mixed States which is then given in terms of the overall wave function sy which is now going to have the probability of each wave function in terms of the particular composition so for example sy 1 with probability P 1 sy 2 with probability P 2 and so on and so forth so we we have these contributions which make up the final mixed state which is the size state so that density matrices of this mixed state would be having a probability distribution on pure state science called a mixed state the density matrix associated with such mixed state would then be given as sum total of the probability times the inner product of the two wave functions the implicit and the bra so the density matrix for says this particular mixed state 0 with probability 1/2 and 1 with probability 1/2 can be written in this form so the density matrix of the mixed state would then the probability of measuring the 0 would be given by the conditional probability such that and it is probability of measuring 0 given the pure state AI so then we can go ahead and find that it will be basically as we did this exercise before the probability of measuring the state 0 given the pure state AI would be the chase of the state zero the inner product of the two and the density matrix so the density matrices again coming into this picture whenever we want to measure the probability of the state whenever we have a bunch of other states available and we can always come back to this picture with the wave function is a composition of the probability of the inner product of the composite wave functions to give rise to the solution so density matrices contain all the information about an arbitrary quantum state now this is one of the most important part of studying density matrices because as I mentioned earlier we have limited information on the states as soon as they are going to become mixed it so for pure States it is possible to get enough information about the state and we can do operations to get the results out of it however for mixed state the only way to get information about it is as we have been showing is through the density matrices so now let's look at what it implies it implies that we can now work with operationally indistinguishable states which are these are expressions in terms of density matrices alone independent of any specific probabilistic mixtures states with identical density matrices are operationally indistinguishable now this is the corollary of the fact that the density matrices essentially carry all the information because in other words of saying that those states where the density matrices are going to be the same we will have very little to do with their particular understanding because if we are going to rely on the concept of density matrices to understand them so all the states where they have identical density matrices then they are operationally indistinguishable for us to start off with their studies now if we when we apply unitary operator to a density matrix of a pure state the resulting state is essentially the result of the unitary matrix with the density matrix so when we apply this we basically get the unitary on operation on the density matrix when we apply a unitary operator to a density matrix of a mixed state say for example state which has this kind of a behavior the resulting state is going to have the density matrices which will have the property which are going to be given by a dependency on the density matrix alone so if you notice the difference in the in the earlier case when we applied the unitary operation to the density matrix of a pure state the pure state is essentially the only state that existed in the wave function so the unitary operator initially resulted in only providing the information about the pure state directly the entire wave function could be operated on by the unitary operator however in this in this case when it is a mixed case so with the application of unitary operation we always get the result which is expected that density matrix is being applied the unitary operator works on the density operator in this form now when we do this this is always true and let us look at how this works the operational density matrices for mixed state essentially results in a unitary operator working on the density matrixes and which is still true as a result of that the effect of measurement on a density matrix would end up measuring the state Rho with respect to the basis say Phi 1 all the way to Phi D still will yield the ket outcome with probability Phi of K Rho five of ke khet and because the effect of measuring measurement on a density matrix measures the state Rho with respect to the basis yielding the case outcome with probability this this is because the the operation of the density matrix essentially means that we are applying this particular wave function as a result of that which is means that I have basically ended up producing this particular state and the state is collapsing to this particular case State and therefore it is always measuring the measuring the probability of the th state collapsing into that final state and would give the gate outcome with the probability and this is the reason why this is a universal measurement which works with the density matrices whenever we use a quantum operations using of density matrices and this is something which would work universally whether it is a pure state or a mixed it and that's the basic idea this is a collapses to this particular state so with this I would like to end today's lecture because we have we were planning to just give you the introduction to the density matrices it's necessity to be one of the important parameters that we have been using and time whenever we talk about collapse whether we are doing pure state or mixed state and in terms of communications and in many times of the computing it has been very important that the overall property or the overall result which we have looked at the important properties that we looked at and in many cases it was possible to have a solution only because we were able to use density matrixes and so that's why I wanted to give you some important ideas about the density matrix is before we go further and we'll meet you more on these issues in the next lecture [Music] [Music] you [Music]
