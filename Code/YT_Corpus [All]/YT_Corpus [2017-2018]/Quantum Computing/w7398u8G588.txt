 [Music] good afternoon everyone today it's my pleasure to introduce our speaker Jared MacLean Jared and I actually did our PhD in the same lab and during grad school jared was somewhat of a pioneer in the field of developing algorithms for quantum computers to simulate materials and chemistry in particular he's the inventor of one of the most sort of popular approaches to using near-term quantum computers for this purpose which is known as the variational quantum eigen solver Jared is now the Luisi Alvarez fellow at Lawrence Berkeley National Labs and lately he's been working closely with our with the Kwame AI team at Google in order to develop software which compiles chemistry problems to instructions that can be run on near-term qualm computers in fact he's a founder of the open source package Fermi Live which we just released earlier this week so without further ado I'd like to introduce to you at McLean thanks a lot for the introduction Ryan and it's my pleasure to be here to talk a little bit about both what I've been doing and quantum computing in general so just a few words about kind of the level of this talk and content of this talk so I I asked around it's to what level that these talks are generally given at and they told me well it might go on YouTube so it would be useful if at least some part of it appealed to a more general audience some part appealed to say computer scientists or more general computational folks and some part was geared towards specialists at the end so I hope there's a little bit of a gradient of this talk that there's a little something for everyone so if you're not so familiar with quantum maybe it's a good start for you but you might be off to a little bit of a slow start if you're an expert so just that caveat as I begin talking so what what I want to talk about is quantum computation both in a general sense and for this problem that we think it's going to be very very good for which is the discovery of new materials in chemistry so I think it's appropriate these days to start almost any talk and quantum computation with a discussion of why now so if you're like anyone else in the field you've probably been looking around and seeing news about quantum computers being talked about it for probably close to two decades if you've been around for an amount of time and if you kind of graph the amount of quantum excitement over time you might have seen yo you'll see a brief peak here at around 1994 even though it was conceived of in the 80s by richard fineman where Shor's factoring algorithm came out and if you don't know what this is it was an algorithm that promised to essentially break RSA encryption and got everyone in the government scared enough that they started pouring money into it the tension came and so people started looking at this technology saying wow this can do incredible things and you'll notice there was a brief dip after that when people figured out that wow these devices are actually a little bit hard to make so there's a little bit of a decline as people went back to their labs refine their ideas of what they might want to build these things from and you'll see that there's been a pretty big increase recently and if you've been looking around at the news from different companies from different universities and other places you'll see that there's pretty big increase starting to happen right here which is related to the fact that our qubits are getting much better and they're getting much more manufacturable and people are starting to think wow this is a this is something I need to be ready for it because this is coming and there's already been predictions by this group especially the Google Group is a leader in this quantum information field they're fighting by the end of perhaps this year or 2018 that will reach a landmark known as quantum supremacy and what this means is that there will be some well-defined computational tasks that a quantum device can do much faster than all of the combined classical resources on earth today and that will be a true milestone that says wow these devices are really capable in practice of something that we could not do with the classical resources we have and after that there'll be some kind of rush to move from quantum supremacy to practical applications and that's kind of where I'm going to focus on is getting over this perhaps host:you premise and chasm and really pushing this technology forward by showing in the short term what practical applications what useful technologies and rhythms we can bring out of this and of course after that sometime in the future we're going to move towards an error corrected quantum computation regime and I'll talk a little bit more about what all these things mean as the talk goes on but really this is what I want to focus people on is that if we can put these practical quantum algorithms out there on near-term devices then this is really going to close give us new tools and push us forward in the technology so where do we expect to win so the other thing you might be interested in is ok great you've delivered me a quantum machine where do these machines where do we expect them to you useful and how useful will they be so some of the problems that people have talked about and I'll focus only on a few of these are perhaps the simulation of different reactions and what I mean by that is perhaps knowing whether a drug will work or not before you actually do the experiments in a lab or knowing which drug will be produced by that particular catalyst or another one I'll talk about a little bit is calculating radar cross radar cross-sections of perhaps planes or machines you might be interested in or pattern matching or machine learning and of course breaking RSA encryption if you're a three-letter agency and you're worried about that kind of thing and there's a few images of what people might have conceived these month look like and what is the advantage that we actually expect so what a quantum computer is not is just a machine that runs everything you have at the moment faster it's a new way of looking at problems that we'll talk a little bit about it can get you real complexity theoretic speed-up so people talk about polynomial speed ups or exponential speed ups so I just wanted to give you a feel for what that might look like if you achieve the polynomial or an exponential speed-up so if you had a quadratic speed-up for a certain instance of a problem that might be in a reduction of say a year down to two weeks or something on that magnitude depending on the underlying factors and the really exciting one is if you can get an exponential speed-up which has the potential to reduce some problems down from something like 10 to the 82 years to something more like 300 seconds so what is 10 to the 82 years even mean well the age of the universe is something like 14 times 10 to the 9 years so you've really made something that was essentially impossible routine and that's the kind of goal of a quantum design that's why we're so interested in it is the potential for these speed ups to make the impossible and everyday occurs so now backtracking to kind of what this technology means so I've already used the word quantum a lot and you've probably heard it any number of times if you've been at all interested in this field but a backup and say what is quantum what do we mean by that so if you if you're biased at all by media marketing or anything like that today you might conclude that it's a buzzword that you attach to any product you might want to sell a few more of or have it be a little bit cooler I'm going to take a more physics oriented approach and say that you know everything is quantum in a way so the universe is governed by quantum laws but why haven't you seen any of that in reality so something that's in reality that we've kind of observed from day-to-day life we often characterize as classical so classical objects have very predictable behavior from your intuition because that's what you're used to so take these bean bag holes for instance you just throw a bean bag through you watch its trajectory and it goes through the hole as you might expect so there's nothing terribly hard about that prediction but if you took that same object and in fact people have done experiments on things quite large up to kind of buckyballs which granted is much smaller than a bean bag and you cooled it down enough and you had a precise enough instrument to measure it you would find out that if you put one particle through that so if you kept throwing that bean bag towards these two holes you would find that the bean bag was interfering with itself which is kind of a strange effect to have so this is a classical double slit experiment which or a quantum double slit experiment rather that showed some of the original properties of why we started to think wow we need a theory beyond just follows rolling down hills and these effects that we see so a particle interfering with itself and as a result it starts to occupy only discrete levels and looks like a very different type of particle than you had otherwise and when people started to try to simulate and predict these reactions or effects they said wow this is really hard what if we could actually use this tool to our advantage instead what if we could use this difficulty as kind of the power of our but I'll get them into that more later but effectively what I want to define for you in a very loose sense is that a quantum system it's some physical system operated in a regime where we actually need effects like discrete energy levels and particles interfering with themselves to accurately describe it in practice that often means something that's very cold and very well controlled so I'm going to talk also about quantum simulation and I think it's interesting to go back to the roots of simulation which are actually in these devices called worries that are have been dug up from sites as early as 125 BC so the simulation in some general sense is that you have a model you're interested in and you'd like to push it forward in time and ask what that model predicts so in the cases of auras these are models of solar systems that you build and you crank forward either by hand or by a clock and you say does the do the orbits of these fake planets match the orbits of my real planet and if the answer is yes then in some sense the model that you've constructed is somehow more correct so it would be very difficult for those particles that I just described which need to interfere with each other to be built with just classical balls so a idea that originated kind of the field of quantum simulation and that's quantum computing was it Richard Fineman famous physicist said well if you want to do a quantum simulation you probably need to do it with quantum particles and I'll describe a little bit what that means but these blue balls here are kind of just any particular quantum system you might have and your ability these puppeteer strings on top are the ability to experimentally control those much better than you could in a different physical system and we'll use that to kind of examine what quantum particles might do and what are examples of quantum systems so I have a few pictures here of ones that people have proposed for the use in computation and generally these meet the requirements if they're in this regime that you need interference effects and things like that and there are also highly controllable systems so that you can do things that you wouldn't be able to do in nature and I pictured a number of machines like superconducting qubits one here from the Google Group one from the Siddiqui group quantum photons setups and ion trap setups basically any number of controllable systems that you can bring to this particular level our potential building blocks for these quantum devices each with their strengths and weaknesses that might exhibit as you start to manufacture them and quantum simulation of course was the first idea of you know if you want to study the effects of a quantum system and this is a very hard thing then perhaps you can just use another analogous quantum system much like the planets in the Ori of the example that I gave before and this simulation idea led almost immediately well not almost immediately into a more abstract concept that I'll start to introduce now which is kind of Cubans so it's a very big leap to say I've taken some amount of some lasers and pushed around ions and a trap to moving towards an algorithm that talks about factoring products of two large primes there's a big leap there it's very hard to imagine how ions resemble these types of systems but a similar leap was made in the original systems as we moved from say models of planets all the way to digital computing so it's of course very hard to imagine how a planet fits in a digital computer but we've managed to come up with abstractions and encoding and discretization that have made this possible and really the leap from quantum simulation to quantum computation is this abstraction this model of universality that allows us to code problems were interested in into these sophisticated devices and leverage those powers of interference entanglement and all of these hard to describe physical effects to utilize them in a more computational way and so just to talk about this quantum computing abstraction you've probably heard of it many times so if you imagine one of these quantum systems that I've described so a physical system in this low controllable energy space and it occupies only the first two discrete energy levels that it's allowed to then we typically are calling this a qubit so the qubit is a quantum generalization of a classical bit you may have heard this explanation many times and I'll actually debunk a little bit of it in a second which is that a classical bit is 0 or 1 and a quantum bit it's something like 0 1 or anything in-between so you can have super visions of these objects you can have entanglement between them which are truly important quantum effects and operations on these bits are just called gates and we typically denote this with these gate diagrams so you can read down the lines for example and just say well qubit one gets acted on by these gates qubit two gets acted on by these gates and so on so the details of understanding exactly what these operations are are not terribly important at this juncture but just to know that we have this model of computing that we fit in our arbitrary problems to that much like the module of digital computing which we've built so much on in the past and just to give you notational familiarity we often call these generic States I so you'll notice what the qubit I put these brackets around the 0 and 1 and with generic States I'll often put a bracket around some States side it just means some number of qubits some number of these physical systems put together to make my quantum computer so I'm going to consider a quantum computer a collection of one or many of these qubits put together that I can control in any way that I'm interested in within a feasible resources so it behooves us for a moment to kind of debunk a lot of the things that get written in popular science articles on quantum computing so I just like to highlight some of these for people that are in computing to kind of help you understand that there's a little bit more to the speedups than meets the eye when people discuss these algorithms so one thing that gets said a lot is that it's faster or better because it can use an exponential number of states so this is a kind of nebulous statement because you don't really know what it means use you don't really know what what you know popular science writers mean by this and I'd like to point out that a set of classical in bits can also be in an exponential number of states so if you take it at a very face value that you can just have 0 1 or many things in between then there must be something a little bit missing from that statement little clarifications that are needed such as entanglements or such as the number of states that can be occupied for given resource another myth is that it's faster or better because bits can be zero and one at the same time so it's in fact a little bit nebulous even to say bits are 0 & 1 or 0 or 1 quantum mechanics often requires actually a different theory of logic and more importantly what people often mean by this is it when you can dial between 0 & 1 that somehow occupying all those states from the middle is more powerful but if that were the only case that an analogue bit might serve just as well as a quantum one and a collection of analog bits would be just as powerful as classical quantum device but that's not true and a lot of these things are covered in a very interesting comic which debunks the third myth which is that work is done by computing all the answers in massive parallel and so I want to highlight this SMBC comic which is co-written by Scott Aaronson which I think highlights that many of the aspects of this is called the talk where a mother explains through a child the important caveats to the magic of quantum computing and thing they write here is the important thing for you to understand is that quantum computing isn't just a matter of trying all the answers in parallel so if you actually thought that was the case you can look into this comic and see some of the details of why if you perform measurements you would then only get one answer and really you get the speed-up when all of these inputs combine and just the right way to give you just the right answer and so this is a kind of delicate matter but if you read through many pop science articles on quantum you'll encounter these arguments over and over again so it helps to know that they're not completely true or not the whole story so what are the challenges in quantum computing form a both an algorithmic and a design standpoint so these algorithms tend to follow a simple pattern if you look at many of them so you prepare some state of your qubits meaning I manipulate the qubits in a particular way with laser or microwave pulses or things like that I evolved them forward under my given set of gate sequence and I perform some measurements at the end and I'm measuring out a particular piece of information I'm not characterizing the entire quantum state otherwise there's no way I would get out a speed-up from this particular process in each one of these steps of the none of challenges for example in preparing the state I'm often limited by the number of qubits on my device when I think of a 64-bit classical processor that doesn't mean the largest problem I can fit in my processor 64 cubed or 64 bits I have some ability to take problems by chunks and move along and compute on them that's often not the case with quantum algorithms where you depend on the entanglement between all parts to get your speed up and chunking problems becomes much much harder so we need larger devices than we would conceive of otherwise there's also issues of coherence time which mean the amount of time essentially that a qubit is good for as you're acting on it before you'd like to move on or you need to refresh that particular device and it sets a time limit on the number of operations that you can actually perform and finally information extraction can be a fundamentally different which I'll highlight in a particular example after this and one solution to all of these problems is of course better hardware but what I like to say is that we have to meet hardware designers halfway we need to co.design better algorithms as well and what this means is that in the past like this vqe algorithm we've designed coherence time flexible algorithms that work with the coherence time of the device and I think in the future we need to worry about how to middle qubit number flexible algorithms and to improve this kind of halfway point where we couple quantum and classical devices together because we really do have well well-defined classical resources today that hopefully we can leverage in that process so this information abstraction extraction point I want to get back to you with one particular example of the quantum algorithm got written down so this algorithm thinks about solving linear systems of equations so if you're not familiar with this you can just think of this as how do I solve for X in this particular problem it appears in any number of say logistics problems machine learning everyday optimizations things like this and classically when I say I want to solve this problem it essentially amounts to I want to write down all the entries of X that seems like a reasonable thing to do a quantum algorithm came out which was exponentially faster which is that enormous speed-up I talked about before which is exponentially faster delivering the solution but it changed the definition of solution a little bit it noticed the brackets around the X and the B now and what it meant was the solution translates to preparing a state X from which one can efficiently sample and so that's not exactly the same thing as writing down all the entries because if you wrote down all the entries you would lose that advantage necessarily and so I want to say is that's not not a bad thing necessarily what it really is is it's solving the problem not reproducing the classical algorithm so if I'm out and I'm going and I'm looking at my plane and I'm trying to make a stealth aircraft do I really care about all of the entries of where every single radar bounces or do I care about an aggregate cross-section as fast as possible and if the answer is that I care about this cross-section then really what I've done is use a new tool to solve this problem rather than just translate an old classical algorithm and this step was necessary in order to achieve this quantum speed-up and it's one that I think you have to conceptualize moving forward as what quantum computers are good at quantum computers are not about taking an old classical algorithm and running it faster they're about using a new set of tools to solve the problem that you're interested in in a fundamentally new way and I think that's highlighted very well by this particular comparison between the classical and quantum version of solving a system of linear equations so where do we think early applications are going to be highlighted for these particular devices we think some of the earliest problems perhaps will not be breaking codes or you know bringing down the world financial system or something like that there'll be in areas like optimization so say quantum approximate optimization of logistics or other bulky various services that you might find in any kind of problem they might be in some kind of relational representation so you can think of different kinds of quantum neural networks that link together variables in a way you didn't know how to do before and the one that I'm interested in and I'm going to talk a little bit more about this quantum simulation so this idea of how you perform experiments that should have gone that would have needed to go into a laboratory on a computer beforehand and areas like chemistry or perhaps even high-energy physics where you can predict what catalysis would happen the fusion of a nucleus or perhaps you could look at what drugs our disease preventing are the types of simulations that we want to look at and I'm going to focus in on quantum chemistry in particular so why do we want to simulate quantum chemistry or why do we want to simulate chemistry in general what is the dream of this field essentially the dream is that some someone gives you an idea of what a molecule or a protein or something in someone's body looks like or a material and just from that I would like to understand many things about it I'd like to understand how it absorbs life like to understand how it complexes with other species I'd like to understand how that molecule likes to talk to surfaces and move around and from that understanding I'd like to develop some level of control so if I know why a molecule absorbs light what functional groups affect that maybe I can design new photovoltaics new solar cells to put on my house if I know why certain species complex within a protein or why a protein folds or miss folds maybe I can design an inhibitor that prevents the onset of certain types of diseases and if I know why molecules complex with these catalytic surfaces maybe I can get platinum out of my catalytic converters and understand how to lower the energy consumption of these processes and these are things that are all made possible only by very high accuracy simulations which are the kind that we're going to be aiming for and this problem is also an interesting one because you might say well all those things you just described sound like very lofty goals but where are you even going to start from and it's an interesting problem because the underlying laws physical laws necessary for the mathematical theory of a large part of physics in the whole of chemistry are thus completely known and the difficulty is only that the exact application of these laws lead two equations much too complicated to be soluble so it's said by physicist Paul Dirac and what he essentially met was that you can if you could just solve equations large enough so this very innocuous equation that I have written on the right-hand side here essentially represents all of those things that I was just talking about if I can find a way to code a molecule into these equations and solve this linear eigenvalue problem then I'm going to start to understand you know how these molecules absorb light how they come flex with other species whatever rates of chemical reactions and do everything that I just talked about and so that's kind of the exciting dream of quantum chemistry and it's one I think we can achieve with quantum computers and one problem that I want to highlight for this in particular so you say that's a very general type of argument that you've made what specifically are you going to look at and I want to highlight for you one particular problem which is the production of fertilizer from nitrogen this is a process that goes on all over the world all the time it's how you take into and make it into ammonia this nitrogen fixation problem and humans currently do this at massive scales we do it for crop all around the world and we use the process called the Habu process which happens at 400 degrees Celsius of 200 times atmospheric pressure and currently uses one to two percent of all energy on earth today and then we look over at our friends in the plant kingdom in the animal kingdom and fungi and we say well how do these guys do it they existed long before we had fertilizer plants building all of this chemical processes and they managed to do it at 25 degrees Celsius and 1 atmospheric pressure so room temperature and atmospheric pressure essentially and people have managed to boil down in one particular area in nitrogenase where the action is happening to this kind of thermo coke or as they call it and people have tried to study this with current methods and it's beyond the reach of all current classical methods to really understand even where the substrate attachment happens what the electronic structured process is and how we can move forward on this problem and what I want to propose is it while there's no clear path classically I think quantum mechanically was something like 150 to 200 logical qubits there's kind of a straight path forward to studying the electronic structure of this problem and so why is this problem so difficult so I talked about the fact that I only needed to solve this one very simple looking equation and all of these properties would come to me as I I imagined so the problem is not in the be set up it's in the dimension that you need to solve so if you imagine that the another way of phrasing this problem that I want to solve is that I would like to know where I should put all the electrons in system so this is called the electronic structure problem and if you imagine that I discretize things as I always need to do for a computer and put down em site I can ask how many ways can I arrange each of these number of electrons if it's just one I can arrange them M number of ways and if it's 2 its M Squared making some coarse arguments about antisymmetry and if I go to just say a hundred sites and say 80 particles so you can see this grows is m to the N and that's about the size of molecule you might expect for something like a hundred sites that I've pictured they're much smaller than a protein the dimension of this problem that I need to solve becomes 10 to the 100 and 60 so this is the number that's very hard to get a feeling for so I've given you a barometer for that which is the number of particles in the universe is estimated to be roughly 10 to the 80 so that's as if every particle in the universe had another universe within it and I needed to account for all the particles in those and I need to solve a problem that's on the dimension of that scale which seems totally intractable but I want to remind you that this same difficulty is the power that we're harnessing when we use a quantum computer so we've essentially turned our lemons into lemonade in a way so I just want to draw back and aside for everyone who might not be familiar with quantum to understand another exponential object that you might be more familiar with in the relation between that and this problem so you might be more familiar with probability distributions where you say if you have say 16 different places that you might like to look for lunch and you have your own set of preferences p1 for each store that you go to and someone else has their own set of preferences if the two of you don't know each other these probability distributions factorize so even though this Joint Distribution on the left has a lot of size the structure allows you to kind of simplify this problem so you only need a linear amount of information however if the two of you definitely know each other whether you're friends or enemies then a correlation gets introduced between those two things and it no longer factorizes and you can imagine if there's you know n of these are many many of these stores and many many of these people keeping that joint probability distribution is horribly complex and the key caveat of why some is different from these types of probability distributions is that classically we know how to sample from even these large stages using things like Monte Carlo methods but that interference phenomenon that I talked about and entanglement mean that we can't use some of these methods it's unheard of in classical probability that two people would interfere with each other and not be in store for example and having to account for these effects makes it very hard to simulate classically so how do we actually simulate these problems on a quantum computer so I've told you that there's a lot of promise for doing so and I want to show you how we actually start to build these things so if we go way back to say highschool chemistry you might have seen a model that looks like some electrons rotating around a proton and a neutron and then if you continue taking chemistry you learn very quickly that perhaps this model is not so accurate it doesn't make many predictions at all and if you entered chem 101 and say something in university you might have found the molecular orbital model which is often pictured as the last vestige of these things and I want to tell you that this molecular orbital model which predicts things like bond order and where the spins are is exactly like that factorized probability distribution that I had before it assumes no explicit correlation of the electrons it's like a naive Bayes model if you're doing machine learning and it's not it's not a good enough model so it's simple but it's not good enough than to give you a picture for what that might mean it's so if I have some I wrote down that same picture for the simplest molecule like h2 which is a hydrogen molecule and I try to pull it apart which is this picture that I have over to the right then I would find it while the shape is generally okay what I would predict is this top dotted line up here which is seems to be quite a bit off from the exact line underneath it so you come to the conclusion that if chemistry is anything at all to do with the making and breaking of bonds which you feel it might be then this is not a sufficiently good model and the reason for this is electrons actually care a lot about where the other electrons are these correlation effects make the wave function very much non-separable in these types of regions and you have to figure out a way to build that into your model so how do we put these these things in so I don't want to belabor the the symbols here too much but essentially we take some model of space and we chop that model of space up so in much the same way if you drew a line on a computer you would eventually have to go down to the pixels and discreetly draw each one of them on your screen we have to do the same thing here so we divide space up and we put it down on some type of grid we choose a specialized grid but this is essentially the same and the output of this is this problem Hamiltonian that you get here and the only thing I want to emphasize about that is that we classically precompute it and it tells us everything about the problem that we want to solve we often then go ahead and solve that main field problem that I just told you about to get a decent starting point for where we want to go and this defines this concept of molecular orbitals for these different levels that things can fill that are these uncorrelated motions of electrons and how do we build in the correlations in the simplest possible way is that I could go back and ask about that sort of joint probability distribution I could just enumerate every single possibility of filling then that would be one way to solve it it would of course scale horribly like this universe size solution that I had before but conceptually it's the simplest way of doing so and it's often called exact diagonalization or full configuration interaction in chemistry and of course there's been many methods between this mean field uncorrelated and the exact solution developed over the years and I won't belabor this slide too much but the gist of it is many of the classical methods for those problems that were interested in are either too costly or they don't capture the correlations that we need enough so what we'd like is kind of this exact level description but for a cost of a method that's something more like density functional Theory here or perhaps qmc or Monte Carlo or something like that so exact solutions of the quality we need but for the price that we can afford to pay and so why do we think quantum computers might be good at this so a paper that came out in 2005 by alon obscure guzik who's now at harvard and was my PhD advisor as well as ryan's showed that for some instances of chemical problems I will if you put in a safe under certain assumptions then computing that energy which I just told you about only cost timescales polynomial in the system rather than this universe sized object and a key portion of this is that you prepare this state you do some evolution but your measurement only extract a little bit of information it doesn't read out that whole state because you don't care about that whole state there are pieces of that state you would like to know things about but your quantum computer has allowed you a way to zoom in on the information you want without being burdened by the information that you don't need and this this led people to see that classically this might have an exponential cost and quantum mechanically it seemed like a modest polynomial cost the challenge when we went to put it on experimental devices was it often required many more resources than were available in the lab so we tried to look towards a different approach and we took a co.design perspective so what do I mean by that so if you imagine the previous perspective as someone kind of sits down with a problem they try to write down a circuit specification that optimally solves this problem and then there's a big question mark because of this qubit and coherence time problem does it fit in my quantum blue-jean queue and if it does it gives me the answer to life and everything if it doesn't then perhaps it simply doesn't run which isn't very useful so what we wanted to do instead was consider the task and the current architecture and try to find the best solution possible so what this means is kind of combining the problem and the architecture that we have getting a circuit sequence that's compatible with these two and doing kind of a classical feedback loop so the answer we get back out might not be perfect so it might only be close to the answer to life in everything for a lot of chemical applications say does this react or not is this a valid drug or not where you're only interested in some course answer that depends on an accurate energy that might be better than you can do classically it might be good enough to make that prediction that you're interested in and to do this you need to ask okay so I have a quantum computer with limited resources how do I build to that device what is this device best at doing what what are kind of the minimal specifications for which I can call this a quantum computer and one is I would like to be able to do an operation which if I've done all of my state preparations I'd like to be able to look at a qubit and ass is this cubit a 0 or a 1 and I'd like to do that over and over again until I've I've decided what the average value of that might be and I'd also like to look at many cubits at the same time and I'd like to ask what those correlated values are so this is something that's efficient to do on any prepared quantum state but in general it might be very hard to calculate this expectation value on a classical device depending on the states that I've prepared so I've really boiled down to some essence at least one simple operation for a prepared state that would be very hard for me to do classically so how am I going to use this on my chemistry problem so I'm going to switch formulations a bit and so that problem that I showed you before was written as an eigenvalue problem and it turns out that for exterior eigenvalues you can play a little bait-and-switch and you can always write a value problem as a minimization over this kind of constrained unit vector and so I'm going to switch over into that formulation and say now the problem I would like to solve it's some minimization of an average quantity and if I decommissioned and the way that's standard for some of these systems then essentially by linearity I get a problem that this expectation value that I'd like to minimize over that is equivalent to my eigenvalue problem I have two tasks one which is easy for a quantum computer so I need to compute a bunch of these little averages here so repeatedly looking at each qubit and telling me if it's 0 or 1 and then I have those inputs that I got from the disk rotation I chose how I divided my problem up and my classical computer is very good at adding a lot of numbers together so why wouldn't I use that resource for this particular problem so I perform a bunch of measurements on my quantum computer which are easy I feed those to my classical computer and ask it for an update step so this kind of suggests a hybrid scheme where I parameterize my quantum state with some classical experimental parameters and I compute averages using a quantum computer and I update that state classically and pictorially this algorithm kind of looks like this where I have a quantum module where I prepare some state and feed it in these expectation values that I read out and I add them together in my classical computer and then I just loop that algorithm and back and back until I've reached some level of convergence which I think represents how good that device can do so again the answer might not be the best absolutely possible because you're constrained by the device itself but it's perhaps better than you could do on a classical device so this is interesting because it I showed you the algorithm before just briefly which was this quantum circuit I just described an algorithm that looks effectively like this which is that I've removed all of this interior part without the millions and millions of quantum gates in it and so where is the advantage coming from it has to come from that state that I've input so it really begs the question of what are the interesting quantum states to look at if you imagine the state the space of all possible states somewhere inside it's the ones I can reasonably make on my quantum computer and within that there's the ones that are easy to model on a classical computer so I'm really looking at this part in the blue space which is not covered by the yellow here and where do those states live and I think that's one of the most interesting questions that a quantum computer is going to be able to answer for us and kind of conveniently for that is that I can then define what states I want to explore by the device that I have so if you call it a quantum hardware on thoughts or sometimes sub logical on sets then you can imagine that that parameter space you explore is any of the knobs that you can repeatedly turn on your device so if you can do that operation twice you can call that some quantum state you're interested in and you use the complexity of the device to your advantage and the coherence time requirements are going to be set by the device instead of the algorithm it won't be that case that you get I need ten million gates well I can't do tilde million gates and you get nothing it's I have this amount of time and you get the best answer you can within that window of time and of course we have some theoretical constructs that I won't go too deeply into but we like to be able to design these particular on Sox's as well in a logical formalism so of course I haven't really talked about what happens with quantum errors yet so you can imagine that these devices are not perfect I've alluded to this many times and if you look at the level of the device you might imagine that there are certain errors called coherent errors so imagine if I an example of this by want to rotate by some angle but every time I rotate by a little bit too far and that's going to be a type of coherent error and this quantum device also lives in a larger environment so it's always seeing electromagnetic waves coming in maybe it's even feeling the effects of temperature from bleeding in from the outside and this is going to cause kind of random errors that look more like that are more incoherent so these are types of D phasing errors so how does this algorithm perform in the presence of these types of types of noise and one of the things we conjectured is that because of this classical feedback loop that certain types of coherent errors would be corrected by this procedure and we're lucky enough to have participated in experiment in collaboration here with the Google group actually that showed that this was this was in fact the case so let me describe briefly what this image shows so it's actually a good depiction of what a quantum quantum algorithm looks like in practice or at least a small-scale one so to your left you have the picture of both the hardware at the top and the software at the bottom so the hardware at the top or of course these transmog qubits that come from john Martinez's lab and you see that the software on the bottom labels them is just qubit 0 and qubit 1 and as I apply these quantum gates or just operations to qubits you can see how that corresponds to pulse sequences at the top and this goes through and you measure out just the expectation values that I was talking about over here and a quantum feedback loop goes to change our 1 parameter Z here in the middle so we use this kind of circuit to study this bond Association so what this is a picture of is if you take two hydrogen atoms and you pull them apart what's the energy what's the resistance to this pulling and we've studied it by that algorithm and by another called Bayes estimation what we found was that that feedback loop really gave us something to the tune of some type of coherent error correction and we feel that the smoking gun for this was this plot that essentially took this problem so this is the same problem but I'm only plotting the errors now and the green dots whoops the green dots here are if I took the exact solution of this problem so relatively small at the moment and I can check what the exact angle of that Z in the middle of the circuit should have been the Z theta and I plug this into my device which if my device was perfect then this is I would have gotten the exact result and what we found was these green dots instead and then on the red is if you run this kind of variational feedback loop you find that the errors drop in some cases by over an order of magnitude and you get much better inconsistent results across the curve and this is kind of indicative to us that it's coming back to fix these types of over rotation errors because if you want to rotate by some angle and you did it by theta plus Delta this is really just a labeling error in some regard what you care about is the quantum state you've produced rather than the particular labels that you've given it at the end of the day so this was our our smoking gun for this type of a quantum error suppression but we also wanted to look at kind of generalizations to this could we tackle incoherent errors could we look at other states and one thing that you look through when you look classically at these types of problems so eigenvalue problems are defined in these linear spaces and what we have here is instead a parameterization that kind of explores something that looks a little bit nonlinear so if you imagine that this is my parameter space dis like gray manifold here and I'm walking around that space it looks curved you know similar to the way you might have a neural network parameterised by some weights or something like that it's not exactly linear so if you want to learn something about the distribution you want to leverage the power of linear algebra that we've always used in quantum mechanics to tell us things like excited states interior eigenvalues and other things you want to pass this back into a linear space but one that's relevant to the problem that you're interested in so you can imagine that it might be possible to look at this point that you're at and expand just around that particular point build a little flat plane where I can do my analysis even though for that point this is both 1 that I don't know much about and can't prepare classically but I can build this little flat plane and learn something about the action of an operator within it so what I'm going to do to do that is I'm going to act this set of operators I'll choose a set that determines little flat space and I'll ask the Hamiltonian on that because these are where the energy eigenvalues are coming from and I'll probe with states also within that space so this will tell me how any state within this little flat flame that I've built moves to another state within that space and I'll do this to build a matrix representation of that which will tell me how it acts on all of these states even though these states I don't actually know exactly what they are and moreover I have to build some representation of the identity which is also the local metric but in doing so I build now an offline classical generalized eigenvalue problem so this is again a coupling between quantum and classical I've built some offline problem based on the measurements I took on my quantum device to kind of improve what I could have done without the classical computer and this gives me some estimate of my excited state energies and also something a little more so how does this look for a real problem kind of pictorially so if you imagine that this is the curve that I got before of my hydrogen bond breaking assume I got it equally well at each point on this curve I'm going to do this expansion that I talked about and this expansion only corresponds to extra measurements on my system there's no additional coherence time required and it looks kind of like if my system went through this dqo hearing channel over here and I prepare the state then these expansions sometimes actually let me go outside the original set of states that I was able to prepare and I solved this problem and I get out these excited state energy and properties but what I also find is that because of that expansion outside this kind of cone that I'm allowed to occupy from decoherence that I can sometimes improve the energies even of my ground state and correct for some of these quote-unquote incoherent errors that are in my system and to see how this works you can build a very simple one qubit example to do this so if I just make some one qubit Hamiltonian up and I imagine two characteristic errors one is this side pure here which corresponds to no matter what angle that I give this thing it always gives me back to zero state so it's a non-functional control essentially and the other is my machine is so bad that it gives me back zero or essentially randomly and this is how you define these kind of operators within this space and I'm going to choose these sets of operators that build my little planes and the first one is the identity so that's just the original algorithm and then in the second set I'm going to include only bit flips and then the third set or set to as I'm calling it you do essentially full tomography on this qubit and what you find if you look at the error in the lowest eigen value when you do this you'll at the initial outset so this is just the original unexpanded version you have quite bad error so this is log 10 error in the lowest eigen value if you add bit flips you perfectly fix this case of a non functional control and you moderately fix the mixed state error and if you do full tomography you correct both cases with just the measurements from the device so we went out and we did an experiment based on this in collaboration with the Siddiqui group at Berkeley and we found that if we did both that type of expansion which I'm characterizing as likely linear response or lowest level excitation plus a few select ones from the next level so a few two qubit flips as well then what you get out are much improved ground States and also the excited States so the excited state curves are just the ones you get out from these extra measurements that you do and I'll highlight that the yellow points down here with the larger error bars or the uncorrect advanced with very small error bars are what you got as corrections to those so it improved both the energies and the spreads of the energies that we got out in the experiment so we're very happy about this because we feel like it's evidence that for some problems there are application specific error correction modules which you can consider building rather than a general-purpose error correction and that quantum simulation might be a very brutal area for working in this so I want to just kind of close with slide saying this is an exciting time for quantum this is just a short picture of all of the different companies and different groups and that have started to do research in this area and if you look at this list even say five or ten years ago it would have been not even a fraction of this it's taking off with dramatic speed we're having more and more qubits every day that are better and more and more groups getting interested our government is finally getting on board assuming that the current administration doesn't you know that's things up but that's important but I think it's an exciting time to be in this field both on algorithmics and superconducting qubits I hope that I convinced you that there's at least one key problem we're really driving towards that we can work on for this and with that I'd like to to just kind of recap the things that I've said which are if you go back what was quantum computing quantum computing was looking at these particles while they're in this state that requires interference and discrete energy levels asking how what happens if we use those to simulate other particles and what happens if we build a computing abstraction on top of that can we do different or new interesting algorithms that look nothing like their classical counterpart and we saw some examples of where that was true for example this linear solution of equations or this ability to propagate forward chemistry problems in time I hope I convinced you that in some ways coupling classical and quantum devices lets you do a little bit more than you would have just running on the quantum device at least for the short term so we have very well developed classical computers and I think it's a mistake to cut them out of the problem entirely at the moment and we did this interesting expansion that I hope you're you're excited about and that we're really moving towards real problems now that we have devices in the pipeline I think we finally exited the time of quantum computing when you imagine you know you work on algorithms with the amend your imagination that no device will ever exist now is the time to work towards real problems in real applications and I think we're not that far away so with that I'd like to thank you all for listening and I'm happy to take any questions [Applause] thanks Eric for the nice talk maybe as little addendum I know you guys have been working on a new algorithm again in the spirit of variation of quantum algorithms but it uses a a well adapted basis set so that we have a chance of running it on one of the upcoming year term advices can you talk a little bit about that yeah definitely so when I talked about originally the the chemistry problem I talked about how you cut that problem up much in the same way if you wanted to draw a line on a computer you need to discretize it so there's a lot of choices you can make in that regard and some of the ones that we've made previously have just been I guess I would say carryover or heritage from classical computing and in fact some of those basis sets are so old they were inspired by the need to do them with a hand cranked calculator and so the question comes was was that really the optimal way to slice it up especially if now you're dealing with an entirely new type of computing technology so some work that I've been doing in collaboration with Brian Babbage here has said that they're in fact better basis sets that look like these kind of plane wave dual basis sets and we'll have a paper out on that soon which make an interesting trade-off so the discretization is perhaps a little bit less compact but the circuit depth needed to run them is much is expected to be much much smaller almost linear in the system size and so what that means is that if you have a device with a lot of qubits but perhaps a modest gate depth available or a modest coherence time and you have a really good chance of doing an early important problem with that architecture rather than one that focuses on compacting the qubits but requires a very long runtime and I think that's got a good opportunity to be one of the first applications that runs on one of these real devices so at the end here you mentioned the your feeling that we shouldn't sort of cut classical computers out of the picture and we should develop some way of using classical computers and quantum computers together so here at Google obviously one of our strengths is machine learning and there are even some people at Google on the Google accelerated Sciences team who are actively thinking about how they can use machine learning to accelerates a electronic structure calculations so my question for you is you know do you think that there is any role that say neural networks and sophisticated machine learning can play to accelerate quantum approaches to electronic structure is there any sort of you know interplay between say the variational algorithm and you know machine learning paradigms that might be interesting yeah so I think there's a lot of interplay that can happen here and one of the one interesting connection is of course that neural networks don't look so different from certain types of quantum circuits but that's kind of a different topic than using a classical neural network to accelerate this type of computation and so for example some areas that I could see these these being beneficial in is perhaps even choosing the basis set that you might be interested in you might be able to learn what discritization ZAR best for a particular problem you might be able to optimize some of the the search procedure of this particular problem so for example I did that subspace expansion at the end which told me something about this this excited States that are nearby this ground state so I can imagine that a neural network might be able to learn a different optimal set of operators which corrects both for which not only looks the excited States but also hopefully learn something about the errors in my real physical system because if you can create just the right perturbations you can reduce the error quite a bit in that particular model so I think there's a wealth of unexplored areas as to how quanta say classical machine learning could hook up to a real quantum experiment especially ones with classical feedback loops and both kind of accelerate it and push it forward to new levels that we haven't seen before so I have a question about the qubits the actual numbers so you hear companies like IBM they say they have sixteen qubit computer and V wife has thousand cubic computers but I guess all qubits are not the same how do these numbers compare yeah so there's a lot of important facts that you have to consider when you look at comparisons on number of qubits in fact I think iBM has even started proposing some metric that includes both the qubit number and their coherence time and the quality of operations that you can perform on it think they call it the quantum volume so what that really captures is that it's important to look at a lot of other factors as well for example some machines don't have arbitrary couplings so even if you wanted to solve certain problems on say the thousand or two thousand cubits that you have you just cannot fit that problem into your device and so it's important to look at both the qubit number the coherence time their connectivity and all of these other factors when comparing across this regime and I think by introducing something like quantum volume I think IBM started a good trend in that regard and we need more evaluations of that metric and developments on that metric and free people to actually report with that metric so we can do comparisons to say this quantum device you know it outperforms this one in some meaningful way so it's a good question slightly going a little further afield here I don't know if people are interested in this or not but I was wondering so so they're always like different interpretations of quantum mechanics right which are sort of as far as I know they're all observational II the same that I've heard some people claim that maybe some of them aren't exactly but for a first approximation their observational II the same right we've got the Copenhagen you've got many worlds you've got the wheeler transactional interpretation I'm wondering is is there one of these that sort of more fruitful more more perspicacious for thinking about quantum computing than the others is that as opposed to like just your personal preferences there one that that you make progress better if you think of it that way so I have to admit that I'm not a leading expert on kind of what I would call quantum fundamentals or interpretations and I know many people make arguments in terms of say the many worlds theory for you know the superposition over all inputs and you need all of the many worlds to come together and agree in just the right way I personally haven't really delved deeply into which interpretations aid in the kind of development of algorithms I've always I guess prescribed to this Copenhagen argument that you know you can build a model that predicts how the hands on a clock move but that might not tell you anything about how the gears are constructed behind it so I yeah I don't think I have a great answer for your question because I mean it doesn't like you were saying with this gutter and some cartoon right so that the idea that these things are massively parallel it's not exactly right but it's not exactly wrong it's right eye and the the many-worlds kind of would seems like it's the natural way of thinking of it as parallel but maybe it makes it too easy to think of it as no and certain well many worlds is certainly the most exciting from a science-fiction standpoint although I've always liked it for that reason but in terms of interpretation I agree that it has many appealing aspects at least in terms of computations agreeing but it's hard as to like the specifics of your question I've never found one more helpful than the other for constructing an algorithm okay like that
