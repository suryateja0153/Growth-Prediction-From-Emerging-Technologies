 [Music] hey there I'm Jenny and I'm Rhea and welcome back to the wait a minute I know it's been a while but CEO of Drita delivers what's that well it's my new company Duryea delivers is a delivery service that kind of acts like a ride-sharing model the only thing is that we're getting ready to launch in a week and I have to train new folks quickly and efficiently but we're also based in different locations that sounds like a job for the transformation gallery check it out so in a previous episode we use the transformation gallery to help Jimmy automate his time off process but this time we're going to use it to create a centralized training resource a hub if you will let me just search the transformation gallery for inspiration I'll type in training hub and here this card looks perfect first I'll use Google Drive to gather any resources I might want to integrate into my training let's see I've got an employee handbook a video talking about proper customer relations and a checklist of onboarding tasks for my new employees to accomplish then I'll use Google Sites to create a website that can act as a one-stop training portal for all my employees no matter their location here's a link to a tutorial on setting up and personalizing your site finally I'll embed my files into my website to create a self-service training portal and I'll share the link with all of my new team members now they can access the website anytime from anywhere on any device and since those files are embedded from Drive files they'll get updates in real time so videos and handbooks are fine but in my experience it can be easier to learn from a real person especially if that real person incentivizes with candy well I don't have any candy but live training sessions are no problem using Google Hangouts I can conduct virtual classes with employees and I can use Google Calendar to embed a schedule those classes directly on the training site employees can add themselves to training events I put on the calendar and the event will have a link to the Hangout as well as any relevant attachments so now our drivers can train using videos documents present Asians even virtual classes whatever works best for them but how are you going to know what they actually learned what they need to know for the job that's a good point so I think I can make a quiz with Google Forms to help with that first I go to Google Forms and from the list of templates I select blank quiz now I can write questions and answers assign points to questions at explanations to answers and receive summaries of the results once my quiz on drivers safety is ready I can either embed it directly into my training hub or email the forum to participants after a hangout training you know you can also use Google Forms to collect feedback from your drivers so they can tell you how they really feel about the training material not that they have anything negative to say of course okay fair enough I can also use the file upload feature in Google Forms so that drivers can add any important documents like their driver's license or even their insurance card file upload now appears in Google Forms right alongside other question options I just add a new question type in for example upload driver's license and select file upload from the list I can even add parameters like file size and type when a new employee submits the form the uploaded file will be added to my drive automatically and your on the enterprise plan right yeah of course it's worth noting that drive on the enterprise plan now features advanced data loss prevention and image recognition with rules that are simple to set up and customize the site administrators can easily secure a sensitive data enforce policies and control how confidential information is shared and that extra functionality is going to be great for your business area that's true so the transformation gallery was super helpful in terms of setting up a new training hub but it's also a two-way street so any new business processes or strategies I come up with using G suite tools I can easily share those as well oh wait hey looks like I got a new service delivery request I'll send my driver Jenny Auto jobs I'm looking for any excuse to use my new car but besides that if you have any ideas on how to use defeat tools for your business join us at Google cloud next this March you can register here until next time we hope with Googlers and customers across the globe and trying to find a meeting time to be a tricky process especially with both drawn the road with the Fineman time feature in Google Calendar and handled all the details for us
