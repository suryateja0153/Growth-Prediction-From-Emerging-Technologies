 Our brain is the most complex machine in the known universe. It all started here on Earth a long time ago. The Oldowan rock: we owe much to this sharp-edged tool. The reptilian brain: it is responsible for our most basic automatic function. Touch the occipital lobes to move them into place. The occipital lobes process information related to vision. The parietal lobes deal with spatial awareness, touch, and body position. The frontal lobes: they are involved in the functions of speaking and decision-making. Even now, within your brain almost 26 billion neurons are firing in a perfect symphony of electrical signals. Without a doubt, sitting on your shoulders is the most sophisticated mechanism in the known universe: The Natural Machine. Whoooa! The resolution's beautiful. Cooool! [Applause] Bravo! Thank you! Looks great! Cool! Awesome. Awesome!
