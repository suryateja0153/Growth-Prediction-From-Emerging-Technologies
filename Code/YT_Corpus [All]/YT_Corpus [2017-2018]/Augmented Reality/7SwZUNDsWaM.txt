   When you see the world as your canvas, there's something quite magical about that. Drawing with augmented reality, it's allowing me to see, and to be able to utilize space, in a way that I haven't imagined before. To take that very simple idea of a line and create new landscapes. And...playback. This project is an exercise in creating movement in a space that's infinite and could be anywhere actually. Putting a choreographed dance routine into AR, You know, taking the live performance and bringing it to your space. You can't help but react to that. With this project, we're taking an artist's lyrics and we're moving it into the world of augmented reality. And I really like this idea that we can feel even more immersed in the lyrics. It really creates this kind of personal connection between artist and the viewer. As augmented reality gets into more and more people's hands, I think we're going to see a really wide range of ways that people can use this technology to bring each other closer together. Anything you can imagine, you can bring it to life in the real world.
