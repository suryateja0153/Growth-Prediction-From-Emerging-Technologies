 Michael:  We're here at AT&T today. This is what the people  are gonna see today when they wear these lenses. Wow.  It's like you can totally  see an augmented reality. That is insane. It's probably  better than my trick.    You ever been  in this store before? Surprisingly, yes,  I actually have.  Yeah, like, a car and  everything virtual reality. Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, we were just  right over there. Oh, yeah, they had virtual reality last time over here. -You saw that?  -Yeah. That was me. Yeah.  I'm demo'ing  the augmented reality.  I don't even know  what that means.  Oh, well, virtual is like  you're completely blinded, in another world. Yeah. But this technology  kind of messes with the rods and cones  in your eyes. 'Cause the digital world  sees things in pixels. -Yeah.  -But our eyes see things with rods and cones. -Right. So, this sort of,  you're looking through a lens that allows your cones  to behave like pixels.  So you want...? There we go. Let's see. Try that on. There we go. All right, yeah, and it sits right...  Yeah, exactly. Oh, it's the Statue of Liberty. Here, can you lift it up  and take it off for a second? Yeah. You're gonna  let your eyes adjust,  and I'm gonna reflect some light right here, okay? So, if I reflect light just in that spot. Now, put the lenses on. -Whoa. -You see that? What do you see? It's almost like Legos. -Oh, did it pixelate? -Yeah. -Yeah. -Yeah. It's pixelated?     Were you wearing  that tie before? What happens  when you do that is you kind of program  your eyes to see digital. -Those glasses? -Why? What's weird? I didn't think you were  wearing that before.  -Really? -Yeah. Okay, wait. Just stay there. I just want to make sure  your eyes reset in this spot. Gonna reset that. Oh, come on. That was not like that before. -Are you seeing it pixelated? -Yeah.  -Your watch, too. -Take them off.  Take the goggles off.  Take them off. Okay, take them off for a second. -Oh, this is so -- -Close your eyes and open them. Close your eyes and open them.  Try to reset. I'm gonna give you  these instructions, okay? Just follow these for a minute. -I can't read that. -Take it. What? I can't -- I can't even see that. Here. You want to stare closely  at a blank spot on the wall.  Just follow those directions.  It's a temporary thing. That one's pixelated, too. Nothing to worry about.  We'll figure this out. I'm just gonna get a little mist  to spritz in your eyes, okay? -And you'll be fine. -Okay. One second. Just one second. Wait, for real? Aw, man, I think I'm blind.    [Bleep]  Come on.    They said everything's fine.  It's gonna take 45 minutes.  -That's -- Okay.  -Is anything clear?  It'll go back to normal? Oh. Any clearer at all?  Is it starting to clear up? Yeah. Your cup  went back to normal. Okay, good.  That's a good sign. Okay, the directions -- Do you see them? -I can read it.  -Can you read that paper now? -"Pixelated vision issues."  -You can see it now? -Yeah. -Great. Yeah. As it returns,  we just want to make sure  that you don't go through the Carbonaro Effect.  You know, your vision  doesn't have a major impact from the Carbonaro Effect.  The Carb-- Right.  That thing. Got it. The Carbonaro Effect -- Have you ever heard of that? -No. -Oh, it's an eye issue. -Okay.  -It's also the name of a hidden-camera,  magic TV show... -Oh.  -...that you're on right now. -No. You're kidding?  -No, I'm not.  [ Laughs ] What? My name's Michael Carbonaro.  What's your name?  I'm Chitty, like  Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang? Hey, Chitty. Yeah. Hey.  You are on my TV show right now. There's hidden cameras right over here... Okay. Hey. Oh, man.  -I'm a magician.  -Oh, man. That was so -- Did that look cool?  That's so crazy.  Chitty, you were awesome. I thought I was like -- I was like, "No, I'm blind, this is it."  I'm like, "This is it for me."  -Are you okay now?  -Yeah. No, I'm fine now. Did I bring a little magic into your day? [ Laughs ] [ Laughs ] -I can't believe that.  -Chitty, you're awesome. That's crazy.
