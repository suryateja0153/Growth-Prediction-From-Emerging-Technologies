 The good this week is the rise of augmented reality apps! Apple introduced AR Kit, a framework that lets developers create AR apps rather easily. The App Store has exploded with fantastic apps like this one, that creates a blueprint of any room with completely accurate measures or IKEA's store, that lets you test how furniture will fit in your apartment before buying it. It might be early to tell if AR will be the next black, but so far, it's pretty slick. Now I can't say the same about Virtual Reality. So far, VR has just been a curiosity gimmick at tech events, but it hasn't really picked up for anything else. Some disastrous user experiences here, you need an obstacle-free space to use it you can quickly get dizzy and disoriented, not to mention... it's a girl magnet. For a startup, it might be tough to figure out whether or not to spend time building products for these experiences. My suggestion here is to try to build the least viable product you can build, and test how people react to it. Sure, it's nice to get a nice publicity boost by being one of the first Apple Watch apps, or the first AR apps on the App Store but building something like this is a huge bet and if user excitement is not sustainable... it might proof useless in the end. And that my friends, is why Slidebean doesn't have an app yet. Among other reasons.
