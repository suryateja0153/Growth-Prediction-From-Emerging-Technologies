 well this is something pretty common right you walk into the wine store you simply pick up a bottle of red you pay and you walk out right well our shopping experience is about to make a huge leap into the future with talking labels and no not just from me drinking too much of the wine Tim Owen is about to explain what the new technology that became popular with the Pokemon go craze has to do now with our wine purchases Tim when I say a big leap into the future I really mean it right yet I know it was super excited to be launching the first ever talking wine label and I think the great part is it's fun it's interactive and it's simple to use so Jenna maybe we should go through it how it works because it is it is kind of the future here today so what you do is you go to Google Play or iTunes you download the app you follow the prompts it's very simple here all you do is hold the hold your phone over the label of Aurora stands when the bars are mine impede and you can see that it starts talking to age so what's great about this is 19 crimes as is based off story stories so in this instance here we've got John O'Reilly who was fighting political oppression and was sentenced to mutiny and it was either losing his life or going to Australia for 20 years so it's also culture and history and the foundation of Australia and yet that's just pretty cool and it's it's augmented reality right is that is that what we're calling it and I have my bottle here so this little guy is gonna tell me a little bit about the wine yes not to be confused virtual reality is basically putting on goggles and that's changing augmented reality is about changing what's in front of you so now Pokemon go that we've kind of known about for a few years so it's really altering the state of and how you bring it to life so you know each convict has a different story that they want to tell and that like I said they're real stories that it's kind of taking convicts to colonists so yeah that's what augmented reality is and it's pretty exciting it is pretty exciting on top of it just being cool and like you said we're going to be able to learn a little bit what else can we I mean obviously I know that this wine is awesome yeah you know the shopper experience is continually changing you know you've got online shopping in the aisle and I think people really want to know what they're consuming you know what's in the product and this brings it to life we know that you know everyone's somewhat connected to a smartphone these days and you know that's our source of information so naturally it's easy to transition there and kind of learn more about it and as you saw it's a very simple process and you know not just in store but think about you know go to a dinner party with family and friends at home showing you your partner or what have you it's it's so engaging it's so fun like watching someone's reaction on this is it's really enjoyable it's a tough the enjoyment you will definitely be the hit at any party if you break out this and show them that your bottle of wine has a talking label on it and now this is 19 crying's wine this is the type of wine that this app is going to work with right yeah so we have seven different wines that this kind of works on so you know as I mentioned age convict has a different story so now the foundation for 19 crimes is that story in the history of Australian I was Australian I'm very proud and this is this was our foundation so it works across our wines as I mentioned we're slightly introducing new wines we've just launched a hard Chardonnay that tells you the first of our female convict Jane Fleming and her story so you know a great way to bring these real stories to life well they always say there's an app for everything there really is an app for everything now so we will make sure like you said go to our you know Google Play and and our App Store and make sure that we get that app and then do this it's gonna be pretty cool to show off to everyone Tim this is something pretty awesome I can't wait to try it out thank you so much for telling us about it thanks Tina okay I will don't go anywhere the morning blood we'll be right back
