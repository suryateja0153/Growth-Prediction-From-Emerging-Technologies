 is I'm sorry by tally yes gone charak yes alright thanks vitality is the CEO and founder of augmented pixels it's a company that developed software to lounge drones robots and other devices navigate outdoors and n GPS denied environments with high era see he's been involved in several adventures exploring the potential for computer learning image recognition and augmented in virtual reality he's recently served as mentor and judge for NASA space race startup challenge sounds exciting and a multi multi fate sorry multiphase business plan competition to our launch startups to encourage adoption of NASA technologies fatality is from Odessa Ukraine and received academic and business degrees from Richelieu fight iam sorry and the Odessa national university so Batali's going to talk about artificial intelligence intelligence and augmented reality and animal production systems oh thank you very much and then when I was microns like an appliance my name is an applied miss make a little house it's tough I will keep my presentation short and I will not go deep in some technologies but like I mean computer vision may be lost six years so I have a very company in this area but so today I was actually to talk about how machine learning can the organ technology could be used for animal production and I will share some of my experience in Alton almost mitigation in computer vision plus i did some my homework and found several interesting use cases would be used for annual production and i will share several videos you just turn your imagination I know it hard at three hours or four hours of town but I hope you will join you can you just imagine would be what you can do it so now we have a lot of new sensors collect different data about environment about about animal outside inside we have also most robots and techniques inside of autonomous robotics also mushroom learning computer vision etc so with the same view and what would we have included power of cpu and GPU so we can analyze much more data than we can do this like 10 years ago plus we have better internet so we can you can can use a lot of data collect data from sensors and analyzes on a club so i will share several important cases for me not to the them i will just talk about my vision about this and i will try to be short 10-minute fishing so I think the main interest in agriculture is a lot of ID sensors for example probably most Apollo's ba into service or you dig deep before just imagine what you can create something like 54-hole yeah so you can track those of different information from annual and will calculate expression late ph level and cetera and I should have very cheap sensors like this you can track individually condition of each animal you can make decision individual for sure it's electronic amplification it's very important focus occasion to analysis animals inside of farms in session using very simple techniques it's not to like rocket science in machine learning but you can analyze odometry of 40 Panama and we possibly into some cycles where it's better to to make new animals etc so fun facial recognition this is like more silver and come from so just using a camera or several camera you can recognize facebook Oh anymore yeah so you can you don't need even to integrate some chips inside of the body and having these techniques you can you can for example see the animals in more efficient ways in fact some additional front wait detection I want to show you some video this is some of kind of technology we have inside of the company but i will share to you so I using some specific center and it's machine learning me so you can walk around the animal in this case is a few months yeah and you can understand a geometric body so you can create a 3d model of the body science you understand please you can understand the you can analyze using data what already exists you can understand the size of the body so you can predict the weight of of animal and you can do this in a very like natural organic way without stretch to earth to the animal so you don't need to like to put in specifics places and setups you can just put sensors on that wave an animal walking in the natural way and the recognized send and create such kind of models it's back to the presentation with use of justice cheap cameras you can check for example skin on animals and in the host way you can do probably insane techniques wake up because company eventually using deep learning or neural networks ecnl you can understand for example some disease and again you don't need to be very close to them it's a lot for you you can just use the you can't do this remotely it's possible also to track behavior so probably you can understand some disease from my behavior how are you tracking behavior of animal for these cakes you definitely need to so i will show you [Music] like for example like for technology was inside if something what we doing so we do we do some kind of mapping from the environment etc so it's some kind of Helmand and you can provide the soundness step-by-step working instructions to your work inside of five this way you don't need like to explain anything it will show you mine for example if you need something to tick or something the man's name you can just provide such kind of instructions and the worker will do this and more efficient and it also on it's also to do this is like open to trial team from bases on machine learning and artificial intelligence only you thank you next use case yet outlawing segregation so most of how companies picture about products own products of our biology I'll speak with one second to do it for example what we have so we do systems was that we do not do a hardware we do justice system what you can plug into drawn or to a robot and after that you can program behavior inside so if you don't need any pilot or any human who piloted for example what we have we now focus this video like one year old because I cannot share some new videos but yeah that about this is drawn is flying to autonomously and and without GPS so we don't need GPS if you just the image data from from camera and telling this because you can just program this behavior and this acknowledged kind of technology beautiful four by six to four robots with you so for example in this case you can deliver some sensors close to animals yeah and you can tell much more data you can track location Trek behavior etc in these cases out almost robotic tube so you can you can clean something in the farms or you can see the animals what is important so how these sensors robotics and such as they generate a lot of information you cannot analyze it so you need you need some systems what will make some small decisions without human assistance or will ask you for something but will analyze something elect Alton honestly and a lot of systems now using like in the farming but not in in animal production but so please bring like all these use cases bring me to some kind of these models so you have a animal with some sensor outside inside they sending data to some kind of artificial intelligence or with human-like with supervising load in your result supervising learning and this system give instructions to throw bodies in more details it look like you have sensors and you sending instruction for example to figure systems to robots and you can sense interactions to augmented reality glasses to workers and we do something would be starting already see this kind of sweetness arms and results of this so I'm answering George so I'm thinking in terms often in investments and profit so I'm when I'm going to any company i'm i'm talking about not like investment for you but for innovations just for innovation itself i'm talking about the size kind of system could decrease code and we can share post with this for example farms and businesses agricultural business so it is the right how we can make a production more cost efficient so that result is possible to increase return investment it's possible to reduce costs on human labor and by the way my company babies in california in palo alto but i'm originally from from ukraine button like six years of company here and human-like cause of the human labor united states no it's comparing with other countries very high so when you're trying to create here some projects you need to compete with their with the same cost abroad and thank you add more robotics into production it's make you more free from this kind of course so you can you can do not dependent so it's possible to make more competitive exports so we can evenly can compete with the prices in the future what is good so thank you signs that you started to use artificial intelligence machine learning in agriculture you can increase your knowledge is and this is a continuous process of you you will help improve your systems like daily and this makes acknowledge is much more massive and as a result is efficient use of resources thank you very much [Applause] fascinating questions we can avoid obstacles yeah in the landscape area yes so with with our system be taught to do mapping of the environment so we have some textual map of the second we we understand the obstacles like new obstacles in the objects etc and sending to control system like new comments how to how to avoid this obstacle any truly part so you need to use a lot of sensors who is not on the camera and I'm you you have to use like ultrasonic to to our to not broken glass because you cannot detect glass using cameras for some reason set up so easily it's a very very big system with little peppers i I'm working whether New Zealand is has a lot of interest in trying to reduce methane emissions in sheep and cattle and I guess with your e pills and that I mean is there a possibility that you could sense methane and then deliver I forgot what the what I'm looking for but anyway tannins are or to control the mathematicians in analyte have you thought about that or is that possible ah I think yeah so you need justice right sensors indeed you need to the right so right I don't need to exclusive but probably yes the part of the problem is that they had a compound and then it gets wash out of the system but if enter or organisms a draft adapt but if you could put at the right dosage continue you know you wouldn't have continuous you want to have the weed resistance from Thanks idea okay oh hey G you know I come I harvest stage I say your heart hanging pinky you might you might start to see or harvesting avocados and sardine avocado some time but with that pull helmet on it i can see you pretty quickly give the harvester better view what are you trying to get because if keying on exactly needs to take right you can potentially do that with other ripening fruits that have different spectrums and it was really show that really quickly which couch other ones there or what's ready to pick at that and yeah so what you can do you can put some so first of all using computer vision techniques you can define these fruits second and some commercial networks etc seconds you can understand like color for example of these scoops and the source you can provide like a pet you can just like highlight these food so it will be visible for you i'm not sure how this cost efficient but because vs like robotics itself so you can probably can send the robot and pick up troops yeah but how it is cost efficient compared with the human is in a helmet about yes like only technology level possible all right questions ok thank you alright well thanks a lot so we'll take sorry probably about a 15 minute break here and then we'll reconvene I've got three more presentations in the afternoon ok i think we probably should kind of get settled here on your car separate each engine came out here and almost eerie and here not the official disease we okay go okay so we're going to switch gears a little bit from agriculture production per se more natural resources and soil and water so our first talk presentation this afternoon
