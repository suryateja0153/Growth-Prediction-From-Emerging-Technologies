 oh my goodness I said on my Facebook page dinosaurs have invaded look at this this is our augmented reality and this truly to me is going to be the ultimate Christmas present and we are going to show you how you can go from having dinosaurs that are interactive not only interactive but educational and it could be dinosaurs and cars or it's going to be your space like going to outer space could you imagine being on the space station without ever having to get into the shuttle dream okay chef I have to look at this so yeah it's oh gosh this cornea that's cornea a scardy is joining us and she is your our product expert you work for utopia and we're so excited to have you here at HSN this is the coolest product oh my gosh it is okay let's start off you simply how you choose for 3995 it's this day only so we're gonna take $10 off you're gonna get this delivered in time for Christmas on 4 flexible payments of $9.99 how you choose do you want the space one with the Augmented cards and that cards and that's gonna also come with your augmented cars for cards for cars as well then you have the dinosaur so whichever one you choose space or dinosaurs and then you're also going to get the cars coming included cars cards cards cards yeah it's a mouthful it is so what is augmented reality augmented reality there's an app that came out about a year and a half ago you probably remember all the kids all the parents they were running out of their homes trying to capture these mythical creatures they don't exist but you can see them through your phone screen so this is the same exact concept this is augmented reality which is virtual graphics ok late into your real-world environment so that's what you are showing it's in the beginning of a dinosaur was actually crawling on my hair ok and so I'll actually show you again okay so we've got it let's just show our viewers at home so how this is going to work you're going to get these deck of cards when you choose the space choice that's going to come with 26 of the deca cards the dinosaurs come with 20 deck of cards so you're gonna take one of the cards out it even gives you educational information right fun facts then we're just gonna lay this down on the table so I didn't want to yank it out of the shop yeah then you're gonna use your smartphone or your tablet smartphone or tablet okay or you can even use it with the VR headset for a more immersive interactive experience okay I'm gonna show you just the card itself so I download the free app and I scan the card in just like that because now it's 4d the t-rex just came to life he just came to life they say they're extinct I don't believe that there is one standing myself away guys okay so even better I can hit the fun facts icon so did you know female t-rex were bigger than the males peanut girl's power rock and roll okay and then we've even got the skeleton mode so this is like a real life x-ray can we weren't actually seeing the drive man okay let's do the drive mode and now look he's gonna walk up my arm that is a dinosaur skeleton walking up your arm so this is amazing because you think about did you make a bigger so you can make it bigger when you scan them in oh and this is awesome because we always talk about dinosaurs and I think they're so timeless whether you're a little boy or you're a grown male little girl female adult it's fun everybody wants to transfer back to prehistoric times be surrounded by dinosaurs and this is stem based education okay so what does stem-based education so that's all science technology engineering math this is technology used to learn as parents I know that electronics they terrify us a little bit kids are always on their smartphone they're always on their tablets they're gonna do it anyways so why not give them technology that feeds their brain right they're learning while they're using it it's immersive its interactive it's bringing everyone together and it doesn't make noise you know I'm saying I mean except if you have it you can hear China good you could you know a lot of those toys like you're hitting your banging and it's like or it's repetitive in its aren't you crazy this is wonderful because not only is it educational not only is it interactive and fun but you're getting the virtual reality headset now how this is going to work you're gonna pop your smartphone inside here and this is gonna work with an apple with an Android operating system if you've got a tracfone as long as it has of course what gyroscope drivers know which most phones do you can use it in here and this has those stretch bands so this is going to work for anyone who is seven years and up but usually with moderate you know if apparent 5'4 everyone loves dinosaurs everyone loves space right and you do have the split screen right here so this right here if you get the space bundle it's going to be a 360 tour of the International Space Station so all you're gonna do is you're gonna take the headset and you're gonna slide your phone in right through here and you can actually look up you can look down left it's like you're floating and it's like you're floating in space so every kid wants to be an astronaut every kid wants to experience the solar system see all the planets in orbit and this allows you to do that while learning hey maybe one day you'll get to Mars before we actually do absolutely you can do your virtual reality headset so that headset comes included you're also going to get your deck of cards now the deck of cars which eat which either you know whichever one you choose I can't speak today whichever one you choose you're gonna choose dinosaurs or the science one never the science today say yeah geez Louise the space now if you choose the dinosaurs that's going to come with also the deck of cards that is for the car so that you can actually drive on your own racetrack which we'll show you in a minute and then for your space one then that space cards and you're gonna get the cars as well coming included so already almost a hundred of these have been spoken for the virtual reality headset comes included it is adjustable on the back so you can get that customized fit it's not big it's not clunky its compact it's portable if it's on the road trip and the kids want to do in the back of the car road trips dinner practice vacations this is technology that you want to embrace and the best thing is that it brings people together so you can use it with the VR headset absolutely but you can also use it with a smartphone or a tablet highly compatible brothers and sisters that come together mom and son nieces nephews this is technology that brings people together it's immersive its interactive and I want to show you so both of these sets no matter whether you choose the space bundle or the dinosaur they are gonna come with a bonus cars deck so as you can see on the front we have a police car we have an ambulance we have a dump truck taxi don't all kids go to their parents and say hey can I take your car keys can I go for a drive and usually you know it's 7:00 or 8:00 the answer's no we can't do that I have a curfew now you can say yes so if I actually turn to the back here you will see that we have tracks all along the back side so what this means is that kids can actually build out their own virtual course so they can build out this course and then put virtual obstacles over it scan a card in so I can scan in a police car okay and I can use my tablet or iPad and I can drive it and I can navigate this course that I have created myself it's that amazing and you know what the nice thing is is this is not complicated you are simply taking your smartphone and when you say scan it in you just mean go into because you know when you say scan we'll go over to the cars to show that you don't mean physically scan like a barcode no I mean just from so you're gonna take the lens on your camera okay and what you're gonna do so I'm going to set this down and here we'll just show what you what we're talking about on the screen they're actually showing you how to scan how you can get information and that's when we talk about educational this is educational it's interactive it's necessary hundred and sixty degree app now the app that you're going to once you get this at home on your smartphone or your tablet you're not having to worry to buy the app the app is free to down free to download so when you get the box itself though it's gonna come with a registration code okay and that is going to unlock all the features on the house fantastic I've in to the card okay I have to preface this by saying I'm not a very good driver in real life what is what you mean by scan in the car yes because I think everyone at home I literally think like a UPC code no so I just take the camera lens and I point it towards the card and just like that okay very easy okay let's see if I can stick to this obstacle course hey nice job you know mented reality this is augmented reality if a user saw me driving like this I'd be arrested yesterday Ernie but it is so much fun and what you can actually do is you can record a video so I can hit record and I can we have my driving skills uh-huh oh I'm no good at driving about the hand-eye coordination that you're absolutely inching as well absolutely you know I think sometimes as adults kids get toys for Christmas and then they sit and play by themselves absolutely this is something that as a parent as a mom as a dad as a grandparent a sister or a brother you're actually going to want and yes I mean want to sit down and play with them because it is so much fun this is like whisking you away to your own wild adventure whether it's using the cards to take that augmented reality and take you to a whole new level or you're simply getting on YouTube there is so much free content for virtual reality that you don't even have to pay more on YouTube and that's going to be with the virtual reality utopia headset which comes included and to me what did I say to you I said I can't even believe for 3995 years you're getting all of all of this this is honestly the gift that keeps on giving because with kids we say you know what do i buy them they have this toy it stuffed away in the closet they've used it once they're over it this sat right here it has so many layers to it it's got a 3d library you can scan the cards in you can use the VR headset for thousands and thousands of free apps on the app or Google Play Store so I mean think about limitless it really is so it's not like you play with it once and then you're done I mean there's so much content at your fingertips that really allows you to explore whether it's space whether it's dinosaurs I love it you're talking prehistoric yeah you know we watched the movie with the dinosaurs yeah and we loved those movies and when they come on the TV and we want to replay them and watch them or you have the movie at home the DVD this is a way it's taking it to a whole new level the fact that you're getting the bonus set of car absolutely and a nice I do want to show you so we have the 40 library right here for the cars I can go in and learn about every single car the transporter dump truck electric car fire engine so I can go in and I can actually learn about the speed the handling braking you can do all that fun stuff so every single app whether it's a space this is Dino kick car from Italy from 1954 so you are learning this is this is great it's stem-based education kids are having fun they don't feel like they're learning right well and I always find like when I go to the doctors and the doctors telling me it's something about you know your health or whatever I feel like I never remember but I have this one doctor and I know this is not it's not personal but trust me he draws he'll draw like a little thing trying to explain to me and you know what I remember it because he's actually putting it to paper absolutely that's the same thing when you actually have something on your tablet or your smartphone now you're retaining it you're remembering it you're having fun it's not something you're just sitting there listening to at you know nauseam this is something now you're playing with family it's a mercy yeah it's interactive it's hands-on I would like to show you the solar system stay excited about that solar cell because I think that is a lot of fun my niece or not my niece my nephew just came down with my sister and her husband Kim and Jo and they went to Kennedy Space Center and I'm telling you they had like picked million pictures they took but it was so much fun if you want to explore the planets the solar system knows how space objects you can even do space missions you can you can beyond the space a space station you can take a 360 tour of the solar system right so I'm here and I'm saying all these planets orbit around me or the International Space Station now watch this I'm gonna scan in my solar system card let's turn our volume up okay so when I scan this in it's gonna say solar system and then you see all the planets in orbit now watch this zoom in this is a solar system brought to life right before it even has changed language it does so you can change that we can change the language for feeling a little multilingual we want to learn a different language I mean kids are learning a lot of - I mean you love it French and then we do have a photo mode okay so you did take a picture with us earlier so what you can do you can actually go in here let's Paul find a fun planet that we like look at all these different options so you can take a planet let's go back here and I can take a picture so let's see if I can do a selfie here there we go I'm here with this planet and I can capture this photo and then I can post this on social media I can share it with my friends I don't know a planet that is but it's right next to me right I mean that's so cool but I mean I think you know in particular we'll show you the picture of the dinosaur because I took a picture with the dinosaurs so whether it's the space station whether
