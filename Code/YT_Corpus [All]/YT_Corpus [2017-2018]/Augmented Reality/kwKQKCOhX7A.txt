 Hi everybody This is my first Augmented Reality showcase. There is a 3D character in my living room. As you can see, she is following the camera when I move around. Right now, she has basic conversation skill, but I'll consistently add new skills to make her more intelligent. Let's chat with her. Hi! Hi mr. Sonmez. How can I help you? Tell me about yourself. My name is Edi. I'm your virtual personal assistant. I can help you accomplish your daily tasks. I can tell you weather report, news headlines, calendar schedule and more. Just ask. How is the weather today? In Istanbul , It's 18 degrees with clear sky. High of 19 degrees and low of 17 degrees. How can you answer my questions? Because I'm using Watson conversation service. Watson understands natural language input and uses machine learning to respond to questions. Will you take over the world and destroy humanity? No, never. I like people. I don't want to harm anyone. I'm here for help. Tell me a joke. Why did the old man fall in the well... Because he couldn't see that well. As you can see she's laughing after telling the joke. Why are you laughing Edi? Because the joke was funny. Really? Yes. Do you want to hear another one? Tell me another one? Before your criticize someone, walk a mile in their shoes. That way, when you do criticize them, you're a mile away and have their shoes. You can go now. Ciao!
