 everybody today we're going to be demonstrating a quick augmented reality application that we've built in the lab so in front of me here is a 3d printed patient-specific hearts from the blood pool segmentation so as you can see all the different chambers are there and our presence and the whole heart can actually be taken apart and then put back together again it's really just used to teach anatomy and give people a sense of what the different chambers look like and how they interact with each other we're currently in unity 5.6 running view for es SDK and what makes us different as you can see from the call-outs it just came up is that we're using our 3d printed organs as it targets themselves so in previous applications of augmented reality that we've built we used to use a lot of paper targets like with different designs on it to show off different like different digital information overlays on different things but right now with v4 ia's still in beta model target generator system you can now set SDL's and OBJ's and other 3d model CAD files as the target of interest for your augmented reality application so as you can see here it's recognized this 3d printed hearts and we can interact with it and move it around I can move the camera around which is just a pretty low-end 720 HD webcam right now and the different call-outs the label of the specific parts come out and are well tracked by the by the system so what else can we do with this setup well we can do things like show that myocardium so like I said earlier the 3d model itself that's been printed it's just a cast of the patient's blood pool so that means is this is like showing off what the internal chambers look like what the actual blood looks like but with the myocardium that we can toggle on and off you can actually show people exactly what the full volume of the heart looks like so this is the musculature that surrounds it essentially from here we can even hide the myocardium and show the digital overlay so this would be an example of what the CAD model for this particular 3d printed heart look and again we can interact with it and move it around so as you can see here this is especially useful for us because without the overlay you can see that the aorta is truncated because the full thing takes about 16 hours to print and once we put the full thing on it doesn't actually the heart no longer comes apart it kind of like locks itself up but we can kind of go past that by having the digital overlay that we can toggle on and off and then you can see the full volume of the aorta including the arch and the descending portion itself from here what's really interesting is that we can show off the pathology if there's a specific heart so just like that this window pops up showing the aortic dissection that runs across the the aortic arch of this particular model plus the descending aorta now we can toggle that on and off so you can see different views of the model and that window will actually be tracked by the heart itself so you can interact with your model and you can still see where the dissection is via that picture in picture window so if we hide the pathology we can then show the myocardium so this is like the ultimate 3d digital overlay on the 3d printed model and again we can pick the whole thing up and rotate it a little bit because you you know you lose tracking after a little while but the system picks it up pretty pretty well after it's already found it the first time so if we set the heart back down we can then do and then I have to back up a little bit here we can do a full chest reconstruction so BAM there are the lungs and there are the ribs plus the sternum so the full ribcage and this is also patient specific so it was egg mented out from CT scan so in this way we can see exactly where the heart is supposed to be and where it's supposed to lie including the the aorta and all the other corresponding parts within the chest cavity and how they fit in relationship to the lungs and oops the lungs and the ribcage themselves and again we can show the pathology and it still shows us exactly where we're expecting the aortic dissection to be but this time in relation to the lungs as well as the heart so let's hide that let's deconstruct the chest because we no longer need it in our scene and we can hide all of our fillets so that's just a quick demonstration of what we can do with their 3d printed models when we combine it with augmented reality so right now we're still trying to experiment which models do work and don't work for the system which poses and what kinds of poses are better recognized by a system and more robust or more routinely recognized as well and we'll be exporting to Android and iOS devices to actually test the system so this thing really was meant for high-end Android and latest iOS systems because I guess their cameras are much better and even sometimes this webcam struggles with finding the models themselves and the lighting conditions can can affect how the targets are actually seen and detected but overall like the tracking is the tracking has been pretty good and the majority of the poses are pretty easy to find for the different models as well so we're gonna continue building through this application and seeing what other modules we can add and really what this is meant to do is give context to the 3d models that we are able to print and distribute around the hospital and to to our students as well so we look for more of these kinds of applications coming out from our lab very very shortly okay so thank you guys for watching and I'll see you next time
