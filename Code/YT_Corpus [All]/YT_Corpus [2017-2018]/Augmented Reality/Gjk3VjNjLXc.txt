 Hey guys, this is David at 3Dream. I wanted to take a minute to give you an Augmented Reality Demo..... Check it out! It's called augmented because it's a 3D object that we created in our computer using 3D modeling. It's intersecting with real-world video imagery in real time Here's a recent project of ours where we are showing a 3D model of a church When we pull this up in our app we can show it on any smartphone or tablet so basically What's happening is we are taking the real-time video information coming in... Then the app then tracks the 3D spatial surface of the paper Instantly it locks on to that paper as a surface and it shows the 3D model linked to it The you can take that surface and rotate it study the building, or really... it can be any 3D object you want So... there it is I hope you liked our sneak peek... and you are already thinking of ideas on how you can use this in your business Our hope is to bring new ideas to companies for corporate and industrial training and also for sales and marketing So as always... this is just one more way we here are 3Dream Studios are... "Helping You...Share The Vision!"
