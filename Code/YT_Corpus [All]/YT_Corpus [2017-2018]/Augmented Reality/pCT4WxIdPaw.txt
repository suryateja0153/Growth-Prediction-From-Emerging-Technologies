 today I want to talk about augmented reality and it truly is one of my favorite subjects mainly because I believe it is going to be massive in our space now let me just talk about what augmented reality is first of all because many people don't really understand the term so augmented reality what AR is a term used for when we place computer-generated images over the real world now a very popular example of that is the Pokemon go game where the way you get your screen out you'd wave it around and you'll see these little Pokemon characters applied on top of the real world now this is very different to something else that some people may know which is virtual reality or VR now virtual reality is where you put a big headset on you absorb into a completely different world everything is computer generated so augmented reality is where we're putting computer-generated images over the real world so what this got to do with travel safety well I can see two applications that we can use in travel safety the first being training and the second being in the moment reactions so let me break those down for you so in training if you think about how we do a lot of training things like situational awareness we train people in classrooms or in videos or in other sorts of environments but how does it actually tell people what to do if somebody was for example an attack was coming towards them or a vehicle was traveling towards them or all the other scenarios that we have to deal with inside travel safety or commented reality will allow us to really get the the user the truck the person being trained into an environment where they can learn how to react or what to do in situations but also in the real world not in the computer-generated simulation but in the real world is extremely powerful the second in the training environment will be situational awareness so for example let's say we're trying to train a whole bunch of people to travel to another country and one of the things that overwhelms a lot of travelers is things like airports what if they could be in an airport they can experience what to do in an airport in real time it's about removing all those little elements of interference to was performed that much better the second application for me is about in the moment examples so let's take for example a situation where you've got somebody who an incident has happened and you want to give them directions of how to get out of an area or to show them safe zones you can do all of this with augmented reality we can direct our people live in hotels in street in cities to help them keep safe now if you don't think augmented reality is going somewhere you've just got to have a look at the people that are backing it people like Microsoft with their hololens or apple with the the art kit and a company called meta are all investing billions and billions of pound into AR it truly is going to be the next generation people are saying it's going to be the thing that's going to replace smartphones so for here for as a travel safety we are keen to develop and embrace AR technologies to be able to help people travel safely and I've loved if anybody's interested in talking to me more about AR and how it can work with travel safety please do get in touch it will be a pleasure to speak to you many thanks
