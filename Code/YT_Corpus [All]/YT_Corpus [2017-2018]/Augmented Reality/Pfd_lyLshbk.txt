 I think that teaching students topographic maps is one of the most challenging things I do. You know you're not going to remember looking at maps all day, you're gonna remember playing in these. I have half the students go to the sand table and half of them start with paper maps and then we switch and the difference is unbelievable and they immediately look down and see features and start talking about typography. The other group they do get it but I don't think they see it until they go to the sand table and come back. So there's a tremendous difference and it's fun.
