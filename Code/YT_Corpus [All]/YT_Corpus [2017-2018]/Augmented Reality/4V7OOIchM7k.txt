 [Music] you our project today is at a at a stage that's one of the most complex stages in the project we've coordinated it concrete's up the structures up so we're at the point where now we're really just getting going putting all of our MEP work in place and of all projects a hospital project is one of the most complex when it comes to putting MEP work in place so by looking at the helmet today and seeing those scopes in the context of where they were going in it was really interesting to see what was installed and what's going to be installed tomorrow from electrical the plumbing to death the work what I saw was just I was a nah it was pretty cool it was surprising how real it was in the same sense of being able to see in the future right so instead of just being in the virtual reality world and you're sort of stuck and in far-off land right you can actually see the walls you can walk the job site you can actually see what's in real life at that present time look up and you can see the future this technology will change my job by making it another tool for us to communicate our efforts of modeling and coordination with other people both installing and quality assurance and quality control aspect of the job with the biggest problem that we run into is just the coronation effort you know everybody's trying to get as much components and their equipment into a small limited space so anytime that you can bring tools such as the daiquiri helmet to allow you to see that stuff would be it would be a benefit I think it's going to help out the MEP immensely simply because the fact is they're going to be able to see a lot of the collisions that are above ceilings and situations that fall within the walls so I think that's going to help them immensely is getting ahead of the program getting ahead catch those issues early it has the potential to answer a lot of the questions and issues that we have a lot a lot of that surround digitization right so we've digitized all of the information we consume in the field we've digitized the capturing of information what we haven't yet done is taken that digital information and put it right in front of the people in the field so in using the helmet today I think I think that's where the real potential is it allows you to see issues that might arise and context of where they're actually going to be installed I think in the end it'll help us you know as a builder to head off a lot of those issues that potentially come out on projects this is just the beginning I think we're going to see more and more of the stuff i can see coordination meetings instead of sitting behind a computer being on a job site with helmets on i see us using this technology to look in the future both on the construction side and in the office when we're designing and modeling the components yeah it physically be on out there in the field and put two and two together it helps all it gets pretty exciting when you start to think about the IOT boom and having a lot of connected sensors information on the job site that we don't have today how is that going to connect into something so that you can see that when you're out in the job site it's all great in the trailer we love having information in the trailer but when you put in in the place of work right on the job site and a wholesome true potential you
