 [Music] all right now it's time to learn about all the new cool stuff with Google Play console and I'm here with Matt to tell us all about it hey everybody we're super excited to be here iö is the big moment for us with the play console because we're all about developers as you probably know the play console supports available reviews to publish their apps to Android devices to put through the Play Store and what we've seen is over the years we've gone from a play console which was simply about getting an app from A to B from the developer to the end consumers phone now it's so much more it's really a hugely diverse set of tools that enable developers to be more successful with their app and what we found is that the user base is diversified as well in addition to our core audience of Android developers we have product managers marketing managers many other users wearing different hats in the organization is starting to use the tool at i/o this year we're announcing a whole new set of features as well as updates to some of our popular existing features in some cases these features are helping apps to be higher quality and so we're launching android vitals which is a whole new set of reporting about bad experiences on the android device so these are a user experience where your app may be crashing or your app may be rendering in a slow way or you may have extensive wake up stocks wakelocks that are causing excessive drainage on batteries so we're going to start revealing that reporting to developers it can help them to debug understand more about optimizing their app for the variety of devices that are out there and that's one of many different new features we're launching another one actually you can see on the screen behind me is the device catalog so androids diverse ecosystem has been a tremendous strength the source of the scales the 2 billion Android devices that are out there now but that diverse ecosystem can also be hard to navigate Stanford developers until now because the device catalog the much easier way to browse the you know more than a thousand different Android certified devices you can you can search and explore these devices by spec like RAM like system-on-chip and you can then see a reporting information about the number of installs your app has on that particular device or on that group of devices how much revenue you're getting how your ratings compare which can really help you to understand whether any of the bad behaviors any of these problems that users may be having with your app are concentrated in a particular area which can be critical to optimizing and making your app super high quality so we're founding even just in the initial testing which was now completed this feature is rolling out to all developers we found our early testers have really embraced the these tools it's really helping them to be much more surgical in the way they think about targeting their app and making it a great experience for end user in addition to the features that help developers to build higher quality apps we've also got a number of features which help to mitigate risk during the release process and so when you're releasing a new version of your app you may have an installed base of millions potentially hundreds of millions of users if you're pushing out a new version of your app you you know it can always be a worrying time you don't want to know that that that bugs are causing uninstalls you don't want to know that information late so we have a new release dashboard with very low latency reporting that helps you to have visibility of these metrics on the hour every hour and it's starting to roll out substantially global audience of hundreds of millions of devices and so this can help you to manage a release with a lot more confidence a third area where we're launching new features right here i/o is is in the business area and so developers in addition to building amazing experiences they want to make money they want to grow their we have a lot of new reporting including for app developers that have a subscription-based model you can look at subscription by tenure look at cohorts from when they've started when they've installed the app and how that lifecycle trends over time you can help to see how different inflection points are contributing to subscription renewals or people leaving a subscription so it can really help you to manage your subscription business and then in general we have a lot of statistics that are available through the play console in the past they weren't always easily navigable we have a new configurable statistics page and with that page developers are much more easily able to slice and dice these metrics much more easily able to to create custom configurations to compare different time periods against each other to compare one one metric against another and to introduce benchmarks the pole classes of apps so they can see how some of their reporting compares to peers who make similar apps and so we think the features like this will really help developers to manage their apps as a business as well wow that was a lot of stuff thank you so much Matt thank you [Music]
