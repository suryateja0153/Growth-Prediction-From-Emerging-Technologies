 [Music] from San Francisco it's the queues covering definite create 2017 brought to you by Cisco hey welcome back everyone with live in San Francisco for the inaugural event for Cisco's dev net create part of their dev net classic developer community now extending out into the community of open source and cloud native and DevOps world where applications and infrastructure coming together it's the cubes exclusive two days coverage I'm John Fourier with my co-host Peter Berg head of wiki bon comm research our next guest is Ben Brown CEO of bot kit out of Austin welcome to the cube thank you so we just chat before he came on about you know how open source and how you know essentially using machines and humans working together that there's a nice evolving machine learning marketplace for having new kinds of reimagine recommendation engines chat BOTS that actually work hey integrations again back to software yeah tell us what you guys do and how you guys relate to the cloud native and what your role in open source is sure so it's really interesting you know over the last couple of decades enormous amount of progress has been made on you know AI and machine learning and NLP tools at these big companies like Google and Microsoft and they are now giving that away right like it is free to use Facebook's top-of-the-line you know machine learning algorithm but but it's sort of a mystery to an unfamiliar tech you know territory for developers coming from web or mobile it's a black box that nobody's ever used before so what we do at bot kit is you know provide tools for developers mostly developers who are coming from the web or coming from mobile development and give them you know semantics easy to use and customized tools for building conversational user user interfaces and that can beam chat BOTS that can mean voice skills for the Amazon echo or Cortana or things like that and uh and give them these you know open source tools that allow them to you know take advantage of this like exciting and ope and voice to text and text a voice and all that to build you know real software today so what bot kit is is it an open-source library it's free to use MIT license so very liberally licensed and it gives gives developers tools like hearing and saying right so it's not about API calls and you know NLP classification and utterances and all that it's about how does a robot like think and act and like sort of the metaphors around that so I think about could I think a web kit things these are languages of developers so are you guys actually providing bot kits to create BOTS or is it more of a platform how how do you guys describe what you do in open-source and how do you guys stay in business and keep the lights on yeah so we're a venture back startup and you know so we have an open-source toolkit and and these kits right so if you want to build a slack bot or a Facebook bot we will give you 90% of the code that you need to you know bring that bot up and start talking and that piece is all free and we do that prefer for slack for Facebook or Twitter or Cisco for Alexa and Microsoft and a bunch of other platforms and what we're really hoping is that we can instill in people or sort of give to people a skill set that is akin to you know a webmaster right like you did there's a bunch of skills that are interrelated that you need to actually bring dissociation is cooling to save them time to get acclimated and get working absolutely absolutely and then on top of that we have a you know Pat a set of power tools that sort of complete the process so bot kit the open source piece is you know a software development library but you also need deployment management and operational tools and content management and integrations and things like that so that's where our business is a classic freemium model the first hits free that's a I'm sure that's a drug-dealer model there you get it get it in there but as they scale you're they're already successful so it's not like you're getting someone for for not getting value out of it absolutely I mean we we think about our business model in the same way the lot of other developer api's do this is these yeah let's talk about some of these open developer API is because it used to be that you use the language then you use a data management system and then we started talking about web services and that's all good but where does this end up going where you have a specialized tool kit for box that you can add you may have specialized tool kits for know Amazon starting out specialized tool kits for voice recognition that you can add yeah so is it just going to be in the interface or there going to be other classes of kits that you're that developers are going to buy and and combine them together where do you see this going yeah absolutely I mean we it's just like you know all software development that came before right so nobody built every line of code for their mobile app right like you nobody had to define what a button was for iOS that was done at a higher level so that in the same way you know people who are building these conversational apps are composing you know their own code with third-party services with you know open source software and all that and combined so you know there's really interesting stuff going on like I said there's NLP tools coming down from all these big players but also from small players there are there are tools like human takeover right which is like a new thing that that didn't exist before so you know you're talking to a bot you're starting to get angry you know IBM Watson can identify your sentiment and say oh this person is frustrated let's bring in a real operator so there's you know third-party services to actually manage that I want that check in right away only angry customers parachute me and just really angry customer I know does not sound like a great job yeah and then they're you know you know almost every kind of component that you might imagine existing in the web stack is being specialized or the mobile stack is being specialized for you know conversational stuff because it's just different enough right so analytics and CRM and you know I mean don't be a rocket scientist to figure out that voice is the hottest app in the market I mean you got Alexa you got Siri Google I mean voice interface is here that's conversational to your point yes now software that's kind of where you guys are betting right yeah yeah absolutely I mean we've got your voice and conversational software right I mean as I was just saying in my in my session here like I don't think anybody really wanted to sit down at a typewriter attached to a television you know that was just a technology that we had at the time you know if you know Charles Babbage and whatever was dreaming about the thinking machine and so we're just much much closer to that now and we know we think that over the next five or ten years you know almost all software will have some sort of conversational element whether that's in the app is it does it mean you're on an Alexa skill but that's embedded in the car you know who is just in a never fite fashion but this is a relevant fashion piece where we seeing machine learning get rendered in AI and some of the cool you know too is applications like cars and boys and yeah yeah I'd ask you you mentioned that you know all this free stuff coming out it's like it's like Christmas it's like a kid in the candy store for your developer how in your opinion has that shape that develop our ecosystems because I mean outside of the young kids who are just green have no idea that it wasn't like this before like in the old days we used to actually program everything yeah a lot of cool stuff coming in for free from Google from Facebook some cases Amazon but I mean what's the impact I mean you know people are able to take advantage of much more sophisticated technology much earlier on in the process right like you know for the last ten years we've been talking about ah you know machine learning isn't it great if you're Google and you have you know 10 trillion you know data points but nobody else has it so it's not even worth talking about but now it's possible you can start on day one and start training your machine learning and you know models and things like that and those that you know you don't have to actually invest in that technology so and you know voice-to-text it to give them more it's given them more speed to get to newer high the higher functioning stuff yeah absolutely and it's bringing that kind of technology that was you know most of a I has been in academia right and like in research and now all of a sudden it's on my kitchen counter right so my kid now uses a you know NLP technology every day and that that is a big you know without the independent developers and and smaller apps the IOT is going to be in your wheelhouse - as more things get connected the interfaces will be more what I was going to crush about that does does does this technology today the technologies mainly thought of as a meaning part of the interface between the machine human being yeah because this technology end up in between machines yeah absolutely I mean they're like sort of between BOTS in turbot communication is very very interesting and then also you know so yes absolutely but also like being on the other side of the human or like between people right so customer service representatives using a AI to be have a solution suggested to them that they can pick from and things like that right like translating systems that like suggest the response so that you can use it if you so desire right and it makes your job easier but it's not actually doing the transaction for you so it's it's really really interesting and that's not nothing that the end-user would actually experience themselves so any final question for you Cisco has always been the king of networks I mean the internet was their wave they rode that hard we all know what they've done amazing connecting routes together routers and melt MLPs routers MPLS from the routers paths they own that yeah now they moving up the stack so now you're seeing this as a gesture of going into the community bringing apps and infrastructure together to bring true DevOps like what you're doing with your interfaces to software what's your thoughts on this strategy Joe what's your what's your take in reaction to what Cisco's doing it you know clearly so the software layer is becoming more and more powerful and you know prevalent for people and a bigger part of people's lives so I mean I think it makes you know tons of sense and the you know what Cisco is going to gain by opening these things up is you know the like innovation of the community right like that they were they were never going to be able to do the things that people are going to do with the spark api's and and the way that things are connected and you know inter interwoven to each other because you know I have like a smart home I you know have all these IOT devices they don't talk to one another I am left to like weave them together i mediate right and so and I'm sophisticated enough to be able to do that but if they're gonna make it you know as easy as plug and play and drag and drop you know it's gonna be it's gonna open up off you're gonna say waterfall versus agile which one's faster agile that's the question about BOTS reconciling or bots you haven't mediating between different devices or different bands is that it's a it could be a way that a human being can understand some instructions for how these things engage your stuff yeah so that it still looks like it's a set of human interface yeah while at the same time its operating a machine speed yeah machine efficiency this is one of the most interesting things particularly in the IOT space that I've seen there's an app called thing tin that is like a chatroom for devices and the way it works is like those devices emit machine messages and human readable messages but they can talk to each other in machine language but you can read it that's a denial of Skynet I'm telling you it's coming yeah if I did only but you like each other hey go get killed at you over there but no there's somebody's gonna have to program it to kill many algorithms to watch the algorithms great stuff I think Cisco clearly this is a move that they have to make I mean Cisco's been I mean I've been following Cisco for many generations past 10 years they were one of the first and smart homes ones first smart cities first with IOT they called it internet of everything the human network social network they had the pulse on all the right trends yeah but could not execute it Peter and to your point they'll never get there without open source in my opinion I think this is a signal that Cisco can do that now here's the key they have the keys to the kingdom it's called the network yeah and I think that making that programmable and extensible is well able to do they have to be able to make it they have to make it obviously available to developers they can create value on it yeah and that's something that they're still slowly does is bunny does the bot kit and does all this new creative activity going on the network has to be adaptive and not get in the way yeah and not for the creativity of the developer because network day is hard right and that's a great point I mean and so much of what we do with bot kit is try to drain the complexity out of this of this complex stuff and make it available so that you know this enormous amount of power is available to you know to the developer of today power to the developer developers are in charge developers are driving the network policy in a dynamic way congratulations you successfully I'm gonna check out bot kit I already have some ways Peter and I are looking at it for the clips and then the crowd chat firstly great stuff congratulations thank you Ben Brown CEO bot kit check it out bot kitty I we are soon to be replaced by BOTS here in the cube with talking machines but that's down the way when Skynet takes over this is the cube here at the inaugural of them for Cisco dev net create I'm Java at Peterborough's we'd be back after this short break hi I'm April Mitchell and I'm the senior
