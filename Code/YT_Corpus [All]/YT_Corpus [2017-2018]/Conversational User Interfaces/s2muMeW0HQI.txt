 In this video but to talk about something called schema right now me to show you what it is to try to explain to you why it is very important to pay attention to it and then I'm gonna show you some tools that you can use towards the end of the video on how to implement it on your site or your client sites with ease so here is what schema is of you ever done a Google search and you might may be a search for product and you see these stars here and there is a rating there were maybe off to the side there's all the specific product information a product image is some of the specs of a particular product and then you scroll down and you have this top stories where there is a variety of websites and their content is featured in a prominent way like this or when you scroll down maybe there's just some other random site was some reviews stars in the Google search engine results all of these are examples of schema maybe you have searched for some concert tickets and if you type in a search and you you scroll down there's these links here to specific events for this particular concert that you might be looking for this is another example of schema and here's actually better example word list dates and it lists the event venue locations this also is schema let me show you another potential scenario I'm a big fan of something called Sue V I cook a lot of times this way so maybe it's-Sue V recipe and you scroll down and you're wondering how do these get these review stars in the cook time and all of this additional information this is schema okay and lastly maybe you are a web designer or web developer or your searching for that you scroll down and you look at all of these websites now one of them has a schema why I have no idea because it is so easy to add an implement to your website and this is one of those services if you're a web developer that you can add to your client's websites maybe charge them additional fee in order to implement this on their website imagine if someone was doing the searching they scroll down which one would stand out probably the one that might have some schema and might be showing some review stars along with it all of these are examples of schema and not you might be thinking that schema really isn't that important and I just in this video want to impress upon you the importance of having schema in your website every single website you touch needs to have schema and I want to go through some of the misnomer's of schema some of the misunderstandings people have about it they think they already have but they really don't want to go through all of those in this video before I get too far in this video I want to introduce myself my name is Adam from WPCrafter.com.com where I release a ton of content to help you get better results with WordPress faster if you knew your consider clicking on the subscribe button if you don't want to miss a thing click on the belt and anything that I talked about in this video will be linked in the video description down below okay so if I haven't already impress upon you the importance of this thing called schema and I want to show you that even though you might think you have it you might not have it let me even pylon some future way of looking at the need and importance for schema there was a recent article on search engine journal and I recommend if you have a website or your making websites or people you should really follow what some of the search engine related authority sites are talking about and I came across this article actually just a few days ago and it talks about the importance of voice search and how you need to start thinking along the lines of your website and how to get a mesh in with voice search and I was also listening to a video last week a very forward thinking guy named Gary Vaynerchuk was saying how really the future is voices not video and his reasoning was you can listen to things you can use voice when you're doing other things you don't have to be focused on it so voice is really important especially with these devices that are coming out and essentially what schema is is code that gets added to your website to better communicate the specifics of what your website in your content is about for Google or various other search engines that choose to look at the schema and process it so that's kind of in a nutshell what schema is and when you think about voice search voice search is heavily dependent upon proper schema that's the only way Google is really going to know what your content is about and so when you read this article it tells you the importance of the single voice search and only scroll down to give some suggestions and what is it say right here use schema markup on your content it's super important so it's not just about having the listings in Google and then be a little more eye-catching it's about more than that it's about voice search in the future giving Google or any search engine is much information about your website and your content as possible I don't know about you I think this holiday season of giftgiving some of the biggest and gifts that are going to be going out are these Google home vote these little devices you put in your house and you can talk to it as good things and it gives you information it's going to give you information based upon schema I use the Echo devices Amazon echo I love it I have these throughout the house these are using this schema okay so right now that I've gone over schema and the importance of schema I want to talk about the misconception people have about it because you might say ha well I'm using the Genesis theme and if you go to the website it says that there is a schema in it so I'm covered or I'm using XYZ theme it says I have schema so I'm covered and I'll tell you you're actually not covered with the type of schema that I'm talking about schema actually is doing lots of things it's communicating to Google or the search engines the structure of your website so a theme is going to have schema in it that's all well coded themes can have scheme in it but what this schema is is going to say okay Google here is the header on my website okay Google here is the menu on my website and here's the sidebar on my website they it basically just it says Google here is the structure of my website but there is no information about the actual content of your website so if you are using Genesis theme or Astra Theme or any of these themes and they say it's has a schema and it that schema is very important but it's not going as far as you need it's not giving enough a schema about the actual content it's just covering structure now I personally have been using various schema solutions for WordPress for the last check as long as I've had a website the last five years for sure I purchased the many different schema solutions and some are are are okay but they're pretty clunky when you're actually inside of WordPress and there is a lot of double entry and manual entry so for example recipe here there's like this double entry so say you have all the recipe details in the content of a blog post then you have to reenter all of those recipe details and an option box below it so that the schema can be generated and that's pretty tedious especially if you might have some kind of custom solution on your website I made a video couple days ago or we can go now about implementing custom post types custom fields using something called PODS so there's a lot of double entry going on and then you start having a cluttered experience inside of WordPress when you're trying to create content and that's where he needed to be uncluttered as much as possible so you kind of have all these things, working against you now there is a new plug-in that just came out I've actually been using it I really implemented on my website over the past weekend but I've been testing it for the past few weeks and here it is it is called all in one schema Pro and here is the website now this is actually made by the same people that make the Astra Theme and the ultimate add-ons series of software and they actually have a lot of expertise in this that they have been building schema plug-ins for the past four years and there in the WordPress repository with I think maybe like 80,000 active installation so they know about the schema and they learnt everything from the free plug-in they released to create this I think a masterpiece of simplicity for what's called all-in-one schema Pro now I'm in a show you implementing this plug-in on your website how easy it is but is actually so easy you could come to the website here and see the different types of schema and how to implement it it's so easy but I wanted to actually show you because there some options that might not be communicated well enough on the website so when you come to their website right here on a link in the video description below but you can go to WPCrafter.com/schema Pro no-and right here are the a of some of the different schema types that you can implement with this right now so there's article schema so that is what you want apply to all of your pages and posts pretty much all of your content recipe schema course schema event schema local business schema review schema product and books but there's actually a few more this are the only eight that they're showing on their homepage right here now what's nice and what I like is I can go ahead and click on any of these and it shows you how easy it is to implement so for article schema when I click on it it takes me to a pager with a little bit of information an example of what the schema looks like in Google search results and then right here the three steps to implement that it's literally so easy and I really went through and I implemented all sorts of schema on my website this prior weekend and you can go here to schema types and you can see all the various schema types that it supports now what's nice is they are adding additional schema types to this over time so as new schema types come out that are in demand that they will add it to the plug-in so you see right here job posting schema software application book schema all of these different schemas so here's what a book schema looks like you can click on it and you can see this is what it looks like when you're in the Google search engine results it also the author published in pages so it's just all of this additional information that you're able to communicate to Google about the content on your website and it couldn't be easier let's take a quick look at the pricing and then let's install and implement and test some schema and I'm in a show you how to test the schema which is nice because you can test the schema that you currently have on your website so if I click on pricing this was just released its $59 for an annual license or you could just buy lifetime licenses 199 I'll tell you the schema plug-ins that I purchased over the years one of almost $400 for a lifetime license so I know what 99 is a bargain and especially when I show you how select this is to implemented it's a really good deal especially if you have customers or clients or building websites for people this is just something that you can use to differentiate you and your expertise because you know your competitor that might be charging $500 less they're not doing this so if you get any pushback on the cost of your website development this is one of those things where if you go with me you're getting it done the right way if you go with them is just to be whipped together thrown together and it's not enough and actually harm them in the long run so 59 and 199 and this is super developer friendlier to see works with custom fields it's pretty spectacular now here are some excellent actual good news about the price is if you have the Astra Theme and you have an agency license right here is the Astra Theme I talked about it many times on the channel it actually includes this plug and it was added to the aid of the agency bundle with Astro so if you're already an agency license holder which I am you don't have to pay anything it says just concluded they added that value the aster agency bundle comes with the Astra Theme comes with Convert Pro premium sites this the various ultimate add-ons and future plug-ins that this developer makes and they also have lifetime license available if you're interested in Astra just visit WPCrafter.com/Astra to check that out I have a ton of content on Astro so enough about the product let me just show you this thing in action now I have this site that I used for a tutorial not that long ago where I showed you a full three hour tutorial on how to make this website and that using the Astros using one of their starter sites and it was a very easy to put together so here I am logged into the back animal to go to plug-ins and new I've already downloaded the plug-in so I'll just go ahead and upload it really quick it's very light weight it's only 300 kB in size so it's a very light plug-in when go ahead and activated now let me just to quickly refresh here alright so one of things I like it right off the bat is they put the option underneath the settings actually it's an option you can by default it goes underneath the settings but you can have it be on the main list menu list here I hate when it's all cluttered so I like it to go in settings so here it is a schema Pro a go ahead and click here so I haven't turned on any schema yet another some advanced settings for you as well so in the toolbar when you're viewing a page on the front and it's going to add an option here that's going to say test the schema so let me see I don't have any schema implemented let yet let me do a quick refresh here Curtis test the schema so you can leave that there or you can have it be disabled if you don't want to see that in your toolbar next you have all these placement options so by default it goes into the settings panel but you can put it wherever you want and there's this option here where you want this ischemic code added and will just leave that where the setting is so first let's test our schema now Google provides a schema testing tool so what you can do when you have this plug-in installed is you can test your existing schema by clicking right here it'll open up in a new tab on the tools website and it will automatically populate the URL and do the quick search so these are the types of schema that I'm already getting by default with the theme remember I said your theme well coded themes will have some structural schema and that's very good but it doesn't get you all of what you need so here's a different schema types that come with your theme and you can click into it so I click into here this is what the schema is so basically this one is just communicating to Google here's our logo and here is our URL and it's an organization here's the WP head and this basically tells Google additional information and all these things are just given Google additional schema information so I would go ahead and close that out and let's implement some schema on our website Summit go back and click on schemas and then a minute click on add new and this is one thing I like about this plug-in you notice some of the stuff could be a little on the complicated side and they took a real complicated process and simplified it made a real easy so here's a different schema types that the plug-in currently has other all available right here so say I want to add a let's add a review schema summit click on review and then I would go ahead and click on next and then the next step is where do you want this schema applied so in the situation I'm in a put it only on blog posts so I'm choosing all posts now I can add additional locations by clicking add enable rule or I can add exclusions where I don't want it to apply now for most people you'll just have the same scheme almost locations but say you have your events you don't want events the option box to appear all over the place you want it just where the events content is going to be and so that's why you have these advanced targeting rules so I'm just going to go with this right here and then I'm in a click next and now I'm ready so I can go ahead and click on complete set up it's gonna take me back into the back end of WordPress so right here it names the schema now what I did when I implemented this on my website I have some review schema but I have different configurations in different parts so what I did is I would name it review for blog posts review for XYZ so you can stick with this name just review because working to see a list of all the schema we made but if you wanted to just have a different schema for posts in a different schema for pages and might be nice to just change of title to kind of put some location information there as well so just put four posts just to make it simple okay so now that that's added right here you can euros can be able to come back and change the location that you apply this to so you're not stuck with what you set up in the wizard it was just a pre-configure this so right here is where this the power of this plug-in really comes in the play so for review schema you need these different fields of information the name of the item that's being reviewed the image of the product the description the date of the review the actual rating and that's a five star scale and the name of the reviewer so what we can do here is if you're a developer in your may be applying this to a custom post type in all that information is already in some custom field you created while you can map these different fields to where you know that information already is so for example the review description by default it's just going to assume that it's in the content of your blog posts so you don't have to put some info on your blog post and then you have to double entry put it into this review schema it's gonna pull it from there the same thing goes for the review data just is linked up to the published date of the blog post the same goes for the reviewer name now it's nice is we can change this so say the title of the blog post is going to be the name of the product you're reviewing so there's no sense in having this double entry going on since I know that I can change this to the title of the post right there so that's one less piece of information that there's gonna be some double entry for so the same thing for their review item image say I know that I'm going to have that be the featured image on my blog post I consented to featured image or a specific image so I chose this I could just choose a specific image in my image library and there's other options here so I could just say featured image we set content with this now all were left for a review rating is the actual scale from 0 to 5 now if your developer and Yorty have this in a custom field you can go to select other custom field here or in this case I'll let it create a new custom field for me so numbly click on updates and I'm going to go jump into creating a blog post now exit before I do that let me click back here and you can see here's that schema I can go here and change it at any time delete it and all of the different schemas that I create are all going to be listed right here actually let me create one more type of schema that's very important it's article schema for blog posts this would be a lot easier to click on add new and miniatures article schema Lemme click on next and I'll apply this everywhere to all the content on the website click on next and click on complete set up in here are those same fields but all of these fields are already going to be pulled from the content you can see you don't have this double entry so this is for article type and it changes the blog post that's the only thing I want to change so news article is that timely news so when you do the Google search and it shows those big about prominent news articles 3 hours ago six hours ago stuff like that that would be your news article on the just stick with the blog posting right here in all this information is already in the blog post let me click on update alright so now I'm in a go to posts and I don't think I have an existing post just as hello world one let me just click into it and see what this is looking like so so far it looks like a normal blog post I got my title I got my description and when I scroll down this is just my Yoast stuff let me just shrink that and here's what it added to schema Pro and here's that option for me to go ahead and add a star ratings I can just add a star star rating right here or I can manually type it in or put it like that and that's where the manual info is good to go and so I would've left some of those other fields to say create a new custom field he would've created that would be available here if I also want to have the recipe schema applied to blog post so then I'd have review and recipe the no be another option here for each of these different types of schema that I'm adding to the same content type because sometimes you say it is a recipe blog you're gonna want review schema and what recipe schema you want both of it and there might be another type of schema that you want added so the schemas don't replace each other they just stacked together okay so let's just go ahead I want to create a new blog post and I want to go ahead and fill this out myself okay so I've gone ahead and added a title which is also to be the product name and I added a description I added a star rating and down here you can see I added a featured image someone go ahead and click on publish now I don't expect this to look pretty obviously I'd put a lot more information so let's go ahead and click on view poster right here so here we go where here we are with everything so now what I'm a dues a minute click on test schema and let's see what Google is showing us with their data testing tool you can see right here I have a lot of that same schema but what we have that's new is this review so when I click on it you could see all of the information so right here we have type we have description which was just from the post contents and we have the product name we have the image to the product we have the rating and the star rating this was all done with this as all-in-one schema Pro plug-in and you can see right now I must've screwed something up for the blog posting this was in here and I just added it let's click on it and see what the heck this error is so when I scroll down it looks like I have a problem with my logo let's see my logo height has an invalid value okay so I have to go and fix that but you can see how you can come here and test this schema add schema to your site add schema to your content and come here and test that schema and then what's going to happen next is the next time Google comes your website to index it it's going to take this new information this deeper information it has on your content and added to the search engine results most likely now with the review stars they don't add it to every piece of content sometimes soak in my experience I can usually get it on about 70% of my content it's never 100% so it's it's up completely up to Google whether or not they're going to give these enhanced listings to you it's completely up to them but you should have this came on for many different reasons this is this is you communicating to Google exactly what your website is about so that's it this is all in one scheme approach you have any questions about this video and schema you can ask in the comment section down below also have links to everything in the video description box and also have user form on my website you might not be aware that you can go here click on form and you can ask questions to me there is any question that's not about this video or it's a little bit more technical anything more people can benefit come over to my website click on the form button and go ahead and ask so that's it for this video thanks for watching NOC in the next one
