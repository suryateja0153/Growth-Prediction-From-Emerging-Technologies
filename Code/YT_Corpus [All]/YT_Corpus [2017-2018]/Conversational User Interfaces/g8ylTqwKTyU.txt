 Welcome back! Right now you should have an app, a messenger app up live that you can actually message right to your page. So you can go to messenger, find the corresponding page that you're associated with your messenger app. In this case, it's Aha Moment Labs and you should be able to interact with it. So when I go there when I type 'hi' it the parrot says 'hi'. If I typed in anything else, that gets parroted back too. So, except there is there's one command that I've programmed that won't do that and that is 'Aha'. If i type in 'aha' this is what what you get: you get back these cards. Ok, now these are cards are provided again by Facebook. So, there are two different types of cards. One has a web URL and other one is a postback. A postback is simply a response, so if you push post back, it says, 'postback received' and you can make it say anything really. Right. If you did web URL, boom it sends you to another page and then this is another type of card. The second type of card which is just a postback. It does not include the link. Now, as you can see here you have a number of different different elements. You have a postback element, you have a an element right here where you have it like a description, you have a title and you just have the image and over here we have all the same elements except there's also a web URL. Now you may also be thinking well how many of these options can I include? Right? Can I have one two three four five post backs or URLs or combinations? And answers 3, you can have up to three. So in both of these cases, there's one here and two over here so let's say that you wanted to change this up what would you do?
