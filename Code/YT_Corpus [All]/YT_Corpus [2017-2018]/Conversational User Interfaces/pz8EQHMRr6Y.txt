 [Music] we're chatting about storytelling in the age of conversational interfaces my name is Oren Jacob on the CEO and co-founder of a company called pull-string that's very happy to be here first thanks to Google for inviting me here at Google's home team other folks in the speech recognition team the folks at API Google cloud and the various friends and relatives actually in Mountain View work with probably speaking in particular let's get started with a talk there we go I work at pulse train comm and this is a picture of the pull-string platform and it's authoring environments will do two slides of upholstering and then 58 slides about everything else but I want to motivate the talk here because this is a professional platform for computer conversation authoring environments and emigrated ml hosted runtime analytics collaboration for text and voice form including for Google home so the did you scale out today with built in pulse train and live today so if you want to go talk to Diddy and have it sing back to you you said you can do that with your new Google home the Google game everybody thank you google for those skins the today's talk I'm going to start a little farther back this is Robert McKee and Mart McKee wrote a very fancy book called story there's some quotes from it here and Robert Marquis made a career out of educating people in the screenplay trade about how to build characters and craft dialogue broadly speaking we're going to motivate this talk from that place and talk about ways and design motifs challenges and opportunities my building conversational interfaces as the point of today's talk this first quote from the key two characters revealed those choices a human makes under pressure the deeper the revelation the true the choice of the characters essential nature one of the principles of screenwriting and to motivate that for a second by the way prior to starting culturing I spent 20 years working at Pixar if you ever seen the Pixar movie in their life raise your hand no come on now raise your hand okay whose favorite for most bugs like no Nemo right come on well tomorrow second um well one of these things is always considered at the studio that I worked out across the bay for many years is under what pressure do you put the character centering your story and at what point do those characters make very important decisions in the they make under pressure it's what reveals through the dialog that they use that's an important word for our talk here about confidential interfaces the dialogue they use how they express what they do under pressure and the decisions they make is how we understand more about those characters and when they come from here's my keys book so McKee spent I think he's passed away now but he twenty thirty forty years of doing like three day long Tony Robbins Styles seminars so instead of spent two thousand bucks and go sitting at a Marriott for three days you can buy the book for like 19 bucks and that's good because McKee was a very um sharp I'll say speaker he enjoyed thrashing most of the work produced in Hollywood publicly in front of the folks who had done it was sort of his shtick and you paid two grand for the privilege 20 bucks is a better deal and it includes really is you know three four five hundred pages of analysis and advocacy in the space I'm going to take out just a couple of highlights from today so if you under some good reading afterwards you can check that book out and you'll find a lot of the stuff in your reference from the key I want to talk about three other particular quote so we'll get started with here due to the level set what it means to review character under pressure pressure is essential to the rub to the communication of your character to audiences and if nothing is at risk and he choose to to tell the truth in a situation where Lima gained you nothing the choice is trivial and the moment expresses nothing this was well characterized as asking the question hey Google home what's the weather in Mountain View today we all expect Google home to know that and answer the question with a high of 86 degrees is the forecast like air temperature being 79 as I discovered at the happy raspberry pie integrated drink mixer don't by API out there which is pretty cool I like the peach one myself however the same character in Stinson telling a truth when a lie would save their life then we sense that honesty is at the core of his nature this is the case when you ask really any personal assistance or really anything in conversation as a conversation interface a question it might not know the answer to you've now placed that agent that action that bot in an awkward position either because they didn't understand what you said so intent was not recognized properly perhaps earlier in the pipeline feast recognition may have worked and given something wrong back to the intent recognizer are ultimately maybe that's not a thing within scope as demoed by the happy drink mixer after half an hour ago I think it was Chris with the guy gentle is that right so Chris said hey Google what's on the menu today and the assistant didn't know and said I don't know and then he then went into the particular thing they had built that you understand the menu agenda ingredient vitamins broadly speaking but when you answer what you say back is important because at that point there is pressure you pushed the conversation interface to a place that the thing you design does not know how to accommodate it so first can you understand what was said back and no you don't know what to say and then how do you defer do you either say I don't know politely do you say checking Wikipedia do you give an answer and carry on anyway and the choice you make there in particular in the areas that are out of scope for the action that you're designing are probably the most important point in design that communicates the tone mood and style of what you're trying to build and how you expect the users in your audience to feel about the thing that you're building you might expect that I'm taking some examples at a thinner here an uber action a Bank of America action of Southwest Airlines action and a lyft action would all answer quite differently if you ask them questions they don't know about because the tone Buddhist by all those Branson companies are very different and that's what taught so about today and that's McKee Jana one of the story seminars then I was doing standing ovation at the end because he takes the last two hours to tear apart the various plot lines in Casablanca which is a fun thing to go read there's some point you can check Google images you can find the grass he draws for that and at the end of that two hours we all cry week with joy we've had a story reveal to us finally I have up for twenty bucks in the way out please thank you how'd that plays out so moving on past let's define conversation for a second here sort of scope to talk more specifically kicked off Google earlier today an informal exchange of ideas spoken words more casually to people talking back and forth using natural language in computer conversation we're going to swap out one of those people and soft in the the very fancy computer Google cloud being one of the fanciest ever built on the planet Earth today in fact but even if we do that we cannot separate having a conversation from thinking about whom we're having that conversation with those things are inextricably linked and they have been since you were born because everybody you talk to or more importantly has talked to you actually had a personality and a tone abuddin of style so here's the quote you should recognize it is not Luke I am your father the most misquoted line in movie history it's no I am your father those nerds in the audience Empire Strikes Back there you go no I'm your father there we go okay to be or not to be Act three Scene one William Shakespeare's Hamlet holy this goal I have a dream my opera dr. King here in DC I'm sorry Dave I can't do that how and mommy which is of course my kids so when each one of these cases I brought the examples up those to be very specific very general to be public and to be private to be fictional and non-fictional to be current and historical and future tense as well too in all circumstances in these quotes I bet you who here in the audience recognize the vast majority them immediately raise your hands please there we go and back at home on livestream raise your hands at your desks I can't see you okay that that's why I want explained to folks here and get the point across very strongly that as you design the dialogue in the Google actions that you build and then the thing to build for Google assistant when you're using language back and forth it is utterly essential that you contemplates both intent and content both understanding which is an important part what we do here in the built in the tent here and also responding back and how we design that dialogue because you always associate what's said with who says it behind it but we learn about each other through the use of language and we did at a two level both on the surface and below the surface the subtext in it context and I use the iceberg metaphor here sort of bluntly because what's said at the surface big in the context of our conversation is an important part of what gets communicated in a conversation but all the other things underneath which take different expressions in text and voice form add a whole heck of a lot if not even the majority of your long-term conception of the experience subtext can be in voice form prosody am i talking super high really fast or am I going mellow dude means quite different things do i uptick of the back the way I talk or do I not end down downbeat in text form it's how long does about it to respond back and forth do I say typing indicators does the bottom expelling errors on purpose are actually randomly back and forth does the bot understand leet speak does the bot understand that moji does that understand animated gif can I respond back with emoji animated gif or English or Spanish or Spanglish so North American normative English from an AP English test given in high school is not what we speak and messaging platforms in text or voice form it's actually quite different and understanding all the other things that aren't just the blunt context around the experience strongly communicates to users and audiences the tone bluto style of what you're building let's go to the question of personification I'm talking a lot about characters here but we're in the other hand building actions for Google home so if there worked in the film but it happens to also be the case that this is the main theme of every Pixar film ever made are things that aren't human actually talking back and language back and forth toys talk this talk I mean they don't but they do in these interviews and it's actually quite common for us to personify all kinds of things that's because we're people and when language gets involved we've only been talking to other people with language since we're all born so it makes obvious sense that if you hear a thing or see a thing type back-and-forth to you you will project human traits onto that thing if your app has a character and a backstory and a motivation tone mood and style because everything you've ever talked to also does as well too if you don't design for that then deliver it to people people will still assign it to your thing whether you want them to do that or not that actually is both good news and bad news there are two stories to tell here on the good side sonification will help you as who's your developer themselves raise your hand just really try again who's the developer here okay who's actually built a thing that involves natural language and their life in some way shape or form keep your hands up who's here and I'm going to split left right hands who hears anything in text oh tech stuff and Hanser voice stuff okay you can split okay personification helps you in both cases because the use of language will engender us to a scientist thing that we're engaging with and if I do that I've invested in it therefore I have a hand in creating that that relationship whether it's conscious or unconscious that's the benefit to engage the number tension broadly speaking on the downside if you don't consider that inside it for very carefully you're effectively going to let your audience of users randomly assign the personality traits they would like you to your particular app action or bot and in that case it's not clear what they're going to think about it so I would strongly advocate to be in control of that as not the disregard character in design is equivalent to saying letting a user pick random colors and butt locations for your GUI one of the main differentiating designs of Google way back in the day it still do today thankfully is the remarkably simple and direct expression of google.com homepage one of the gifts to the internet that is still one of the the joys of web surfing in general to the juxtaposition of all the other ones that didn't do that they're not here you guys still are I'm glad to be here with you as you guys went in that regard but you certainly want to want someone to like re scramble the Google homepage look how AltaVista file that's not very helpful anybody's cause so by asserting the dialog that you have in your India things that you write as well to you are doing the equivalent to button layouts GUI layout color palette selection responsiveness designs as well to the kinds of feedback whether you want to go see morphic or not with the interfaces we build in gooeys but different voices voice interfaces and while it still might work yes you could type text into an old AltaVista search if you care to as a functional spec requirements I didn't really care turns out none of the restoral that either - so scooting on to foundations of design and computer conversation a way to think about this can also one of the reasons I started to talk mentioning Robert McKee as you can kind of think about this space interactive screen writing but the trick is that for us in this tent we're responsible for lines one three five and seven but not two four six and eight two four six and eight are everything set back to us by the user interestingly enough we have actually no control at all over those that's what cuz that's what set back to us and that's an important distinction because it isn't actually true in GUI designs and GUI designs you're asserting what text entry points you're putting up what dialog boxes what buttons what sliders and widgets you have in this case language is the response back it languages a very unconstrained space part of this craft comes in additional screenwriting stage writing theater prose character story and dialogue linear narrative arts and there's a lot of literature I give you only one reference here to look at in that space the other half of this comes from the art of gaming and web mobile design and creating engagement at retention the interactive arts and those designs and this field of crafting interactive conversation is one of the unique blends of these two things there are analogies we can make to some degree in the space of video game design whether that's mobile web or console or desktop otherwise there is a similar combination to some degree but it's just now in the past 10 or 15 years that the fields of interaction design and the fields of linear narrative had begun to cross each other and I think in the space here particularly with text and voice space design is one of the most important expressions of the new combination and some ways to work so here are three of the sort of pretty elemental concepts to consider as you go into design here one is the constant of fidelity and it's a related word here is adjacency computer conversation always happens adjacent to real life full fidelity humidity human conversation if we talk into the Google home and it's sitting on a kitchen counter you're probably at breakfast with your kids and your wife and husband having a lovely morning conversation and then you're heckling Google home to do a thing for you whether it's play music or show your lights or order something as well too but it's happening right into monks your family already talking if you're texting back and forth with but that's probably happening on a messaging platform somewhere or on your phone where already are a billion other folks texting back and folks with you who all actually humans so the adjacency issue is actually very distinct from the other things I mentioned earlier on in this talk that is not true the art of video gaming when we go nerd out with my xbox or playing my Android phone sitting on Bart it's not the case that I was just playing chess or Rochambeau with the guy next to me on Bart probably so the game adjacency as she was quite separated I played with my family monopoly over here and I bought my android phone won't play clash of clans over there but in this case it probably is true that I'm texting back and forth with a billion other folks who have mobile phones sorry and Billy and other folks who have phones out there in the world and my boss engaging me then or Google assistant is in text form and the Google home is sitting in my house also I'm a nerd my office too but let's go up my house turn now and in my house my families are sneaking back and forth that means the bar one has to reach him adjacency is actually all of us talking to each other and that's essential to the field that's a super high bar there's a lot of heckling about boss this past year back and forth let's because we're reaching for human fidelity conversation not because I mean people say like the public's expectations were so high I think it's just a blunt truth it's against all of us talking to each other so we have to accommodate that need and but also speaks I think broadly to should the things you might be able to make a joke should I be able to answer questions about the topics you're building for travel finance ecommerce or it is or enter to questions about everything I'm going to take that last enough for a second there's been a theme I've seen when it comes to text and voice space work producing the space that texting are talking back and forth to this particular action it should be able to respond to any question that I asked and do so in a way to quite informative but that's not true of any of us in this tent none of us knows everything in fact well Google doesn't know anything these organizes it off route so it's super helpful doesn't actually know everything and the world's not knowable that expectation is in usually press it upon actions and thoughts because we don't press it upon ourselves actually ever and if you spoke to someone who actually knew everything I think you've processed some other plane of existence that I can't describe for us that's not true of our reality that also speak I use that motivating case to talk about the facility design and if you're talking about any commerce experience or travel or hospitality or fitness and you're building that for Google home making that'd be the most amazing fitness thing you can talk to you back and forth seems quite appropriate to do but not as the questions about geography or about history but find a way to actually remove the conversation back in the tone buddha style that a fitness instructor would do to get you back to your fitness based actions talk about agency for a second so today I think Kerswell may have a different opinion about this but synthetic autonomous emergent personality today is nowhere close to human fidelity yet it may get there which can tell you back you're talking any fears about that agenda but that's not true today but it's not a problem for us and I don't think it is today because their world of fiction here's some Game of Thrones cosplayers that I found up there I like the Mario a once in a previous slide as a way to motivate fictional characters on our daily lives suggest that specifically crafted characters and designed behaviors can be as or more effective because they've been created to match the situation's and outcomes we need them for when I'm back to my fitness example is picking that out of thin air here at Google home any fitness experience that I'm talking back to on Google home will be designed by maybe somewhere in this tent as opposed to the actual versus the gym who could have got a parking ticket got a decaf coffee Beck's at a Starbucks said of their caffeine coffee I was kind of cheesed off in your spin class and brought that attitude into the class as well too and that may not be the most helpful thing for you at the time trying to work out with your Google home that you get back to your kitchen I think that if you look at this slide also to a relevant point to make here is that land back to earlier in the talk when I brought up Hamlet I think on a quote where the thing that's on the order of five hundred years old so half a millennium old and people all got that so the lasting legacy of character and dialogue can span my generations millennium of time already does today in the form of written word and spoken word live theater and stage play so the ideas that are presented when you design a character and personality can strongly reach history may give you sense of the depth and strength of that advocacy in our design work and I throw up scales doing cosplay here is a motivating case that's a lot of Stormtroopers and it turns out they actually formed a brigade a walk around themselves they spend about as much time doing this as people the military reserve view here in this country it turns out and while I support Star Wars and maybe our US military as well and then for Lucas on this one because that's pretty cool they do that alright so on to creativity I'm a computer scientist or should I become one or my a writer and should I become one both of these are highly creative pursuits that with different emphasis emphases it depends on what you're trying to do there are many things that are built on this basic computer conversation that are transactional based in e-commerce banking and fund transfers as well too and those things are very efficient and compact expressions there are also things that are built that have much more sort of poetic intentions interactive fiction broadly speaking mysteries romance the genres of literature also can be expressed this way as well - and in-betweens kind of lose everything else deciding who is writing a dialogue and who's thinking about your dialogue design I think should be motivated by those cases back and forth but the spectrum exists in this field and only talk about celebrating both sides of this the rest of this talk creative briefs is connecting things from Steve you try to throw that quote down here for us today so um three topics in particular getting specifically to designing of actions directly and boys space skills and content intent and context keywords might entice and touchscreens are all examples of high precision high accuracy and unambiguous inputs was the button pressed or not but they have a very small aperture got a button clicked got a key press language is hugely imprecise terribly inaccurate utterly ambiguous and as your infinite aperture but it can be shockingly efficient and it's in this juxtaposition here that's the most important differences about how we designs that have come to surface now I've talked the words love and hate here for a second because in four characters both sides nations go to war peace treaties are signed humanity advances itself at a level of just four simple characters also with the bracket in the slashes well - it's impossible to express that in a GUI interface with a voice and language interface you can and you can get to all things like awkward here grand picture among key states here the concept of awkwardness is a very interesting proposition because it presupposes you understand what the monkey in the face should have been doing why does it look funny or sarcastic to you as it relates to other phrases that you've seen with goofy smiles and selfies it's all a set of information encapsulated in that word next to that image we invented language in fact to communicate the human condition in all of its complexity and big.you idiom subtlety and so the design principles themselves now and practices that help us handle this in a medium whose boundaries are that brass include content and intent intent recognition as we all know is the thing that many people focus on in this field including Google with API that AI is offering in other places in the Google Network of things and that's good that's understanding what said inbound to us by user and I do celebrate that but it's half the problem the other half of the problem is content which is as important and requires equal attention from both our tools and our processes on both sides if you're looking at the amount of effort put in to building connection for Google home and you have a 10 we project to set up to work on 10 personal weeks to assign to it if you're spending 8 person weeks designing your intense and like 3 days writing dialogue and then debugging you've not spent your resources in a way that represents what the design requirements really are of the project those two things are actually almost bang on even money probably speaking because half of the conversations understanding what you say to me the other half is matching back to you response back we have to constantly both of those things evenly I think is an industry we weigh over index on intent recognition I understand why that's the problem computer scientists are very well schooled to go solve that makes perfectly reasonable sense it's also think we didn't have before so we had to go build machine learned recognized intent and that's great we had those intervention out going forward day by day as the field that produces work now in the space for audiences and users to use and engage contemplating Goethals understood and what sit back with even measure is an advocacy I want to bring to you guys today iteration and creative control in recent time enables creative expressivity and reach how efficiently can I do a thing the faster I do it the better I can make it the background of the slide I chose specifically because this is a gesture drawing agenda taken by a done by a woman Elaine Horry I found online license to be used here for you guys to see and was done in a session often sitting down with the model and drawing brave gestures and they styles so here has a guess for how long it took her to do that many drawings thrown about 20 minutes over here they here a week over there couple days on these are probably done I'm guessing at about 32 seconds to one minute per probably speaking typically a lunch session is done in the studio or your drawing as fast and rapidly as you can and one of the reasons why you're going to spend four years making an animated film you want to nerd out at lunch drawing rapidly if you could enter a true dozens and dozens of poses for a character in the course of a two-hour span before you spend the time to dental floss it in the film finally it's from my previous life in this life here how long does it take me to debug my bot why is the thing answer back the way it did and what is this saying next oh I have to go build a thing and recompile it and put up with the cloud and carry on as well too or can I see it live and where I'm working right out today the time it takes you as a developer out there to run a full loop to understand what broke and how to fix it as we all know from being software developers is an essential contributor to our efficiency in that area so I want to push that forward here in the face of computer conversation that it's not just how fast can I design my intent it's not just how fast if I'm at my dialog its when I have the thing stood up and running and now I'm chatting back and forth of it or talking back and forth to it's how long in clock time is the actual loop from it's saying a thing I didn't want to say can be fitting in and saying it the right way next time measure that on the clock and when you're down from you know eight hours to one hour to fifteen minutes to a minute to actual real time you've walked yourself from the year-long projects to a you know doodle on project as well more importantly those on the budget implications are if you're at a place where in real time you're editing and working and fixing things he's not going to start experimenting you're going to start playing with the thing and you're going to find what you can achieve in conversation will then expand significantly beyond a grass lay connected very simple diagram of status then go this thing go here well I'll start there but because language is so expressive our usual goodness to us anyway so it's an important way to think about the tool sets that you use in the process you bring to bear to measure the efficiency of it and how fast you can fix and adapt things predictability is a critical design agenda here as well too often we're asked to throw more data at machine lured intent recognizers because they'll get better both for the folks in this room about you probably understand what that means but a lot of the rest of the world might not and in particular what data and how much and if I did that how would it change linearity isn't the requirement here predictability is and I think that as many more folks out there become educated about the techniques of machine learn and tenth recognition broadly speaking folks beyond this this tenth will get better and be able to do this in the wild but say this is the real struggle for a lot of folks in in developers who aren't at Google that are outside building their own things in computer conversation in text or voice form for them to improve their machine learning temps probably speaking of the challenge I share with you we all share as industry helped us understand how to better work with things I use the idea of a black box here because we you never want a black box in a creative agenda and aspects of a bike here on purpose so who here knows how to ride a bike I'll hand should go up yeah if I'm on a bike and I stand off and take my hand on the seat my shove the bike down the street what does the bike do anyway follower immediately no they were all slower for some period of time but here and doing kind of this well it and then it'll cliff out who can explain to me the physics behind how that actually works in the closed form solution anybody no it's actually not describable by modern mechanics today in a closed form solution interestingly but yet you all raise your hands cuz you can ride a bike a bike is a remarkably nonlinear mechanical dynamic mechanism we in our minds have all understood how to lean reverse back adjust the handlebar in correct against the steer to get the lean over to get the bike to turn even though no physics professor at Keller Stanford could whiteboard out how that actually works in the closed form solution today so a good example from all of our lives including my young kids lives about the human minds ability to map a predictable very complex system and work with a very quick very creatively even though it's not not linear and now my tide is gathered with context this word is like super over using the space unless I talk about this a little bit quite directly here first at a high-level context is the mental scaffolding that we and our technology need to help us manage complexity hence the Pantheon in the back they didn't rebuild for you their conversation broadly speaking is a piecewise linear agenda if I'm negotiating to you about a pizza order back and forth for a few minutes and then about my commute home on Bart and then about what I'm doing this weekend going to Tahoe or not back and forth each one of our Pizza discussions and our Bart discussions was locally to three or four turns about pizza and then Bart and then Tahoe but notice that with pizza Bart and Tahoe is not connected those small piece wise linear bits that connect together we can take large advantage of because I'm talking about pizza and learning out about mozzarella versus pepperoni and I'm having that discussion about Pizza ordering agendas not about who what the guy next to me was eating on the BART train which I could be saying in the next agenda I don't think we take advantage of this enough and I say this because a lot of systems today built offer giant long flat lists of intents to recognize broadly speaking and don't use where you are in the in the context of the conversation to motivate intent recognition and motivate dialog going back and forth that's you and how you build things is true in our tool sets as a field in general you can only pull this off if you combine content and intent together not keep them separated far apart but brought together unless the folks who build actions and thoughts not oh thanks as well work with both of those things back and forth in mmm as you blend and create into space together it's one of the most important points of this talk here so I tie this down now once it gets to a few minutes for Q&A at the end here we talk about one having gone through all that I'll leave you the following conundrum and my favorite Rock'em Sock'em slide time to throw in there too the more personality that you offer in a thing the more you'll engage and delight your users broadly speaking and they were memorable you will be long-term at the same time more personality that you offer the polarized and segment your audience without mentioning names if you participated in the last US presidential election there were two candidates who broadly speaking move the country into two places I don't think anybody in this country wanted to vote for both of them simultaneously that would make little sense that's why there were two candidates I'm looking farther than that but as an example of if you went that far with personality you actually chopped your audience bang on it half now that's not a thing company like Google can do you're trying to reach everybody in the world and of course me is some awesome rad action developer wants the biggest audience I can get so therefore said I withdraw and not do any personality to maintain giant audience well if I built a thing that appealed to absolutely everybody will be the definition of the most average thing in the world which actually boring to everybody as well too Google's not taking that position your homepage is not a boring design it's actually quite a bang on crisp on it has been now again for going on nearly two decades now to your credit so what do we do do we go all-in Darth Vader and go full personality or all in plain vanilla do nothing as well - and that is the art of the space as a judgement call but I won't leave you just a hanging I don't know there's no right answer here as a thought creating one average personality I don't think is a lie P path to the right answer my best suggestion is to consider a countable plurality of personalities to get a good match for the over 95 percent case of potential audiences in the case above if you just built the average personality for any individual user when something more funny or appealing shows up perhaps Samuel Jackson is your doing the voice of your banking apps your Capital One I could imagine that happening people who like Samuel Jackson will going to be attracted to that and be pulled off the average the average sitting the middle is susceptible to any one of the particulars being better and that plurality will be them over time but you can't write a personality for all of them that would be uncountable in our personalities so I think the answer probably plays out here to a countable plurality to meet the largest audience that could get to a 95 plus percent case of coverage of appeal probably speaking to a general global audience parting shot for two minutes for questions coming up here is that you can check out full swing comm if you want to work with the system that offers those things together so you're trying to build here at pull-string and doing that with Google and thanks for helping that we're - and if you want to build some yeah awesome actions Google home you can start that like this afternoon people part let me do that thank you [Applause] [Music]
