 How to make an interface between an ERP-System and infoBoard An ERP-System usually has a SQL-database with 3.000 to 70.000 information columns The coherences and the intelligence of the ERP-System develops in form using the surface-program and also in a functional middle layer that controls the event-driven operations Often we have to print out a manufacturing order and a delivery confirmation The results of the calculations can now be found in the database So what is necessary for the interface to infoBoard? We need two main information from other systems The process & the duration Now let's have a look at the production interface We need 4 minimum requirements for that First: the Process ID from the ERP-System Second: the text on the infoBoard planning object Third: the order number Fourth: the chronological order of the process If you deliver those 6 information for every process you will get the well-known business operations on your planning board When do we have to picture a manufacturing order in infoBoard? There are 3 different options: option 1: event-driven option 2: time-controlled option 3: manually The manufacturing order for the production is always created by the initiative of the ERP-advisor So the ERP-System should be adjusted, so that the 6 information will be send to the printer and to the infoBoard interface as well Now let's take a look at the event-driven function That's when the ERP-provider extends the "print manufacturing order" function Also you can just make an update-trigger in the database That's when the new data from the interface will be selected and inserted into the database When it comes to the time-controlled transmission the new manufacturing orders will be communicated 2-4 times a day And last but not least: the manual export Now the user can choose the specific information columns and place them as CSV-files in a defined directory with the help of the infoBoard standard converter the CSV-files can be read every 20 seconds and be renamed as edited Next the data will be selected with the simple user interface edited if necessary and inserted into the infoBoard database interface That was quite simple, right? That's how you can visualize your ERP data in infoBoard with clear responsibility
