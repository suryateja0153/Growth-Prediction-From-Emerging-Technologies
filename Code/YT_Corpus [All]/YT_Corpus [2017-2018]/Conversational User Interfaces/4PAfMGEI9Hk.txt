 [Music] if you've been hearing a lot about voice technology artificial intelligence and how it's the next big thing but you're not quite sure what that means for you you're not the only one whether you're a developer trying to create a conversational interface a business that wants to know what this means for the future of Commerce or just a human being wondering why in the world we need more robots when we're trying so hard just to connect to each other you've come to the right place hey how's it going not too bad yep so glad you're here glad to be here seriously though you've been doing this for quite a while it's definitely different and it's really new I'm Nandini and welcome to this new video series where we'll explore all things related to voice tech and the rich elements of human communication that will feed a key to its success hey Google let's talk to number G I'm thinking of a number from 0 to 100 we're looking for great apps out there to highlight how you're using these elements to create your own conversational experience what you're building is a conversation what's the biggest challenge for you you realize you have so many options how do you maintain that variability so there's a lot of opportunity here actually for the developer to be clever as cats rule the internet ok so let's talk kind of where we're starting today is hello world [Music] I'm Nandini and I enable conversations between humans among businesses and any combination in between some of which includes some machines who's excited about this series developers we just launched this as a teaser on YouTube but it's coming and you're gonna hear all about that today but I want you to stop and take a moment take a picture in your mind right now of why voice is interesting why is it I wonder what you're thinking we're living in a time when innovation is shifting our outlook so rapidly of our future in fact it's so rapid that it's worth taking that moment to stop and think about where you are now and how different it could be in a week's time a month time and next year I guarantee you will be a different landscape a different ecosystem than we are today you're part of that by the way so why is that enabling machines to speak on our behalf to speak to us out loud is so deep to our context as a culture and as two human beings it makes us question where we are Mace's question where we are with technology it really is putting us at the intersection of technology and the human condition more than ever before we're actually confronting a reckoning between science and culture right now so I have a lot more to say about that topic but today's not the forum for that today we're just starting a conversation and the hardest part about any conversation is listening so we want you to know developers designers businesses we've heard you we've seen the feedback from IO and conferences like this that the most valuable part of the experience is interacting with Googlers and with other developers and people creating experi is out there so we decided to create a different kind of content feedback loop for you and with this series so in our first few episodes for example we're going to start by helping you understand just how to get your arms around the 0 D interface and then how you supplement that with other elements like visuals will show you what palette you have to work with now how to create your landscape how to build your world for your users in your own unique way so in our first season we just wrapped filming it's very exciting we have six episodes we've already filmed we're gonna have things like greetings and goodbyes how do you start an end a conversation including how do you do reengagement how do you identify users how do you authenticate them and how do you make money at this transactions are a big part of this we'll also show you how to create custom voices to brand your experience how to create character what does it take to create character in persona and also what are sounds involved in all this there's audio landscaping you can create that's an entirely new world that will be the gateway to things like virtual reality technology so from there we'll explore timely topics and deeper concepts and if feature and highlight examples from the ecosystem we want to showcase what good looks like what are you guys creating out there and what kinds of people it takes to make this work so well and then then on each episode we'll always feature guests that will help us dig a little deeper and there will be people from the community sometimes they'll be Googlers and come on up you guys so we're gonna do a little live show today to talk a little bit about what this means and hopefully you get a little bit of insight and and will actually not answer all your questions but we have a few questions that I've gathered from social media and just from our advocacy work that we've done in this space so to start out I want to introduce our panel you know I'm thrilled to have this great set of panelists here that I personally selected because I feel like they're most representative of where people who have come at this and pivoted to this field from other areas to give us some insight into their journey of how they got here because I really think that there are a lot of experts in the field actually very few that are considered experts but there's this kind of tapped in muscle that you don't even realize you have that you can design and build for this space and that's what I'm hoping you'll get out of this today and the whole series so we'll start by first we have Mark Polina who together with Peter Hodgson in the audience they've created a new rapid prototyping technique that involves you know it's a methodology for interaction design and in fact to give you an idea how we're really taking the audience and with you know building the series with the audience and our users in mind and our viewers in mind we've built this panel also directly from feedback from you guys so for example Marcus ran a sprint with Peter with a small group across the street with this new methodology but it has to be done in a small scale so we want to scale that thing so we're going to show it on camera so that you can all learn from it that's an example another is Kimberly Harvey who has pivoted with deep research experience recently pivoted to design she'll tell you about that but Kimberly on the panel is a direct request from the gde community - Julie shirley from the Tel Aviv area UX research expert and children's research asks about having more representative from UX research and Kimberly offers such a great point of view for that so she's here and then finally if you don't already know him Sasha he has found the decoder ring between design and engineering and I can credit watch it as fully responsible him and his team for pulling me out of my shell of where I was working and doing more advocacy work so thank you and also another example is the G+ community I'd asked what else do you want to see in our videos and there was immediate answer with authentication transactions how do we do those and so we reached out to David Wang who's going to be on one of our very first episodes talking about that who's from the product management team so this team are all advocates for you and we're really excited to dig into some questions so welcome everybody so watch it let's start with you voice what's all the noise about sure first often thank you for having me on the panel and thanks to all of you for coming it's really exciting actually to be here just not even gave me a great introduction but just to add to it a little bit I'm an engineer at Google working mostly on developer tooling and I was working on the living room team before on sort of Android TV and cast and Google home became part of the living room so that's how I got it it's kind of sucked into this thank God and so you know about a year ago and Anini and I were working on some of the first samples which by the way she helped it's if you ever have the chance to have her help with an after building she has an extraordinary talent for what the design and the technical portion it would be right seriously just save me a lot of time trust me in any case to get back to your question about what's all this noise about I think that this noise that were that we're hearing is the low low hum of the sci-fi promised to take words directly from the Nene and what I mean by that is we are at the very very very early stages of the next mode of interaction between us and machines and this is something we've dreamt about for decades and it's finally happening and so far it's it's still a little rough right a lot of these interactions are still a little frustrating sometimes but what's important is to listen through the noise for the signal of those magical moments that we have with machines and it's happening today and we're gonna be telling you know future generations about these days years from now when it's working as they expect it to great things such it so how about you Kimberly what's all the noise about good um so I guess noise meaning what's exciting about voice for me what is exciting about it is I feel like we're getting closer and closer to a direct thought download I studied communication and cross-cultural communication in grad school and you know everyone knows humans have a lot of different methods of communicating someone might be watching this on video I'm using gestures I'm using words we have systems of writings all around the globe but I feel like having having humans interact in a way that's been natural that's been one of the first skills that we learned as babies can kind of get rid of some of the challenges we have we're having you can get rid of some of the challenges we have getting one thought from one person's mind to another and mark you've been does even a designer for a long time and you bring some unique perspectives on interaction design but you you started in voice actually way before we had the Google assistance so how about you what's all the noise about yeah I think it's it's really interesting time in a moment so so talking about like the journey that we've been we've had I wasn't a voice designer before I started working on voice actions in the Google Search app I was interaction designer working on mobile working in automotive and TVs but voice for me was was quite a stunning journey it was so different than what I was used to so for me it's been really enlightening thinking about voice and conversation and natural user interfaces and how there's such an emergence right now of all of these technologies like AI Internet of Things robotics and so on where the technologies are really trying to take the the friction away from people and so we've got all of this these new natural user interfaces that set people's expectations so much higher than we've had before so as a designer it's been really exciting to try and create these new design methodologies where we can understand people a lot more and and try and meet users expectations as such it was saying in the future it should just work but right now with the technology how it is there's there's a lot of really interesting design problems yeah we've what we've been seeing and and you know that there is some kind of forgiveness there people are at this point where they they're like okay we get that it doesn't work perfectly all the time and it's great to see that people are working on that but it's like people get the possibility finally which is so exciting well let's let's start I have a few questions I kind of pulled online and then we have a few others that we got from just asking around at the conference we do user centered research very not last-minute at all so this one comes from Twitter Bob stalsberg is the Google assistant a girl scout I can take this one yeah well the first thing I would ask Bob is why do you think it's a Girl Scout what is it that lends itself to that stereotype that you have in your mind that's just from a research perspective but to answer his question I would say that the assistant is not a Girl Scout but it can facilitate relationships with characters like Girl Scouts we have an entire team at Google that just concerns itself with a personality make sure that the interactions we're designing are on par with that personality make sure the wording is right and also shows different parts of the assistants character that's good and ryan Grimek who heads the doodle team and the personality team has a great analogy that you asked personality questions you sort of poke at things and ask it things that you can sort of know what to expect an answer from or you know a little like what colored was your favorite color things like that it's like when you asked out it's a way of establishing trust so when you establish trust with your neighbor for example you might borrow a cup of sugar like Ryan says borrow a cup of sugar before you go and ask for the lawnmower so one of our episodes features how to write like how do you write four personality questions that are just about the character you're interacting with as opposed to the deeper back-and-forth interaction about whatever that is the task you want to accomplish so that's a great question and then so we'll switch to a hoe singer from the developer community this one via LinkedIn probably for sachit but maybe one of the others can pipe in so there's a common sentiment among developers who are leery of starting projects found in newer services and tools as they've been burned numerous times in the past by deprecation and abandonment of support so given the inherent community based nature of conversation design can developers find assurances that Google recognizes this pillar and won't be abandoning support for the assistant SDK API dot a I to speech reco or other related projects to Ella this is amazing allow innovators to create new products and even found businesses upon well I will say one thing if we are doing that none of us have any job so we're here so just to say that but such it from the developer perspective you guys work with the tools and all the api's and that so what would you say to that so first I would I would empathize with the person asking the question it was Brandon hunter by the way from LinkedIn who asked amazing questions Thank You Brandon thanks Brandon so I felt that burned before so I I certainly wouldn't want to inflict that on on anyone else I would also say in this space that I think a little bit extra oven sort of adventurous attitude is actually called for here from the developer's point of view because early investments now in terms of just picking up the knowledge around these api's and round that even though just the terminology just figuring out what the design looks like for these types of things will pay off you know exponentially in the future but to directly answer the question in terms of Google's investment in this space I think it's very clear just even using the list of services and API is that that that the person asked in the question it's very clear that we're trying to push an entire suite of products on developers here and I think that gives evidence the idea that Google is really trying to push heavily into this space and I can tell you from you know sort of personal experience that I mean just internally we are we are seeing this as sort of the next step and this also is shown through the consumer side so that will assistant as an entire company initiative it reflects the developer API as and services that we're releasing so I think what's what's clear if you look at the scope of what Google is actually putting out there is that we see this really is the next step for both users and developers and we will be supporting this moving forward so I wouldn't worry too much about about the sort of platforms going away or these services going away even if they're art changes and that kind of thing clearly the platform as a whole that the conversational push as a whole isn't going anywhere and we're sticking to that thank you okay let's pivot to design mark can you talk about some of the design methods we have used for voice interaction sure so as I said learning the design process for voice being new to the to the field is quite a challenge as I said we can't use a lot of the same assumptions and the same design process and methodologies that we used for other experiences for example designing apps websites and so on for for voice so it helps to keep learning new methodologies so I personally take a lot from service design theory one of the principles of service design is that we democratize the design process so that means for me it means empowering the whole product team to be able to come up with powerful experiences and come up with user centered designs and so the way to do that is just as a designer but or a researcher or as a anyone in the product team just to be aware of who the user is and what the user needs and be and and keep asking the question what what's the motivation what's their gone even what are their anxieties and their fears the more that you understand about the user the more user sensitive your designs are going to be like I said people have got much higher expectations of these natural user interfaces than they have of other types of interface and then the other thing is best practices for conversation design so we one principle we have conversation design is that we focus a lot on designing for failure because with the current the technology how it currently is is there can be a lot of missed recognitions and also just with language there's a lot of ambiguity so we focus a lot that the happy path is quite it's fairly straightforward but the unhappy path can be quite quite complex so we spend a lot of time focusing on designing for failure and then there's also investment in prototyping so that's another aspect of user centered design is being able to validate what you're designing with users such that you have a term for instead of happy path that's yeah I have something I call the happy tree yeah yeah there's a bob ross reference in there somewhere happy little trees okay well and then I mean you mentioned research so Kimberly so we can all talk we can all speak or gesture we can we can all communicate it's the first it's the interface we learn first and the one we know best so it's not like we need any help understanding that finding a button so why do we need UX research why don't we need you just because we know how to speak doesn't mean we understand the intention of what's going on for example a backstage I was saying let's say Marc Marc was outside in the center of the hall and I was talking to someone and I said what is Marc look like they would describe Marc in a certain way like he's wearing my shoes he's got a multicolored shirt on but if we were working in an office and Marc had been out with the flu for a week and this was his first day back and I turned to my boss and I said what does Marc look like my boss might say well he looked a little better last week same question completely different answers based on the context and a lot of times while we are sitting and we're developing even designing an experience we really don't know until we actually see it in motion whether we've ironed out all of the kinks and whether there are surprising behaviors that are emerging from the designs that we didn't expect so it's a great way to it's almost like QA in your human condition to make sure that you've got everything covered so such it what about you I mean you've learning other disciplines as you get into this but just from a developer perspective getting you know they're just the ramp up into this like what can a developer bring from past platforms into this space so I think the great thing about our platform particular is it's mostly driven through the cloud through the web so what that means is for developers who've already been developing on the cloud or like web apps or even API is they've been building for mobile apps that kind of thing you'll be able to bring all that experience in and the tools that we provide like in particular API a I to abstract some of the harder problems like the natural language understanding those tools are fairly easy to use for anybody you don't need a computer science degree really to understand that kind of stuff so first learning that is fairly simple there's a low barrier to entry and then secondly with your existing cloud and web knowledge and just using basically efficient coding practices around things like string manipulation those kind of things you can already build apps pretty effectively on our platform and you know one of the things I'm actually really looking forward to hopefully that I want to see from the community is more tooling and frameworks that we have similar to front-end apps on other platforms like web apps and mobile apps there's a lot out there if you just want to build a UI and so I'm really looking forward to seeing how people build frameworks for building conversational you eyes and voice you eyes I think that's going to be really exciting great and then usually once you start building you're getting pretty early in the process you want to start prototyping so mark you have some really unique perspective here so do you have suggestions for how to prototype and voice interaction to yeah I think prototype when I think about prototype I'm looking at something that I can use early in the design process that I can I can learn quickly and I can iterate really quickly so I think it's really important that we invest in prototyping especially if we don't have the years of experience working on voices and faces and that we're really learning on the go so there's a few methodologies that we've used with some success designing conversational us at Google such as Wizard of Oz prototyping so this is the idea about Wizard of Oz is that you remotely control the device that the participant is using in a study environment but they think that they're speaking to the assistant but really they're speaking to me as the puppet master putting the strings behind but it's like literally create the whole scene like you could go behind that yeah you could you could basically like emulate what they would believe is like the end user experience but basically there's no AI there's no cloud it's just me on the other side because talking is a scrappy as it gets in terms of yeah role playing and it's it's incredibly like conversation is it can go anywhere like you never really know there's no set path and so to feel natural you need to be able to pivot in real time so if it's oh really unless you had the AIA built for that like the only person you can do that is a real person listening in real time so Wizard of Oz is really powerful and you know it can be as simple as having a Bluetooth speaker and you know the audio files ready to go on your laptop and you're just basically playing them as you're responding to the user it takes a bit of practice but it's really good and then the other methodology that we use early in the design process is just saying out loud role-playing and in the Google design sprints when were actually got the whole product team designing their conversations will actually do investigative rehearsal which is a methodology created by Adam Lawrence of this is service design doing and it's basically the idea is that you can you rehearse the conversation in real and then you investigate that conversation and you ask questions about it so it's it is the most scrappiest most lowest fidelity prototype you could you can imagine but incredibly powerful for sort of the first draft of the conversation before you invest in any any coded prototyping it's funny you mentioned that you for those dis prints you were just talking about that you have the whole product team there because basically what you're facilitating is a conversation to build a conversation and it actually creates better conversations in terms of the actual apps yeah yeah yeah yeah it's it's having the whole product team there it kind of democratizes as I said the design process but everyone shares the same understanding of the problem everyone understands the user requirements everyone understands the their goals and maybe the business goals as well and and everyone's thinking through that at the same time and trying stuff out so it really is like a platform approach for design yeah in fact that's probably a good place to close and just wrap up and and is to get everyone thinking about you know this I've been doing this for a really really long time so hopefully if you feel like we raised more questions in this panel than answers and good because there's a lot to talk about as I said at the beginning this is just the start of a conversation and there it's like the inception of conversations there's so many different kinds there's worldwide conversations there's conversations between one person and a group there's two person conversations this is just one of them and it's a it's a much larger one so a conversation about the future of technology and you know where we are today and where we're going from here is going to take a new kind of ecosystem this is called the conversation economy you guys are part of it and with your help we need to build this new ecosystem we can actually at this point take a quantum leap past this AI first world in fact you know words really matter right like its Sun actually quite unfortunate that call it artificial at all when we need things like authentic and advanced intelligence more than ever we're all starving to amplify our own intelligence so maybe amplified intelligence you know hashtag fix the glitch so we can but you know with all of your help with the ecosystem of the developer community on all platforms on all devices it doesn't matter users come first and if we build a world using a people first creative approach to building solutions that people can use in their daily lives it's more than just talking and getting answers anymore people want insight and they actually want to be able to do things in their world we want to find those micro moments that are assistive well there's another a word and we just need the whole alphabet and we need you know all disciplines at the table diverse voices diverse approaches diverse thinking this is really a time when you know it's like I said the intersection of science and culture human interaction human solutions to a global problem of like we built these machines let's make them work on our behalf to help us connect more with each other in our world and the things we want to get done so it's personally it's my I mean I've been doing this a long time working with this technology but it really is my personal mission to give voice to others and to help create a culture that we can build experiences that illustrate like a shared vision of our future we need to collectively recognize a good means you know going beyond don't be evil or do what's right to actually you know create experiences that are you know to show how it's done and so hopefully with this series we want to show what good looks like we want partner experiences developer experience to showcase what you're creating and any you know for your users and you know for the common good of users everywhere so you know we want to give insight to the kinds of people inside Google who are building this and also changing the landscape of the future of Technology and also you know this is the power of spoken language and discourse what kinds of people does it take out there in the ecosystem to change the landscape you know it's a disruptive environment it's a really really good thing so we're all living our legacies in real time you know what are you going to be known for what are you kind of world of you're creating for your kids like have that conversation with yourself and with each other and we're gonna create some amazing things and I can't wait to see what you create and we look forward to it thank you so much to our panel and thank you to the audience for being part of this kind of exciting creative moment for us thank you [Applause] [Music]
