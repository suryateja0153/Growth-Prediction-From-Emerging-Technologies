 welcome to this information module on our new Edexcel international GCSEs in this module we will look at five key topics the first are new Edexcel international GCSE suite providing an overview of the new suite before delving into some of the main features in more detail the second our world class qualifications the design principles and processes that make these new qualifications world-class the third transferable skills and how we are supporting the development of these skills in our teaching and learning materials so that students are better and abled to succeed a level in university and eventually the workplace the fourth the nine to one grading scale the new grading scale that we have introduced to replace the a startg grading scale and the fifth international GCSE support including the comprehensive range of support materials tools events and resources that we will be providing to help you to deliver the new international GCSEs with confidence first we will go through an overview of our new Edexcel international GCSEs before looking in detail as some of the standout features that Excel international GCSEs are a key part of our at Excel portfolio of qualifications with four schools which also include our international primary curriculum international lower secondary curriculum GCSEs international advanced levels and GCE a levels international GCSEs are designed to provide a seamless progression route to a level or an equivalent level of study international GCSEs also provide an internal internationally recognised standard they can be trusted by education stakeholders schools university students and parents alike and with equivalency to UK GCSEs achievement will be recognized and understood by global universities most international GCSEs in the previous suite were last revised in 2009 or 2011 and so it was important to ensure that we looked at all of them to ensure the content was up-to-date our approach throughout the development was to look at what was valued by students teachers and schools and to retain those elements while also looking at where we could make improvements ensuring that the design of the subject was an able successful progression to earn new international a level sweeps and other comparable courses and into university qualifications in the UK have been through a key period of reform which has impacted on all GCSEs and GCE a levels therefore there was a need to review our international GCSEs in particular to ensure that they continue to be comparable with the GCSEs and including the introduction of the new known - and grading system structure and assessment of those qualifications the redevelopment of our international GCSEs have also provided us with an opportunity to refresh an enhance the support provided for learning and teaching the range of resources and tools available to support the new suite includes curriculum matched published books and the results + exam performance in Dallas and Alice's platform as well as free materials such as the getting started guides schemes of work and exemplar material to help teachers deliver our qualifications with confidence we have consulted with teachers higher education representatives subject expert groups and other key stakeholders to gain feedback on our suite of qualifications the feedback received was positive and highlighted that international GCSEs are valued by teachers and students across the world the feedback also indicated that these stakeholders would welcome some evolutionary updates or tweaks to the qualifications rather than large-scale changes we have therefore designed the new qualifications with the following features we have retained the linear two-year study structure with end of course exams and options for a hundred percent external assessment across all qualifications moving forward there will be smaller evolutionary changes to the contents of our qualifications we have updated the content to ensure the qualifications are internationally appropriate and relevant we have introduced a 9 to 1 grading scale to both reflects changes with the UK GCSEs provide a higher level of achievement for the best performing students and provide greater differentiation across the scale we have embedded the tools to support the development of transferable skills alongside subject knowledge and competencies in our free teacher support materials to prepare students for the autonomy and independence required for a higher level of study the new qualifications will continue to be recognized worldwide and used for progression by students everywhere we have retained the examination availability of the may/june series as well as retaining a january series for some subjects we will now look at the subjects available in the new international GCSE suite in total there are 37 subjects in the suite all of which will be available for first teaching in September 2017 with first examinations in May June 2019 the subject shown in bold have been available since September 2016 and these are available for optional first assessment in May June 2018 subjects with an asterisk will have both January and June examinations available the specifications and sample assessment materials are now available on the Pearson qualifications website qualification overview guides are available for those subjects that will be releasing final materials in April 2017 to help teachers plan and prepare this overview of the transition timetables from the legacy international GCSEs shows the final windows in which students can sit examinations in each subject around half of the subjects will have final examinations in May June 2018 whilst the other half which have historically had January examinations available will have a final series of examinations in January 2019 just three subjects have final examinations in June 2019 with classical Arabic week being withdrawn and Turkish and Gujarati available as a GCSE only moving forward now that we have had an introduction to the new international GCSE suite we will look in more detail at some of the less familiar features starting with world-class qualifications the background to Pearson's world-class qualifications initiative was a desire to undertake a thorough interrogation of the qualifications we offer to ensure that they meet the needs of students everywhere and are comparable and standard to some of the best education systems from around the world the initiative also recognized that the challenges faced by young people in the 21st century world are different to those faced by previous generations and therefore that their qualifications the way that they learn and are assessed should help them to develop in ways that allow them to meet these challenges and progress in their lives in order to velop an understanding of what makes world-class qualifications we used our expertise in curriculum development designing assessment learning technologies and education policy to undertake a large-scale investigative project the main part of which was forming a panel of Education experts from around the world to spearhead this mission to learn from the best performing education jurisdictions around the world and understand the priorities of universities and employers all with the overarching aim of developing a framework with which to design Pearson's qualifications the panel's work was supported by commissioned research into how to tackle the most significant challenges faced in education around the world today and the different approaches used in the leading education systems Pearson's wider ongoing program of research continues to support thinking around qualifications and assessment the world-class qualifications expert panel was convened and led by Sir Michael Barbra Pearson's chief education advisor the panel draws on expertise from a range of backgrounds experience and specialisms covering key areas such as employability policy and higher education with some of the leading universities employers represented through our panel of education experts from all over the world Pearson has defined a framework for the development of new qualifications which addressed the context of learning in a fast changing world the qualifications being developed should uphold an internationally benchmarked standard to which all young people passing through the education system are encouraged to aspire to and the excellence of which stakeholders understand a significant part of the panel's investigation into the traits of qualifications in the world's leading education systems are the world-class qualification design principles these principles are used by the panel to assess and validate all new Pearson qualifications and we will now look at these in more detail one of the jobs of the expert panel is to provide external validation and approval of Pearson's qualifications including the new in Excel international GCSEs this is to ensure that all qualifications are globally relevant represent world-class best practice in qualification in assessment design and maintain a consistent standard and support student progression in today's fast-changing world relating the design principles to the new at excel international GCSEs they have been found by the expert panel to be an appropriate level of demand which does not mean that they've been made more challenging but the qualifications place enough of a demand on students to provide an element of stretch that gives their learning outcomes meaning and can therefore be viewed as meeting their needs to be able to progress confidently into relevant qualifications at the next level of study the new Edexcel international GCSEs have also been found to be rigorous with assessments that inspire confidence in those that use the grades awarded as a reliable and accurate guide to achievement such as universities parents and schools the qualifications have been found to be inclusive which mean that they are accessible to all students this is particularly important for international students where we have ensured that the content and assessment approach mean that all qualifications can be accessed by students internationally and finally the new Edexcel international GCSEs were found by the panel to be empowering because they provide the knowledge and skills required for progression to and success in further study and employment they are more than just a means of except accessing further studies as they also provide the grounding needed to succeed at higher level most importantly the qualifications developed the skills that are needed to succeed in today's world some of the ways in which we insured the new Edexcel international GCSEs would meet the design principle criteria and expert panels assessment were a level teachers subject experts and higher education teachers were consulted throughout each qualifications development to ensure that they provided progression opportunities to further study and that the content and assessment methods were appropriate and valuable we reviewed all materials for their clarity for those for whom English is not a first language and benchmarked all of our qualifications against the common European framework of reference for languages to ensure English level requirements of students are clear and in the back of the specifications we recommend that students are at level b2 on the CEF R we are using the same quality marking systems to ensure that we deliver the most accurate and reliable results Pearson's exam marking processes have been shown to produce exceptional and reliable results in independent research by off qual with the fewest grade changes on remarking of all the leading UK awarding organizations we set up online subject expert panels to ensure our customers could help shape the design and development of the qualifications and these will stay open to enable teachers to feedback on our materials we are proud to have met the world-class qualifications expert panel requirements for the new international GCSEs each subject specification includes the full process and approval statement from the panel in its appendix here is an excerpt from the approval statement in the back of our specifications which illustrates the panel's views on the new qualifications excellent teaching is the key factor in any student success and the panel believes the new international GCSEs support teachers to help students achieve their full potential as they found them to be outstanding for their coherence thoroughness and attention to detail and regard them as representing world-class best practice this endorsement is an integral part of Pearson being able to confidently offer these qualifications knowing they will help teachers to get the best out of their students to achieve succeed and progress in their lives now that we have seen how the world-class qualifications design principles have been applied to the new international GCSE suite and earned these qualifications the endorsement of experienced education experts we will look at the part transferable skills we'll play in preparing students for future success in recent years higher education institutions and employers have consistently flagged the need for students to develop a range of transferable skills to enable them to respond with confidence to the demands of undergraduate study and the world of work the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development the OECD defines skills or competencies as the bundle of knowledge attributes and capacities that can be learned and that enable individuals to successfully and consistently perform an activity or task and can be built upon and extended through learning we can call them transferable skills because they can be transferred to different contexts outside of the context in which they are learnt these very same skills taken together act like a how to learn toolkit that enable a person to go on learning and to learn different kinds of things in different environments they are essential for success of further study and in the workplace to support the design of the new international GCSEs the personal research team selected and evaluated seven global 21st century skills frameworks the framework was selected from the National Research Council in the u.s. sets these out as cognitive intrapersonal skills and interpersonal skills these are embedded in the qualifications and supporting resources and ensure students are acquiring the kinds of skills that they will need when studying more independently at higher levels including University and ultimately to put these to good use in one day in employment the skills are developed alongside the subject knowledge skills and understanding contained in each international GCSE cognitive skills are those used for thinking learning and reasoning which students apply to any task they face during their studies intrapersonal skills are about emotional intelligence and how the insights this provides can bring context to learning interpersonal skills are about interacting with others through working in teams collaborating and building relationships these three skills overlap and are developed in conjunction with one another rather than independently some transferable skills are explicitly assessed within our qualifications but others could be acquired by students depending on how teaching and learning methods are constructed we have therefore been looking at increasing our support around where these skills naturally occur in qualification and when new skills could be gained additionally through the teaching and learning Pearson Edexcel materials and mapping documents will support you in identifying these skills and developing these skills in our students for the new international GCSEs we have asked our writing teams to provide a subject specific interpretation or definition for each of the relevant skills for qualification and in our schemes of work we'll flag where there are opportunities develop those skills we have also used lesson plans for English and maths to help teachers understand how to construct lesson plans that enable the development of these transferable skills our publishing team have also embedded these and their resources signposting the skills that are covered to help support students to acquire and identify those skills across different subjects emphasizing the transferable nature of these skills to help you to better understand as the role of transferable skills in Edexcel qualifications we've provided a range of information on the pace and qualifications website including blog posts the transferable skills infographic for international GCSEs and a guide for schools on transferrable skills in international GCSEs we will now look in detail at the new grading scale we have introduced for the new international GCSEs we have recently launched a new set of Edexcel international GCSE qualifications and we wanted to make sure that students internationally have the same opportunities as students in the UK the new Edexcel international GCSEs will therefore have a new grading scale 9 to 1 instead of the a startegy grading scale that you're used to 9 will be the top grade here and we've introduced this to make sure that we're really differentiating those top performing students there's also greater differentiation in the middle of the range with three grades four five and six equivalent to the old grades B and C so grade five will be awarded to the top grade C performance and grade six will be awarded to the grade B performers the new number grades will be awarded using the same tried and tested procedures that we have always used for the letter grades the bottom of the grade four will be aligned to the bottom of the grade C and the bottom of the grade seven will be aligned to the bottom of the grade A the bottom of the grade one will be aligned to the bottom of the grade G and all other grades will be awarded arithmetic Li you Kane Eric will communicate with UK universities and governments worldwide to endorse the new 9 to 1 grading scale we will support this effort to ensure that the international GCSEs continued to provide clear pathway to a level and degree level programs as 92018 introduced GCSEs in England we felt that it was important for our international GCSE learners to also benefit from the new grading scale we know universities will be setting exceptions criteria for GCSEs using the new 9 to 1 grading scale and it was important to us that our that our international GCSE qualifications could meet exactly the same standard the first thing to emphasize is that the 91 scale has more grades than the a-star to G scale which had eight grades one of the most significant features of the 91 scale is grade 9 which creates an extra level of achievement beyond what was possible with the a-star grade there is also great differentiation in the middle of the range of grades with grades four five and six being equivalent to the old grades B and C meaning grade five will be awarded to the top grade C performers in grade six to the great be performers the new ninety-one scale will be awarded at grade seven four and one which means these boundaries of achievement provide the basis for determining all the other boundaries the greater that fall between the key boundaries of seven four and one will continue to be awarded Aerith matically at even intervals we will award our qualifications so that broadly the same proportion of students who achieved a C and above will achieve a four and above and broadly the same proportion of students who achieved an A and above will achieve a seven and above teachers can use the same methods as they do now to help students understand where they are performing here are some of the key benefits for students of the new 91 grading scale the scale provides greater differentiation across all of the levels of attainment so a set of results will tell a student more about where their strengths lie the new grade 9 rewards truly outstanding achievement the new grading scale provides clearer information on student attainment to help make more informed decision about a level subject choices having clear comparison to the new standard also helps to ensure continued comparability with GCSEs which means that whether a student chooses a GCSE or an international GCSE qualification they will have exactly the same progression opportunities we also know that universities will be setting new GCSE acceptance criteria using the 91 grading scale and it is important to us the international GCSE grades could meet the same standards required more information on the new 91 grading scale is available on the peers and qualifications website including a video and parent and student grading guides we have now looked at the main features of the new international GCSEs next we will look at the support that we will be providing to help you successfully deliver these qualifications we have put together a comprehensive range of support materials tools resources and events for the new suite of international GCSEs getting started guides and editable schemes of work are provided for every subject for each subject we have also created subject level interpretation documents of transferable skills we are reading a program of online and face-to-face getting ready to teach training events to help to prepare you to deliver the new qualifications with confidence our team of subject advisors will be on hand to support you directly with all international GCSE questions and needs each subject advisor also sends out regular newsletters may encourage you to sign up for these results plus our free online exams analysis tool provides detailed insights into your students exam and mock exam performance helping you to target areas of weaker understanding and focus your teaching so students have the best chance of achieving their full grade potential regional support managers are based locally and are there to support senators with any queries as well as providing face-to-face support for some selected subjects we have provided additional support in the form of curriculum matched publishing available from Pearson Hodder Collins and other independent publishers all information on published resources can be found on our subject pages on the website lesson plans example are marked responses to help you better understand what is required from students to achieve certain grades topic booklets to address specific content support in geography history science and modern foreign languages an additional sample assessment materials will be available for a selected range of subjects ahead of first assessment to allow you to set a secure mock examination paper exam wizard an online tool that helps you make the most out of pass papers by choosing questions to create tailor-made mock exam papers for your students to sit we believe this diverse and comprehensive range of support materials tools resources and events give you the best chance of student success with the new international GCSEs as part of the support provided Pearson are publishing a new range of published resources to support the delivery of the new international GCSEs the resources have progression international relevance and support is their guiding design principles and our curriculum matched they will go through the same endorsement processes as for external publishers for more information on the published resources that Pearson will be providing as well as providing updates on publishing obtaining samples ISBNs prices and subject specific details please visit the pace on global schools website at Pearson global schools comm we will now recap the key features of the new international GCSEs we have looked at we used an approach of evolutionary change when redeveloping the International GCSEs retaining all the features that make them so popular and focusing on updating and further internationalizing the content this approach means the qualifications retain the linear structure and external assessment that scores everywhere value for allowing more teaching time and less assessment time we introduced a new 91 grading scale which provides great differentiation of attainment and also rewards the very highest level of student achievement all new international GCSEs develop transferable skills alongside subject knowledge and understanding the skills prepare students to study at the next level progressed to university and eventually thrive in the workplace as with all new pace and qualifications international GCSEs have been developed using Pearson's world-class qualification design principles and validated by a panel of international education experts ensuring they compare with the learning provided in the best education systems around the world and finally we looked at the comprehensive range of support materials tools resources and events provided to help you deliver the new international GCSEs with confidence you can find out more about our new Edexcel international GCSEs on the pearson qualifications website at
