     Behind every heartbeat is a story we can learn from.    As we have for over 80 years, Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies are working to use the knowledge we gain from our members to better the health of not just those we insure but all Americans. Some call it responsibility. We call it a privilege. "Second Opinion" is funded by Blue Cross Blue Shield.  "Second Opinion" is produced in conjunction with UR Medicine, part of University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York.    [ Applause ]  Welcome to "Second Opinion," where each week medical experts discuss a real-life case. I'm your host, Dr. Peter Salgo, and I want to thank all of you here in our live studio audience for being here. And, of course, I want to thank you at home, too. Now, our experts today are Dr. Scott Soleimanpour -- he's an endocrinologist at the University of Michigan Medical School -- and Dr. Lisa Harris, primary care physician from Our Lady of Lourdes Memorial Hospital. And now I'd like you to meet our special guests. Linda Moroney -- she's here with her son Liam to share their story.  Our family was always incredibly active. Having two sons means boundless energy, always going, going, going. There was baseball. There was flag football. There was swimming lessons. There was, you know, every sort of activity going at any point. And we never saw anything like this coming. We didn't know what to expect. Liam was playing CYO basketball, which is very competitive. It was winter, so he would be sledding. He went of skiing with some friends one day. He's just always been incredibly active. The end of the day, he was getting really, really tired and groggy, but there was no fever. There was no -- you know, no other signs that we knew to look for. He was always thirsty for those last four days. [ Clears throat ] But a little bit more so than normal, but he's always been a kid that always preferred to be drinking over eating at any given point. He was just sort of out of it. I said, "Let's pack up. Let's just go to the pediatrician. You know, maybe there's some weird virus that you're having and see -- see what this is."  Now, we heard from Mom. What I want to know is what was it like from the inside, looking out?  Well, I personally couldn't do all the activities that I loved, and everyone else noticed that. They told me, "Liam, keep up. Why aren't you playing as hard as you normally do?" And I wanted to drink and eat all the time, and I just didn't feel like myself.  And that's not normal for you?  No, not to the level I was.  Had you noticed that it was a really sudden onset like that, or had you -- In retrospect, do you think that you had noticed that you were getting a little tired prior to that?  I think I noticed it, but, at the time, I didn't know what to relate it to, so I just figured I might be sick or something.  And you took him to the doctor?  So, we took him to the doctor on that fourth morning where he had just been so exhausted at the end of every day, and, like I had said, he looked really gaunt. And, you know, they tested his blood sugar, and he was in the high 400s at that point, and they explained what was happening and that we'd be heading to the hospital then and there.  Okay. So, they told you what? They said his blood sugar was high. Did they use the word "diabetes"?  They did use the word "diabetes."  When you said, "Blood sugar around 400," I was looking here and here. The eyebrows went all the way up into the hairline. That's a high blood sugar. So, diabetes -- type 1 diabetes?  Yes.  So, why don't we -- Why don't we get some definitions here? What is type 1 diabetes?  The accepted terminology for type 1 is generally thought to be diagnosed in childhood, although there are increasing numbers of folks that are getting diagnosed with type 1 later in life.  We used to call that "juvenile diabetes."  Exactly. But the vast majority of cases are diagnosed in childhood. Usually most folks, between 5 and 12, although people can be diagnosed earlier and later, and can be rather sudden in onset, just like what you experienced with dramatic thirst, frequent urination, frequent hunger, severe high blood sugar, fatigue, weight loss being some of those cardinal symptoms.  You hit all of 'em, Liam.  That's right.  So, what causes diabetes? Do we know?  The belief is that the immune system destroys the cells in the pancreas that make a hormone called "insulin." These cells in the pancreas are called "beta cells." And the belief is that the body's own immune system destroys those cells, rendering patients unable to make their own insulin, and when you no longer are able to make your own insulin -- Insulin is that classic hormone that controls blood sugar, so when you have a lack of insulin, blood sugars then rise uncontrollably.  It's similar to --  All right. Let me -- I'm sorry. Yeah.  Similar to adults who have longstanding type 2 diabetes that basically burn those beta cells out now become what we call insulin-requiring.  Okay, but let's -- Let's hit just a few points. Is it genetic?  There is a genetic component. The belief is that the best studies to look at this have been done in identical twins, so if you look at identical twins who have the exact same genetics -- they share all the same DNA -- if one twin has type 1 diabetes, the odds of the other twin developing type 1 diabetes are 50%, which means that the disease is 50% genetic and 50% of another cause, and we believe that that means that there's an environmental component to the disease, as well.  Is there an infectious component? Is it related to a viral infection?  So, the understanding of the environmental causes are still an area for open investigation, but the biggest leading evidence is viruses do contribute in some way to the development of type 1 diabetes.  So, Linda, you're at the pediatrician's office. The pediatrician takes one look at that blood sugar and goes, "Holy...mackerel," or some equivalent thereof.  Right.  And what happens next?  Well, you kind of wanted her to say it again, 'cause you're like, "What? You know, I thought this was going to be a virus. I thought this was gonna -- You know, we'd have some medicine and take off," 'cause it was just so shocking. So, we went to the emergency room, or to Strong Memorial Hospital.  Well, they must have sent you, right? They didn't let you go home to think about this?  No. They said, "You're going to Strong now, and you're going to be there for three days."  That's your local hospital emergency room.  Exactly.  "And you're gonna be there for three days." No surprises. This has to be gotten under control.  This is what's happening. Right.  So, while you're there, you and Liam, what happened? What went on?  Do you want to take this?  Sure.  Liam, you describe it.  Well, I didn't really know that I was going to a hospital at first. I figured, you know, I might just go home. I remember asking my mom for some juices after we went to the doctor's office.  But then, when we got there, I stayed in an emergency room, right? It was an emergency room? For an hour or two, and I couldn't have anything to eat since my blood sugar was so high.  So then what else?  Well, since I couldn't eat, that's all I could think of, and so that really took a toll on me, so they just came back, giving me ice cubes, and we called them "ice chips" to make me feel a little better.  [ Chuckles ] That didn't work.  [ Chuckles ] And I stayed in my bed and just watched TV and did whatever I could.  Did anybody talk to you? The pediatrician -- when they were telling you to go to the hospital -- certainly, they talked to your mom, but did anybody really talk to you about what was going on?  Um, not at the beginning. I didn't really know. They just didn't want me to get scared or too confused. Once I was in stable condition, then they started explaining what was happening.  Tell me about that three days. You said you were there for three days. During that 3-day period, you must have had one heck of a learning curve.  It was education around the clock, all the time. It was learning how to use syringes. It was learning --  The syringes for were for the insulin that he was gonna need, right?  I had gone through labor and delivery twice without an epidural because I was afraid of needles, and now [Chuckles] I had to learn how to give shots, you know? So, it was a learning curve and checking blood sugar all the time. I mean, it was a lot to take in in three days.  Liam, you go from being a kid who's playing basketball to, suddenly, a kid who needs shots. What was that like?  Well, immediately, I wanted to know that I could still play basketball and still play the sports I liked, 'cause it would have been devastating to me if I couldn't, and, thankfully, I was able to, and they explained how it will just be a little different.  Now, your mom helped with that, right? I understand you were Googling like mad.  Yeah. So, he would go to sleep, and I'd sit in the chair, you know, on my phone, Googling to see what, you know --  Oh, no!  What professional athletes had type 1 so that when he woke up in the morning, I could show it to him and say, "Look. There's a football player. There's a basketball player. There's baseball players. You can do anything that you still want to do."  What was the biggest change that you saw coming down the pike, Liam, now that you knew your diagnosis?  Well, I think just having a bigger responsibility over my shoulders. If I wanted to go play with some friends, I had to count carbs, and where my parents could trust me to go out for dinner someplace now, they have to make sure that I'm counting the right amount of carbs.  Your pancreas was doing all this for you.  That's right.  And, suddenly, "Whoops! We've got to do it."  Right.  That's tricky.  Absolutely. I mean, I think that's the real challenge of the disease, is that it's incumbent upon, at least in our younger patients, the parents to keep track of all of the glucose in the blood, keep track of the meals that you're eating, activity, you know, exercise, which changes blood-sugar control, and then learning to kind of go with the flow of all of those things with the understanding that you're never gonna hit the target perfectly because things change in your life. And, certainly, as you age, things are gonna change, as well, so it's -- I always make the analogy with my patients that it's a moving target and you just have to do the best that you can to keep yourself out of those danger zones, which are very low blood sugar -- Right? -- which can be very debilitating. I don't think I need to tell you. And then very high blood sugar, which, you know, you want to stay out of so that you don't come back to the hospital or you don't have problems, you know, when you're much, much older.  It's a lot of work because you're always behind the 8 ball, trying to catch up. You're checking your sugar, and then you're trying to match that, so you're always behind the 8 ball. When your body, ordinarily, when things are functioning normally, as soon as you prepare to eat, your body begins to release insulin, and as your activity levels go up, it releases insulin, and down regulates when you don't need as much. So now, artificially, we're trying to catch up with that.  Well, stay where you are, everybody, because in every episode, "Second Opinion" looks for game-changers, medical innovations that could make a difference in diagnosis and treatment. In diabetes, doctors are always considering better ways to help patients control their blood sugar, and now an artificial pancreas might help.     So, the pancreas is the organ in the body that makes a hormone called insulin. So, for patients with type 1 diabetes, this is an autoimmune disease which actually destroys the cells in the pancreas that make insulin. So, an artificial pancreas is a medical device that is, one day, going to replace what the pancreas is doing. The new artificial pancreases combine an insulin pump with a continuous glucose monitor, so a continuous glucose monitor has a little electrode that sits right beneath the skin and will record the blood sugar continuously every few minutes, and that glucose monitor will then communicate directly with the insulin pump, so instead of having to have the patient manually check blood sugar with a glucometer and enter in that blood-sugar value into the pump, that number will be transmitted directly to the pump. What makes this more towards an artificial pancreas as the insulin pump can then make decisions simply based on those blood sugars. Basically, what it does for our patients with diabetes is takes all of that information about blood sugars and gives it to them in real time. For parents, often the biggest comfort from this technology is the ability to sort of know what's going on with your child's blood sugar at all times. In type 1 diabetes and diabetes in general, we've seen just tremendous advancement in the use of technology to help patients control their disease. The goal is to, one day, have a device, a true artificial pancreas, that a patient will just literally put onto their body and then not have to think about their diabetes.  So, folks, what technology do we have right now that Liam and Mom can take advantage of?  So, the latest things that are available for our patients include insulin pumps, which use a cannula, a tubing, connected to a little plastic cannula that goes under the skin that infuses insulin continuously into our patients. And then the patients can use the pump on demand to take extra insulin, say, when they're eating a meal.  Liam -- he's got one.  Mm-hmm.  Let's see this thing. Just show it to the camera. There you are. Now, it looks like an iPhone to me. It has all kinds of screen features.  Touch screen.  Look at that. What does it do, Liam?  So, instead of having to take shots every time you eat a meal or your blood sugar is high, you can just dial your carbs or your blood sugar into the pump, and then it will give you insulin instead of having to take an injection.  And how do you know what your blood sugar is at any time? You've got some more technology here.  Yes. I have the test to do that, and I carry this bag around everywhere I go, and inside here is my kit. And I pull it out, and, um... I basically put a strip in here, and I cock it back, prick my finger, put the blood in here, and then it gives me my number.  And you're also wearing a monitor of some sort, right?  Yes.  Tell me about that. By the way, you're doing so well. You're after my job, and I'm getting very worried. [ Laughter ]  He's doing the medical-expert job, too, so...  You're out of work, too.  Yeah. [ Chuckles ]  Tell me about this continuous monitor that I wear on your arm.  So, basically, here is the Dexcom monitor, it's called, and instead of having to test all the time when I need numbers, it basically gives me numbers, and you have to calibrate it every once in a while to make sure it's accurate, but it listens to my levels, actually, and, that way, my parents can watch it when I'm at school.  So, that means it's talking to your -- It's tattletaling. Your mom and your dad -- they know what your levels are. That's incredibly cool.  It's really, really, really good with sports, so we can tell if his blood sugar's going up superhigh during games, which it often does, or if it's dropping really fast during practices, which it often does.  So, that just induces tension in Mom and Dad.  No, it gives us a good indication of how to treat him and to get in there before he bottoms out, which is really important.  Which is really important technology to have, because when we started with insulin pumps way back when, we didn't have that technology to really get the continuous blood glucoses.  Right. Right.  So, using glucometers is kind of the lifeblood backbone of diabetes.  The glucometer is pricking your finger...  Pricking your finger, getting a little bit of blood from your finger, putting it in that machine that he showed, that device that he showed, with a test strip. That still remains a critical component of diabetes self-monitoring and treatment, but these new -- The device he showed on his arm -- this is called a continuous glucose monitoring system. These are extensions of that that allow our patients to get 'round-the-clock glucose measurements.  Well, of course, you know, you're a doctor. You don't know what it's like to have diabetes or have an insulin pump. Or do you?  Right. So, I've had type 1 since I was 5 years old. Been wearing an insulin pump. Had type 1 diabetes for over 30 years. So, here's my pump, and I wear a continuous glucose monitor, as well, a glucose sensor, as well, so I live the life, as it were, and definitely try to take stock in what I've learned as a patient and help it with my practice. And so, you know, as devastating and difficult as this condition is, there are treatments that have come through the pipeline that change the way we approach care, and those are things that have really helped our parents of kids with type 1 and then also our patients.  And I think the game-changer with diabetes now is that it now has become something that you have and not something that you are.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, that is really critical. You don't identify with your disease. You're a person with an issue. That's really important.  Absolutely.  So, in the early days, when the blood sugar got too high, you had to deal with it. When the blood sugar got too low, you had to deal with it. And, to some degree, you're still dealing with that.  Oh, yeah.  How do you manage all that?  You don't sleep much [Laughs] overnight, because, obviously, he can drop overnight or he can go high overnight, and so having that glucose monitor overnight and setting levels that it'll alarm me or my husband to know we have to go in and test him is so key. You know, I can't imagine not having that anymore. And I know a lot of patients don't, you know?  Well, you talk about having to dive in and treat this. You're not getting much sleep. Lisa, what are the risks? Oh, the blood sugar goes down or the blood sugar goes up.  So, hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, is actually more dangerous than high blood sugar, so people with low blood sugars can really die. It can be a fatal disease from which it makes it very difficult to recover. It's very hard to get that blood sugar back up once it's critically low. High blood sugars, we can give insulin. That's not to say that that's not as dangerous, but it is. And so back in the old days, when all we had was the insulin pumps, that was the concern, particularly from primary-care physicians, that you had this pump that was giving continuous insulin, and we were really worried about low blood sugars, because how could you tell? In the middle of the night, when the patient was asleep, who was there to wake them up and check their blood sugar.  What blood sugar are you shooting for, Liam? What's your perfect blood sugar?  120.  120? Now, I know there's a body of literature out there some years ago that said, "That's too high! 120? No, no, no, no, no. Let's get it to 70 or 80." What's the current thinking?  Yeah. So, there's actually an evolution in thought about this. So, actually, if you go even further back, into the 1980s, there was a belief that was held by some that tight blood-sugar control in children might actually stunt development. You know, we're talking brain development and cognitive development. So, for a long time, there was a belief that we should let our kids' blood sugars run high. And what they found was, long term, when you look 10, 20, 30 years out, the patients with tight blood-sugar control had lower risks of diabetes-related complications -- blindness, kidney disease, kidney failure, nerve disease, amputations.  Big, big worries, right?  Big, big worries. But the problem that was born from that study was that, as we tightened blood-sugar control in our patients, type 1 and type 2, that the incidence of low sugar started to rise significantly.  Right, and, as Lisa said, the low sugar is the real problem here.  And it's even a bigger problem now that we have a larger body of literature on low sugar, that the more frequently that you get low sugar, the body has a series of defense mechanisms. So, if it drops below 70, a lot of our patients, early in the disease, they get what we call shaky, sweaty, you know? These are, like, fight-or-flight adrenaline-type responses, where, you know, your heart will race, you'll feel a little shaky, you'll feel a little, you know, fatigued, your heart will be running quickly. But if this happens quite frequently, you lose that sensation. That sensation gets dulled, and, eventually, you can develop senses of low sugar where the brain is being deprived of glucose.  So, that's a very late sign.  That's a later sign.  We don't want that ever to happen, if we can avoid it.  No, and then, eventually, that sensation can go away, as well, and patients can get what's called "hypoglycemia unawareness," where they can be sitting around, having a conversation with you, and their sugar can be in the 40s. And they can be on the verge of significant compromise.  And, you know, the other thing with the DCCT and the UKPDS is that those were done on adults, and so, many times, what we do is we do adult research. Then we try to extrapolate to pediatrics, and we try to figure out the dosages and the important things. And so we thought, "Well, you know, let them run a little high. It's okay. They're growing. They're gonna need extra sugar." But we found out that that's really detrimental. But it's just as bad to have extremely tight control. So, you really want to do more of what the body does ordinarily to keep it within a range.  And, at the beginning, you had to give shots, had to calculate his carb load in the morning, give some insulin shots, calculate what he was gonna have for lunch. You had to call your mom, did you, if you were gonna have some extra carbs for lunch?  Yes, because, in the beginning, I didn't have the continuous glucose monitor, so we just had to rely on how my body was feeling or tests, and that's why I'd have to call my mom.  I got to tell you that when I was dealing with insulin on an outpatient basis with diabetics, I found it incredibly tricky and confusing. I got a nod over there.  It's a lot of decisions that you're thinking about constantly.  So, you are all Team Liam.  Yeah.  Mom, Dad. You've got a brother...  Yep.  ...who's here. Are they all supportive, all helpful?  Yes, definitely.  Even your younger brother?  Unfortunately, yeah. [ Laughter ]  Let me throw one last question up in the air. Cure -- we're looking for a cure. Do we see one on the horizon?  So, I'm glad you asked that, and I may, a little, wax poetic, quickly, about it, but I think this is important. So, as someone who is a type 1 diabetic and takes care of patients with type 1 diabetes, one thing that I learned when I was young was that this was the same question my mother asked. This is a family disease. This is not just you. This is everybody. And so parents, especially in our pediatric population, are driving that question. And sometimes -- and this isn't meant to point fingers, but I think it's because we have, sometimes, a disconnect with the basic research world. We actually don't know where things are well enough to be able to make approximations, and so we say to our patients, "It's around the corner." Well, that sets false expectations, and then patients get disappointed, myself being one of them. I was annoyed. People said, "Oh, 5, 10 years, you won't have this anymore." They said that to me in the 1980s. So, I think it's important to have a very clear understanding -- that drove my decision to go into this field -- to be honest and keep positive and optimistic but to be honest. In terms of true cure, giving -- trying to regenerate those beta cells, bring them back, provide more, I think that's a little bit further off. And so, you know, there are active stem-cell research studies being performed to grow new beta cells in the dish and then maybe to grow them from your own stem cells, maybe, that are formed from skin cells, per se, or embryonic stem cells. That's a little bit further off, but there's a lot of excitement, and large groups are pursuing that.  It is simply worth saying, I think -- Lisa, you can concur or not -- compared to where we were when I started practice, this is dramatic.  Absolutely.  You're sitting here with a pump and a monitor and an iPhone and a mom who's worried and a brother who's actually helpful, all of which is remarkable. And I want to thank you two for being here and sharing your story with us. To end the show today, here's some advice that Linda has for families.  My advice to a family with a newly diagnosed type 1 diabetic child is it's a lot of information to take in and to take in quickly, but, you know, you're absorbing pieces of it every single day. And you can do everything right, and sometimes the floor is still kicked out from under you. There'll be a high or be a low, even though you've done everything right. But it's a marathon, and it's not a sprint, so some days are gonna be really, really hard, you know? But the next day might not be.  I want to thank all of you for being here in our studio audience today. It was terrific. And I want to thank you at home for watching. Now, remember, you can get more second opinions and patients' stories on our website at... You can continue this conversation on Facebook and Twitter, where we are live every day with health news. I'm Dr. Peter Salgo, and I'll see you next time for another "Second Opinion."                 Behind every heartbeat is a story we can learn from.
