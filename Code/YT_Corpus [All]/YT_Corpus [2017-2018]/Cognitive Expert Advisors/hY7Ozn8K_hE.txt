 all right we're gonna get started thank you all for coming I know it has been a long day but I hope it has been an engaging one and one in which you have learned a lot and and you know thought deeply about some some really great issues and I think this panel will be another opportunity to do that my name is Brook Hopkins I am the executive director of the criminal justice policy program here at Harvard Law School we call ourselves CJ P P and we are a relatively new organization we're in our third year but we have we have amassed a great docket of work in that short time we work on criminal justice policy reform so you know most of the criminal justice work at the law school that students have an opportunity to participate in is direct litigation direct service litigation on the prosecution side and on the defense side we do policy work and we work on we work with policy makers and with their stakeholders and with advocates across the country on really cutting-edge criminal justice issues to give you a couple of examples we work on bail reform issues and we've we we've written a report on bail that has been cited in court cases and is used by advocates and then we've also worked in specific jurisdictions on specific reform initiatives we work on criminal justice fines and fees we do we serve as a national policy hub for fines and fees work across the country we we created a web tool for advocates to use that that that collects all of the statutory and regulatory information about the way that your every state in the country charges criminal justice fines and fees which is a really important tool to figuring out to sort of starting local policy solutions to some of these problems we also work on lise technology and we did we worked with the Boston Police Department on their body camera pilot project and we've also worked on sort of a more theoretical level thinking about how to fill the regulatory vacuum that is that is occurring now as a result of the rapid emerging of at the rapid pace of Technology and the way that it's being adopted by police departments with very little structure framework of regulation we've also done some projects thinking about the role of the prosecutor and and rethinking that model thinking about reform oriented prosecutors and what that might mean and how that might work and we also did a project a clemency project at the end of the Obama administration so we do a lot of work on a variety of issues and students are involved in all of this work so it's a great opportunity for Harvard law students to be a part of this exciting work and these important conversations so we are hosting this panel today to kind of give you a sense of some of the stories of folks who are doing this work on the ground so to introduce our panel of storytellers I want to ask Alex whiting here to come up Alex as a faculty co-director of CJ PP and he teaches criminal law and evidence and other classes related to criminal law here at the law school including the seminar that CJ p-p does with students who work on our policy projects so Alex waiting [Applause] thank you all for coming we're very excited to have this panel today these these two speakers who are enormous ly inspirational in the work that they do and we're looking forward to hearing their stories about their work and their experiences it's my privilege to introduce Jeff Robinson whose class of 94 well class of 1981 he is a deputy legal director of the ACLU and the director of the ACLU trone Center for justice and equality which works on criminal justice racial justice and reform issues before that he was a criminal defense lawyer in Seattle a state and federal public defender and also worked in private practice he has tried over 200 criminal cases to verdict I'm guessing we might hear about one or two he was an original member of the John Adams project which was established by the ACLU to support military counsel at Guantanamo Bay and he himself worked on behalf of one of the five men held at Guantanamo Bay charged with carrying out the 9/11 attacks he lectures on trial skills across the country is a faculty member of the national criminal defense college MA in Macon Georgia past president of the Washington Association of criminal defense lawyers and an elected fellow of the American College of trial attorneys please join me in welcoming Jeff Robinson it's a pleasure to be here and I won't say that when I was in school here I did not anticipate that I would be back here on a panel celebrating the 200th anniversary of Harvard Law School that's for another time in place I'll just leave it at that what I want to do is to talk about the people that I work with and the work that they're doing the National ACLU is divided into three centers and my center the trone's Center for justice and equality is named that way because a man named David Troon who owns a company called Total Wine that some of you may be familiar with made a huge donation to the ACLU I was able to negotiate not to have trone tattooed across my forehead but I am my Center is now called the trone center and the trone's Center for justice and equality is made up of four projects the capital punishment project the national prison project the criminal law reform project and the racial justice program the director of the racial justice program Denis Parker is sitting in the back of the room and Denis is gonna have to leave and Denis I've got you all at the end so you may not be here when I talk about the great work that you're doing the ACLU started several years ago something called a campaign for smart justice and this is a campaign that was funded by the open society foundation with the intent or purpose of reducing the prison population by 50% there are any number of campaigns or movements around the country that are focusing on the prison population and I think I just wanted to highlight this because my Center the trone Center is working hand-in-hand with the campaign for smart justice to try and effect what we consider to be the most important criminal law and racial justice reforms that we can work on and there are several things about both the ACLU and the campaign for smart justice that I think is important and what's going to be interesting is that I think when you hear alik get up and talk what you're gonna hear is somebody that has started an organization that is completely different from the ACLU but the principles that he's going to be following and talking about our principles that anybody working on criminal justice reform had better understand litigation is critical to what we do and we're here at Harvard Law School and there are lawyers who are going to be litigators it is some of the most important work that will happen but if you think litigation will save the country from the criminal justice woes that we have you are wrong it is litigation plus legislation plus community engagement plus advocacy plus education and this kind of integrated advocacy is what is going to be necessary to truly tackle the criminal justice challenges that we have in America that is a chart that anybody who is familiar with criminal justice is going to be aware of and one of the things that you see from that chart is this if you let out every single person in federal custody tomorrow we still got more than two million people in prison and what that means is that while the Trump administration and the policies that it wants to pursue and advocate they are important and it's important to understand how they can be harmful this game is not going to be won at the state at the federal level this is a state game that we are engaged in and one of the things that the campaign for smart justice is trying to do in partnership with other organizations is to create a blueprint for each of the states because if you looked at this pie chart and you had a similar pie chart for each state in the country the divisions would look absolutely different and what I mean by that is if Arizona wants to adjust its criminal law reform issues the policy changes that they need to make will be completely different than what Arkansas needs to do and that will be different than what Pennsylvania needs to do there are definitely going to be some common elements of cross the systems but understanding that this is a fight that is going to be won at the state and local level this is a place where the state and local politicians state and local policies can actually impact and drive what happens in the federal policies so I want to tell you a story about the capital punishment project these are lawyers who work in my Center they are housed in Durham North Carolina some of the finest lawyers in the country and I want to tell you about how they engaged with other partners and the state of Florida because this is what Florida was like in January of 2016 death row was bloated ten executions in the calendar year before that the governor signed a bill to speed up executions and then something happened Hurst versus Florida and the US Supreme Court decided that the Florida scheme was unconstitutional because in Florida it was the judge rather than the jury who would decide on the existence of aggravating factors and their weight and the jury didn't have to be unanimous the jury could recommend life or death didn't have to be unanimous well the US Supreme Court heard that case and we argued in an amicus brief our capital punishment project that the historic right to a jury is a right to a unanimous jury especially where execution is involved and one of the things I would say to you is that if you are looking at history and at the end of my comments I'm gonna say something about that if you look at history you'll notice for example that the state of Louisiana is one of the only states where you can be convicted of a felony on less than a unanimous verdict 10 to 2 will get you convicted in Louisiana if you go back into the history of the Louisiana Legislature in the Louisiana State Constitution what you're going to see is people saying this slavery is over but we need these black people to be working and we don't want to pay them and one way we can get that to happen is if we convict them of crimes because then we can put them in prison and put them on Prison labor gangs so let's have 10 2 to 2 just a little bit easier to maintain our economic status well the Supreme Court decided that the sixth amendment requires a jury not a judge to impose the death penalty and they remanded to the Florida Supreme Court but Florida wasn't done yet the Legislature passed a law and they said okay jury sentencing for execution but it doesn't have to be unanimous and our capital punishment project once again work with other lawyers around the country filed briefs in that case and on October 14th of 2016 the Florida Supreme Court adopted our position and the position of our partners know the jury has to impose it it has to be unanimous and this applies to all cases that were decided after ring there are 200 people on death row in Florida who are now going to have new sentencing hearings that means 200 families that are not going to have to watch a relative die in an execution chamber the Supreme Court denied the state's requests for cert to review Hearst versus state which was the state's retroactivity decision and the capital punishment project is leading trainings for lawyers in Florida to do resentencing hearings saying to the state do you really want to pay for 200 sentencing hearings again to try and Institute the death penalty in Florida the national prison project is one of the other projects that works in the center that I have the honor to lead and they do just what you would think they work to try and protect the people who are serving time in prison because I have a message for everybody in this room and I think you know it nine out of ten people who are in prison are coming back and how would you like them to come back would you like them to come back after they have been sexually and physically abused in prison given no training or education to do anything given no kind of tools to be successful when they come and would you like them to move into your neighborhood saying let's see what would happen or would you like them to be treated somewhat differently these are the things that the National Prison project has worked on issues that have a major and direct impact on how we are treating the people that we choose to imprison I believe that when alec stands up you are gonna hear something about people living in cages and as I've said those people are coming back if you ever saw the movie Silence of the Lambs do you remember the Institute where dr. Lecter was held where Jodie Foster went in to see him the first time that was the Baltimore City Jail the actual Baltimore City Jail where people were housed until recently the National Prison project worked extensively to get that shut down the East Mississippi Correctional Facility one of the private prisons that is now sparking up and going and coming up all around the country private prison companies are either building prisons or taking over state built prisons and running them because there is money in the criminal justice system when you look to see who it is that is advocating against criminal justice reform you'll find private prison companies right at the top because they need the clients and the national prison project has led a campaign to stop and eliminate solitary confinement in the United States prison system and they've done that since 2010 and that is just an example of some of the states where they have made substantive gains in eliminating solitary confinement and I have to apologize I don't know if I've dropped any f-bombs yet but there may be one or two that come when I start talking about this because understanding what solitary can Fineman is and what it does to a person psychologically and emotionally is significant and if you took a tour through a solitary confinement facility and you understood what happens to a human being you would be sick to your stomach and the most conservative law-and-order person in the world cannot make a substantive argument that says let's abuse people that we put in prison to make sure that when they come out of prison they're gonna re-enter our community as meaningful healthy people it doesn't make any sense Dennis you're still here and I'm glad Dennis Parker runs the racial justice program and this is a program that has worked tirelessly to achieve racial justice not just in the criminal justice area but in other areas in America we know that racial justice and criminal justice walk hand-in-hand because people that look like me make up about 12% of the population and about 46% of the prison population and we could have another discussion on another day about why that is maybe blacks are just more violent maybe the rocks are just more tending to be criminals we can have another discussion when I have more time about that but this is part of the work that the racial justice program is doing for one of the most forgotten populations in this country and that's Native Americans the people that we stole the country from whom we got started it's easy to forget that because the narrative that we tell about racial and criminal justice in America is one of the most false narratives that has ever existed in the United States history they filed and settled debtors prison cases we heard from Brooke about the debtors prison work that people are doing here and when you think about debtors prison it's essentially people that have fines and fees and they can't pay the money so they go to jail we have a cm lawyers that have sat in courtrooms where judges are telling a population of mostly black and brown faces get on the telephone call your relative call your sister you better get twenty-five dollars down here because if you don't you're going to jail debtors prison and bail issues and Alec has done amazing work on some bail issues that he'll talk about but my view is it's the opposite side of the same coin in each situation I understand there's some different law in each situation but in each situation somebody is standing in front of a judge and they want to go home and the judge wants money before they can go home and that issue alone is an issue that has infected the criminal justice system in ways you can't imagine let me just give you this brief scenario you're arrested tonight for driving while intoxicated and I'm talking about the people in this room most of the people in this room will have the money so that they can bail out tonight be home by Saturday and you'll be at work Monday morning you'll never have to say a word to your boss and if you get the case settled because you hire a good lawyer nobody may ever find out about it and you're just marching on but if you don't have money you get held in jail tonight and when your family doesn't know where you are they're gonna find out maybe tomorrow if you can call them and say hey I'm in jail and now you got a decision to make do I call my boss and say I got arrested on a DUI please don't fire me I'm gonna take care of it and worry about being fired because you got arrested or do you call your boss and lie and say you know what I'm sick I'll be back to work on Wednesday and then if they find out that you lied about it you lose your job because you lied and if you lose your job one of the things that people don't realize is so many folks in America are living paycheck to paycheck people that are considered quote-unquote middle-class you take the paycheck away and you can't pay rent and when you can't pay rent you get evicted and now you're charged with a crime and you're homeless and now see how your life starts to revolve around the water going down the toilet fair housing is one of the other issues that the racial justice program has worked on and maintaining and expanding federal state and local requirements about data collection data collection is critical in the debate about criminal justice especially when you are trying to impact people to the right of sinner when you can show data data is important for everybody but I'll tell you what has impacted people to the right of sinner the money and when the money that is spent on criminal justice systems is such that it starts to bankrupt communities you now have people that are willing to listen and say you know what maybe we can do something other than imprison those people you know what maybe the sentences shouldn't be so long and so people understanding that economic reality is something that should be taken into account in the criminal justice system that's fine and I think it's a it's a tool that can help us move things forward but I don't want you to mistake arguments about money and economy in the criminal justice system for arguments about justice in the criminal justice system this is one of the reports that our JP worked on bullies in blue and it details what police officers are doing to our children in school I am freaked out completely when I see what kids get arrested for today for what they did in school I went to Catholic schools growing up and the stuff I did in schools man I guess I would be a felon by this point disrupting school that's a criminal charge that people seven eight and nine years old are getting arrested for and getting convictions on their record spraying perfume fake burping fake fart spray fake fart spray again refusing to change a t-shirt depicting a hunting rifle not following instruct criticizing a police officer kids work charged with crimes for these behaviors disorderly conduct kicking a trash can cursing refusing to leads the lunchroom documenting bullying assault throwing a paper airplane throwing a baby carrot throwing skittles and fake fart spray one more time and it would it is funny if it weren't so freakin unbelievable the criminal justice system is getting involved in this stuff and this is what the racial justice program is working on you put out this report you understand that students handcuffed during mental health crisis look who gets handcuffed and Luke who gets handcuffed when nobody ends up getting charged with a crime and explain to your nine-year-old when they come home how they should feel when they've been handcuffed in school for acting like a kid the criminal law reform project is one of our other projects and they have done substantially great work as well this is a lawsuit that was just filed in South Carolina you are taught here in school that if you are charged with a crime where you can go to jail you have the right to a lawyer that's just black letter constitutional law and you may be sitting here thinking that that's the truth in every state in America and it's not in states all over America people are sent to jail without a lawyer and judges don't even tell them they have a right to a lawyer this is happening in our country the prosecutor is the arresting police officer who questions himself about his own credibility and makes arguments about his own credibility to the judge that's the criminal law reform project and some of the kind of cases that they work on because these things are what's going on behind the curtain in America this is the true narrative about criminal justice in America do you understand that in the life last five years over 1 billion dollars has been paid in police misconduct cases and yet officers in Oklahoma and Minnesota are acquitted when video cameras show them essentially executing black men the criminal law reform project cannot replace the Department of Justice and 19,000 lawyers in the Department of Justice under the Obama administration we had a Department of Justice that was interested in investigating these things that's not going to happen anymore part of what the ACLU has to do is with our partners to try and step in and fill some of that gap and I'm gonna get to that in a second the clemency project was something that the criminal law reform project was involved in and that released almost a thousand prisoners who would have stayed in prison otherwise we have filed a lawsuit in Idaho and in Missouri about challenging public defender systems that are radically underfunded we're in Missouri public defenders are given a choice of a public defender was just I think disbarred for not giving adequate defense to a criminal defendant and his defense was my caseload is too big those same public defenders are held in contempt when they tell the trial court judges I can't take any more cases we're filing lawsuits in those circumstances so it gives you an idea of what the criminal law reform project and those lawyers are doing and I want to talk for a second about the value of reports because the Massachusetts State Supreme Court issued an opinion not too long ago that essentially said a young black man running from the police without Moore is not probable cause and the basis for that decision was an ACLU of Massachusetts report that demonstrated that 75% of the people stopped in Boston's version of stop and frisk were absolutely innocent and one of the things I suggest to you is you cannot stop crime by stopping and frisking innocent people there is no there there there is no connection and so I'll talk about one report that our Center did a report called back to business and this is an example of the kind of collaboration I was talking about because we have in the room the human resources director of Walmart we have representatives from Koch Industries and at the same time when you see key advisors each one of those key advisors is a formerly incarcerated person who is running an organization supporting formerly incarcerated people and before we produce this per report we sat down with them to say instead of us telling you what it is you need how about you tell us you're the people that walked out of prison one day trying to reintegrate yourselves into the community why don't you tell us what you need and this report that was put out has demonstrated that there are all kinds of reasons to see formerly incarcerated people as exactly what they are incredible human resources that we cannot afford to waste so I want to do this if I have like three more minutes or five more minutes education is part of what we are focused on can I see a show of hands in this room how many people know who the colonial Marines were this is one of the most educated audiences in America and I am NOT saying this to humiliate or embarrass anybody everything I'm about to show you as I end my part of this presentation are things that I learned in the last seven years I'm 61 years old I was born and raised in Memphis Tennessee I'm 11 years old when King is assassinated my parents were D in the civil rights movement it wasn't something I read about it was something I lived through and I was humiliated when I found out what I don't know about the history of race in this country because in my view I've already said the history of race is inexorably tied to criminal justice in this country and until we recognize what that history actually is we will never solve this problem George Orwell wrote who controls the past controls the future and when you control the narrative about what happened in the past you control the narrative about where we need to go in the future and he also said this who controls the present controls the past and the narrative we are hearing from our federal government right now about race in America is a false one the colonial Marines were black slaves that fought with the British during the war of 1812 and there's a woman who went to Harvard Law School here a woman named Chloe Coburn who graduated several years ago and her great-great great-great-great-great- something great aunt or a grandfather or uncle or something a guy named alexander cockburn was a was the Admiral of the British who got these colonial Marines to fight with them about three months before Francis Scott Key was in Baltimore getting inspired to sing that or write the national anthem he was involved in an engagement with the British and the colonial Marines and the technical military term is they got their asses handed to them the Americans were driven back into Washington DC the White House was set on fire and Francis Scott Key wrote what if they all do that meaning the slaves so how many people know the third verse of the national anthem can I see a show of hands and folks there's one hand I'm not trying to embarrass anybody I'm asking you to share my humiliation I want you to experience our national anthem [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] gonna spark for the generation justice program are representing the young woman who was picked up out of that chair in a South Carolina school and thrown across the classroom by the police officer because she wouldn't stop looking at herself the history of race in America is a history you do not know is a history that has been hidden from us because the South may have lost the Civil War but they won the piece and they won it big time if you are going to deal with criminal justice reform in America you have to deal with racism in America and part of our educational efforts are going to be to ask Americans to share with us what we are referring to as a Naked Lunch moment with race in America William Burroughs wrote the book Naked Lunch and he was asked what does that title mean and let me just say don't read that book that's a horrible book you don't want that stuff bouncing around in your head but he said what does the title mean it means that moment when everyone has to look at what is really on the end of their fork the ACLU is going to be asking America to have a Naked Lunch moment with the true history of race because if we do we will be compelled to do more about criminal justice in America thank you [Applause] all right so to introduce our our next speaker I'm gonna ask Carol steiker who is the other faculty co-director of CJ pp to come up she her scholarship focuses primarily on the death penalty but she teaches basically anything involving criminal law at Harvard Law School Carol's duiker teaches or has taught so thanks Jeff thanks so much for that really powerful presentation it's my pleasure to welcome you to Harvard Law School welcome you back to Harvard Law School on many of those in the audience along with Brooke and Alex I welcome you on behalf of CJ P P the criminal justice policy program a relatively new initiative here at the Law School and we're very proud to be hosting this event today in this day of terrific events and I'm especially pleased to be able to introduce my former student Alec karat Katz honest who I remember not long ago graduated will be 10 years ago this coming spring but seems like yesterday that a bright-eyed and idealistic Alec was in class and now he's a bright-eyed and idealistic reformer who is leading the charge of a movement that's moving like wildfire across the United States to reform America's practices of money bail which have flown below the radar of public policy conversation for far too long so Alec graduated from Harvard Law School and worked in his in the early days of his career as a public defender at the DC public defender service and as a federal defender in Alabama and then he I'm very proud to say this too he applied for seed grant funding from a new Harvard initiative that I was also part of the committee that created the public service venture fund an in-house Harvard Law School social justice entrepreneurship fund and Alec along with one of his classmates applied for seed money to start the organization equal justice under law which began to advocate for the rights of some of the most vulnerable people in the criminal justice system Alec went on more recently to found the civil rights core which he now directs and he's made bail reform one of his central issues we at cg c jpp have partnered with Alec and the Civil Rights Corps but really they've been going around the country having remarkable really stunning success in litigation challenging bail practices across the country one of his more recent victories which you may have read about is a huge decision in Texas striking down Harris County that's Houston's bail practices the reason I think you may have read about it is if you like me get your news from the New York Times online the New York Times posted some of the videos of Houston judges setting bail which if you haven't seen them are really quite stunning and the victory in that case and in many other cases is really the you know can be traced directly back to Alec Carrick it's honest so I give you Alec who is here to speak to all of us today so it's a real honor to be asked to speak here I could not have imagined when I graduated here having said many of the things that I had said when I was a student here that I would be asked to come I don't know what what you were alluding to earlier during your time here but but for me it's really it's it's really great in a testament to Harvard that they invited me back just just nine short years after I said so many things let me out of respect and mercy for those of you who just sat through me speaking for an hour and a half on a different panel and and since I come here a lot and they say a lot of things about my views on our on our criminal legal system in our society generally I thought just for this brief period I would tell a couple of stories and I won't say anything we'll talk at you too much about my views of our criminal legal system because I think stories are really at the heart of everything that we try to do as advocates and everything that we try to do at civil rights course so I encourage you to go to the civil rights core website if we're just in looking at more of our work that's civil rights course you are PSO rgp including a incredible fantastic new case we brought with the ACLU suing the district attorney in New Orleans and ten individual prosecutors we're launching a prosecutor project which is going to be an effort to do what we did with fines and fees and with bail in the world of the American prosecutor and that is to tell a different story a different narrative about who prosecutors are and what they're doing and the effect that they have on our legal system in our society so with that let me just let me talk a little bit about what I did shortly after Harvard gave me some money to start being a civil rights lawyer the first thing I did was I bought a plane ticket with Harvard's money and I went to Birmingham Alabama and I rented a car and I started driving around to different municipal courts all throughout the south and I my intention was to go visit some of my old colleagues in Montgomery and a sort of meander around and and until I got to Montgomery and everywhere I went I saw things that really shocked me that maybe they shouldn't have shocked me I'd read all about our in a legal system I've been a public defender for four and a half years at that point but nonetheless the things I saw in those few weeks that road trip affected the the course of the rest of my career I saw in town after town as Jeff was describing some of the ACLU lawsuits that have been filed in the last few years I saw human beings being thrown in cages because they couldn't make small monetary payments and I saw this every single courtroom I visited and I finally made it back to Montgomery where I used to live I lived in Montgomery for two and a half years right after I left Harvard Law School and before I went and visited the judge that I clerked for in Montgomery or saw my old friends at the public defender's office I decided to go check out the Montgomery Municipal Court I arrived there was a very cold winter morning in early 2014 and I walked into the courtroom and there were 67 people all of them black all of them in jail garb handcuffed and not a single one of them was accused of a crime they were all in jail because they couldn't afford to make a monetary payment from an outstanding traffic ticket and one by one they were called up and the judge would scream at them give me my money give me a thousand dollars you were going to jail $3,000 you were going to jail and one by one in proceedings that I used the word proceedings as we're in a law school in in in a one-way dialogue from the judge that lasted about five to ten to fifteen seconds sometimes they were thrown in jail and for reasons I were being videotaped okay so I won't go into why I was kicked out of the courtroom but I was kicked out of the courtroom eventually and I I so I decided well why not just go up into the jail and so I went up into the jail was wearing a inside-out hooded sweatshirt which is what I usually wear when I court watch and I walked into the jail and I just started calling out the names of the people who I had seen jailed until I was asked to leave the courtroom and I guess the jailers didn't really know who I was what I was doing so they started bringing these people who like whose names I called out and I'll never forget the first two people I met with I'll never forget any of them but I'll just I don't have unlimited time here I'm sure you have limited patience the first woman I met was a woman named charnel Mitchell Shaun L had been in jail for a couple of weeks at that point and she told me that she had been sitting on her couch with her one-year-old on her lap and her four-year-old next to her when police raided her home on a Sunday night and they arrested her they literally took the children out of her hands left them there and took her to jail because she owed money on traffic tickets from 2010 four years previously and charnel started crying I think as any young mother would about not knowing where her kids were she couldn't pay any money to use the jails for profit phone system so she didn't know where her kids were her babies she didn't know how she was getting out of jail she showed me her court document and on her court document it said pay us twenty eight hundred and seven dollars or do fifty nine days in jail and I asked her now why how did they come up with this number fifty nine days she said well actually in Montgomery you get $50 a day toward your fines and fees for every day you do in jail so I owed $2,800 so I guess that meant fifty nine days and actually start you know that made me realize what I had seen downstairs I saw the judge saying two thousand dollars forty days one thousand dollars twenty days I didn't understand what the formula was but it made sense but then on the back of her she had a jail guard had given her a pencil and on the back of this court document she'd been writing the days wasn't through fifty nine in each day she was writing fifty fifty fifty seventy-five seventy-five and then on the other side of the paper she was subtracting these numbers from twenty eight hundred and seven she was trying to figure out when she could get home and I said why are you writing 75 some days I thought you told me you get fifty dollars a day she said well if you agree to be a janitor and to clean the judges office and clean the blood and feces off the the jail bars in the jail floor they give you an extra 25 dollars and it dawned on me that the reason when I was a federal defender with my clients being held in the Montgomery City Jail the reason I always saw an army of people in jail garb cleaning up everywhere was that they were local city debtors in the city of Montgomery in the year 2014 was running a modern-day debt peonage system of slave labor and by the time she was done talking to me the the pencil was all smeared with her tears and I had brought my phone into the jail there was no sign saying you couldn't bring your phone into the jail just for the people recording this and I took a photograph of the court document and the next man I met was a man named Lorenzo Brown Lorenzo I had actually seen his court appearance below he did something very moving I thought he got down on his knees in the courtroom and he begged the judge for mercy he was the only one who I heard talk really he said something to the effect of I know I've made mistakes in my life judge I was a drug addict when I got these tickets and I wasn't a very responsible person but I found God and lord have mercy upon me I'm throwing myself at the mercy of the court please don't put me in jail and the judge said pay me $2,000 or do 40 days in jail and just shuffled him off and Lorenzo understandably when faced with a a person wearing an inside-out hooded sweatshirt who said he was a lawyer from Washington DC didn't believe me yeah I later laughed about this a lot but he had no interest in talking to some guy who you know no one had offered and in fact I later found out that the person I thought was the prosecutor in the courtroom that day was actually the public defender I'm a sophisticated courtroom observer the things he was doing look to prosecutorial to me he was asking the judge to jail people and telling the judge that they hadn't made an effort to pay money and things like that but that was his experience with defense lawyers I later found out when when we sued that his contract provided that he would not get paid unless enough money was collected from guilty pleas public defender wouldn't get paid yet public defender in quotes of course anyway so so Lorenzo said I'm not talking with you unless my pastor gives me permission so I pulled out my phone again again no signs and we called his pastor on speakerphone and luckily for me Harvard Law School had just posted on the internet an announcement of the seed grant award and his pastor read this aloud and he said to Lorenzo this man is an angel sent from God to help you I said no actually I'm not an angel at all I just want to talk to you about what happened to you and maybe try to help and he said listen to this man Lorenzo and so we hung up and he told me his whole story Lorenzo and charnel became my two first clients as a civil rights lawyer we filed a eventually what became a class-action I had really no idea what I was doing I look back on this with with horror a little bit luckily this was before anyone was starting to file any of these lawsuits so the good thing was the other side had no idea how to defend against them so and all I did really was I told their stories I showed the federal judge who was a George W Bush appointed rural former state Republican prosecuting Alabama I showed him Sean Ellis the photograph I showed them the handwritten jailhouse affidavits that show Nell and Lorenzo and the other clients had written and and this was the first time I'd ever done anything like this and it helped me understand for reasons that I'll get into a little bit more later the power of our clients stories and within a few weeks the federal judge had issued a preliminary injunction he was so appalled and outraged at what was going on that he ordered all of the top city officials to appear in front of him in person to explain how it could be that this was happening in Montgomery Alabama in the year 2014 rather than do that the city just released everyone from its jail and imagine what it what you have to think to be to be able on a single day to just release everyone from your Jail imagine the the what what kind of reasons did you have that keep people in the jail if you're able to just release them all in a single day and again a sort of theme in all of this work from the first moments that I started observing these courts is the incredible indifference that everyone working in them displayed to the brutality inherent in putting a human being in a cage so fast forward you know this this was great we then partnered with the Southern Poverty Law Center and a fantastic Harvard Law School graduate from just a few years after me and I'm Sarah's amperian who many of you some of you may know and we met with the city of Montgomery and we designed a whole new Municipal Court system so that they had to follow a number of procedures and and we got rid of their private probation company all kinds of other things and including that if they ever did jail anyone for not paying which was pretty impossible given the procedures we had outlined they'd have to call my cell phone within 12 hours and they haven't called my cell phone in almost three years and so after that happened so I started realizing that this same problem was happening all over the country and while I was involved in the negotiations at the Montgomery Michael Brown was murdered in Ferguson and I read an article about about Ferguson that was written by a great organization which was also partnered with the Institute here at Harvard called arch city defenders and it described obviously everyone was very upset about the the violence against black men in st. Louis and the incredible history of that racially motivated violence in the city but but also there was something else going on and it was the fundamental corruption of the entire law enforcement apparatus of these municipalities so when I I just called these folks and st. Louis and I said I just did a similar case in Montgomery could I come to st. Louis and do something similar and when I arrived in Ferguson during the protests I just sort of embedded myself hung out with protesters started having these little meetings with groups of homeless protesters or in people's houses and that would invite their family and friends we'd get these big groups together and everyone go around and tell their stories it was some of the most devastating stuff I've ever heard you know people talking about being in these jail cells with blood and mucus and feces on the walls no hygiene products for weeks just because they can't afford $100 $150 this cycle of being shuffled to seven eight-nine municipal jails because st. Louis has 81 municipalities 90 minutes pallies in 81 municipal courts and jails so if you drive from the airport downtown st. Louis you could pass through 20 cities each of them has a police force trying to make as much money as they can off tickets so many of my clients had warrants out and seven or eight or nine or ten cities and so our name plaintiff in the Ferguson case eventually every time she left her house she was worried that she'd be arrested every time she was arrested she would be she was been three days in each jurisdiction because they figured out if you don't pay within three days you cost them money so they just send you to the next Jail so what they do is they say in the first day you know four hundred dollars if you can't pay that next day well about three hundred dollars next day but about two hundred dollars and then you get out free extortion racket anyway so I'll never forget another moment during one of those those house meetings someone told me you know she she said I I love my children so much but you know I'm also schizophrenic and every time they would put me in these jails and I would be there for fifteen or sixteen or twenty days they wouldn't give me my medication and I would have these breakdowns and the last time I just I just couldn't take it anymore I couldn't live anymore knowing that every time I went to the grocery store to pick one of my kids up from school I could just be taken away from them for weeks at a time and so when I got to the last Jail last time I tried to strangle myself with my bra and I think about that a lot you know as we've as we've done as Jeff mentioned we subsequently started converting our our fines and fees lawsuits into challenging the American money bail system because one of the next morning after I met that woman actually I was just in downtown st. Louis in a courtroom I saw another young mother who'd been away from her newborn child she just given birth a couple weeks and she was getting a ride somewhere and the police found a burned marijuana cigarette in the ashtray she was charged with marijuana possession she couldn't have paid $200 so she'd been in jail for three weeks and when I saw her in that courtroom the judge said to her I'll let you out today if you plead guilty and take a fine but if you want to fight your case I'll set you for the for three weeks from now I can have a trial and she said but can I get out of jail I says well you have to pay the bail she couldn't pay the bail so she said okay I'm not III don't know what happened in the car wasn't my marijuana but tell me what to say so he walked her through a guilty plea to a crime that she didn't commit to a drug offense she didn't commit because she was so desperate to get back to her kids that was the moment and it was a really painful experience to watch because they had to do it several times because at the key moment where he was trying to get her to say she knowingly possessed it she kept saying I didn't know it was there until finally she said oh you want me to say oh okay yes I knew there was marijuana in my friend's car and now that what this woman has a fine that she owes and she has a criminal record which could affect all kinds of areas of her life forever and I and it was that moment that I realized the urgency of converting our fines and fees cases to challenge the American money bail system which has four hundred fifty thousand human beings in cages at any given night so these stories I could tell many many more of them are all I think very powerful examples of what happens when a legal system becomes desensitized to the brutality that's inflicting every single day so we ended up filing I don't know 20 or so of these lawsuits against money bail systems around the country and the same themes would pop up in every single case the Harris County case that professor steiker mentioned for example there are about a hundred and thirty suicide attempts every year in the Harris County Jail in the five years before we filed our lawsuit 55 human beings died in the Harris County Jail who were being held on a money bail amount they couldn't afford that's one of the reasons that the Harris County sheriff in Harris County DA actually testified for us at the trial the people that are closest to this that actually see the human costs of it some of them with the ones that have enough courage say I can't be a part of this anymore that's the power of stories when you have that human connection that's why I think that when we think in our organization about how to affect change we don't think about it in terms of creating a legal doctrine or you know arguing the the finer distinctions between cases first and foremost we do that stuff because it's important in the existing environment but first and foremost we think about our clients and their stories and every day I get new stories so a friend of mine in Alabama just called me a few days ago they found a man who's been in jail for three years in Alabama on a drug possession charge because he couldn't pay a $500 bail they haven't even tested the drugs yet they don't even know what the drugs were and everyone forgot about this man cuz there's no public defender in this place three years this guy in jail I think that's what happens and that's I've seen it I'm sure you've seen it with your work all around the country that's what happens when the people who are working in the system every single day lose sight of the consequences of their actions on human beings and their bodies we've seen the same thing in San Francisco the same thing in our cases in Chicago this is not a problem that's affecting only Mississippi and Alabama although there was a story yesterday Mississippi that many of you probably heard about the woman who was barred from seeing her four month-old child for 14 months because she couldn't pay court fines and fees that level of indifference to the consequences of our actions at least when they're inflicted on poor people of color is a fundamental defining characteristic of our current existing legal system I think that's an important point to be made we're not talking about a few bad apples or a few bad actors it's a system that is utterly desensitized to the harm that it's inflicting and that's I think for me the main purpose of our work is to tell those stories so when we went to montgomery federal court for that first hearing i'd never done one of those hearings before and i wasn't sure what was gonna happen i was sure that there was gonna be some doctrine that federal courts had concocted to prevent themselves in doing justice that I learned about in fed courts but the other side didn't raise any of those I didn't have to argue all the legal points that was prepared to argue and the judge when he said those words you know I demand that every you know official come before me in person I looked over at my clients and they were they were they were patting each other on the back and they were smiling and they were they were they're very animated and I didn't actually get a chance to see this but I was later told by Sarah the other Harvard Law School lawyer who she was in the audience watching because SPLC had come to watch the hearing and apparently when when Lorenzo walked out of the courtroom he walked he was an older man and walked with a cane when he got to the threshold of the courtroom Sarah held the door for him and he just paused and he looked down at his shoes and he muttered under his breath Wow I never knew I had so much power and that is for me why we do this work it's about using the power of stories and the things that our clients have endured giving them a forum for him to tell his story to a federal judge in an open courtroom it didn't even matter that the only people in the audience were one local journalists and a few lawyers in the Southern Poverty Law Center his his story touched a federal judge who then said it into motion a course of events that changed the entire of city of Montgomery's policies and that by extension now have now really had a huge effect around the country in this area fines and fees and then subsequently money bail that moment where he felt empowered is the kind of thing that we endeavour to do every night every night and so personally I try to think of a story like that from one of my clients in my cases every night before I go to bed to maintain this sense of urgency this idea that I never want to become one of those lawyers who I saw every day in those courtrooms who'd become desensitized to the consequences of what we do and it's what we try to teach our younger lawyers who work with us it's it's the idea that we can't get ourselves out of this problem where our country is caging people at rates that are unprecedented in the recorded history of the modern world it's not gonna happen by talking about saving a few extra dollars right the point that Jeff was making it's not gonna talk about it's not gonna happen with a few legal victories on money bill because Jeff made this point I think very very eloquently unless we address the underlying stuff economic and political and racial history here the structural factors what replaces money bill could be even worse than the current system of money bill it could be a system of no bail detention it could be a system where everyone is on some kind of GPS surveillance that they have to pay for and then get more fines and fees right so we don't think of our work as you know finding little tricky ways to prevail in a legal case with some cool doctrine that we might have learned and in law school or read in a book we think of our cases as a forum for telling a story of a forum for organizing people in the community around that story in a forum for letting them share that story with the public and as lawyers taking a step back sometimes and just being there to help them tell that story and so I think that's all I have to say right now and I think the only thing that I would want to leave you with in addition to that is find those stories for you what inspires you it may not be the criminal law I may not be these particular issues in the criminal law but every day as you live your life try to think what do I feel urgent about how can I live a life of real urgency to create a world where there is a little bit less suffering than the day before and I think if you do that and if you force yourself to do that really hard thing every day it's not always easy to think about this stuff every day but that's what we do when when when there are emergencies and the criminal legal system in this country is an emergency and I think we all have an obligation to undertake that very difficult task of confronting that in an urgent way every single day so thank you for having me and looking forward to so it's instead of coming before him they just agreed to release everyone from the jail and they filed a motion saying that it was unnecessary for them to come before him because the whole problem had been fixed and they were committed to it never happening again [Music] I'll be interested to hear what alec is gonna say about this I started attending storytelling conferences about 15 years ago and I go at least once a year because it is an art and it's an art that is as old it is a racial art and when I say racial I mean human racial if you go back to the caves in France in Alta Mira fourteen thousand year old paintings those were the first opening statements all they were were stories and they're stories about where do you find the animals that we eat what do they look like what does their scat look like and what kind of weapon do you use to kill them and if those stories weren't clear and then tribes starved so storytelling is is that the essence of the way human beings understand the world one of the things that I have talked to some kids here at school and I'm getting myself invited back because one of the things that we do is if there is a three and a half hour presentation that we are having made into a documentary on race in America the true story of our racial history not the one that we all have adopted and so one thing I would say to folks is if you never heard the third verse of the national anthem and anybody in this room has criticized Colin Kaepernick or any NFL player that has protested and ask you to rethink that did you know that Jackie Robinson who we now deify wrote in his autobiography I don't stand for the anthem and I don't salute the flag we deify that man but we forget convened the political stances that people before us have taken so that we can have a narrative that makes us comfortable with the way things are so storytelling is I think I agree with Alec it is going to be at the essence of what turns around the way we view the criminal justice system and I'd be interested to know where you so if you read if you go to our website you read some of our complaints so we've been experimenting a lot since I first started doing this with pushing the boundaries of legal legal writing and legal documents for example our complaint in the Montgomery case or better probably the complaint in the Ferguson case is a good one to read or the complaint in the Tennessee private probation case is maybe my favorite example of this we try to be a little bit more journalistic than normal and to try to tell stories in a different way and then throughout the the case we try to use language very deliberately I was speaking at Yale on a storytelling panel at a conference last year as a joke I actually said if I could I would much prefer to file poems as our briefs in cases and actually I said it as a joke but I actually believe that you can reach people way more effectively by touching them and communicating through that medium and so one of the the main focuses of our work over the last few years has been working with journalists and writers one of our board members is a fantastic poet who's formerly incarcerated when he was a child for many years and he's you know reading his work and thinking a lot about actually was a ACLU intern Duane Betts and I've learned a lot from from poets and and painters and musicians and I there there's a way of reaching people and so we've been we've been working a lot with journalists on various and artists on various projects I've actually had a documentary crew following us around for the last year and a half I don't know whether I'll ever come to anything but the ACLU produced a beautiful video about New Orleans prosecutor case that I encourage everyone to go to the ACLU website and watch there's just something different about watching someone tell her story that you can't get an illegal brief and actually when when Jeff was doing his presentation I saw a photo of Eric garner and I pulled up on my my phone a very very short poem that I intended to read when I was talking because I think if if a jury has read this kind of poem or or if if legal decision-makers engage with this kind of work I think it'd be very very different legal landscape let me just read it's a poem by Ross gay some of you may know because it I think it received some attention last year but it's called a small needful fact a small needful fact a small needful fact is that Eric garner worked for some time for the Parks and Rec horticultural department which means perhaps that with his very large hands perhaps in all likelihood he put gently into the earth some plants which most likely some of them in all likelihood continued to grow continue to do what plants do like house and feed small and necessary creatures like being pleasant to touch and smell like converting sunlight into food like making it easier for us to breathe and I think poems like that you know that make you feel something about it and when you when you I challenge you to watch that I can't breathe video again think about that poem think about his life I think you'll you'll feel a sense of urgency that's just not possible from a legal filing and so we don't have the answers and we're certainly playing around with different ways of doing it but one thing is is for sure and it's we need to find a way of telling a different story about our criminal legal system and until we do that whether we win a couple of cases or not the system is going to reproduce the same set of an justices if you and this these are available online if you go and read the grand jury transcripts of the way that case was presented you will be horrified the case was presented by criminal defense lawyers defending the police the criminal defense lawyers just happened to work for the prosecutor's office and one of the best examples is an expert that the state hired on marijuana because Michael Brown had supposedly been smoking marijuana and they went through about half an hour of testimony and he gave all the statistics and yes the blood was tested and he definitely had marijuana in his system and the state's very happy and then the expert without being asked a question just happened to throw in I got to tell you there are not many people that are smoking marijuana that are going out starting fights with police officers the prosecutors went this will be the one f-bomb bat crazy they attacked this expert because the narrative that he had inserted into the case was not the narrative they were looking for what I think is much more I should I shouldn't say it that way what I think is equally important is not the criminal justice maneuvers that went into deciding whether to prosecute that police officer it's all the other things they found in the city of Ferguson that were going on the email traffic between clerks talking about black defendants like animals the email traffic between police officers exactly what alec was talking about in terms of being completely desensitized to the kind of physical and emotional violence that's being inflicted on folks and I will say this isn't just my view I will say it's easier to do when the people are black and brown because America has been used to that we have been desensitized to that for our entire existence as Americans which is one of the reasons why I think it is critical in our storytelling to go back to how did we get here in 2017 and when people are confronted with those facts I think there is the opportunity for what I'll refer to as cognitive dissonance I think people when they saw the picture in 1955 of the young man who was killed and beaten and burned Emmett Till I believe that on that Sunday morning white America woke up looked at their newspapers and they said something like this I know those colored people are frosting are causing a problem but I didn't sign up for this and it's that moment of I didn't sign up for this where a federal judge may say get the people here in front of me because I'm sick of this I I now have to look at this I've had a Naked Lunch moment with what this really is and it's the power of those stories that will make federal judges write opinions that other people can rely on I mean so on the oh okay I was that you're not good you're not gonna want to hear my first answer which was abolishing all jails and police forces but so I do think that is realistic by the way if we adopt the right attitude I think a truly just society would have no need for those things I think we create a need for those things because we have to try to keep our society extraordinarily unequal in a lot of ways and it's just not a natural state of things for people but I take your question it's wanting something a little bit more practical I think what we're shooting for in the short term until we can address bigger things like capitalism and racism more generally is eradicating the notion that anyone should be kept in a jail cell because she can't make a payment so the decision about whether or not to put someone in a jail cell has to be made based on other legitimate compelling reasons and in our legal system yeah this is another fact of our legal system which is that understand because they can't see you we we already have pretty good laws we already actually have laws that say if you want to detain someone prior to trial you have to have a compelling interest and you can only do it when you make a finding that no other condition or combination of conditions would short of completely incapacitating the person would meet the government's compelling interest so yeah so that I think is the constitutional standard that's certainly what we're arguing and what Massachusetts Supreme Court just held for example is the constitutional standard and what I think every court that's ever been presented with that question will has held and will continue to hold so what I think will end up happening is a system of preventive detention where and I think our task is to limit the types of offenses which are eligible for enough attention to - just as narrower categories we can get so only the most serious of offenses are even eligible for presumptively innocent people to be kept in jail prior to trial I think we're like if if the current reform efforts of the ACLU and us and others are successful I think we'll see states moving toward a model we're extremely serious violent offenses are eligible for attention but only after really rigorous procedures and findings are made so no longer will people be kept in jail on this sort of assembly line money based system nobody charged with lower-level offense is gonna be kept in jail prior to trial the plea bargaining assembly line will be ended this is the sort of optimistic realistic answer and pretrial detention would be reserved for only those rare instances a few percentage points so in DC for example the pretrial release rate is 94% in Harris County 40% of and that's all felonies all cases in DC where I live and they don't use money bail anymore the with some very limited exceptions that aren't relevant to your question I don't think Harris County for example detains 40% of all misdemeanor defendants so I think we're gonna see is is in Nashville in Davidson County detain 60% of all misdemeanor criminal offense I think what we'll see is dramatic reduction in the detention of misdemeanors and low-level felonies and then a replacement of the existing money bail system with one a preventive detention for the most serious criminal offenses and then the real battleground as I mentioned during my talk is going to be the the supervision industrial complex that that develops to supervise all the people that are now being released and that's what's very worrisome you know what is a GPS monitoring drug testing our people to be charged money for all these things like that currently are in most places I think the real battle is gonna be as the technological advancements happen and more and more people stop using cash bail we're gonna see the private prisons the private probation companies that bail bond industry is going to shift its business model to supervising people rather than being bail bond agents do you want to jump in yeah I just want to say I this is incredibly dangerous what we're talking about you are talking about a surveillance state where people are walking along with GPS monitors when they're checking on probation officers three or four times a week and they're doing it as opposed to having $1,500 of bail $1500 how dangerous is a person gonna be if they can get out of jail for $1,500 so you're not talking about dangerousness you're not talking about somebody getting hurt you're not even talking about risk of flight because how many poor black and brown people have the resources to run folks aren't going anywhere so I think we have been raised on a narrative that know this whole bail and and all of this surveillance of people is really necessary to keep us safe and part of what I'm suggesting is this is a false narrative that we have swallowed whole I've swallowed it too I mean I'm not blaming anybody this is a problem for all of us all of us have swallowed this but I believe what we cannot do is to turn the bail system into a money-making system for private corporations and these corporations are already the private prison corporations they are already buying up private corporation companies they are getting ready for the ankle monitors because there's money to be made so I just think this is a critical thing and I agree with Alec probably the real game is gonna be what kind of detention are we gonna have for people who are charged or accused of violent or serious felonies and what are we gonna replace money bail with in my view you let people out of jail and ask them to come back then you're not gonna have a woman having to go through a guilty plea colloquy three or four times before she finally gets it right what am I supposed to say because she's not gonna have to go to jail or wait for a trial she's gonna go home and if you think that innocent people don't plead guilty to crimes that they haven't committed I am here to tell you you are wrong and I have three six years of working in this system - no you are wrong and the thing I will tell you is this is also from Naked Lunch wouldn't you and the answer is yes you would I guarantee you every person in this room would plead guilty to a crime you did not commit if I put you in the circumstances of the people Alec is talking about every single person in this room so I want to make sure that as we're talking about these reforms we don't end up creating something that 20 years from now Alec is going to be my age and somebody younger than him will be sitting here talking about well now we've got to try and fix it some other way what I can tell you is I got interested in what our history was and some of that was personal with things going on in my life and my family and I started to read and every single thing that I showed you today is open for anybody to find and I am making the ACLU chapter of our Virg Law School bring me back up here because I've got three and a half hours of stuff I have learned over the past seven years I just spent three and a half hours speaking to a group in Mississippi yesterday and a guy came up to me at the beginning saying three and a half hours really you're gonna talk about this for that long and I said yeah I am and at the end of it he said I guess now I know why this is available to all of us it is just that we have been blind to it and we have been blind to it because nobody teaches it none of us got taught this in school your children are not being taught this in school and so I think it is incredibly important for us to go and do the looking for ourselves and then have and be able to present that for people to actually think about in a positive way I don't have nearly enough time to state all my views on this topic which I think I've been extensively documented I will say and I want to preface my comments because I sometimes have been called to harsh about this I don't think the people that work at corporate law firms are bad people I think that particular decision in their life is a decision that I think is morally wrong but I think that good people do morally wrong things all the time and our task in the world is to try to convince our friends and our family when we all each of us we all make mistakes I want my friends and family to tell me hey I think you're doing something wrong and here's why I think as far as your two reasons that are offered I mean making money to pay off loans would never in any other circumstance be a justification for doing something that is morally wrong so in the last panel someone asked a similar question I gave the example if someone told you I'll give you $150,000 to pay off your loan and all you have to do is walk across the street and beat somebody up for it I would I would I wouldn't do it and neither would they because they think beating somebody up is wrong so if you believe that helping corporations create a more unequal Society which leads to poverty and suffering and terrible environmental consequences terrible Court home foreclosures all of the work that they've done to our tax system all of the work they do for military industrial complex and corporate banks if you believe all of that stuff is making our society worse it's not an excuse to do it to make money to pay off your loans and you wouldn't yourself think of as excuse if the harm was right in front of you and direct like being told to beat somebody up and I think that the the reason that it's become normalized is that so many of our peers do it that we stop it to be kind of like washing the judge in the courtroom every day if you do something enough times and it's happening every single day you become desensitized to it you start to think it's normal it's not normal to use this incredible gift that you've been given with this intellect in this in this is education you're getting and the energy that you have every single day it's not normal to use that to help their wealthiest people in our society increase the gap between the rich and the poor that's just my personal view and I have many friends in corporate law firms and certainly all of you funding our nonprofit organization have made a lot of money through that system I don't think they're bad people I think that particular choice is a really harmful one and the reasons that are offered by Harvard Law School students don't hold water I think I'll be much more persuasive to me if they just said I want to make money because I'm I'm just being selfish about this one it's also just similarly not true that they're getting the kind of skills every corporate law firm calls me I get corporate law firm calls every single day and they say to me we really need to get our associates experience and skills can we pro bono partner with you because they're not getting those skills in their document review litigation cases so I think that doing Public Interest work instead of corporate interests work is a way of getting skills doing something with your precious time on earth that you find meaningful and valuable it doesn't have to be public and just legal work it could be teaching it could be any number of professions where it could be playing an instrument I mean do something that you find is is really meaningful and there's so few people including not one of my colleagues who I've done a survey ten years after I wrote this article called the human lawyer when I was leaving here about this question I did a survey of my corporate law friends not a single one told me they found their day-to-day work to be morally meaningful so several of them said that they appreciated the financial flexibility it gave them and their children and their families and that was very important to them but not a single one thought that they were doing morally good things with their work and so I think that we we should all just think like what kind of life do I want to live don't want to live a life that's consist of my moral values and I think if you ask yourself that question you probably won't be saying things like I need to go to corporate law firm to learn litigation skills I know we're out of time but I have a different perspective because I've been out of law school for 36 years it took me 23 years to pay off my law school loans because I couldn't pay very much because the kind of practice I did didn't make me a lot of money it's the best loan I ever took out in my entire life and it took 23 years to pay off I live comfortably I can go to the movies I can travel and take a vacation there's you know pretty much anything I want to do I can do but I'm not rich but I wouldn't trade what I do and the work that I do for any amount of money and one of the things I saw in my private practice were people some of my clients were unbelievably wealthy and it was very clear to me that wealth will not make you happy so I would ask people just to think about that and to think about it for the first year second year and third year students here to think about not what's gonna happen in the next five years or the next seven years where are you gonna be in 25 years this is this is like a journey it's not about getting it all right now or by the time you're five years out you have your home you have your car you have your this that or whatever a course over your life is important to think about and one thing I would tell them is I am really really happy I am financially secure and I wouldn't trade the work I've done for anything that's what they should think about so this was a very fitting end for the bicentennial celebration because the the the goals of Harvard Law School and that we've touted in the Bicentennial is may make people think and inspire and the two of you have done that today you've made us think and you have inspired us and Jeff I'm gonna disagree with you you said you're not rich I think both of you are very rich thank you very much [Applause]
