  RECENTLY THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF STORIES TALKING ABOUT HOW DONALD TRUMP IS MENTALLY UNSTABLE, AND THEY COME ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM REPUBLICANS WHO WORK WITH HIM, WHETHER THEY ARE REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE LIKE BOB CORKER SAYING HE COULD START WORLD WAR III, THAT THEY ARE RUNNING AN ADULT DAY CARE CENTER AT THE WHITE HOUSE, AND THAT HE COULD DRIVE OFF THE ROAD AT ANY MINUTE. IT ALSO COMES FROM REPUBLICANS INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE. REMEMBER, YOU DON'T MAKE IT IN THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE UNLESS YOU ARE DEEPLY, DEEPLY RIGHT WING. SO THESE CONSERVATIVES ARE ALSO SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS GOING, I DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT KNOWS WHAT HE IS DOING. THE REASON REX TILLERSON APPARENTLY CALLED HIM A MORON IS BECAUSE HE ASKED WHY DON'T WE JUST HAVE 10 TIMES AS MANY NUKES? AND NOT JUST AS A THROWAWAY QUESTION, HE ORDERED IT. AND OBVIOUSLY THEY IGNORED HIS ORDER, BECAUSE THAT WOULD COST AT A MINIMUM TENS OF TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS, AND THE ONE FACILITY WE HAVE IN NEW MEXICO THAT MAKES NUKES, IT WOULD TAKE THEM 350 YEARS TO DO WHAT HE ASKED. BUT HE DIDN'T ASK HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE OR HOW MUCH IT COST, BECAUSE HE'S NOT MENTALLY FIT FOR OFFICE. HE NEVER HAS BEEN. BUT I THINK I KNOW HOW THEY ARE GOING TO GET HIM OUT, HOW HE WILL LEAVE, AND WHAT THE EXCUSE THEY WILL USE IS. I'M NOT THE FIRST GUY TO SAY IT, THE FIRST GUY TO SAY IT IS ONE OF HIS CLOSEST CONFIDANTS OF ALL TIME, THAT'S ROGER STONE. IN MID-MAY HE WAS THE FIRST TO SUGGEST THIS. THEY WILL CLAIM THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS ALZHEIMER'S, AND THAT IT IS PROGRESSIVE, AND THAT IT'S PROGRESSING AND THAT IS THE SOURCE OF HIS INSANITY. THIS IS THE GAME PLAN. WATCH CAREFULLY, YOU WILL SEE THE WORD ALZHEIMER'S MORE AND MORE IN THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. HE'S THE ONE WHO PLANTED THAT IDEA IN THE FIRST PLACE, AND I REMARKED AT THE TIME THAT THAT WAS QUITE REMARKABLE. WHY WOULD HIS CONFIDANT SAY THAT? WELL, ONE OF THE REASONS IS THAT IT COULD BE USED AS A DEFENSE IF YOU WERE CAUGHT HAVING DONE SOMETHING CRIMINAL, SERIOUSLY CRIMINAL, WITH PERHAPS A FOREIGN COUNTRY. THAT IS WHY ONE OF HIS ADVISORS AND FRIENDS AND ALLIES MIGHT SAY THAT. NOW I THINK THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT FACTORS HERE. ONE IS THE REPUBLICANS WHO COULD REMOVE HIM USING EITHER THE 25TH AMENDMENT OR IMPEACHMENT, AND THAT DEPENDS, IF THEY THINK HE'S UNSTABLE ENOUGH, AND NOW THE VANITY FAIR STORY THAT SAYS MANY IN THE CABINET ARE THINKING DO WE TACKLE HIM IF HE ORDERS A NUCLEAR STRIKE? THE 25TH AMENDMENT SAYS YOU ARE MENTALLY UNFIT. THE OTHER AVENUE IS IF ROBERT MUELLER FINDS OUT THAT IF HE DID COMMIT A CRIME WITH THE RUSSIANS, IT COULD LEAD TO IMPEACHMENT. I'VE SAID THIS THROUGHOUT, IT WON'T LEAD TO IMPEACHMENT, HIS EGO IS FAR TOO FRAGILE FOR HIM TO GET IMPEACHED, HE WOULD NEVER RISK IT, HE WOULD RUN FOR THE HILLS. NOW, A RESIGNATION IS ALSO DEEPLY EMBARRASSING, AND HENCE THE ALZHEIMER'S THEORY. FIRST LET ME BE CLEAR, I HAVE TOLD YOU ABOUT DIFFERENT PARTS OF THIS THROUGHOUT, NOW I THINK IT'S OVER. AND I'M GOING TO POUND THE GAVEL. [GAVEL SOUND] TRUMP WILL DEFINITELY NOT FINISH HIS FIRST TERM. HE IS TOO UNSTABLE FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AND FOR THE REPUBLICANS AND PEOPLE INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE TO LET HIM KEEP GOING. SO HOW WILL THEY GET HIM OUT? THOSE TWO AVENUES I'VE TOLD YOU ARE TOO EMBARRASSING, IMPEACHMENT AND THE 25TH AMENDMENT. WHAT IS PERFECT IS IF THEY SAY ALZHEIMER'S. WHY? BY THE WAY, WHETHER HE HAS IT OR HE DOESN'T, IT DOESN'T MATTER. THREE REASONS WHY. ONE, IT ALLOWS FOR A GRACEFUL EXIT THAT EVOKES SYMPATHY. PEOPLE GO, POOR DONALD TRUMP. HE WAS GREAT, HE WAS GOING TO BE A GREAT LEADER, THEN A BAD TURN OF EVENTS, BAD HEALTH. WHAT CAN YOU DO? AND HE HAD GREAT HEALTH BEFORE, HE DID. NOW ALZHEIMER'S, IT HAPPENS TO EVERYONE. THEN THERE WILL BE ENDLESS STORIES IN THE PRESS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HAD ALZHEIMER'S, TEARJERKING STORIES ABOUT WILL HE BE ALL RIGHT, AND THE VALOR HE HAD IN STEPPING DOWN FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY. BECAUSE HE CAN'T BE EMBARRASSED. NUMBER TWO, IT'S AN EXCUSE NOT TO PROSECUTE. WHY WON'T THEY WANT TO PROSECUTE? THE SAME REASON HE DIDN'T WANT TO PROSECUTE NEXT AND, THE SAME REASON WE DIDN'T EVEN TALK ABOUT THE BUSH/CHENEY VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW WHEN IT COMES TO WARRANTLESS WIRETAPPING, IT'S EMBARRASSING FOR THE COUNTRY, YOU WANT TO COVER IT UP. SO THE PEOPLE IN POWER, ESPECIALLY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WON'T WANT TO PROSECUTE IF MUELLER FINDS ANYTHING. SO THE DEAL IS, LOOK, HE WILL STEP DOWN, BUT DON'T EMBARRASS THE WHOLE COUNTRY, AND ESPECIALLY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, BY PROSECUTING A SITTING PRESIDENT. BUT HOW IS HE GOING TO STEP DOWN? ALZHEIMER'S. NUMBER THREE, IT'S A TIDY EXPLANATION FOR HIS ERRATIC BEHAVIOR. THE REALITY IS HE'S BEEN ERRATIC HIS ENTIRE LIFE, HE'S BEEN AN ABSOLUTE FOOL HIS ENTIRE LIFE, HE'S BANKRUPTED SIX COMPANIES -- HE COULDN'T FIND A WAY TO MAKE MONEY IN CASINOS. YOU GO THROUGH ALL OF HIS DIFFERENT COMMENTS THROUGHOUT ALL THE YEARS, HE'S NEVER HAD A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF ANY OF THE ISSUES. HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES, HE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY, DOMESTIC POLICY -- JUST TODAY HE SAID IF THE STOCK MARKET IS GOING UP I GUESS OUR DEBT IS GOING DOWN. NO, THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS. BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW ANYTHING WORKS. HE THINKS NOBODY KNEW HEALTHCARE WAS COMPLICATED. HE HAD NEVER PUT ANY THOUGHT INTO THE CRITICAL ISSUE OF NORTH KOREA UNTIL HE WAS PRESIDENT, AND THEN THE CHINESE LEADER HAD TO EXPLAIN IT TO HIM AND HE TOOK THAT AT FACE VALUE. HE HAS NO CAPACITY, AND NEVER HAS, TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. BUT NOW IT'S NOT JUST DEMOCRATS OR INDEPENDENTS OR PROGRESSIVES OR MODERATES THAT RECOGNIZE THAT, IT'S REPUBLICANS WHO RECOGNIZE THAT. THEY HAVE TO GET HIM OUT BECAUSE HE'S A DANGER. THEY WILL SAY IT WAS ALZHEIMER'S, AND THEN EVERYONE IN POWER WILL UNIVERSALLY AGREE, POOR DONALD TRUMP. SO THAT WE CAN GET HIM OUT OF OFFICE AND GET SOMEONE STABLE IN. THAT IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN, MARK MY WORDS, AND I WILL SEE YOU LATER WHEN IT HAPPENS AND YOU ARE WATCHING THIS.
