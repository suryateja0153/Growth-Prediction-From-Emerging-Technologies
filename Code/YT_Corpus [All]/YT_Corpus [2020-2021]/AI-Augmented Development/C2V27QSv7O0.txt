 Over the last century, we got moved from plain X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs to what we think will be the final frontier, which is a mixed reality. My name is Osamah Choudhry. I'm a Neurosurgeon and one of the Co-Founders of Medivis.  I'm Chris Morley, Co-Founder. I'm a Radiologists by training. On the radiology side, we're really interested in CT guided procedures. A recent study on ablation showed the average error rate in the placement of the catheter to that position in three-dimensional coordinate space was 2.2 centimeters. That was in spite of using 10 CT scans over the course of the 2.5 hour procedure. With Surgical AR and HoloLens, we can potentially scan the patient just once and place the catheter with millimeter accuracy at a fresh all of the time.  Some of my favorite cases to do using the technology is what we call cerebrovascular bypass procedures. One blood vessel or a part of the brain isn't getting enough blood supply. So you route in another blood vessel and stitch it in using the finest sutures possible. Before, we were using ultrasound technology to find where that blood vessel was. But here, we can take a CT scan of a patient and overlay it directly onto them. At least 200 operations have now been performed using this technology.  So that's what really excites us when we can do some of these routine procedures in just an inherently superior way. So we can get our patients in and out of the operating room and safely back to their families.  I can explain to you how fortunate we are as clinicians to be alive when this technology's available. This is the work of science fiction.
