 hey guys and welcome back so today I'm going to show you how you can create your own glass holograms in a series called Project Smart Glass so in this series we're not only going to be creating these really cool holograms but we're also gonna try and fuse Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision into the mix to create some really cool applications so Ritz, why are you doing this? can't you just do your normal vuforia tutorials? hmm.. Well how about no.. so I want to try something a bit different something that has not been done quite that often I want to test what would happen if we lived in a world where transparent displays were a reality what would we do with these glasses plays and how would they be different from the devices we already own today? what type of experiences would transparent displays allow as we approach the future? so these are the types of questions that I intend to answer in this tutorial series so subscribe and click the bell icon if you have an order to learn more So currently, transparent screens do exist in a form of transparent OLED TV’s from LG but those are waaay too expensive for us to experiment with There are currently transparent LCD’s, but their reflectance values are way to high that you end up with a really dark view After doing a lot of web prowling, I’v concluded that the best and cheapest way to enable this experience is by means of a projector and a transparent projector film so how it works is that when light shines from a projector onto a glass the light shines right through the medium and this is because the optical transmittance of the glass is very high now to maintain the transparency of the glass while still being able to view the image we place a projective film on the glass which reduces the transmittance so the image is displayed on the glass Rather than passing right through it so the projector form that I have bought of Amazon Has a Visible Light Transmission or VLT of 89% meaning that 89% of the light from the projector is passed right through the film and the 11% is captured by the film for display The lower the VLT, the better the image will appear on the film but the darker tint will appear, mean you will have less transparency From my tests a VLT of 89% works really well for the effects we are going to create So, if you’d like to learn how to build your own glass hologram then let’s get right into it in this tutorial! Before we get started please don’t forget to Watch till the end to find out about how you can win one of 20 free enrolments to the course of your choice including this one And, if you like this video, please give it a thumbs up comment down below if you have any questions or any suggestions for future videos Subscribe so you get notified when the next AI/AR tutorial is out Feel free to share this video with any of your friends if think it will be helpful So, let’s get right into in – Roll Intro! So the full series Project Smart Glass course will be available as a standalone course So the full series Project Smart Glass course will be available as a standalone course So, the 3 most advanced Phases of this project will NOT be available on Youtube but will be exclusive to course on Augmented Startups The links are all down below If you are interested in Artificial Intelligence in Computer Vision we have a course that teaches you AI object detection, object segmentation, pose estimation, Android AI app development along with the complete Project EDITH tutorial Series and Project Smart Glass Okay so if you are ready to get started with Project Smart Glass! Okay, so for you to get started you will need a couple of items for the project Over here is the Bill of Materials spreadsheet that I have created on GitHub – Project Smart Glass- phase 1 Links will be in the description Bill of Materials So a couple of things you will need, are the glass which can also be acrylic The project, I am using the LG PH150B you can use any projector you want. I went with a project that had a high contrast ratio to ensure that the black dark pixels not projected onto the film Also, the higher Lux or lumens the better Next we need the projection film, the one I got is from HOHO films And now I must warn you, this film is not great quality and I only bought it because at the time I could not find any other projection film on amazon I recommend finding other tinted films because this one comes creased and filmed with bubbles which may hinder your experience I recommend you also try a matt screen protector For the size you are looking for the iPad pro 12.9 inch matt screen protector might work But, I have not tested it on my side yet Next we will need the stands to hold up the projector and glass For this a pair of tripods with a swivel head will do this trick And lastly an HDMI cable that is long enough to connect to your PC Putting it together So, setting up is quite easy. We just need to attach the tripods to projector connect up your HDMI cable from you PC to the Projector On the second tripod, paste the Film on the acrylic or glass, try your best to minimize bubbles and creases I clearly failed at this.. lol Attached the metal plate to the bottom of the glass and mount it on the magnetic tripod mount Now all you have to do now is align your projector beam with the screen Now to get the best image, it best to shine the projector down and aim it towards your eyes with direct line of sight I found this to work best to produce the brightest image You can experiment with different angles to see what works best for you Visuals Now this phase we are not going to do any AI or coding, we’ll continue that in the next phase For now, we are just going to display a demo video from Youtube And this is where you find a wide variety of these hologram videos To show it up on our screen, the projected glass display is shown as a second screen that we can set windows to either extend or duplicate If you play the video full screen, focus the video and... voila! we are able to view a sort of a holographic effect on a glass display Phase 1, Now this effect is pretty much static and we can’t do much with it except for admire various demo videos So in Phase 2, we are going to be using AI face detection in Unity to control a 3D model to create a parallax hologram which is essentially a holographic illusion created by perspective shifting Phase 3, We will be using the leap motion for hand detection we will see how we can harmonize the transparent display with natural interaction Phase 4 Will be using object detection. Phase 5 Will be on enhance object detection but using Mask RCNN Phase 6 Pose estimation Phase 7 & 8  Will be bonus projects of project Smart glass which will be revealed closed the later phases of this project And, if you like this video, please give it a thumbs up comment down below if you have any questions or any suggestions for future videos Subscribe so you get notified when the next AI/AR tutorial is out Feel free to share this video with any of your friends if think it will be helpful Okay, so earlier I mentioned that if you are interested in winning one of 20 free enrolments to any augmented Startups courses then all you have to do is like and comment on this video and sign up to the webinar at the link below Winners are announced every 3 months You can comment about anything, or provide suggests for upcoming video and ideas as I’v mentioned earlier Alright, that is it from me, thank you for watching and we’ll see you in the next lecture
