 [Music] welcome to assistant on-air or we have conversations of people that built for Google assistant I'm Jessica and I'll be your host today today we'll be chatting with Alan who is a Google developer expert for Google assistant welcome Alan great to be here so Alan tell me a little bit more about you so I am a developer Mike during my day job I helped my clients understand new technology where they're going with it best ways to use it and where what to do with that and I'm also a Google developer expert so I help other developers understand the technology understand how to develop for it and bring it into their applications that their needs their communities that's awesome that's awesome and you've been a GTE for a very long time and yes but would love to learn more about your experiences but before assisting specifically about your experiences with glass yeah so we've had glass now for six years it was first introduced in 2012 at i/o then and in 2013 we as developers first got our hands on it and first really started experimenting and playing with the potential that a new form factor and a new integration mode could bring us glass was very much the forerunner of the assistant yeah many of the the concepts that we have in the assistant today you know the the invocation trigger phrase for glass it was okay glass you know we've seen how that's evolved the interaction with glass again very similar to what we have today a lot of voice driven commands a lot of audio responses video where it was appropriate and where it's useful but largely a ambient computing notion yeah so there's this notion that we are using our computers using our technology while still engaging with the world around us and that was a very important concept for class yeah definitely so what are the concepts or lessons learned from development home glass that you think translate to voice into the system I think the biggest is this notion of ambient computing that we need to be careful how we're designing our technology how we're designing our interaction because people are doing things beyond the the machine itself yeah you know so we've in the past we've had a notion of being behind our terminals or being behind a video screen or being behind a mobile device and now with ambient computing with glass with the assistant with similar technologies we are using our computers in the kitchen we're using in the living room our computers are there but they're not the focus anymore our lives are the focus and the assistant is there to help us live our lives yeah it definitely reminds me of like 1970 sci-fi TV shows or movies where you know things are happening in the show and you just talk to the computer and things magically happen you it feels that way it does feel like we're living in that kind of a future doesn't it I almost think that we've got something even more powerful than we envisioned in those TV shows and movies a lot of those were very non conversational very synthetic very very rough and not very personal no they were you know the the assistant is truly a personal assistant and I think increasingly we're going to be giving it our personal information and trusting and with our personal information because what we get in response is very personal very personalized information and very personal way that it reacts and works with us we didn't see that in TV show just do think and more even just yeah it was just a statement do it and that's it and that wasn't like it was that was helpful no it was a way yeah I think that's a great focus about the assistant is it's really focused on you it is it is literally your assistant mm-hmm so Alan if we had if we could look into the future and you know we didn't have any constraints on technology or any of that what do you think would be the cool thing or what would you want it to see in the future when it comes to the way people interact with technology I always like to think about how we kind of the same is what I've said how we are taking the notion of interacting with things on a very personal level so how do I talk to my documents how do I talk to my car how do I talked to my spreadsheet how do I talk to my shopping list what does that feel like to say what does it mean when I talk about talking to a document yeah what doesn't mean I don't know and in some ways that's what I'd like to explore what I want to help other people explore because I want all of us to lend our own perspectives to what that means and let's figure it out when I started with glass we had certain notions about what it would mean mm-hm and we've learned since then we've figured some things out we have other things that we haven't figured out yet yeah the whole like customization or like how you would talk to a document just makes me think about how we interact just with technology currently my terminal and my text editors are set up differently I'm sure yours will so I wonder even the way you talk to your document might be a little different than the way I talk to my doctor I imagine it wouldn't be and I think the great thing about a personal assistant is that it would learn what our habits are what we mean when we ask for something and that would be very different than how you do it that creates a great deal of power you know we talk about personal computers we used to be big things that sat on our desk yeah and then we thought about it well the phone is the ultimate personal computer and I don't think that's true I think the assistant is is really the next generation of what a personal computer what personal technology really is well Allen thank you so much for chatting with us really appreciate it thank you for having me it's been a pleasure so we hope that you'd like today's show and if you have any suggestions for future episodes please leave a comment below and follow us on Twitter so you get updates into the new episodes I've been Jessica chat
