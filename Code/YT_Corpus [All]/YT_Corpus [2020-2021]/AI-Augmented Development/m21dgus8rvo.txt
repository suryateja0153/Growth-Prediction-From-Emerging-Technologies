 [Music] how are you getting information out of your current system do you have to go to multiple sources to pull that information together and is your system able to proactively provide you with the information that you need for decision-making purposes Oracle HCM cloud is intelligent in that it provides you with the tools that you need see seamlessly embedded into the processes in places where decision-making occurs we want to enable you to embed analytics and meaningful locations we want to provide your users with actionable dashboards as well as tools to proactively give the users information they need like suggested learning as well as notifying managers of predicted flight risks let's take a look at what that looks like within the system for an HR administrator like Kurtis we want to make sure that he's able to easily access all the information that he needs so we want to provide him with a rich and robust set of tools that start from being as simple as using the search bar to find information or the people that he might need so by using these various search tools throughout the product you can quickly find the answers to your questions whether it's looking for a specific person or using something like synonyms to easily take Kurtis to the part of the system that would help him with issues relative to pay in addition to the search tools that Kurtis has available to find the information that he needs we also can include for your HR administrators and your executives access to key performance indicators or what oracle calls info let's write on his dashboard so as I scroll down we'll see that he has analytics that are important to him and his role but he's able to monitor very visually engaging so he's able to see trending information and he can easily drill into any of these KPIs to get additional information on something like the number of absences within the organization the aim is to give your user that high-level information that they may need in order to determine what needs additional drill down details so now we've taken Kurtis from a high-level view of some trending information about absences taken into a more detailed dashboard with the ability to drill down into even more granular details relative to absence management not only is it important to be able to query and run the reports that you need to answer questions as they may arrive but we want the system to be able to provide you with predictive information to help you understand trends and things that might need to proactively be addressed here we're looking at Robert Jackman's dashboard he's an executive within our organization and he's able to look at for his specific direct reports some workforce predictions this particular tool is embedded with hundreds of algorithms to monitor employee satisfaction as well as implement our employee history type information in order to be able to tell Robert not only who his high performers are but also to indicate areas where a high performer might be at also a high risk of loss here we're looking at one of his direct reports a guy and the algorithms are able to tell him that not only is guys predicted performance in the future to be at a very high level but also based on his employee history he's at a high risk of loss when we go in to look at those prediction details the system then details from highest to lowest what really makes up those predictions and so here we're able to see that it's been not only a significant amount of time since he received his last increase but that his last salary increase was less than a percent it also highlights the length of time since his last promotion now with that information in mind Robert is able to use the tool also to put together a plan of action to correct this situation so with the what-if analysis tool Robert can model what a 40.4% increase would do to his level of satisfaction we'll see that it is now moved in the right direction the likelihood of someone like guy leaving based on this new proposal has now decreased we can say that to his employee plan or you just keep it as you know a what-if tool to kind of model future actions but it's providing someone like Robert with those predictive analytics to understand his direct workforce and to move his employee satisfaction levels in the right direction Oracle HCM cloud intelligence also extends to helping monitor for fraudulent activities security breaches as well as conflicts and governance issues here we're at the dashboard for Gretchen our chief human resource officer and she's able to have delivered to her dashboard warnings or potential security issues that she needs to resolve she can see from her things to finish area that she's been warned about a potential conflict and the roles assigned to a particular employee that is driven by the Oracle HCM advanced controls monitoring for those different types of security issues governance issues and looking for different types of fraudulent type actions with Oracle's intelligent HCM cloud we want to provide you with one unified platform for analytics that provide you with a 360-degree view across all of your data delivering what you need when you need it where you need it you [Music]
