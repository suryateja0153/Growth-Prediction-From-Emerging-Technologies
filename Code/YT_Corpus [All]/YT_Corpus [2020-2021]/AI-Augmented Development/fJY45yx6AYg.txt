 hi welcome to the session build virtual reality with JavaScript I'm super excited to be here with you talking about one of my favorite things virtual reality and mixed reality so I'm Cassie and I am a cloud developer advocate at Microsoft I actually focused on AI and XR and my backgrounds is a full stack ton a software engineer but I really just love to play with different text or with a different tech I should say ok so first let's go over the agenda the other thing I want to point out I was looking at the chat and I saw people calling out from where they're from which is just so cool I think this global event is really amazing and I stopped someone say they're from Minnesota I am also from Minnesota so that's really cool so thanks for getting up really early with me because it's 5:00 a.m. here so it's pretty amazing alright so here's our agenda for today the first thing we're gonna do is just talk about the quick basics of a website I'm gonna go over that really quick but in case there's people on the call that haven't built a website before I want to make sure you understand some of the technology that we're going to be going through then we're gonna talk about what what VR is and VR and spatial computing talk about some different tools that we can use so we're gonna be talking about Babylon Jas but there's other tools that you can use to build virtual reality experiences as well and then we're gonna go into some demos on how to build the game so just some housekeeping here there is a code of conduct please be kind to each other we're here to learn and have fun and so let's keep it positive in the chat um so what is HTML HTML is a markup language for browsers and if you take a look at the left here those are different HTML tags and on the right that is how it renders in a browser javascript is a programming language that makes web sites dynamic it's rendered by your browser and it helps with these static elements of HTML and CSS and CSS creates the style that's applied to a website so when you put all that stuff together that's how you build a website okay so now let's jump into what spatial computing is it may be a term that you haven't heard before but it's new an elevated world interaction using the space around us to interface with a computer and that is virtual reality and augmented reality and then there are some other device so if you think about anytime you're interacting with tech and using the space that's considered spatial computing and so what is VR VR is a completely virtualized world you put on a headset and I'm sure many people on this call have tried it you put on a headset you get to go into a completely new computer-generated world and web VR which you may not know you can create websites with what VR which is under websites that are VR which I just think is so cool and then you may have used things like steam as a gaming platform where you download a client and then run that on your headset to play VR so that has a heavier client they're usually bigger games where with web PR you just go to the browser and jump in the game I was I think it's interesting to think about the history of where we are beyond has a very interesting history I'm not gonna go through the whole thing but the first thing I want to point out is that VI works because of stereoscopic vision which was invented in 1838 so if you really think about it like VR started in 1838 we just think it's super cool and so how stereoscopic vision works is you actually get two images almost identical czar slightly different isolated you're right in your left eye and then when your brain puts those two images together it tricks it into seeing 3d so that's how VR headsets work when you put that on that's how it's actually tricking your vamp brain to see a 3d object that's called stereoscopic vision so let's talk about some different tools that you can use to build VR experiences so we're gonna be doing web XR with JavaScript and we're gonna be using Babylon j/s you can also do augmented reality augmented reality with a rjs there's other SSR libraries out there for JavaScript as well if you want to go more the unity or unreal those are different gaming engines that allowing you to build with c-sharp or C++ and then there's different tools within those like Mr TK which is a library of objects in order to create better experiences and quickly build and then blueprints in unreal so we're gonna focus on Babylon Jas but I wanted to point out some of the other technologies that are available to start building VR experiences so what is Babylon Jas this is our library to create 3d games it's using what's called WebGL which is what's allows us to access the GPU on the browser and create this virtualized experience and if you haven't heard of a library before our code library for you can just think of it as code that's some other developer wrote that you can use and you can then create something cool so you don't have to build your own physics engine or build your own gaming library because somebody else some other smart developer did it for you so that's what Babel nsj is gonna do for us and so this is the game we're gonna be building it's not done I actually started building it about a week ago to be honest and we are gonna be building a version of the classic game snake so I kind of created this like dirt box where like you know snakes live in the ground and like that's kind of cool and then we have this master 3d object that's a box and then whenever it interacts with a sphere it gets bigger and and what happens is that it'll start increasing the speed and then when it runs into the wall the snake will die our game will be over so that's kind of the basics of how the game works and that's what we're gonna see what we did today or how we got to that point um so the other thing that I will do is I'm gonna keep building this out on my twitch stream so definitely if you want to keep seeing how this evolved or contribute to it on the github I think that would be absolutely amazing so if you want to go to the website listed here this is where the source code is and I will jump to that in a minute but in the amount moderator should put that in the chat as well the first thing I want to show you so Babylon j/s has this really cool thing called a playground and in the playground you can go in and right in my browser I can start playing with different example projects of Babylon j/s scenes and so if we look over here on the left the code over here is creating my 3d experience on my right and let's take a look at what that's doing so it's creating my scene it's creating my camera and then it's giving my camera a point camera a point of view and without a camera that is where the camera is the point of view of the player so you need to have a camera so they can see and the other thing is you need to add light so because we're going into a completely new world of virtual eyes experience experience a blank slate if you don't have any light there is no light in your world if you don't have any physics there's no physics in your world right so it's really really cool to think about it that way like you have full freedom to create whatever you can dream up in the next thing you see is we have a sphere so we're creating this mesh object and Babylon j/s has a lot of built-in meshes which i think is really really helpful because when you start building out games sometimes the hardest part is like well how do I do 3d models how do I get this how do I get that you can just start with some of the basic models that are built into library you don't don't worry about getting those and they can see we're setting the white position and then if you go over here you can see there's a lot of different examples that they have available for you in order for you to start thinking about how I can build something so I still use this today when I'm like oh I want to do something with collisions I wanted something and I'm not even sure necessarily what I want to do it or how to do it I check out this Babylon j/s and I go look at different examples of how other people can do it or have done it and there's even a library where you can post your own stuff so like if I were to change this I can save it and then I can also share it with my friends I could come in here I can project something and I could quickly share with the community a shirt with my friend without ever having to figure out how to deploy it or anything so the cool thing about this as well is along with those basic objects that are available you can add custom textures based on an image so this is a built-in sphere and I just wrapped it or they wrapped it with a create image to now make it look like a crate so you can do a lot with that those in those are meshes that are available in the library and so definitely start there when you're starting to build different things so I will flip to the github now so this is the github page that you'll go to when you end up on that short link and here you'll see we'll have some different intro information what is Babylon j/s and canon je s so canon GA s is the physics engine that we're using and physics is going to add gravity and inclusion and give our objects mass and then we have typescript so type script is a superset of JavaScript so you can still do vanilla JavaScript in tight skirt but typescript makes it statically typed so I can actually get intellisense in different really helpful things so the project that I have here is actually using typescript and then it transpires into JavaScript so when you go down on here you'll see that there's going to be two different options we have this just go ahead and get started with the project the way it is now or you can go step by step with building it out and I'm gonna show you this starter template that I have here so I have it up already yeah we hit visual studio I'm sure how I did that okay go away visual studio there we go visual studio wanted to be included in the presentation that's what's going on it's like you want to use C sharp in unity so if you do C sharp you use a visual studio okay so if I go to the starter template here I'm gonna clone this repo so I'm gonna open up my windows terminal I'm gonna go to my build profile I'm gonna get home if any of the intro get things you should have got a little bit familiar with some of these different get its commands so I'm gonna print out my directory and I see that I have my starter project here I'm going to that was the location and then I am going to open up that project and so I'm doing code dot that's gonna open up my D s code instance which is the basic idea for doing development and it's gonna open it up the dot means in my current directory and then I'm gonna run something quick here that's npm install' so since i'm using node it's i'm tim installs gonna look at my package JSON and it's going to install on my different package that I need so if I were to go to the index.html here's the HTML all the HTML that's needed to create a br site so you just have your canvas tag and then you have your source and if I go into my source I can show you here that this is the same scene that we were looking at in the Babylon Jes it's kind of like the hello world of PR and you can see we have our scene we have our camera we're setting our target those same basic things the ground and yeah so this would be a really good place to start out you can come here get started and then start changing things here and you already have the architecture set up your own web pack you have type script you have a lot of things that have done for you so you can just worry about building your game so my npm install is taking a minute so why don't we flip over to when that's done over to my snake VR project so here's the one that we saw in the example and let's see one second I need it okay so here is the basics of the next es for my JavaScript or 4-8 VR game so you can see that I'm grabbing my canvas element I have my camera I'm setting some so these are some public variables that I'm doing at the top of my index J s and then when I go to start creating my scene you'll see that we have something different here we've imported our physics engine so we can start adding physics to our game then we're going to create the snake and there's something called the VR helper so this is the VR experience helper and it gives you some really neat default experience with this one I'm actually manually creating out my box environment that you saw so I'll step into that so you can take a look but there's also a default VR experience that gives you a lot of stuff for free where is that it's here we go so we go here this is the default experience and you can grab this and then you'll have like an environment with some basic things that you don't have to then manually build out like we will in this game but because I wanted some customized experiences it worked better for me to build up my own environment so I'm creating the box I am giving the top mesh here so that's the actual ceiling of it I'm setting the XYZ rotation I'm adding a physics and posture and so I want to make I want to add some physics to that object because again without that there is none I'm adding the ground material and then I'm adding the snake interaction so let's take a look at how we're creating the interaction with that mesh so if I go here you can see that we can register actions in our action manager and this is important because this is how we're going to create those dynamic events and I'm adding an event that's on inners intersection enter trigger and so what that means is I'm saying when the plane is intersected with the snake I want to trigger this event and when that event is triggered what's gonna do it's gonna add particles so if you saw in that demo and the like the red kind of like explosion effect those are particles which we've we are importing from our particle projects or a particle problem file over here and then I'm going to remove the snap snake from this scene and then I'm going to do spread dot sleep and then I'm going to remove the particles from the mesh so the reason I need to do that thread dot sleep and that just means I need it to wait is because if I were to remove add the particles and remove them right away you wouldn't actually get like that animation to be like and be there and then be gone so I need to wait for a minute I want it's animate and then I want to remove it from my scene and then we're gonna stop the game so that's adding how you add some interactions to your mesh and then the next thing I want to point out is this create ball so I need to create four walls and rather than having this code for different times I've created a helper method to just do it for me so anytime when you're programming if you start doing like copy-paste a lot on a particular block of code that should be a red light to you that you should probably put that in a function because then you can have less code and and make it more functional so I have a crate wall function where I say which one I want to create I tell it the XYZ position I give it the scene the snake and the ground material because I need to actually create that interaction on all the different walls like I need it to happen when it runs into the ceiling I need it to happen when it runs into the floor and and everything so that is how we are creating our world the other thing I want to point out too is you'll notice that I have all these different files broken up here when you're like well why isn't all in one there's there's a few different reasons one is maintainability and when you start getting a lot of code in there it makes it a lot easier to find things and move around there's also something called encapsulation so I can have private methods meaning it's only available in that class that won't be available to me and other ones and because I don't need it there so it just makes it for a cleaner better project if you haven't broken out and you have and you just import what you need into different classes so let's take a look at how we're creating these our register snake controllers so if I go into here you can see I'm passing in the VR helper and then the VR helper it's gonna let me access the web viewer controller so that's how when I'm moving the left and right triggers I'm able to move the snake because I'm grabbing that event but I'm doing an on change event of the those sticks but Joyce their common controllers so yeah take a look here okay I hope you see my video right now okay anyway so when you when the joystick moves then you can create an event so when that event happens I'm checking which hand it is because my right hand is controlling one access and my my zxs and then my left hand is actually controlling my X and y axis so when that happens I take a look at own this is logging the values so when you're when you're programming in JavaScript it's helpful to log out what's happening so that you can better debug and see what's happening so like if if I want to know why is when I go right with my controller it's going left like I can easily see what values are happening with the joystick and then I know how to change it and then from there you can see I'm creating the animation when when it actually happens so I'm adding the animation to the snake all right let's go back up here and I want to get this project okay quotes oh man family's all finished you can ignore the warning I wanted to show you quickly how you get started with this so we did npm install now i want to run a build to get my output flipping back to my original kind of starter project just so if your that you get done with this and these instructions are going to github as well but so you can go in you can grab that and get started easily so I'm running that build that's gonna take my typescript it's going to transpile it into JavaScript make that output folder and then I can do NPM start and this is gonna start my local server and give me my website so I can take a look at how it's running all right so the localhost is running so I should be able to refresh here now and then we should be able to see our VR scene you takes a minute slow there we go cool so now you can see that that starter project is the exact starter project in the playground and so you could come in here and start building out a different games you could fork this starter project clone it to your locally and start playing around and then to stop it you just go ctrl C and yes so let's keep looking through the different things that we did in order to create this game so we've looked at a little bit how we created the environment how we added interactions we added a label so how you get that information to the user so when you think starting what user experience they need to know what to do how to play your game so that's adding labels of the scene is how we're doing that and let me do it up so let's take a look at the noms so this thing is eating arms cuz they're not me and here you can see that we're adding the nominee look at what's happening here I'm calling to add great function so I'm working on adding actual meshes so if you go to the assets here you'll see that there's apples grapes and oranges and a snake that I started creating with paint 3d and so in this particular one I'm adding the numbers of the scene but I'm also creating a sphere because I'm still working on that it's not working right yet and the sphere is then adding them that material so remember when I was talking about how we added that texture right now I'm just wrapping it with an orange material so it kind of looks like an orange I'm setting its position and I'm doing that randomly because I want it to not always appear in the same spot so I'm using math dot random to get a random number and well it's clean by five so that I get a fear or a Nam to appear within my box environment because if it is too big if the numbers too big and it goes outside of the box and then the game is broken right because I can't actually interact with that and because the event on the sphere which we'll take a look at here we also have a non interaction with the sphere and so we're adding this to our food mesh we're adding a trigger event and we're passing in the snake since this is what we want to trigger the event when these two objects collide then we are adding particles to the mesh again because we want to have that animation and then we are going to remove it again thread dot sleep because we want to actually see that animation for a little while and then we're going to increment the score so there's a score on there every time that the snake runs into this object we have a score running so you can actually see how many you've gotten in how far you are I'm playing with the speed and the snakes still so right now every time this happens I'm increasing it I'm doubling it I haven't I'm still kind of playing with that I'm not sure if it's working right yet so there are some things in here that like I said I started building this one a week ago and I'm still working on so then we're adding in place and then I want to point out this so if you look here I'm calling add nom within the add nom function and this is something recursion and calling it's a method that is itself within itself which is a really neat feature within or that to use it can be scary though because you can create infinite loops this one is important because I want to then create a new Nam every time it is this one is eaten essentially okay so that's that was a lot of information I'll kind of stop there on this particular game but hopefully that gives you enough of an introduction to how to start building either in this game or a different game because the other thing I want to show you is that it shows I made this video and I'm just gonna play it quick here but basically you can use 3d paint ticket objects so one of the things when you're starting out and you want to get different models in your in your project and you don't necessarily want to learn any complex 3-month remodeling software and it takes a long time you can go to 3d paint you can use the library you can grab it then you can import it into the sandbox of babylons edge is which allows you to play with that and then you can export it to the babylon format so it's a really quick and easy way to get to get up meshes very quickly all right let's go back to here so there's another game in here that you could check out as well and this is again all available on my github this is the one if you were in the students own last year that we built out called on exploding spheres and this one also has step-by-step instructions on how to build it so if you want to check out this one definitely do that and it goes through some of those same basics how you add a mesh how you start the game how you add particles it let's go back into our presentation so we we went through a lot of information there I hope that you're inspired to start learning more about Babylon Jas and about building games either sorry hang on I working there we go okay cool and so I want to point out like we talked about how you can build the game with Batman jeaious and and we talked about gaming in particular but mixed reality isn't just for gaming there is a lot of different applications there's things like cinema VR there is like you know social entertainment things like there's a space VR conference that's actually helping so mixed reality done days that starts today and so there's so many different ways that VR is actually just changing the way that we do things which I just think it makes me really excited because I love it and an AR to an augmented reality so if you want to continue learning more about VR and AR check out this short link register for mr dev days I will be hosting a couple sessions it's gonna be super fun it's gonna be a little bit more advanced but I still think there'll be something for everybody and there is a Babylon json' where they're going to talk more about what's happening with the product unless they don't talk about this quote that I just really love from Satya so if you change the way you see the world you can change the world you see and with VR you're given a blank slate to dream up anything so it is super powerful and amazing tool to get started with and to learn more about so what's next in the student zone we have there's some more sessions I think so I actually don't know and then there's a short link there where you can go and check there's that link that I had for you that goes to the github and there's all the links from all the other amazing sessions in the student zone check out Asher for students you get eight hundred dollar credit so if you do want to host your own game you can do that for super cheap using our static storage or our azure storage to host a static website and in the exploding spheres tutorial I go step by step in how you can actually deploy your web VR game with Azure so thank you so much I know that was a lot of information but I hope you were able to kind of understand how you can start really quickly in easily building games with Babylon j/s so I will take a look at the questions now Thank You KC I can actually ask you the questions because they were through I think to a couple of interesting questions yeah the first one is does Babylon GS and a RGS integrate with ADA spacial anchors yeah the cloud side of the technologies yes it does so after spatial anchors my stuff of service you can set up and if you're not familiar what as for spinkle issues it's really cool it allows you to create an anchor anchor in the real world that you can interact with in virtual reality or augmented reality and so it's cool for shared experiences so if you like let's say someone has a hololens on and so on has a tablet and someone has a phone using spatial anchors you and WebEx are you can all be sharing a virtualized augmented reality experience on different devices at the same time so as your spatial anchors is really cool there's a talk at the the conference the mixed realities of days that's gonna talk more about address facial anchors as well so yeah you can definitely use that with Babylon yes one more question how can you compare it to other technologies like play canvas or three years how do they compare to Babylon yes that is a really good question I have never used the other ones so I can't actually do a compare I kind of just don't jumped in with Babylon and I really like it so I haven't played it with some of the other ones but I should make some time to do that but generally when I make time to play with web PR I have an idea of something that I'm excited to build and then I just jump in and start building that and so since I've already been familiar with the Babylon j/s that's kind of the one I always go to right there are a lot of questions on how do you start learning that what would you suggest yeah yeah so the playground hundred percent the playground go start looking at the examples play with the code on the Left hit play see how it affects everything on the right that's a really good way to start but the other thing that I think is really the best way to learn something is to have a goal and then just try to get there so think of something really basic that you could build maybe just a simple like having a mesh in the environment and have it interact and use that particle system right so you could grab the particle system from the code that I have in my repos so start small start pulling apart how things work the starter project I think is really great as well if you want to get once you're past like okay I've played with the playground a little bit and I'm seeing how I start interacting the other thing is my I'm planning on my foot stream to do more Babylon jazz stuff another one of my cut advocates April she is doing some really neat twitch streams as well on VR development with unity so I would say there's there's so many reasons out there and I know it's hard to be like where do I start but those are good ones the other thing is I added I'm gonna keep adding issue this into that github repo so if you just want to be like I want to figure out how to add you know this mesh into the scene you can grab one of the issues in that particular repo you can clone the project and try to implement that feature so you already have the skins of everything there and what happens when you're gonna do that is your gonna start figuring out what's happening in a project because you're gonna have to kind of reverse engineer what's happening and then when you start doing that it's gonna start clicking on how those things are put together and then you can figure out how to how to change that so those are some different ways that you can get garden thank you guys say that was really great advice to students on how to start learning and the good place would be the repository for this project and maybe watching this session again and recording thanks a lot and I think that concludes our session thanks to add all attendees to watching thank you
