 Dreams are what I imagine in my mind and the things I want to achieve to me, reality is anything I can experience with my 5 senses I always need to think of new ideas I always need to find something new but the hard part is sometimes I imagine things that are so new, and so far from reality that it's hard to make them real it's a challenge to achieve something truly innovative Mixed Reality can take things from our dreams and make them visible in the real world the coordinates of our reality and the future will fuse together holograms are a way to bring our imaginations to life we can create any world we want in order to see those dreams, we use HoloLens the ideas I have tend to be unconventional and crazy working with the team, we determine how an idea can be realized with HoloLens we're always trying to make something original I think holographic companions will become people's partners in the future some people find wayfinding apps difficult to use but if they could follow a character, it would help them find their destination it would be easy for all people to follow and understand I've just started learning more about Azure and I look forward to using it to explore new ideas I think our perception of what is real and imaginary will merge in the future dreams are something you look forward to... when I was a child, I looked at manga and anime and imagined the things that would be possible in the future I think holograms could be the thing that makes those dreams real holograms offer everyone the ability to turn the dreams they envision into reality....
