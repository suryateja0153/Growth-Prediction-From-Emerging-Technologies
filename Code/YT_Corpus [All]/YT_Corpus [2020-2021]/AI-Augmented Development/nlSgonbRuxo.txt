 &lt;Jed Okay let's get started.      &lt;Justin Hey folks welcome back and thanks for tuning in my name is Justin Angle and I'm an associate professor of marketing at the University of Montana College of Business I also host a podcast called A New Angle. Welcome to tonight's installment of the University of Montana Alumni Virtual Engagement series. This series is designed to keep you engaged and informed about the many great things going on at the University of Montana and it is brought to you by the UM Alumni Association. Tonight we are using the zoom webinar system so please use the Q & A feature on the toolbar at the bottom of your screen to submit a question at any time I'll be curating questions for Mike after he finishes his brief presentation. Tonight we once again have my great colleague Michael Braun. Mike has been teaching at the University of Montana's College of Business since 2006. Previously he spent a decade in industry in publishing, direct marketing and investment banking. His research focuses on disruption and organizational decline, recessionary strategies and business model innovation. Welcome Mike thanks for joining us again. &lt;Mike Thank you Justin great to be here again. Nice to see everybody and and I just want to say thank you for having me on. &lt;Justin So you got some brief remarks and then we'll do uh Q & A after that. &lt;Mike That sounds great so what I'm going to do is uh just a screen share of just some you know some some slides that I have just about 10 15 minutes really meant to provide a little bit of a landscape and then also you know seed some thoughts and ideas on the future of work and then yeah this is really a topic that lends itself to a discussion just because it is so multifaceted and obviously it is playing out in the now. So what I'd like to do is just get a little bit of the definition of the future of work out of the way so then we can start to operationalize it understand the implications of the future on work of work on uh what's probably most important to many people which is their occupations and what are some of these um you know displacements that we talk about so often. Also what are some of the emerging skills and capabilities that we are anticipating at this point. And then I want to just spend a little bit of time talking about what leadership sounds like in future of work and this is not just sort of organizational leadership but I think it also is about personal and self-leadership if you will. And uh just so everybody understands I mean you know there is there's sort of a a dialogue that's been unfolding pre-covered and I think uh now what we're seeing is um sort of a different veneer on the future of work discussions and that's why I have on here what now so what has this pandemic really done to maybe change uh the narrative of future of of work so as as Justin said my background was in industry pre-academia and uh I was also with dot-com startups and that flamed out and venture financing um so you know there's been an interest in technology and innovation for a long time there and then it got amplified with my research focus on disruption innovation and organizational decline. I was on a couple of weeks ago talking about recessions and how to navigate recessionary environments and I think that what we're going to talk about today with future of work is actually part and parcel of the disruption of this current recession which was caused by coronavirus. So the these are all very much intertwined uh and it really comes to my personal interest in trying to understand technology society and sort of the management of firms through some of these disruptive uh periods. Again I'm not an economist I'm not sort of a I'm not even a technologist if you will if anything I lean more towards being a luddite I tend to be a late adopter but I'm a strategist so I look for patterns and then directions and my hope is always that I can maybe peek around the curve a little bit which kind of makes it difficult but I nonetheless try so here is the definition of future of work and folks if it looks fuzzy to you then that's what it's supposed to be future of work if you try to look up any kind of definition it's like trying to nail jelly to the wall it is a multi-faceted very complex type of topic that really talks about not just technologies uh and automation that are at the heart of this but also the impact of these technologies uh not just on work and organizations but really on how we live how we communicate to one another how we organize uh you know from all the way at the at the sort of the team level to organizations and then as a society. So my view is that to really get a better handle on what this future of work means it's helpful to sort of look back a little bit try to understand what's happened before and then maybe take some of those anchor points and try to extrapolate forward. And what I have here is really sort of the four industrial revolutions we have three plus the one that is unfolding right now the first one here is is uh you know the the the the advent of steam in the 1760s that obviously brought on the first sort of uh period of of automation where we saw for instance you know the cotton mills that were um that were driven by automated steam-powered uh gins cotton gins we also obviously saw at that point the emergence of the railroads especially in england which was sort of the central um part of the first industrial revolution. The second one we had the emergence of electricity right and this was obviously using copper wire all of a sudden we're seeing that you know we're we we're seeing cities with light bulbs we're seeing the telegraph and the the telegram make its appearance this is around the 1870s and we saw immense uh productivity gains and obviously the world even got a little smaller at that point as all of a sudden we were able to communicate across uh vast distances. The third industrial revolution really came after world war ii with uh the introduction of the microprocessor processor and taking the power of the microprocessor and putting it onto the shop floor to really bring automation uh to a lot of for instance um you know organizational processes we saw that especially when it came to the workplace we saw computers uh you know process and automate a lot of um sort of uh you know skills and capabilities that before had been done by hand. Then this last one that you know the the world economic forum pegged as the fourth in this industrial revolution is really about the um the the the vast amount of data that started to be created in the late night uh 1990s and then early 2000s when we had the emergence of the internet. So what we have to understand is that throughout the first three industrial revolutions there's always been jobs that have been displaced that have been destroyed entire sort of occupations that gave way to new ones right so whereas for instance before we had a lot of cottage industries of fabric production now these things were automated into textile mills obviously we also saw that for instance the you know lamp lighter that used to make the rounds as the sun went down was displaced by electricity or then we had uh you know through automation and desktop publishing the typesetters that went away also if you think about the typing pools that were so prevalent in the 40s 50s and 60s well once you had a desktop computer with microsoft word and all the other productivity tools well so went the the the typing pools and then the one that's probably closest to my heart is good old blockbuster attendant many of you will remember those uh entire experiences of taking yourself on a thursday or friday night to the local blockbuster to find a new release hoping that would that it was indeed there roaming the aisles trying to figure out what you were going to rent and then dealing with those late fees those pesky lay field fees well um it was really Netflix that in the late 90s you know using first dvd by mail and then obviously streaming uh put blockbuster out of business within just seven years seven eight years um so it was it's pretty amazing when we think about the ongoing displacement of jobs throughout so there is there is precedent for it. What's different about this fourth industrial revolution is that what we're seeing now is a steeper and more accelerated curve when it comes to technology adoption and usage and we can kind of peg it around maybe 2014-2015 when we see the confluence or the convergence of these you know super technologies so if you think about it I mean we only saw the the Iphone make its emergence about 12-13 years ago and this was layered on top of the internet where all of a sudden we were all empowered with our own little devices and then we had social media make its appearance some of you may remember uh friendster or myspace but obviously with facebook then it really got cranked up and then we had a bunch of other ones as well. By the time uh 2014-2015 uh rolled around we had more than 50% of at least here in the u.s adoption of the smartphone with individuals seeding their little plot of land which is the smartphone with amazing amounts of information with everything that they liked or disliked or visited or streamed so on so forth these little plots of land digital land started to aggregate all of this usage information. And with companies like Amazon and Facebook and Google and Apple it really started to put a lot of information into a receptacle kind of like almost pulling back that slingshot and making it ready to deploy. Well now that's what we're having we're having these companies figuring out how they can actually deploy some of this data through a lot of other technologies that are making their appearance. So when we're talking about the future of work yes we're really talking about the use of artificial intelligence through all of these other things whether it's robotics whether it's drones thinking about blockchain enhancements augmented reality and virtual reality all being data driven and you know whereas before you know up until now maybe we've seen sort of experimentation a little bit of the deployment when we're thinking about the Netflix algorithm and how it makes recommendations on movies or you know talking to alexa and getting uh you know this device to basically tell us what the weather is like or make suggestions on the next tune that we want to listen to now we're going to see that a lot of this deployment of data is going to get supercharged. And it's going to have a heck of an impact on our daily lives. I think much of the majority of of the discussion has really been around predictions of job losses due to automation and these are all over the place really when we look at predictions and we look at the employment market in the US for instance we have about 160 170 million people in the in the workforce and you can see that you know everybody has sort of their range of predictions everywhere from sort of saying it's going to be on the lower end uh at around you know sort of um maybe 16 or 20 million to it's going to be at least half right and I think this is interesting but it's not necessarily useful because we have to think about what that actually means and put it into a context of well wait a minute are we talking complete displacement or are we also talking deconstruction of jobs right so what we're me what what we mean by this is that there is a spectrum it's much more nuanced with shades of gray where of course like with the other three industrial revolutions we had jobs being completely displaced or go the way of the dinosaur but then we're also going to have a lot of jobs that will be dis deconstructed in terms of their skills and capabilities thinking about wait a minute we have 60 percent of all occupations where maybe at least sort of 25-30 percent of those uh occupations or the the skill sets can be automated right and in a way those might actually bring in new productivity and allow us to maybe focus our efforts elsewhere. The other thing is we want to think about all those jobs that are going to be created through some of these emerging technologies I mean some of the jobs already out there if you think about it sure maybe we don't have the blockbuster attendant anymore but now we have you know video bloggers and we have folks who uh obviously you know make loads of money reviewing products on uh Youtube and and uh and Tik Tok and so on so forth uh we also see that there are actually digital therapists out there who will help you manage your digital lifestyle there are camps where you can go where you can just unplug if you really need to just get away and you know the only thing that will make you unplug is the lack of of any kind of uh cell service or wi-fi right and then we are even seeing some emerging ones when it comes to uh some of the the uh the technologies that are not necessarily just purely technology oriented but are really around the realm of technology and the efficiencies that it brings one of the ones that I'm really interested in is food designers who are thinking about how they can take some of these non-meat or non uh yeah non-meat based uh foods out there and really come up with entirely new categories of food which is just beginning to make its advent I'll talk about that more later but really we want to think about the core skills so what are the core skills and how vulnerable are they to automation right and then what is it that the market really values in terms of the delivery of those skills and capabilities and when I talk about the market it's not just consumers it's also obviously employers out there it's organizations it's industries so when we match up the core skills and the value delivery then we'll get a much better sense of which jobs are going to sort of be displaced which ones are going to be augmented with new skills and capabilities and then really entirely new categories of jobs and occupations that well in large part we can't even fathom or think of we don't have that much of a creative knack for it yet we have to see how these things roll out. So in pulling back a little bit from sort of the industries and occupations we can actually already see some of the skills and capabilities that are increasingly finding traction or are going to be in demand I'm not going to go through all of these but when we think about it we do have of course understanding of technologies emerging technologies and really how to navigate those so these are technology skills where we will have to understand how to interface with different kinds of technologies we're also going to have to understand how to sort of digitize manipulate digital information how to scrub it how to deploy it how to make sense out of it really understanding the competencies and how to take out just data and make it actionable and informative information that can help us in doing our jobs. We also have cognitive skills these are really of interest so sure the critical thinking and problem solving has been there but the one that I really am interested in is cross-disciplinary thinking or what is also known as cognitive flexibility and when we're talking about cognitive flexibility it means that you can quickly sort of synapse between different domains and what it i i i love what the author spiro and and colleagues talk about when they think about sort of criss-crossing landscapes very quickly and uh having the flexibility and agility to work in very different sort of environments and make adjustments and be able to switch back and forth and I think this one really comes to when we're thinking about what artificial intelligence is today it's very narrow in that you know it allows us to sort of streamline and um sort of you know increase the efficiency and the speed of very specific types of applications but AI still is a far away from doing very sort of larger general systems thinking. And then we also have uh relational skills and this is not just understanding how to relate to technologies out there but also how to collaborate with technology and with different types of cohorts different types of teams how to come together how to solve problems where maybe you're going to have three or four different generations of folks working together how to really coordinate not just across obviously distances but time zones some of these different domains. So um you know I'm not going to spend too much time on this but here are some anticipated uh impacts of future of work innovations on at least montana's economic sectors so these are the economic sectors that are predominantly driving our economy it's energy and tourism and recreation and health care now what you have to understand is this is pre-COVID so already when we're thinking about tourism and recreation we have seen the advent of concierge, robots obviously digital assistants and service services big data scrubbing and trying to understand how we can actually help companies uh using smart agents out there another one that I I'm really big into is real estate and construction where we're starting to see 3D printing for material deposits as well as educational services obviously this is something that we spend a lot of time on in higher education, understanding adaptive learning experiences. So rather than sort of educating everybody on mass now you're going to have technologies that really help individuals pace their learning and that really builds the learning experience to what their needs are right. So there's a lot out there what we know is that um the the genies out of the the the bottle if you will that uh these technologies are going to uh accelerate even more um that there's no turning back or turning them off what we don't necessarily know is the speed the scale and sort of the the standards that will emerge and even some of the impacts out there and I think you know there are some folks including Stephen Hawking and uh and Elon Musk at Tesla who have talked about sort of you know AI being um the thing that will um sunset um humans if you will right so we are basically creating our own extinction through AI it will outsmart us and uh maybe we're going to have a skynet event for those of you who are terminator fans you're going to get that reference um which then means that you know these are these are leadership skills that um are in the are in the um the the literature out there uh talking about how you can try to at least manage teams, yourself, your organization. The acronym here is self-created I just happen to to use this one because uh you know montana is known for its craft beer and and if you think about what is happening with uh all this automation all this uh artificial and synthetic intelligence and technology this is really going back to sort of a handcrafted approach to leadership right it means that what we're doing here is we're using high touch we're using a way to sort of you know connect to people we have five categories here competencies based, relational, augmentation, oriented, future fluent and t-shaped. When we're thinking about competencies based it's really saying okay the the organizations of tomorrow and even the jobs of tomorrow the professions are not going to fit the boxes that they did up until now even organizational charts where it was kind of like okay here's where the director of marketing goes and here's where the VP of finance goes and so on so forth we're gonna have to disaggregate those really into the into the skills and competencies and it also means that now it really becomes a lifelong learning experience in the workplace or for your professions where leaders are really going to understand or have visibility in terms of those emerging competencies and then equip their their teams and their employees with those competencies on an ongoing basis that will have to be shouldered by the organizations if they want to remain competitive. Okay the other thing is more and more employees are going to want line of sight about not just what they're doing today but they what they're what they will be doing in three or four years as they sort of evolve in the organization. When it comes to relational here we're talking about more of the um the social economic um or I'm sorry the social emotional leadership qualities more and more we're going to see that uh leadership is going to take on empathy and patience transparency and understanding there's a lot of uncertainty out there so that transparency really comes in leaders are going to be asked to really uh connect the dots for their employees in the workplace to say okay you know here's what's what's sort of on the horizon how do we bring it in here how do we instill a growth mindset it's also about not pushing um employees necessarily to you know where where they can sort of max out but rather where they want to max out how do you how do you how do you support them through their journey inside the organization and through their industries especially when we think about what is going to happen with some of these jobs where you know what maybe it's going to be more of a gig thing we're going to see more project management where people come in work maybe on a project and then sort of disengage work with another company or another project so there's going to be a lot of coordination that's going to require a lot of relational skills. When we're talking about augmentation oriented this is really managing sort of the machine human interface and I think what's interesting is that we still hear about man versus machine but it's more like man or human um and machine right how do you how do you actually augment these these technologies with humans to maximize not just productivity but also their sort of self-actualization and I think it's interesting that you know we spent so much time talking about what can this machine do better than this person this worker I think it's actually the other way around we got to start asking what does this person what does this employee do better than the machine and once we understand that then we'll actually figure out the implications and and consequences of certain technological adoptions and which ones are there for the long term. Future fluency just means that um this is sort of kicking it up into the bigger picture what are the implications of some of these technologies on individuals, teams, organizations as well as culture and structure throughout industries and societies so which technologies are going to be truly enabling versus the ones that are going to be authoritarian or almost punitive if you will so there's a lot of discussion around workers rights obviously privacy issue when we're thinking about equity and inclusion especially in this in this era are these technologies going to increase the divide or are they going to actually sort of bridge some of the gaps out there that we see when it comes to income and other lifestyle inequalities. And then also how do you actually bring in the diversity of experiences and also expertise across multiple generations into the workplace to solve some of these problems. I think with future fluency it's going to be key that we actually retain the voice of the worker in that future of work that's going to be really important. And then in terms of the t-shaped approach this one is uh really trying to be a t-shaped professional whether you're leading or working it means that there's a real challenge when it comes to so much information figuring out how you actually tease the noise versus the signal being able to take that signal being able to manage that sort of focus distraction paradox right and a t-shape means that you're scanning the environment for some of these emerging trends but then figuring out which ones are the important ones and then deploying them in a fashion that are actually uh both efficient and effective. Um oops sorry about that somehow my computer so I think that there's going to be an ongoing challenge when it comes to sort of understanding the curiosity versus sort of the concentration and competency getting away from technology for technology's sake and uh focusing more on how it's actually beneficial to the organization and to society as a whole. So this is sort of what has been going on this is the the uh the narrative that's been playing out pre-COVID of course now the question is well great now what right as we are inundated with an unprecedented uh event that has made things even foggier what's sort of the direction and my view is that um if anything uh COVID and its resulting recession are already accelerating uh some of this future of work uh that was already on the horizon some of the emergence of the technologies out there you think about the the big reveal that happened with uh COVID is that it made explicit some of the the fault lines in a lot of industries also in a lot of professions right so already we're seeing that um you know artificial intelligence is being deployed obviously in combating um you know this pandemic whether it came with Amazon buying a um you know a personal heat sensing um technology so that they can actually figure out who's running a fever in some of their their uh their warehouses we have for instance some of these robots that will uh you know enforce social distancing in parks and on beaches but we are also seeing other things that were sort of nice to haves or interesting for instance Amazon with its amazon go which is a cashier-less store where you just go in you grab stuff with your app and then you walk out and automatically charges you well if if if any one of you out there is having a hard time going to the store these days uh and and sort of not liking the experience as much um sort of waiting in line and everything not only is Amazon rolling out its amazon go but they actually just announced a smart car where whatever you throw into your car it'll automatically calculate what you got so you know we're seeing amazing efficiencies uh being accelerated uh another one that I have here is you know what is happening sort of when it comes to supply chains we've seen supply chain disruptions we're going to see probably uh blockchain adoption throughout those supply chains but even things that again seem sort of on the fringe like beyond meat and impossible burger that you had are now becoming uh really mainstays just because that uh the the the the meat processing supply chain has been contaminated so you know I think some of these things are um going to be pretty positive because we're clocking in at 7.8 billion folks and uh you know we are living in a resource constrained environment and the hope is that some of these technologies are going to bring in efficiencies that will you know maybe move us from sort of an extraction mentality to a sustainability um uh mentality uh worldwide so um it'll be interesting to see how this adoption will play out again a lot of uncertainty around that. Like I said I have some some resources here if you're interested um you can you can learn more about it and at this point I will uh leave it to Justin to throw some questions at me. &lt;Justin Awesome thanks Mike we've got some great questions in advance we also have some wonderful questions come in during your presentation there we'll just take it off in order I mean there was a question about how to do education um in response to a lot of these forces Tom Seekins asks is there a role for the the liberal studies liberal arts uh things like history and philosophy uh in this new emerging world and if so where did where do those topics fit in? &lt;Mike Yeah no I think the humanities definitely do because again this is about uh you know what what uh what the human species can do better right and uh uh listen artificial intelligence responds to what we feed it. So uh you know all the things all the biases that we have all the problems that we have as a society if we're not aware of those we will just feed that into the uh into uh you know robots and and augmented reality and artificial or machine learning uh engines and they will just reflect and even amplify those things so I think the humanities especially when it comes to not just critical thinking and problem solving but also understanding sort of um you know where where we've come from and what how we've you know hopefully evolved and what we've learned as a species from our mistakes it's it's those it's those mistakes and and even our triumphs that we we need to uh we need to feed into the artificial intelligence if we hope to actually make good use out of it. &lt;Justin Yeah that's well put Mike I remember the question reminds me of a conversation I had with Michael Punk author of The Revenant, former ambassador to the world trade organization and current um I think he's vice president of public policy of Amazon so a guy that's had a bunch of different big jobs and I asked him about you know how to educate people in this moment and he said you gotta teach people how to think how to write and how to speak and to me like those three things are hard to do and they come out of the humanities and liberal studies as well. &lt;Mike Yep no I agree and it really goes to this this idea of systems thinking that and and this cognitive flexibility that uh you know the well-rounded individual um who also can can situate humanity in a greater context including a historical perspective will uh will bring a lot to the equation. &lt;Justin Yeah next question question about the health care industry health care senior care hospitality these industries rely heavily on traditional immigrant population for frontline workers we're seeing closures of the borders and different policies around immigration particularly with COVID so how how do these under industries move forward is this accelerating some of the trends that you're you're you're talking about here? &lt;Mike Yeah it's a great question and you know there's there's that that pandemic overlay that um you know it it maybe keeps us sometimes in the fog but I think if we fly high enough uh you know we'll get more visibility about sort of the forward-looking trend lines so um you know I think like I said before I think some of this this automation was already on path but I really like what um uh you know two authors of Dune Herbert and Anderson said that history demonstrates that the advancement of technology is not a steady upward curve but rather that it has its flat periods upwards spurts and even reversals and I think some industries are going to sort of pull back a little bit and try to figure it out and others are really seeing a spurt in terms of the implementation out there. I think you know there is a bigger question here too in that maybe we're thinking of health care and hospitality still in the old paradigm and I really truly believe that uh we might actually see a very different mode of living come out of this this is a true shock to the system and we don't necessarily know what's what awaits us on the other end uh we don't know if this is the second or the seventh inning of this pandemic right so we sort of have to see where it'll go but there's enough uh in terms of people maybe rethinking individually and collectively how they've led their life that there's going to be a big shakeout um and we're gonna see new patterns emerge on how people want to live work play you know communicate coordinate all this stuff so uh we we shall see but I do believe that this is uh the admin of a whole new volume in in our society. &lt;Justin So it looks Mike like we are being joined this evening by Peter Coffey who's the head of strategic research at the sales course Peter submitted a question via the chat here that I will read to you so I get it right yeah in 2009 the h1- h1n1 pandemic reminded the world that these sort of things happen and they were well considered pandemic readiness plans developed and circulated after that but the decade that followed did not apparently include 10 years of worldwide thinking and preparation for the next time around is this time different in particular are there fourth industrial revolution technologies and behaviors that enable a more pervasive and enduring response? For example remote work blockchains that simply weren't available in 2009. Will post-COVID-19 changes to workplace and society aimed at resilience and containment still be apparent in 2030? There's a lot there maybe take it piece by piece. &lt;Mike There is a lot thank you Peter and by the way I watched your future of work at the quote to cast so that was super interesting stuff and I hope to connect with you and and uh chew the fat on on some of this uh you know multi-layered um question first of all you know this would have been so much more difficult in some ways back in in 2009 to do I mean you know I think about what we did in education that it took us really ten days to go fully online um you know as as an entire industry so the technologies uh were there I think that the the issue is is that um you know we we we did okay with what we had but it's still not good enough I mean for instance zoom is was never meant for instance for education it's uh it's a a business meeting uh software um and and vehicle so now it's really going back to some of the innovators out there who are figuring out how to take that experience and and make sure that they can both do the science of education the science of of technology and blend it together and I think a great example there is Minerva who is uh really pioneering this uh in terms of your question you know will we learn this time I mean there's a lot of research out there that says till it affects you it sort of seems distance uh and uh you know we we're even seeing this here where uh you know maybe in some parts of the country where the infection rates and the death rates weren't as high initially it seemed a little bit more of well that's happening in for instance New York right and obviously New York did a much better job of handling the initial uh outbreak and uh and now we're seeing that some of the other states they're they're feeling it firsthand uh this is a pandemic so back when we had SARS and MERS you know they were more localized and they were more like headlines in in the in the newspaper that you know we sort of scrolled through well now this is something that we're dealing with on a daily basis and I think or my hope is that you know not just governments but organizations industries in general will really deploy some of these technologies uh that are available to us uh so we can make sure that you know future panda or future outbreaks won't necessarily you know take us out of the equation like like this I mean and and here here's the other piece you know there's a lot of brain power out there and maybe if we can divert it from you know the next version of Tinder or whatever it is towards really solving some of these uh mission critical um uh um issues that we're facing as as a as a nation and really as a civilization I think we're going to be better off. &lt;Justin Yeah well said Mike and Peter thank you for joining us and thanks for the question. Um somewhat of a related question comes in um around ethics. So in what ways is business education including what you're doing at University of Montana integrating ethics into preparing for the future of work, for example the technological imperative suggests that because we can do something that we should for example in healthcare we can provide we can keep people alive for a long time but should we? so how does ethics play out in your view of this this changing landscape? &lt;Mike Yeah no it's uh it has to be part of the conversation because again this is not just about technology this is about how technology impacts uh how we work obviously but also how we live and how we play and how we relate to one another um and you know there we are we are at this point where technology can either help or hinder um us as as as a as a society if you will and this is where the ethics will come in and help us sort of um set the direction and we talked about the humanities I think that's that's that's going to be part and parcel of that um I think you know at the University of Montana we're already seeing that you know across some of the colleges and schools that people are are looking at various facets of future of work so obviously in the MIS program we have some of my colleagues who are working on it we have folks at the innovation factory then we have across uh campus uh folks who are looking at a different facet of it but I think the more that we can communicate about the implications of of the future of work and not just sort of get enthralled uh by the technology for technology's sake the more that we can actually uh sort of uh you know look forward and and have a sense of where it might take us and you know I I'm a big fan of of how the us and especially in silicon valley that there's sort of this you know really innovative mentality and and obviously this entrepreneurial drive uh at the same time we also have to make sure that when we deploy some of these you know mega technologies that get quick adoption um you know around the world that we are so we can actually understand what the potential downside could be and uh we're seeing now that you know in in Washington um there's anti-trust uh you know proceedings against Google and Facebook and Apple uh maybe they've become too big for their for their britches in terms of what they control it'll be interesting to see what the outcome is there uh you know we have legislation that dates back to the to the 80s on on antitrust and it neces it didn't necessarily take into account uh these different types of uh you know platform business models that could scale up so quickly and just have a a disproportionate impact on on our lives. &lt;Justin Yeah these are big challenges Mike I appreciate the question I appreciate you speaking to it um you know sometimes I lament as a marketing professor that it seems at times that are the best minds of our generation have dedicated themselves to engineering a better customer experience or figuring out more manipulative ways to service ads online and and you're right like a lot of the stuff can be used to solve the big problems of our age and this is a moment where more education is better than less and we need to although all these forces are disrupting all forms of how education is delivered the product we created has never been more in need so I appreciate that those insights. &lt;Mike That's a good point. &lt;Justin Um okay so a couple more questions here um question about uh the defense industry so Steve Maring asks I'm in a defense industry and have been teleworking for four and a half months it seems one of the hurdles for success and remote work is the cyber security issue I've dedicated laptops with VPN in my work which is beneficial what about the consequences to industry and business with many employees using personal computing equipment to perform work for their company this seems to be a real risk in labor force and data security. &lt;Mike Oh yeah and and I think we've seen that we've we've we've seen um you know sort of an explosion of cyber uh crimes out there I mean you think about especially the older generation that may not have engaged with technology on the level that they are now and uh some of the vulnerabilities but I think this is across the board where you know when you have you know 40% of the workforce basically going online um you're going to have um you know you're going to have criminals you're going to have predators you're going to have folks who will try to take advantage of that again this is sort of action and then reaction so uh with it you will have new sort of innovation you'll have innovations that will uh appropriately combat that or that will answer the call uh you know necessity here is the mother of of invention and uh you know when there's demand out there there's usually somebody who will step up and figure it out so um you know I think again we're we're just getting used to this in that it's only been five months that we sort of all moved online here we are doing our zoom calls and everything but already there are innovations that are coming out because this is not good enough right this is this is sort of a temporary patch to a longer term problem and uh even companies like zoom obviously they've seen their their their stock skyrockets skyrocket now they can actually make acquisitions of other companies who have uh innovations and uh features and benefits that will actually round out some of the issues that they have we even saw with zoom obviously the zoom bombing that happened and they quickly came out and and figured out how to come up come about with a patch but you know it is it's um we we we weren't prepared for this and uh now it's a little bit of a mad scramble to uh to try to you know get ourselves uh at least in in the short term into a sort of a a period where we can manage you know it's yeah it's it's cyber crimes it's sort of the the zoom fatigue the mental fatigue it's it's uh you know some of the issues that we have just not being able to to connect with people the way that we used to we're all trying to figure out how to do workarounds. &lt;Justin So a couple questions that have emerged uh both coming in before our talk and in the in the live questions tonight kind of revolve around people that maybe are feeling left behind or are left behind by some of these changes maybe they've been laid off lost their job for a variety of reasons maybe they haven't had access to some of the education to prepare them for these changes or they lack creative skills that they haven't been able to bridge the income divide so this this sort of people in those classes um how would you advise them to uh kind of prepare themselves for the changes that are that are coming or that we're living through right now? &lt;Mike Yeah no and and that one is a that's a really tricky issue in that you know yeah we had um you know workers who could work from home obviously make that transition but we have so many workers and just their their occupation didn't allow that right and uh and that makes it really challenging the other thing is you know what we're seeing is that there's a real divide out there when it comes to accessibility to obviously the internet and and uh and any kind of signal out there that you know especially rural areas have a much more challenging time uh in terms of accessing the the internet and being able to do some of this this work that they need to do or deal with anything uh that requires them to be online um you know I think that we're still going to see this play out I don't necessarily know what the impact is sort of short term with with some of the industries I think industries are going to figure out how they can not necessarily have the the reliance on face-to-face and high-touch involvement right so some industries are going to go through a bigger upheaval than others I mean I think about sort of the the you know the the the the cruise industry or hospitality but already they're trying to figure it out and come up with ways that they can actually mitigate some of the risk out there and it means that it'll be on them to also help their employees get retrained and upskilled and re-skilled in in some of those I think the other thing is we are seeing that there is going to be a large reskilling again coming back to sort of the the uh you know the disaggregated job opportunities uh if anything you know the the the admin of some of these new professions out there is going to make people sort of you know migrate their skills and capabilities get skill set uh to those emerging uh jobs and then um you know try to get uh the the the necessary training for it but I've said this before and and I firmly stand by it I mean there has to be more of a collaborative ecosystem approach where it's not just you know companies by themselves or you know state and and and federal entities I mean this is really going to need everybody working together in a coordinated fashion to figure out how we bring people along we bring people along across obviously sort of digital divides generational divides skills and training and educational divides because otherwise what we're going to end up seeing is just sort of a you know a bigger or even even more increasing gap between the haves and the have-nots. &lt;Justin Indeed so a couple of more kind of immediately pragmatic questions perhaps from a listener who's a small business owner or something like that yeah what are some things that businesses right now should stop doing and what are some things that businesses must adopt immediately? &lt;Mike Yeah and I'm gonna answer this uh more to future work not not so much about um COVID so I think the the first thing is you know we we sort of hear about this the the the new normal and all this and and to me again it's it's one of those things where you know what leave the past sort of behind for now and the the first thing to do is is create an awareness a culture of learning in your organization where everybody will have a curiosity to at least be aware and learn about what this future of work entails now again this does not mean that you have to get up the curve on all the the technologies that are on the horizon but just to understand sort of okay what are we talking about here uh and really stop sticking your head in the sand because we're not going back this is one of those spurts where we're going to see an acceleration of the adoption of of automation in general and it'll touch it'll touch all industries it's just a matter of you know the extent of disruption I just had this conversation with somebody today it's like is anything really safe from uh any kind of disruption and my answer is no and I actually even think that you know when we look at um you know our our system of capitalism that is even uh right for disruption because again we cannot continue to go in the direction that we've been going it's leaving too many people behind and again the the COVID has made a lot of the fault lines very apparent and unless we figure out how to address those uh collectively they're just going to amplify. &lt;Justin Yeah that's kind of a related uh follow-up to that line of thinking Peter Coffey comes in with a um well the follow-up question I think will uh be an interesting thought idea for you Mike speaking of zoom you mentioned zoom before um you know it's noted in may that zoom now has a market cap greater than the world's largest seven largest airlines combined so Peter asks is this an example of a new form of competition based on the need that's met rather than the thing that's made or the service that's performed so the people on companies need to broaden our definition of what competition is? &lt;Mike Yeah I think that's a pretty interesting question I mean I think zoom was there you know I think companies there were companies that just ended up with a wind on their back um you know this is about capital flows so where is the capital flowing right now sure it's going to go to zoom but there are going to be so many other companies I mean you know there's a company called magic leap that does augmented reality and there are so many shortcomings with zoom and I'm looking forward to companies like Magic Leap that will allow you to basically sit in your living room and and have you know avatars virtual avatars so we wouldn't have to do this me staring at the at the at the uh at the screen here at you Justin and everybody else but instead you know we can sit around we can actually sort of see a 3D rendering of one another so I think it's about capital flows right now um and right now the capital is flowing to the to the must-haves that really outline the fears and mitigate the risks so you know they're they're obviously plexiglas companies and soap companies and hand sanitizer companies and so on so forth that are are doing really well but once the dust settles then it'll we'll sort of have to see you know what the priorities and how we actually want to work there's going to be so many issues so many challenges so many problems that will come to the forefront I do think it's interesting that you know you have companies like twitter and obviously facebook who have said you'll never have to come back to the office some folks are saying that's the end of commercial real estate I don't think so I think there's going to be a strategic role for for commercial real estate but you're going to see that technology is going to come in and and just you know sort of round out uh some of the the shortcomings with working of working at home or then um you know and and we're going to see um these things play out on multiple levels we're going to see individuals we're going to see entire communities adapt to some of these new challenges sure some folks are going to move right now people are spending a lot of money sort of you know equipping their home home office and making it comfortable but again you know it's about the capital flows capital always goes to where the need is and uh and there are going to be companies that will will really focus on solutions um of you know of people who yeah they want to work and they want to work because they have to work and it makes them feel good and and everything else so it'll it let's just say it'll be interesting. &lt;Justin So last question it's always nice Mike when one of your colleagues jumps in to uh to heckle you a little bit so you got a question from professor Cameron Lawrence it seems that the fourth industrial revolution will require all of us to have stronger grounding in technology regardless of our individual occupations how can universities help students ramp up their technology technical skills and systems thinking? &lt;Mike Yeah no and and you know I think the best person to answer that question is Cameron himself but uh I do think that increasingly you know we're going to see interdisciplinary efforts across campuses and across the ecosystems where universities are located what do I mean by that and Justin you know this and and you know having been in in academia for 15 years there's really a silo mentality. I mean you can spend 10 years on a campus and not run into folks from other schools from other departments from other colleges I think those days are over so uh these interdisciplinary efforts they're going to spend not just campuses but also across some of the regional ecosystems where you know increasingly colleges and universities are going to have to get informed by uh by obviously for-profits non-profits economic development agencies government entities so and so forth about what those needs are to solve and by working together we're going to move from sort of a supply-side system where we said here's four years of your degree now go find a job too no actually we're gonna work with different constituencies to uh you know create students who can actually you know sort of live through multiple career phases and also um live live life to the fullest. &lt;Justin Well Michael that seems like a great way to bring the conversation to a close thanks for sharing your expertise thanks for the wonderful questions from our engaged audience this evening and please join us yeah so please join us next week when our colleague professor and interim dean at the college of the arts and media John DeBoer will join us to discuss the arts UM arts during the pandemic.
