 [Music] Harry Potter Wizards unite is the new augmented reality game from the antic the company that made Pokemon go such a global phenomenon a few years ago how Wizarding community is at risk of exposure traces of magic are appearing all over the muggle world my antic has pioneered a new kind of video game one that combines the virtual world and the physical one great I've rescued a small cat I've go on so it's a goblin you have to draw a squiggle on the screen to cast the spell accurately so there is somewhat degree of skill involved whereas Pokemon goes sent people scurrying around cities in search of monsters this time Harry Potter is recruiting Wizards to go in search of fragments and magical artifacts bringing some of Harry Potter's best loves characters from the JK Rowling universe into the real world it's doing that with a combination of smartphones and sensors with maps and location tracking and with a I powered cameras and then we go up hunting again right where's the next one young Hogwarts students walking the streets over the last couple of years Apple and Google have built AR technology into hundreds of millions of smartphones and that's made it far easier for less technical companies like IKEA or Nike to build a are apps that let people try on a virtual sofa or virtual pair of trainers baby hypocrite how many of those to the dozen augmented reality has become a top priority for Silicon Valley companies including Apple snap Microsoft and Facebook who are all hoping that one day smart glasses and ubiquitous computing might supersede the smart phone but so far no a our app has achieved the kind of worldwide impact that Pokemon go did and that was three years ago [Music] maybe that could change with Harry Potter sprinkling a little bit of his magic to show the latest innovations in augmented reality apps like Wizards unite and Microsoft's forthcoming AR game minecraft Earth provide a test bed for new technologies such as computer vision and scene awareness so in the not-too-distant future we could see characters like a goblin interacting with wheel objects around them by jumping on top of a lamppost or climbing a tree despite the billions of dollars that Silicon Valley is investing into augmented reality it still isn't clear if this is a bold leap into a new dimension or just a blind alley [Music] you [Music]
