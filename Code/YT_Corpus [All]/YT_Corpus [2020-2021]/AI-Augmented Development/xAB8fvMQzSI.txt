 most of the things we hear about today and marketing are just in our general lives are really uses of machine learning which you could probably define better than me but the definition we always go with is making predictions of future outcomes based on historical data is Paul rates her 100 copr 2020 hub spots first partner agency back in - oh seven we start in the partner program and also more recently the founder and CEO of the marketing artificial intelligence Institute so I'm here with Kevin Walsh today product manager for hub spot machine learning proc metric Russia Larry hop spot to talk about the applications of artificial intelligence and digital marketing so be sure to like or subscribe to the HubSpot Academy YouTube channel and that throw it over to Kevin let's start at a really high level can you tell us if you know what is artificial intelligence and what is machine learning yeah I mean to me the the thing I would say about artificial intelligence is if you search on Google for what is AI you're gonna get 10 different definitions from 10 different experts so what I always try and talk about is just at a very high level it's kind of the umbrella term to encompass technologies and algorithms designed to make machines smart and then within that machine learning being the primary subset most of the things we hear about today and marketing are just in our general lives are really uses of machine learning which you could probably define better than me but the definition we always go with is making predictions of future outcomes based on historical data but the key with machine learning is the machines get smarter and the predictions get better without human intervention necessarily thinking again about do you have any sort of specific consumer examples that people might be familiar with that are using machine learning day-to-day in their lives yeah we always look at like the best example I always give of AI and machine learning in particular is Google Maps so when we try and make it less abstract for people we just talk about the fact that you're using it dozens if not hundreds of times every day in your life so if you think about the apps on your iPhone from Facebook to Instagram to Google Maps to Amazon to Spotify like every one of them is using data to try and predict your behaviors predict what you're likely to do next or what you're going to be interested in or what you're going to buy and so Google Maps to me is one of the best examples of what we're trying to get to with marketing so Google Maps makes predictions about the most efficient way to get from point A to point B but the human at the end of the day still makes the decision and I think that's where we're trying to go with marketing software is to make it smarter to make it predict a little better what might happen or the best route to take but the human still takes that makes the final decision so there's a book called prediction machines that I really like this written by three economists and they look at the future of jobs and say that it'll basically be telling machines what predictions to make and then figuring out what to do with those predictions like using human human judgment on those predictions and so kind of what is the state of artificial intelligence and within marketing sales and services as we think of them I look at it and think it's very beginner level now again you may have and as someone who's overseen the building of some of this stuff within hub spots platform may look it a little differently but I generally think that the technology is at the very early stages of development and application to marketing now there's other industries where it's raced forward so you could look at just Wall Street for example in finance this stuff's 30-plus years old they've been trying to do this stuff to figure out when to make trades and how much to invest so looking at the applications to marketing it's it's just early the money has started to move in we track about 1,100 a I powered sales and marketing technologies and about 500 of them have funding combined over five billion but a lot of that money is funding companies that when you dig deeper they honestly don't really have much proof that it works so they talk about a and they talk about machine learning and they claimed have been building smarter technology but if you press for case studies of how it works it's often you find that they don't really have them and that really the machine learning adage is part of a road map and they're just very beginning staging testing so our experience has been it's very early but that that's actually a good thing because it means there's opportunities for both the tech companies and for the marketers that figure out what this stuff is and are proactive in trying find smarter more efficient ways to do things yeah I tend to agree I hear at HubSpot you know we've been doing machine learning seriously I'm good seriously I would say for about two years a little more than two years and we've grown that team tremendously it's now a full-fledged group here within products and we do take a lot of inspiration from those bigger brands like Google and like Spotify and like Netflix that have pretty successfully implemented you know recommender and predictor systems that people know and love like Netflix I mean who hasn't benched Netflix over and over again just because you would like this it's getting almost spookily yeah accurate yeah yeah and I think the challenge that we face is you know you're trying to as brands even if you're a b2b brand consumer experiences have changed and their expectation of the simplicity and personalization has changed and so whether it is like a Spotify or a Netflix or Amazon like they're so used to that predictive capability that when you start getting into having to buy and deal with chat BOTS that aren't intelligent at our human based logic and going through what we try and manufacture as the customer journey as marketers it's there's a lot of things other big SAS world loves the word friction there's lots of friction in the buying process today that doesn't exist on a consumer side and so I think that's the challenge a lot of big brands have and especially in the b2b side is trying to find a way to remove that friction by building more intelligence
