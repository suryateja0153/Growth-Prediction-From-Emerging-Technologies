 the last network that we have is LinkedIn and LinkedIn is a really surprising and interesting one if you look at the trends on there, influence makes your engagement drop off, drastically, so as you get to the bigger and bigger guys, your Elon Musks and your Bill Gates, engagement per thousand followers literally falls off a cliff. And it isn't just likes. Even comments on LinkedIn absolutely drop off; it's catastrophic how quickly the engagement falls off. Here, this is the strongest negative correlation we've seen. As an influencer's influence grows, it is much, much less profitable for you to be paying to engage with them, or even spending time, let alone having to pay for their influence. Even if they did it for free it is worth much less to you, as a business, to work with a LinkedIn influencer than it is to work with a series of good quality people who have an engaged audience and maybe just have a few thousand followers
