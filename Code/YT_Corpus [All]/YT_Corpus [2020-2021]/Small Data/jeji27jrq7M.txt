 hello and thank you for joining the National Institute of Mental Health Office for Research on disparities in global mental health 2018 webinar series this presentation is entitled envisioning a conceptual model of sex and gender differences in health and disease please know all lines are in a listen-only mode if you would like to ask a question during today's presentation you may do so at any time through the Q&A pod located in the lower right hand corner of your screen this call is being recorded it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Tamara Lewis please go ahead hi this is Tamara Lewis Johnson I'm the chief of the women's mental health program at the National Institute of Widow that National Institute of Mental Health today we are having a hosting a talk that is in partnership with National Women's Health Week so each year millions of women take steps to improve their health and it's the 19th annual National Women's Health Week kickoff which started on Mother's Day and runs through the 19th the Department of Health and Human Services office of women's health is encouraging women to be as healthy as possible and one of the things that we're doing in conjunction with this is our talk today so I'm going to I encourage you to go to that website you can put in a search engine if you'd like to find a book about more activities related to National Women's Health Week now I was going to talk briefly about our speaker dr. Chloe Byrd is a senior social scientist at the RAND Corporation where she studied women's health and determinants of gender differences and health and healthcare she is also a member of a party ran Graduate School faculty dr. Berg recently served as a senior advisor to the director of the NIH office for research on women's health and an editor in chief of the journal women's health issues where she is now associate editor our recent work includes the study assessing and mapping gender disparities and quality of care for cardiovascular disease and diabetes among United States Department of Veteran Affairs patients at California and Texas as well and NIH funded research on the impact of neighborhoods and behaviors on allostatic load morbidity and mortality in her book gender and health the effects of constrained choice and social politics dr. bird and co-author Patricia Ryker explore how policymakers and other stakeholders shape men and women's opportunities to pursue a healthy life they emphasized the need for research that informs stakeholder decisions in order to improve women's health and reduce disparities dr. Byrd is working to build a donor fund a women's heart health research and Policy Center and ran to improve women's health by improving science and policy related to the health of women and by addressing deficits and women's health in health care dr. Byrd received her PhD in sociology from the University of Illinois at urbana-champaign she is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of science and the American Association for health behavior I the large introduce you to dr. bears thank you it is an honor and a pleasure to be here and speak about the ways we can improve science on health so talking today about envisioning a conceptual model of sex and gender differences in health and disease so the NIH mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health lengthen life and reduce illness and disability that's actually lost the NIH mission over all my 10 IMH I apologize the NIH mission statement is the transform the understanding treatment of mental illness is your basic and clinical research paving the way for prevention recovery and cure so how are we doing with assessing and addressing the mental health and the physical health women would argue there's some gap and where we've come thus far so today we talking about what do we know about women's health the challenge is to what extent is the evidence base built on studies that excluded or underrepresented women especially the diverse population of women the relevant populations for specific diseases and disorders with that in mind we need to look at part of the gaps where does the evidence-based end and a function based agreement again first what can we do as researchers to close the gap how can we improve the science on women's mental and physical health and in turn the understanding of health and disease across the population so our challenge is to consider the gaps in knowledge and inspire and it needs assessment and use these to improve care and outcomes and I'm showing a population an image of nine women and it's important to think about mask yourself to use this represent diversity who's missing who is underrepresented where they included in the research I want you to think about three points as we go through today first I argue the better population sample makes better science asking better questions doing better analyses say it's better science and then half right can't bbm there's an uneven history in physical health research and in mental health research as well as mental health an example today many of you are probably more familiar in some ways with some of the gases and physical health research but in mental health the animal studies long relied very heavily on small samples of mice and wrap the jokes when I was in graduate school was that even the mice and rats are predominantly white male with some change since the sex of the behavioral variable policy human studies also over-represented men for many years and worth acknowledged if you look back in the literature is not immediately visible that they did so they don't they aren't defined and having studies of what we know in men they often miss computed women in the case of mental health and having poor mental or mental health overall than men and this was based on the piety and depression of females compared to males and taking treatment so the catchment studies that were done long suggested that women simply had for mental health and it wasn't until Ron kessler's ground-shaking national population-based studies that there was a shift in the understanding of the prevalence the distribution of mental health disorders that there are disorders that are more common in women and there are others that are more common in men and on average in the US and globally men and women have similar overall mental health but with different conditions and increasingly we're starting to understand some different expressions of those conditions and we missed a lot of that because the way we asked the question now I wanted everyone to keep in mind that no one actually planned to know less about the health of women for experimental animal research population samples weren't too complicated the idea of experiment was to do a simple enough study that you could control everything so they were traditionally done on very small samples with assumptions of generalizability and it functions in animals you're only studying sexing animals within animals that when you what you saw was generalizable and the conclusion has been made that there were big differences behavioral responses related to hormones and that that was probably the only difference that was going on between males and females we now know that's not the case but that was the concern of the time now for experimental research in human again populations samples were too complicated but there was a struggle over whether physicians or scientists could define effective medical practice who was going to get to decide what was going on and what should be done that struggle led to a debate in terms of how we would determine what here was good and the debate went initially to physicians having more safe sometimes the authority but the DES and thalidomide disasters really shifted that domain the liver might in particular was much less prevalent as a problem in the u.s. than in other countries because of action by a woman at the FDA early in the regulatory period is pretty striking stories you can look at that some time but that shifted from a focus on we would just figure out things that go from there to we must avoid the risk of birth defects at all cost we must avoid accidentally treating women who might be pregnant and this warped into not including women in research who were potentially pregnant which became all women there was a a little research at the time on postmenopausal women and there are a few exceptional studies that were done in none but you couldn't say that you were not at risk of being pregnant so this shifted things not out of a supported decision to only understand men's health but a belief that it was going to protect babies that was going to protect women it was going to prevent birth defects and they just meant men would carry on as the burden of research subjects it turns out now we understand it's a lot more complicated than that it can't work that way and we also know that excluding women from the research who might be pregnant means that rather than having small numbers of well-informed women consenting to participate in control studies today many women and over time have elastic in critical information on the effectiveness and the side effects of treatments should apply to them especially during pregnancy now the good news is that assessing gaps involving improving research on mental and physical health and needs assessment and information will inform the understanding of health and illness in women and girls it will improve analyses of mechanisms and women and girls and the identification of barriers to diagnosis treatment and positive outcomes in women and girls in essence this is going to give us better knowledge of human behavior health disease and response to treatment and improve the care ultimately a minute well as women all of these things can be achieved through the same basic approach and the intention here is to support the development of scientific knowledge and foster a critical understanding around multi-level approaches the research for women's health across the life course and to be able to improvement mental and physical health for diverse populations in three steps to improving the science the practice and the policy that I want to emphasize today and the first is you understand the title is improving our conceptual model of sex and gender influences on health and disease is to recognize it's what we do and don't know and I hope that model will help guide us the third is to ask better questions because half right can't be the answer so let's start with a sexual model what we have here is a Venn diagram and the circle to the left represents the influence of sex biology and the right gender or social factors when we study animals it is simpler the differences between males and females are sex differences and they are biological when we study humans there are biological differences and there are gender differences which are associated with the social and environmental context context in which we live both sex and gender influence health in some cases we know that differences in health in disease are biological in origin these includes cancers such as specific organs or excellent diseases such as those forms of hemophilia which are more common it's not exclusive in males and females on the other end of the spectrum there are likely some health conditions or event that might be half of categorized as purely gender meaning entirely socially created and not biological but it's difficult to point to specific examples for example we could discuss or debate whether some forms of violence against women are purely social phenomena we're not going to do that today and it would probably be a long discussion and that in most cases when we study human health we are studying the impacts of sex and gender not sex or gender because humans live in a world with a myriad of lifelong gendered expectations with socialization which overlay any inherent biological differences and these in fact have been shown to impact how we proceed in there with newborn or infant based on their presumed sex and the simplest case demonstrated here both sex and gender are treated as dichotomous but we're not even giving to the complexity that go beyond that in reality we recognize there is more variation all the way down to the genetic level which determines extant humans and other mammals an individuals who are intersex including those who are not XX or XY as well as those who are transgender have additional complexity to their health and their medical tier similarly in some societies they recognize three or more genders and those categories and related life experience likely shape complex health differences in in ways that go beyond what we can get to sort of things is something missing even at that first cut so influence of sex and gender here the separating the two and marrying this importantly in case there's anyone who the courtroom is hard to make out due to your own vision Class C or the monitor you're looking at I'm showing here how the impact of sex influences may affect the exposure and health impact of gender and vice versa so the differences are not only additive they can interact in ways that amplifies or confound health effects when sex can contribute to exposure to and the impact of social factors and context for example one is greater longevity exposes them to a greater risk of widowhood and poverty both in old age and these in turn impact health and then hazard is exacerbated by social norms whereby women typically marry men or on average two years older just expose accelerating the process the inequity similarly gingered social exposures can influence an impact an exposure for biological factors on health and here I'd like you to consider the case of workplace childcare which imprint impact men's and women's health and we might expect a stronger exposure and impact on women but for women's on-site childcare Ashley isn't here can support extended breastfeeding and in so doing in turn affect a woman's risk of breast cancer or exposure to oxytocin hormone that helps her connect with the baby and cope with all of the stresses of new Parenthood which has been impact on on depression of another go community parent workplace childcare will not have that same impact on men's health because their biological differences in men and women so we have these confounding very what you see in an adult's or in humans may be social in origin it may be biological in origin it may be impacted by an interactive effect so as we try to understand women's health an influence of sex and gender we need a clear conceptual model that encompasses both types of exposures than in and we need rigorous methods and research overcome back because right can't be the answer so when we look at the influences of sex and gender on health we need to consider the levels at which they operate on the Left I'm showing examples of internal factors from the genome to the individual and on the right externally from the individual to the family to the national or even global social environmental context in short both the internal biological factors and the external social factors environmental factors shape their lives and shape our home almost all aspects of health are influenced by exposures to internal and external factors so again we have this feedback from one to the other this interaction the exposures occur across the life course and contribute to differences in health such as the risk of type 2 diabetes and I left them and we just hire among girls are the rates of autism which like heart disease been defined and understood as disease of mail and is now thought to include previously unrecognized expressions and females so let's think about what we know and what we don't know scientific advances arise from a clear understanding of an appreciation for the limits of our knowledge in other words knowing what we don't know is perhaps even more important to advancing science than knowing what we do now but question here because conceptual model in mind is how clear are we limit of our current knowledge in that even we have a hundred years of research primarily on male subjects and even male tissue samples as well as male animals the research typically have ignored this critical limitation even when we do a retrospective literature review we typically fail to characterize the areas and finding and based on and potentially only generalizable to males this is your profession and they've assumed that methodological and statistical River or somehow sufficient to overcoming these limitations but it is sufficient and appropriate even as we have female samples to assume that what we know thus far is good enough now the challenge is having built this research on a sample that is fairly homogeneous there's a lot we don't know about women's health and we need to be clear about the expense of which females Rick what is in the research to which the data was analyzed if they were included to whether differences were reported if it was in fact a Milan to do this we need to begin to ask better questions part of what we know and knowing what we don't know involves recognizing where there untested assumptions that finding of cement or her male animals or tissue candy or has been generalized to details and we can think about this evidence base as the foundation in the field the question is is the foundation we're working from solid are we aware of the gap in the evidence base regarding the health of women in some areas the assumptions of generalizability of findings on men to women strongly held so widely expected there's no longer question and if you submit a proposal to study them you'll get a comment back saying well this is a very very interesting and you'll find you'll only find what we already know which is an interesting presumption about that which is not uncommon forget that these are testable hypotheses and we're interested in empirical data base so are we aware of these notions of generalizability objective data on women's representation and research and the extent to which findings are consistent for women and men are valuable in some exploration they begin with systematic reviews of the literature the analysis of data from existing studies which had Z and formation on males and females but did not assess whether the binding held for women this kind of exploratory work can provide the necessary preliminary studies and necessary findings to allowance protect studies designed an hour to test for sex and gender influences and it sounds have been evaluated why they might occur and the implications for a surgeon for disease prevention and treatment rigorous is our research we building our science our needs assessment and our evaluations on studies that are including population samples we can't know what it is to be human or what health and disease look like in a population if we consistently rely on the same of bet to study the population this is true in studies of physical health and deterrent settings of mental health mental health has been an easy treatment because the number of studies that have been done on college students and we know college students are a model tiny subset of our population important but tiny and it may not tell us what what things look like in the rest of the world so are the studies that we have have been tested and validated the assumptions that were made and they assess whether the mechanisms operated differently in females and males or whether the interventions are effective in women and girls as they are in men and boys in addition shall be required or we it's a report of evidence of differences and where there is not a difference to inform future research that has not been a standard today is increasingly becoming a standard in Europe and I think it's time to catch up so how rigorous is our research are we in fact ignoring sex and gender including women and simply adjusting for a dichotomous variable and in fact that like saying well we know we're treating into a population that on average has one testicle and one ovary and we'll control for that and then ignoring that it's much more complicated than that we need to explain to me to examine beyond the narrow subset of women which are included but often choose you to identify meaningful differences in incident risks benefits or outcomes we also sense a critical issue is discussed in the Women's Health Initiative trial watch - the follow-up words assuming generalizability beyond the data to women especially to older women we often miss the great disease population now missing when we miss the relevant population we miss a lot of what it takes to understand human health and under the acid be so sterile wanna take this one example and go a little further when we do clinical trials were often held up as solving all our problems there's a gold standard and I'm arguing we need to think more about how we're doing them and maybe that'll be facilitated by all of the new forms that we the benefit of the most rigorous standardized submission information but we need to think about what the studies collectively are telling us in some study and some role representatives of those of the disease or condition in the wider population and for many of the studies I simply think of crazy bat enjoy disease because that's an area focus on much of the mind but it's not the only case the age of onset is younger in men than in women and if the studies were traditionally designed to understand the disease than men then the couple point may make a lot of sense or understanding them so if you think of that as a Venn diagram between the population study and the population experiences the disease you would have pretty close overlap when we go to add women we try to follow those same criteria that practice and clinical trials of studying the younger patients who the disease so it's less complicated we know what we're looking at studying healthier patients for whom they don't have any comorbidities but we know what we're intervening on and how its operating these approaches may be appropriately held in the clinical trials when they focused only on males but given very incomplete information as we start to try to understand it generalize to women so if you think again in that Venn diagram when we drew it for women it's going to be a much smaller subset of the actual disease population that was included in the research not only are they different in age they're different in comorbidities that may confound diagnoses treatment outcomes and this turns out to be critical if we go on a case-by-case basis we would look and say oh okay they're including women that sits with us and and they're doing potentially some of the appropriate analyses all consistent sexist biological variable standard but it does not necessarily mean at the end of the day that we've done all of the work that closes the gap so we need to think of this in two approaches one is what what makes an individual study because it can be and to think is it providing the same level and quality of evidence or using a treatment among women among a diverse population of women with the disease as it is in the intervention in men just doing business as usual and applying the scientific method in the way we have may cause us inadvertently to make a series of missteps that give us narrower answers that don't provide that same evidence base and same quality that we are making so even for your mentions they're found to work as well in women as men it's a gap in the age of the population is different than we may have issues of polypharmacy we may have more issues of depression or complications that otherwise could be avoided if we either think more about it going into it or recognize that just because we have findings from a clinical trial that included women does not mean we have the same level of evidence for treating the actual population of women that it may have provided for treating the population or now that said we may have been missing along the way we may have been treating disproportionately white men in studies and then generalizing to another population that's another question to go back and look how representative is it but it may have been good enough for nothing you know in work shoes for men but taking the same steps and following all of the procedures that we've learned is good science that we undertake is this client may not get an end to the goal as we go finished identified and bent by to treating the populations of the world so when eyewitnesses think about all the different dimensions of which we may in unintentionally be extrapolating beyond the data statistics Allah will not solve the problem but I want to introduce a few whole proposition how do we begin to take the kind of conceptual approach and to better and it ascends the last 12 years actually discussing it with a lot of colleagues in the field including other journal editors and one possibility is for journals to begin to require electronic appendices reporting stratified analysis and if there are limits on the capacity to report in cite an article whether finding cells for both genders or both sexes then that could be explained in a discussion section added in an online report now in the days of paper journals exclusively paper journal this was a problem but it's rarely that the reviewers or journal editors asked someone to take out information about month significant finding regarding sex differences although they might have to ask people to not include underpowered information if we don't start reporting that if we don't start collecting that kind information we won't even have the signal of where there's a difference and this has been key to advancing research on the health and what we traditionally call minority populations white about to be the minority population here but is to begin to report on and understand where is there in signals that there may be an important difference even if the study was not powered to invest back it is that kinds of pieces of information that researchers can look across studies across Facebook see database and be able to say there's some indication Leon to look further but why would we want to report this because the average results do not mean that one size fits all one size doesn't fit all in underwear it is unlikely that it fits all and healthcare and as we look further we're finding the growing number of areas all the way down to tissues studies where there are differences of responses in male and female so this would allow us to start to overcome one of these barriers simply because half right can't be the answer and it would inform the transparency of the work proposition that I would like to suggest is in order to close the gap we need to overcome the assumption that we already know there aren't sizes gender differences and it feels like we know that because as many have been reported but in fact we need to look at the questions we need to do systematic reviews of the literature and the evidence base on the health of women across multiple domains the Japs are not readily apparent in part and they said because they haven't been reported in the past and because it's really the tip of the iceberg where we start to have large numbers of women included in studies that were not diseases and disorders that predominantly occur women and even in those cases you may have assumed we were understanding gender differences of what all of the mechanisms were in ways that they accept the data but systematic reviews give us the possibility of adding value to the existing literature and of mining a database that where we have invested heavily in large numbers of studies that individually wouldn't necessarily speak to this but simply reading the literature is not going to ever be able to get us there it takes the systematic review I personally don't do these systematic reviews so this is not just me speaking on behalf of my of my favorite possibility but that I'm looking for what are the most efficient timely cost-effective approaches to establishing what do we know and how do we know it and are there things that we've missed these are the things that the data could tell us today the third old proposition is that we need to evaluate the generalizability of randomized control trial findings and here I want to think of the lessons learned from the Women's Health Initiative the answer the two years into the Women's Health Initiative intervention for anyone who's not familiar this was a large-scale trials and behind to assess the benefits of hormone replacement therapy which was so standard Lee used at menopause that my colleagues who were principal investigators in this study actually got calls from other professors saying how dare you randomize women off of hormone replacement therapy we know this is fantastic it was is that the study itself was so obviously going to show that it was wonderful that was considered needless and in fact it shows the office that it shows that there were heart attacks of death attributable to harm on replacement therapy and yet many of those deaths included in older populations women who were 10 20 years out from menopause at the time of entry into the study so here is a little bit different than the problem I was saying generalizing beyond the data where you might have only treated one population in the intervention and there's a larger population that should be considered here they scooted the other way and they included a lot of women you would normally go out and intervene doing hormone replacement therapy because we did not at the time do the kinds of bounded analysis and say ok there there were women died there were there these strong effects is there anybody was working for is there anybody it wasn't working for one of the next questions we ought to be asking what should it look like instead it was taken as this was a definitive answer was the book in the randomization fortunately the population all of those are a long time and we now know that at least what smaller doses at least with other approaches such as using a patch there are there are there can be benefits of hormone replacement therapy used right past menopause the point being the one answer was not definitive we shouldn't treat it as definitive and we shouldn't generalize beyond what was looked at in the same way studies that I've either just looked at men are they looking at both men and women and we don't look further to say who did it work for what are the limitations on how it's working who's less now and the kind of founded analyses that we would do in economics what happens when we shift these parameters a little bit how certain do we have to be this is right from a single significance test but on how far off we couldn't we be in this with still do robust bindings that what we say works work or what we say does not work clearly does not work generalizing beyond the population study beyond the gender beyond the racial ethnic group beyond the age group is unjustified it can harm patients and can miss opportunities to improve care and outcomes we can be doing better on this so what I want you to take away from this today is that we can improve policies that impact women's health and it requires us to do better in science it required us to study the population we need it we want to fulfill on the the NIH mission that we want to fulfill on the idea that we can provide fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of human system and the application of that knowledge to enhance health lengthen life reduce illness and disability we have to study a full range of the population and in many cases historically and even some of it continuing recently we've left out women nor the mature we've left out diverse populations including minorities including rural populations including those with less education or lower incomes where it may be harder to treat and we need to understand why and not just assume the assumptions are not good science what we need to be doing is asking better questions and doing the analyses that make better science because half-bright can't be the answer thank you so thank you dr. Berg for a very thought-provoking and informative presentation the you know the floor is now open to those of you or on the webinar on the webinar if you want to submit your question please do so now and then I can share that with dr. bird but let me let me ask for a dr. bird one of the major differences in genesect and gender differences in mental health is the prevalence rate events in the incidence rate of depression for women being higher than men and then not and so I'd like for you to maybe talk a little bit about that I mean some of the sex components of that that situation and then some of the gender you know factors that may affect depression we know that adolescent girls are more likely to be depressed we know that depression shows up during the Jerry natal period we know that another flash point over the life course is during the ministrant the menopause transition and then and then later lives and but we also know that there are variations you know among subgroups not all women are experiencing this yeah it's really interesting because we have a lot of data that suggests that women are more vulnerable at the experience of hormonal transition of hormonal change and it is a shift in hormones can shift your entire experience of the world women talk about feeling emotionally hijacked in the way that that that a toddler is we're we're an emotion runs away Linda and some women will say in there they're actually wondering as they're having a reaction and I really that have sent by this or am I really that's bad about this but but but then getting pulled through to it and experience not not remaining with that luxury of being an outsider looking in because we experienced by our emotions as real and impactful as new members but legally old reliable as reporters part of what ends up happening though is because of the differences in that transition an adolescent we have more women who have experienced an initial episode of depression and once you've had an episode of depression the the chronicity is so much in males and females the risk factors women may be exposed to more because women earn lower incomes they're responsible for more caregiving they have more dependents specifically but also men and women have somewhat different social networks and for men a larger network we know that it's bad for anybody to be isolated for men a larger Network seems on average just to get better and better there just seemed to be benefits although they men admitted some of those wrong that women make in within their network and so that may be for women they experience benefits in their network but they were experience responsibility and trade-off and emotional connection to people so women are distressed by are impacted by crimes that others in the network are exposed to more losses than others and their networks are supposed to so they both report having happened and they may feel the more have more concerns for their for their families and for the world they interviewed men and women about adverse life events in the past year and they were very perplexed because they were studying couples that a lot of times the men wouldn't listen many things and the woman would say well you know when my husband's mother died that was really awful and just a different way of processing and taking responsibility for and managing so it's my social well-being of others may put women at risk even as the benefit one of the other things that I wanted to talk we have no I well I cannot where I can see what tell me if you see one I was going to shift to an example that I had I mentioned earlier of systematic reviews where as you do a systematic review the same issues of what are the questions you're asking what are the population that's included show up there as you in doing an individual study so we have to look not only at the same way we might have looked at problems in men we're going to narrowly define this problem but we need to step far enough back that we look and say population of men with a given disease or with whom we users given treatment what does that population look like and who we include depending on how we ask the question and what if that population of women look like is Louie include me asked question it may be that the studies systematically only looked at people with one problem but because women are more likely to have comorbidities in fact your question about depression is women with depression are systematically excluded from studies of other problems we're going to misunderstand what happens when we intervene on the health of women we're gonna misunderstand what conditions will look like in women and we now know that depression could be physical or social in origin and can be part of a process that exacerbates the disease or TIA signals about the extent of a disease in the course and and in part because it changes people's interests engaging in the most basic self-care other things women's usually are outstanding compared to men in terms of many kinds of self-care except around obesity risk women have higher rates of ending up with obesity but I think the kinds of biases that have happened in the questions asked and how we wanted things have happened because we've just assumed women are good at something or we've just assumed well depression is a special subset we'll get to it later bullets later it's time that we start looking at in many of these diseases whether it's depression and substance use or depression and cardiovascular disease or depression and some of the kinds of vexing pain disorders and of the webinar Marian we missed a lot of those problems and looking at things but at the end of the day it will not be a magical solution to do systematic reviews unless we bring the same rigor to looking at what's the question we're asking and what what are we not asking that may be relevant to provide Rachel's wedding here's a question it says could you say more about how depression would think could you say more about how depression can be either physical or social and origin well in the simplest case we see people who who become acutely depressed in the face of huge financial losses in the face of the loss of a spouse we would say it is normal to be depressed after the loss of a spouse it would be normal to be just depressed in the face of of bankruptcy for example or having a child who's gravely ill they would say that it was your life circumstances it wasn't innate inside of you independent of what's going around you that drove the the episodes or the experience now the resources that you have your social experience so on may shape what that trajectory looks like and they shaped by the response it serves whether or not you have health care may shape what that response is as well is that belief some kinds of supports that are available around you but those things can play out and this is a great example for thinking about that Venn diagram again because I can't point to a case and say this person it was just social and this person it was just physical I know when my great-grandmother died right afterwards her daughter the grandmother took her bed and I thought well perhaps even when your mother is about to turn a hundred it I'd always sudden it's always new it's always terrible it turned out in fact that that she had lung cancer and she died within a week but it hasn't been obvious that there was an underlying physical physiologic process going on that was making everything harder it seemed obvious everything was harder because she was dealing with her dying mother we can this attribute and the same way we can make that misattribution on an individual case we can make that misattribution about the way women are or the way circumstances are but we end up defining and the research community and as a health and health care community what is normal and looking at and developing systems to say how do we intervene what do we do to intervene along the way the other issue related that comes to mind for me goes back to that issue of differential presentation and I don't need differential presentation because something biological or social but being the non normative group having problem and one example is the area of autism like cardiovascular disease we developed our understanding of the disease by cases we identified them on males so we end up with a description of the disease that is really good at describing it among males and the kids of autism partly it has to do with young males being physically more aggressive it's a bigger problem it's a different problem not that it wasn't it's not a problem in girls but the girls weren't a problem in the classroom now that we're having more robust approaches to assessing Havens might be autism to be fair the autism spectrum if you will may include a bunch of different things we now understand it includes things that happen more commonly in females than we than we ever knew and they didn't get treated that same problem happens in cardiovascular disease we miss actually attribute what's going on in women or we step over it and and that's a huge problem in terms of what do we do with information about women who we see high blood pressure episodes during pregnancy we see maybe even create lancia we don't have a system for incorporating that into the risk calculators and even if we did for most of those women we're not talking about something that's going to happen in the next 10 years we're talking about something that's likely to happen in 20 years or so women have because of the hormones because of differences in their physiology and and very brief for anyone who hasn't thought about the physiology and cardiovascular systems in pregnancy women have a much more flexible circulatory system such that we can carry a 20% higher blood volume during pregnancy that becomes important so that you can carry a fetus but that where your flexibility means you're less likely to have high blood pressure and if you do it doesn't do as much damage those differences aside as menopause at which point we have the same risk as men and we catch up so here's another question coming in could you tell us more about the Kessler study you cited Ron Kessler when is not just one there's a National comorbidity study the National comorbidity follow-up study and subsequently these comorbidity studies have been carried out in countries all over the world very large number of countries the National comorbidity studies specifically obsessed mental health conditions and looked at the population prevalence very much so among men and women and across their age distribution to understand initial onset to understand patterns of chronicity and specifically to understand comorbidity ultimately this body of work led to a rethinking about what does it mean to have diagnoses that are entirely separate and we now do many more diagnoses and we I don't mean me and I've got a mattress or psychologist but now dual diagnosis are common and we understand that rather than just chunks all of these women with depression into depression and ignore other things the women could have depression and HD or they can have depression and an alcohol disorder they can and the one in so forth that bias itself may have kept us from including people and understanding what was going on in diseases but it is fairly common interventions and the effects that they could have a differential effects of interventions on different groups by that I mean my kind of payroll therapy or ITT and the effects of this on men or women or you know in in terms of mental health and addressing mental illness I would like to there are limits to what have been studied and I can't go beyond the data in a reanalysis that we did of depression care and I don't think we ever published this part so it's a get a limit but what I know although overall that we found that interventions were effective in men and women very similar when you separate out the different treatment arms there were differential effect and men benefited from going into the cognitive behavior therapy they didn't necessarily end up staying but when they started with an emotive behavior therapy they were more likely to end up not depressed at the end because they would go from that to medication they started medication they may or may not comply and go through it so we and it kind of went the opposite direction for women and so there it's possible as we start to look at these have through care a one-size-fits-all treatment regime may be entirely insufficient and then there are other examples where based on the age of diagnosis people who get a disease of its order younger may be very different and people who get a disease or disorder later and here I think of examples we know from rates of the city in african-americans you see earlier more rapid onset both of prostate cancer and of breast cancer the screening regime that we undertake are insufficient they don't catch early cases we haven't started the screening by then however at the same time if you have rapid acceleration of a cancer screening doesn't have a long window if you're only screening every so often to catch a lot of cases while they're still in consequential so simply moving the start date back even for minority populations wouldn't necessarily be enough but we need to think about what is again doing this kind of in diagram what do we know what don't we know where the gaps and care of are we treating a populated are we treating this population well are the answers that are out there do we have anecdotal or evidence-based data and if we only have a function than we ought to be starting to study in a sense what's happening differently in this population are there things we need to do to give people access to care is it just a problem of access and there were many fights about this around the breast cancer literature and there still are concerns about biasing treatment and to what extent is it something more than that where there may be a different almost different disease the different subsets of disease going on that can be entirely relevant if we're understanding you know schizophrenia which has different ages of onset in women is much more likely to be around the college age wait how do you avoid getting dismissed one of the problems that happens with women getting dismissed with diseases is to the extent that we offer alternative explanations about our stress level about all the other things going on in our lives back in in our differential diagnosis I mean we say well you know there are a lot of explanations for my aren't sleeping well or why you're depressed or why you're having these cardiovascular could be pretty vascular systems that are not specific we need to get better at what do we need to do to give the right diagnosis and to systematically look at whether a specific treatment works better than men than women specific orders of treatment but what different things would you like to see happen in the preclinical research or the animal research that could help inform human studies what sort of things should we be thinking about conceptually about sex and sex differences and the relates to animal study quite a bit of research here in the entire nation is focused on animals day so and then looking at sex differences what sorts of things would you want researchers to think about as they are developing their study design looking at back foot back either sex specific effects different differential influences in animals I think it's a really exciting area in part I would encourage researchers who are doubtful about what to do with what they'll find to look at some of the literature than finding incredible differences in females than males I know in a systematic review that cope when looking at alcohol behavioral responses in I think it's rap they they have very different behavior in terms of consuming and responses to alcohol in the females of the males and this wasn't previously very well understood because of the near universal use of male animals because males and females respond somewhat differently to the circumstances and they functions and a lot of this was driven by hormones so the first thing is to just be able to step back and say what is only been studied in males let's look at it in females and then to be able to start to see what are the possible explanations and we may have very different different issues in terms of what the plausible explanation in part because we know so much less about what they look like a female another piece and is to not as though that this is just going to come where they know what they're going to see you really need to be open to what what do you see in your research and larger studies have cities includes both males and females at the possibility of advancing the science faster personally I am quite convinced that there are going to be many Nobel and other prizes one out of research looking at our theories of our ideas in female populations where we haven't before in the research on medications that can flow aging we found there are a number of medications but have a little bit of impact in Iraq of ammunition pronounced are taking anything but they have phenomenal differences in the effect so as that kind of finding comes out and that gets reported in them in an alcohol intervention study in the study of animal aging and medical and some interventions that might blow spell aging in middle-aged rats imagine such a thing you don't have to imagine that and those findings come out the the question of whether to include females the question of what the value of this is immediately over so it's very interesting that I present on this to a general audience that includes some scientists they'll often be a male researcher there who works in whatever these areas just says that problem is completely gone everybody wants to study females because of what we find and and in fact in some areas of research there are researchers who completely live and now they're exclusively studying females because their selection different that they're finding out about the animal behavior whether that studying animals the lab or studying in naturalistic settings it is this is my last question and it doesn't you know is there any more question from the audience from those of you that are listening to the webinar I'll take one more I'll take one additional question if anyone wants to send anything but one of the research priorities of the NIH is suicide research suicide prevention and we know that there are differences in suicide rates we know that then there are you know there's more suicide ideation among females and although there are 10 they do not result in suicide but with men they you know when there are 10 they are it does result in death by suicide and this also suicide is also a one of those actors that could have gender components it has environmental components or stressors biological specific effect so if you could talk a little bit about what sort of things you would advise when thinking about suicide prevention research for researchers and they go forward with it knowing that this is a research priority of the NG tube there are so many things I would like to see a know about suicide historically the higher rate of completed suicides among men and has to do with the use of more lethal means and so I'm one area I'm concerned about that as around the ovarian epidemic and how is that shifting what's happening at least about the opioid attendant at the Dimmick that public conversation has been around impact a very frustrated unhappy white males when you look at the mortality mortality rates the fund bias among white females and so that makes it a different kind of pattern and whether things can correctly one interesting piece of research that was going on at IMH was trying to begin to look at in a way we never have what happens to individuals who are in emergency room or self-inflicted harm or for and so inviting them what happens in follow-up that is not historically something you've ever had data on because we don't on diagnosis and treatment who call us what and we don't do that kind of linkage and follow-up in terms of how many people spawn our living here later but there are lot of things we probably don't even know about male and female patterns to suicide whether they're whether there were lice indeed the same kind of life-endangering attempts and and were there changes in what somebody was doing to avoid getting ending up in care so some of those kinds of issues another area one of the things combining the social and the biological and understanding is there's a lot of work my colleagues that randa's done looking at suicide of the military and I have a long wondered and not been able to approach this directly would we benefit on the prevention side from talking to members of the military who are exposed to to these highly stressful situations about the ways in which your brain adapts to an environment is a function of your brain working very well now your brain working very well may over adapt you to a situation that is not work very well when you come home coming home hyper-vigilance coming home highly reactive coming home with a limited capacity of plates and it becomes dysfunctional in part because we change settings Furion but if we talked about what had happened as part of your brain works it might engage somebody in being more open to what can be offered in common behavioral therapy what can be offered in terms of teaching meditation or other practices to reduce that over over heightened regulation we there are many studies being done with military populations showing benefit but people these kinds of approaches and they're often done not from you have PTSD from argue in this position and you're experiencing problems with you know resolving conflict or with sleep and it is often than success in dealing with sleep that has someone continue to participate this is also true and women in the general population that success in dealing with sleep pleases and tactically important to our health and well-being and to our physical functioning in my own experience everyone is nicer after I sleep well if I'm not getting enough sleep and the world doesn't show up and objectively the same place so I think that there are another range of issues at a range of framing again going back to what's the conceptual model here not just of the questions we ask but how do we explain to people the origins of mental health problems and if the origins are understood by people in the military to be an indication of weakness that you always were weak or that you are individually flawed that is a barrier to treatment and care and it sounds a particular way when you have depression anxiety or PTSD already it is a barrier to your transitioning back to civilian life another issue that I have been concerned with around the military population and this is relevant others as well but is for the reserves whereas people who are in formerly in the military in active duty they may return to a base setting maybe return to a community or many people know how to connect to many services and can be looking out on their behalf when they return to the reserve from the reserves they were trained the million line probably in a rural area where there's not as intensive range of services and two of these and they're not a lot of other people there and say you know this is what it was like for me this is what you can do this is how you go and handle two things things that help a community embrace them individuals and taze them to really care is and help all of those caregivers live ido Elizabeth old has funded a lot of work around supporting family caregivers of military personnel I think we might paint the same kind of attention to helping parents understand what what is depression is what in student vitality what client in adolescence what should we be looking forward to this English pattern in students and in many cases maybe not adolescents but college students young adults whether or not they're in college and other populations if we had a brain that says this is one of the things the healthy brains do and this is what you do to go in and deal with it when you've gotten regulated to something else this is exactly what it's going to look like when you get sleep-deprived for many months or many years this is what we do in this that would be helpful both for people who experience a objective stress great real child and huge financial loss and for for those for whom there wasn't that kind of receiving of them but as long as we have stigma driving it as long as we have a sense then this was something that was always inherently wrong with you they need something to hide and it's harder to see here and so I think we can do better all of those fronts as we start to look at how do we do prevention how do we understand things how do we get better data on areas we've never collected around around suicides and what's happening great well thank you that's a wonderful way to close our seminar thank you so much dr. Byrd for your presentation and your responses to the questions and answers thank you very much for all of you that have participated and enjoy the rest of your day and this does conclude today's program you may not expect about the wonderful days
