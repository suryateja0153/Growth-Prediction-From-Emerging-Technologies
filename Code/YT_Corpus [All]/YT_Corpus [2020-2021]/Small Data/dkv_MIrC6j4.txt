 today uh we're here to talk a little bit about big data kind of a buzzword out there is what kind of tools and options do clients the size of our zoyo's clients which tend to be mid-tier or um you know smaller enterprise size clients and what what sort of options and tools do they have available for dealing with their big data needs one thing that i think is good for a smaller to medium sized businesses is you should almost always outsource your big data infrastructure needs um you know there's there's open source um there's open source software out there for handling massive amounts of data um such as like hadoop or you know some of these other systems that work in a cluster however if you're a small to medium-sized business you don't really want to hire and manage engineers whose job it becomes to maintain that infrastructure you know these are usually clusters of servers could be hundreds of servers so in those cases you're much better off outsourcing to a cloud provider such as google cloud or amazon aws both of those cloud platforms have managed products for dealing with big data i think that amazon may have probably a larger number of options but google cloud has a a small very effective arsenal of big data type products but either one is a good decision
