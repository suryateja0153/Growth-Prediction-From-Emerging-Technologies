 so today I wanted to do a quick tutorial on how to create a small multiples of visualization in Google Data studio so for this example we want to understand how different events are impacting purchasing behavior on our site so we want one segment with sessions with a video view and a purchase one session that demonstrates content downloads and a purchase and we want one segment that includes sessions with a purchase but no other events and we want a bar similar to this for each one of these different segments of users now to create this first bar all we did was come up here to add a chart and we chose a bar chart now after we did that we came over here on the right hand side and chose host name now all of our host name for all of our different sessions is going to be anvil insights comm so it just gave us this one bar that's what you want our metric is going to be sessions and then down here where it has your Google Analytics segment this is where you want to come in and choose the custom segment for sessions with a video view and a purchase once you click that it's going to ask you if you want to add it to the report go ahead and do that now we want to come up here and address a couple different style issues with this bar chart that we've imported we want to make sure show data labels is checked show axes should not be checked we want to force our axes max so for this example let's go ahead and do 2100 this allows for a little bit of extra wiggle room if next month we are seeing sessions that add up to 1,900 or 2000 we never want this number to exceed our axes max so that's why we want to add that buffer there we can choose our label font size and increase that if we need to make it a little bit more readable and we want to ensure that we do not have a legend after you've done all of that you should have a single bar that you see here now to add additional bars all we're gonna do is hit command C and command V on a Mac that's copy and paste and then we're gonna come down here and line it up exactly with the other one and these red lines in Google Data studio will definitely help you do that to where you can see that it's centered now the only thing that you'll have to do here because all of our style stays the same this come in here and choose the custom segment you've created in Google Analytics for sessions containing it content download and a purchase for this example our site is not an e-commerce site so we don't have these segments actually built in Google Analytics so I'm just gonna come in here and choose a system segment just for the sake of this tutorial now to add another bar like this you would come in copy paste it and change that segment once again that's really all there is to to creating a small multiples graph in Google Data studio if you want more tips and tricks on Google Analytics Google tag manager or Google Data studio make sure you subscribe to our newsletter on our site
