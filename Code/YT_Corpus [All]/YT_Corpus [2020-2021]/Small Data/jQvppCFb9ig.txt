 live from Orlando Florida it's the cube covering accelerate nineteen brought to you by important hey welcome back to the cube live from forty met accelerate $20.99 Lisa Martin with Peter verse you can hear all of the folks behind us on the show floor there's about four thousand people here in Orlando from 40 different countries we're pleased to welcome to the cube for the first time or in small this senior vice president of transformation and security at dimension data Warren thank you so much for joining Peter and me on the cube thank you for having me guys lots of energy behind us let's go ahead and start out so our viewers get a view of dimension data who you guys are what you do where you're headquartered yeah absolutely so first and foremost thank you again for having me I mentioned data we part of entity headquartered out of London today we're a global organization with presence in every major country as an organization we have eight billion dollars in revenue and employ about 30,000 people I'm from group security and responsible for transforming our business to be more solutions and outcome focused to help our clients with the digital aspirations your channel partner in the operational technology space with for Tina tell us a little bit about sort of the history of your partnership yeah fantastic so I so that's a new focused area for us absolutely but I mentioned that has been a longtime partner with fortunate across the entire security portfolio we've made a significant investment today and very intentional around partnering with fortinet for operational technology because we believe the ephedra approach has a good ecosystem as articulated by kin and the four trees this morning around the partners that they've sought to help clients address this operational technology risk so one of the one of the things I think it was Ken talked about this morning is this notion of how the edge is going to be distinguished by different levels of trust a little bit of background so at wiki bond we talked about how digital transformation is the process by which a business institutionalizes and operationalize it it's the role that data as an asset plays in its business so we talk about data zones having a zone of data proximate to whatever event is going to take place Ken talked about almost a zone of trust proximate to or an events going to take place in OT you're talking to an enormous number of customers about outcomes and in trying to match technology to those outcomes how does that notion of us trust being one of the primary determinants and design elements for thinking about OT yes so it's an incredible question thank you so much so I think they're two ways to answer the question so we have a philosophy around being secured by design and by nature being secured by design there is inherent trust because we understand the clients business outcome you know today we faced with an incredible amount of innovation I think we all want innovation everything that we do you know one of the one of the things I keep talking to my family about is how easy my job has become through innovation you know whether that's you know booking an airline ticket and downloading a ticket but now we talk about the credibility of that a line we talk about the credibility of in industry we talk about the credibility of the transportation industry it's not just the ticket so when we talking about the service we talk about the integrity of the airline it's all those peaceful that are integrated you know nobody talks to you today about an OT outage when your bags are delayed nobody's talking to you today about an airline delay because there's been some water leak an IOT since has detected the water leak and now they're trying to get emergency services to come and investigate the problem so I think that's the challenge that you're face to it and inherent in the secure by design being a philosophy with all business stakeholders business now have an appreciation that security is no longer that fear factor you know it's now an enabler of the business outcome that we want to deliver to our clients who are crying out for services I might say it's even part of the brand right absolutely so you know you go back to Systems Theory and you talk about a competent interface and a competent interface it's performance it's trustworthy that behaves as designed it's monitored ball it's all over with all those other things and in many respects as we move to a digital business the fundamental tenets of competency is tied into how well the network retains a security profile so that the business can take on new options but serve customers away it's expected to absolutely so one of you like I like telling my colleagues is when we see some of our you know clients that are either in the oil and gas industry or critical infrastructure when you go to a plant they always talk about fatalities they always talk about you know how many incidents have it's that real in cybersecurity today in this digital attacks you don't see it but once you automate a system or you automate part of a plant there could be some fatalities I read an article recently about how you can manipulate data that says to a patient that they aren't really sick now I'm a I'm a bit torn because you know if I go to a doctor you know I want to be told there's something wrong with me maybe I don't want to know but but battery in reality I do want to know so I can take action and that's the that's the challenge that we faced with today is that you know this uncertainty of manipulation this is uncertainty today's because as we connect these two world to create better efficiencies or to provide that better service to the patient all of a sudden is you creating more risks you know they're mini stories I can share with you you know that told to me or either our clients share with us of real-life problems if an IOT device is not protected and in most times there's a device that's connected that nobody knows about so how do you leave that conversation about security away from fear and more to this is how we can help you stop being reactive and actually be proactive yeah so you know today you wished as a team you know we talk about innovation you know today we talk about what if we talk about the value of you know the way I do my job today you know I'm collaborating the other day I did account of just in number of apps that I use to make a phone call to have a meeting with somebody you know I probably have about seven and you could you could count the same you know whether it's you know VIN the eggs or oh my so but I haven't had any Nate level of trust that that vendor that om that's provided that application to me is is trustworthy so I downloaded and I get on a meeting it's very much the same the way that I communicate and collaborate with my peers whether it's internally or externally I no longer live with the fear that someone may steal my data because I know that there's a process in place and that we put a mechanism place to make sure that critical data cannot be shared much the same with other aspects of technology if we have the conversation of the value that can be derived if there is integrity you know I look around me and it was interesting I got into the elevator yeah and pretty old elevator right but there's a level of trust that it was certified and that it is certified and it's validated that it works right so that's the only trust that I have because for those that know me I'm pretty scared of elevators claustrophobic right well so but I want to try to using you as a proxy for a lot of users because dimension data is deep into a number of global 500 companies in global 2000 companies do you think executives really understand that crucial relationship between their digital business their brand and the role that security networking specifically security will how network and security secure networking will impact their brand and their business I think they I think they starting to appreciate they impact I think it's it's much in the face now you know the numerous attacks that are out there in fact I was saying to some of my colleagues and some of my peers on Friday morning I was on a conference call it was completely it was the first time that I was meeting an individual and about three months before that I'd spoken to PC IO the employees CIO and I've spoken to him about his challenges and I was you know I was articulating the value of his brand because they make critical components of Motor Vehicles and we were talking about what if that is a malfunction so it ain't got down to this individual and we had a conversation and I and I said to him I said you know those interesting what she shared with me is because it almost sounded like I was having a conversation with you but you were talking to me so that your CIO asked you to take this action it wasn't it was it's just become a business problem that's being discussed at the boardroom level you know I think you know if you live in the US and you know like like myself you know I'm I've now become a you know a user of this thing called Amazon my wife the more frequent user myself but we rely that a parcel is delivered at a certain time and we rely on the fact that if Amazon tells us it's gonna be shipped and we will receive it in a manual he wants to have his Pokemon cards arrive on Friday not on Saturday so we have to rely that there is integrity in what they are sharing with us and that they have to rely that their partners have integrity in gear systems and they start they're going to start demonstrating that these are secure systems is all secure manufacturing plants these are secure supply chain plants what is that c-suite and I'm glad that you brought that question up Peter because I'm very always curious can't be a conversation anymore at a at the network security level because it's so we're just at the network security level so pervasive right from a c-suites perspective what are the outcomes that that cio has to deliver back to the business I mean you know you mentioned health care a minute ago and obviously that's an industry that affects every single person whether the data is true or not it affects all of us but that CIO has to deliver outcomes so that this is whether it's a hospital or an e-commerce thunder-like an amazon has to deliver to meet their customers need so how are how is dimension 8 and putting it helping that CIO meet her or his business level objective so that business is competitive is successful etc absolutely so a little bit about dimension data so you know we go to market with practices so we have a digital business solutions practice and we partner very heavily without digital business solutions practice who work with clients around ideation who work with clients around how they going to transform their business so when we talk about smart healthcare what does that really mean to a user you know from a pharmaceutical perspective from a hospital perspective how does that really help you know we've got a number of use cases we can we with demonstrate to clients you know what's the value of providing better service to someone when they are when they are first impacted of first injured we can diagnose we can detect and we can communicate back to be it the hospital or healthcare provider that's the service has high integrity and I'm going to subscribe to a health care provider or a health care practitioner that just that subscribes to a smart health care philosophy you know I'm a I'm a traveling father I'm a traveling husband but the value for me is knowing that I'm always connected and the services that I subscribe to by providers have integrity and that my wife doesn't have to provide in a the details on a continuous basis to multiple providers you know I had a I had a very very emotional conversation once to an individual who shared you know the impact of sharing data on multiple instances with multiple providers it wasn't that they had to share but it was the delay caused by having to share information on multiple instances and then be associated risk and I always I always talk about you know I gave you the example about sharing you know you know we talked about how my my 13 year old I said to him you know what don't you want me to know about you except the cautious what you shape right I got one quick question for you and we're talking increasingly about critical infrastructure essential infrastructure we got we're having more conversations on the cube but it's not broadly diffusing into the general population and a lot of that is one of the reasons for that is people think it's going to be unbelievably expensive but it seems to me and this is what I'm testing that an investment in updating critical infrastructure so that you got better security you got more network ability you are using technology more appropriately will also have the benefit that you can increase the optimization of the resources that are associated with that infrastructure is is there do you see that kind of as you work with clients do you see that kind of ameliorating trade-off where yes we have to invest in these things but there is a there's a derivative benefit there were it'll increase the optimization of them absolutely so you know I'll answer that in a number of different ways right but the first one is it is efficiency and that's what everybody's driving towards can we get greater efficiency by integrating these two worlds but as you said what they don't realize is you can't just connect these two world without making sure that they are capable of being integrated and and that's the first stance that we take with a number of clients irrespective of the industry that they in is you know what do you know and what do you think you know because if you have an understanding and you have a design of what needs to be enabled what needs to be remediated and what needs to be changed you can move a lot faster and you know who to engage in terms of partnerships you know talking about that example earlier it was absolutely you know a case where the client knew immediately that if we connect these two world the devices that facilitate the connection need to be replaced another example was you know a client was implementing a software-defined network for all your plants what they didn't realize was the technology would not enable that software-defined networking so without a plan which we've been extremely intentional in building what we call a cybersecurity advisory for operational technology networks is to help our clients with that design and that plan and methodology to go and execute last question in about 30 seconds no pressure yeah a lot of growth a lot of potential in the market that Kenzie Patrice perch talked about this morning during the keynote what excites you about this momentum that their business growth is carrying into 2019 so I think you know a number of ways to answer but 30 seconds what I'm grateful for is how is Kinsey and patrice articulated it's all about education if we have the right people we can move faster second is that there is a immense value in the integration of the F fabric network you know we see a lot of value in the client conversation that we have today's what do we have that we can leverage how can we make it better as opposed to replace that will give us the ability you know patrice mentioned the a state of 50% of organizations have unfolds and i think sometimes it may be greater because depends on who we measuring right and what's in what roles in this organization but the potential for us is incredible as a managed security service provider and a platform organization that we have the teamwork in fortunate that allows us to coexist in the platform that we are building to deliver better outcomes to our clients for it it's been a pleasure to have you on the cave with dataview it's been a great pleasure faculty we look forward to hearing more great news from dimension data and 49 over the next year and years to come thank you so much for loving you love you to be in our pleasure for Peterborough's I'm Lisa Martin you're watching the cube
