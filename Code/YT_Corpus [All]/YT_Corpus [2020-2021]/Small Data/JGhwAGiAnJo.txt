 welcome to another MedCram SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 update we had a good conference but it's good to be back what we're gonna talk about in this update are the new cases in South Korea the new criteria once again for the diagnosis a lot of you have been asking questions about infants and mother infant transmission and we'll talk about that we've got some data there that we'll talk about and also getting back to the source of where this virus actually came from we'll talk about some data there as well once again really appreciate all of the comments all of the questions and there are very good questions that you all have I'm keeping track of those as we go so here is again the map total deaths well over 2000 total recovered is around 18,000 and we can see the graphs here if we go to the world ometer they have similar numbers we've already talked about how these numbers are under estimating this we don't know how much it's under estimating but we may have a better understanding once we start doing serologies because that will test for antibodies to the virus and that will tell us a much better distribution of the population has seen this virus we'll talk more about that as we go active cases and close cases close cases 20 thousand looks like 89 percent of those have recovered in the active cases they're saying that 40 3888 are in mild condition we just don't know where we're going with those at this point if we click on the graph for those active cases you can see that they're actually decreasing according to the statistics coming out of China we've got here daily new cases and remember we had this big jump on February 12th we'll talk more about that since that time it's been decreasing total cases outside of China are still continuing to increase and that is of course a concern if you exclude mainland China in the daily cases we're still seeing some of the highest new case reports here most recently and that brings us to this BBC news article talking about the South Korean sect that was identified recently as a hotbed about 30 of the 53 cases identified today in South Korea came from the city of Daegu and was tied to one 61 year old woman who tested positive for the virus earlier in the week she belonged to this religious organization and is probably responsible for at least the 30 of those cases and so they are undergoing quarantine we'll put a link in the description below to this article also in the news we'll talk about the diamond princess ship to people from Japan who were infected on that ship have died they were both in their 80s let's move to this confusion mounds over China's counting methods as coronavirus numbers swing wildly and this is interesting because as it mentions here in the article we have Hubei Province reporting 349 cases that's in the entire province and yet at the same time in the capital of that province Wuhan there's 605 new cases all by itself so what is it that is going on here it seems as though the provincial government is not confirming cases unless they actually have the genetic testing whereas what's going on in the city of Wuhan is they're still going by the newly updated criteria which is allowing physicians to diagnose even though they don't have genetic testing they still have these scans which show pneumonia in these patients with clinical signs and that make it suspicious if you read the article it does go in to the fact that there was a sudden spike in the case numbers On February 12 which we discussed in a previous video was most likely due to the relaxing of the very stringent diagnostic criteria it's not a coincidence that the new officials from the Chinese Communist Party took over on the 12th or around that time and there's been this thought that perhaps they wanted to clear the slate get as many diagnoses on the books as possible and there's this quote from the article which basically states that the party boss of Wuhan was saying if there's one more case where to be found in a household that that districts party secretary would be held accountable and that's the show that there is probably a real push to try to get the numbers down now that the new policy makers in Wuhan have taken over anyway we will put a link to this article also in the description below so you can read it for yourself okay let's move to an article that was published back on the 14th of February in JAMA which is the Journal of the American Medical Association titled novel coronavirus infection in hospitalized infants under one year of age in China so here the N number was only nine patients but it's because they're not really seeing a lot of kovat 19 infections in these patients so out of 75,000 they've only got about a hundred or so on the books in the pediatric population so that could be because maybe the pediatric population isn't as susceptible and when they looked at these nine first of all they found that only four of them had fever only two of them had upper respiratory infection symptoms one of them was completely asymptomatic and they were tested because the family had tested positive they wanted to make sure in terms of the number of infants with severe complications or on the ventilator in the ICU the number was zero again we'll leave a link to this article in the description as well so you can read it for yourself so with all of these infections going on the CDC has put out some answers to questions about pregnant women one of the questions was our infants born to mothers at increased risk and so that's an interesting question it looks as though based on limited case reports adverse infant outcomes or preterm birth have been reported among infants born to mothers positive for kovin 19 during pregnancy however it is not clear that these outcomes were related to maternal infection and at this time the risk of adverse infant outcomes is not known here's another question can pregnant women with Kovan 19 pass the virus to their fetus or newborn and it seems as though in limited recent case series of the infant's have tested positive for the virus that caused cough in nineteen and additionally when they looked at the amniotic fluid they were not able to find a virus in there either of course when the birthing process occurs there can be a mixing of bodily fluids and that could be the source of infection in an infants after the birthing process with Zika virus that can cross the placenta it appears as though corona virus does not at this point well that brings us to one of the last stories that we want to talk about this was a really kind of concerning article that I saw here on NPR new research bats Harbor hundreds of corona viruses and spill overs aren't rare we'll put a link to this in the description below so what is this here you can see these researchers actually taking samples of saliva from bats and actually taking a rectal sample and when were they doing this not recently but three years ago when they were doing studies because of the SARS outbreak from 2002 which was linked to bats so this story talks about a organization called eco health alliance that was going out in Borneo but they also did research in China at the time and they collected specimens from bats and what they found was actually quite disturbing they found that there were over 400 different species of corona viruses in these bats now remember these bats live in caves they live together and they commune together and so there's a lot of crossover that can occur the previous thinking on this was that these corona viruses could not really jump into humans because they had to go into something that was closer to humans or that had to get a mutation so it could buy into human receptors for instance the ACE 2 receptor that we see in SARS and actually the virus that causes Kovan 19 they thought that spill overs were rare what they found was concerning because they looked at these viruses and they found that these things could infect human cells in fact they took some of these corona viruses that they found in these bats they put him on a petri dish that aligned with human cells and the coronaviruses at least some of them could infect these human cells without a problem so then they decided to go visit some humans that were living around these caves where the bats were to see if in fact these coronaviruses had already jumped into humans and when they went into the caves to do the research they found water bottles around the caves because in the summertime it's kind of cool and humans tend to go in there and also the people that were living in the area said oh yeah bats fly into the house and sometimes we kill them so there is this crossover well when they did test the humans for signs symptoms genetic traces of these coronaviruses they found them and so they concluded that spillover does occur of course this is kind of in a rural area and so this may not explode into an epidemic because it's not in a city center and the symptoms may be very mild okay now fast-forward here three or four years later of course when this new corona virus breaks out what they did was they took the RNA from this corona virus and they compared it to the four hundred different strains of the corona virus that they identified earlier in China and says here they found an extremely close match they said in fact that a viral tax ominous would probably call it the same virus species they say that suggests that this current outbreak which has infected tens of thousands of people could have come here's the word could have come directly from bats there is a larger take away he says that these bats ours related coronaviruses are actively spilling over into the human population not all of them will spark a deadly pandemic but the more frequent these spillover is the greater the chances that this could potentially be happening in future updates we're going to talk about the molecular biology of corona virus how it infects the cell let's get down to the nitty gritty compare it to the behavior of other viruses other viruses that have been brought up in this discussion for instance HIV etc and how is it that these viruses do different things what is it that they do what are their target that's we're gonna try to answer thanks for joining us
