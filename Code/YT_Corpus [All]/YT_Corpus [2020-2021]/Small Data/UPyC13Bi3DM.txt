 [Music] so even though the hype of peg data is well and truly behind us now I think it's important that we talk about small data and its applications in the real world can you give us some examples of how we tackle this problem let's think about a retail bank with a small corporate book so a small corporate book would typically be a few hundred customers and with potentially a lot of covariates there's definitely a risk of overfitting one of the ways you can mitigate this risk is by moving to quantile regression where standard OLS regression models the mean of a distribution quantile regression allows you to focus on the tail of the distribution the tail is really what we're interested in anyway those are the risky high PD customers additionally standard over less imposes a lot of assumptions on regression a quantile regression is nonparametric and it doesn't come with the same set of assumptions [Music]
