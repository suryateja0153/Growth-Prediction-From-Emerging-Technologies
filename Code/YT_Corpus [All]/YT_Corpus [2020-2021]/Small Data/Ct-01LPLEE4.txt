Data technologies of in your business or maybe you don't even know what Big Data is well don't worry because today we're gonna go over five different big data concepts simplified so stay tuned in this episode you're going to learn what Big Data is and how it can be used with five simplified examples that way the next time you're looking for data to increase your sales or to drive business decisions you know where to turn there's a lot of data out there a lot of data that you should be or shouldn't be using hopefully this will help guide you so that you can leverage the right data for your business let's get started have you ever heard the term big data may be related to a big server room where expensive computers are lined up with high security upfront or that big data could be used for advanced analytics like machine learning and artificial intelligence or you may have to view it's only for big companies in this case you're probably thinking how does big data relate to me it relates to you because you're the actual source the big data in fact we all are yes even granny's putting out big data to I'm going to give you five specific examples to help you understand Big Data to learn how you can apply it so that you can crush it the next time you're looking for data for decision-making in your business let's imagine we are owners of a hip grocery store an up-and-coming area we've been doing well the last couple years since we opened but now since the neighborhood has become a hotspot big players like Trader Joe's and Publix are looking to take our business this leaves us wondering how do we keep our customers how do we expand can this term we heard data actually help us where do we currently stand with using data in our grocery store customer shop around for a bit then ultimately end up at the cash register to make their purchase this is where the majority of our data is coming from what data do we get a purchase well for one we can track sales at different foods we are selling to answer questions like our Apple is really more popular with oranges if so should we order more so you don't run out of stock in addition we can also get customer data some of our customers enter their personal IDs to get discounts we use this in order to see their preferences and to advertise certain products though we can also get part information from our cash register too to identify which products are bought together like peanut butter and jelly this can help a product placement our store but in reality think about it is this actually enough to differentiate ourselves from our competitors not in today's world traditional data sources like cash registers just won't be enough to give us the information we need to reach our customers best there are three areas that we want to focus on first is customer engagement and behavior how our customers responding server products what are their patterns of behavior when they're in our store we also want to focus on you streams of income what other streams can we leverage to monetize our stores facility and to remain competitive we also want supply chain efficiency how can we better monitor and maintain our stock of food to save money on squirrelled inventory it doesn't sell let's see how leveraging big data can help us the first big data source we're going to tackle is social media with all the interfaces people are communicating on such as Facebook Twitter and Instagram we should be able to get some important information right let's check out our Instagram handle at grocery store we can see what customers are posting when they tag us some questions you know want to answer our how's the overall feeling of us or our customers comments more positive or are there trends from their posts that we can actually look into further we see her customers are posting frequently their home-cooked meals they are using the spicy jalapeno spot from our store for the finishing touches before they post we order these jalapenos from a special small seller out in Texas even though it's not our top selling product we can see that people who buy them are huge fans so what can I do with this well maybe we can set up a contest for best photo dinner using our jalapeno product we can post the best photo on our page this can help us to increase our customer loyalty and has our customers advertising our product that we sell to their own followers next geolocation where our customers going when they're in our store let's see how geolocation can give us valuable insight from our store cameras we can observe patterns of our customers through foot traffic we notice a pattern occurring frequently on Sunday mornings in the fall and winter there's a lot of customers that are shopping for items like wings soda chips and it can you guess why we can make an association that they're throwing a party perhaps for football Sunday and hopefully they're rooting for the Giants we recognize this behavior in real-time we can inform our customers about additional items before heading to register for example we can send them an automated notification to their phone to remind them they may want to add many hot dogs to their carts ooh by doing this and understanding their behavior we can not only increase our sales but also have our customers feeling like we really understand them next object at section uses computer vision and image processing to detect objects and images as well as and videos let's see how we can leverage it for a grocery store now you're probably wondering how is a picture of a parking lot any use for a business great question let's see if you can figure it out what do you notice about the parking lot what seems to be missing that we want more of cars more cars equals more customers but in our case only half of our parking lot is full we are wasting valuable space we observe the timing of these static images coming from our video feed and see between Monday and Thursday from 1 to 3 p.m. our parking lot is only half full how can we use this information to make more money well we can try to monetize our dilemma by renting part of it out during our slow business times this can help us to earn money as well as getting more people to notice our business so maybe some of the people using our spots are college students looking to park is close to class about getting a ticket shout out to Rutgers students after class if these students are hungry where will they go to our store hopefully example 4 relates to IOT device or the Internet of Things IOT devices are special because they can transfer data between devices without requiring human interaction with objects reporting data in real time we as users have the ability to make quicker and more accurate decisions examples of IOT devices that we use every day in our homes and mine include smart thermostats like the nest and smart home surveillance cameras like the ring but how can we apply it to our grocery store in our supply chain for a grocery store we need to monitor the status of shipments like a crate filled of fruit in this case apples with sensors RFID tags and RFID readers we can see in real-time critical information such as the exact location of the crate inside the warehouse as well as the apples point of origin and a days until expiration as well as temperature too this gives us a visible transparent process to reduce waste and gives us traceability for each of our products that way we can save money by modern in Apple's soon to expire and where they are located for some of you your small business website may serve as a simple landing page for customers to know where you are located and your contact information but it can be used for so much more than that if we have our products on our platform and the potential for customers to buy directly on our site we can generate useful information on what is resonating with them let's say that you put an ad on Facebook to attract more of our growing user base like Millennials source or through the advertisement we can gauge interests by how many people encounter the add how many clicked on it as well as session length or how long they remained on our site if our food products are showcased in well-lit photos and we supplement our website with interesting content such as a simple recipe using our products then we can garner even more visitors this can be another source of income by adding adds to our website now get me here this is huge we can get paid outside of our store hours even as we sleep how cool is that hey thanks so much guys I really appreciate your time and I hope you enjoyed this video from analytics area make sure to subscribe because we've got a lot of awesome content coming up great I'll see you in the next episode [Music]
