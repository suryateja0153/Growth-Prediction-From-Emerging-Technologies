 Do small businesses need to be concerned about data privacy? So, yes all businesses need to be concerned about data privacy. We see data breaches reported in the news on a regular basis you've probably gotten a letter in the mail saying that your data had been breached. I got one of these from the National Archives of all places, where they that had disclosed all of my personal data many years ago. So, in general small businesses don't have good data privacy policies in place and systems to secure that data. You definitely want to review that and your organization to make sure that that data is stored in secure locations on your network make sure it's encrypted. Make sure that your staff are trained on how to handle this. Some industries like the medical field have good regulations on how to do this, through the HIPAA rulings that they are required to adhere to but all businesses need to be thinking about how to keep that secure data or that sensitive data secured so they don't disclose that information on their clients and on the web
