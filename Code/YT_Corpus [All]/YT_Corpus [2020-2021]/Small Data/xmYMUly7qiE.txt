 hi my name is normally shown and I'm one of the CDC lead for the kovat 19 response in long-term care facilities today we are going to talk about how clean hands come back kovat 19 and discuss some key points for understanding the role of hand hygiene encoded 19 prevention this is part of the key Cobie 19 prevention messages for frontline long-term care staff so residents you care for in nursing homes and assisted living facilities are the most vulnerable to COBIT 19 infection because of their age frailty and chronic medical needs nursing home residents are more likely to have severe illness leading to hospitalizations and deaths 8 out of every 10 deaths from koba 19 have occurred in adults over 65 years of age we all must take action now to protect them you've probably heard a lot about hand hygiene before but did you know that nursing staff can touch up to 15 different surfaces during a single care interaction that means an average nurse working with five residents each hour would be expected to touch over 900 surfaces during a shift viruses like the corona virus causing kovat 19 bacteria including c-diff and other germs can all be spread from our hands to our resident their care equipment and other surfaces in the room cleaning our hands often during these interaction contains their spread there are four important moments when you must clean your hands before any contact with the resident or their environment before every clean procedure such as placing a urinary catheter or a peripheral IV after handling soiled items or body fluids including after emptying a urinary catheter collection bag and after touching the resident or his or her environment if you clean your hands at each of these moments you will be doing your best to protect your facility you probably had many in services about hand hygiene technique but did you know that alcohol-based hand sanitizers are preferred by the CDC for most hand hygiene opportunities and washing is recommended when hands are visibly dirty or contaminated such as after caring for residents with infectious causes of diarrhea like norovirus or c-diff why does CDC prefer alcohol-based hand sanitizers well it's because they are extremely effective against coronavirus influenza and many antibiotic resistant germs in fact studies have shown hand sanitizer is more effective than washing hands with soap and water why because the alcohol hand rubs and gels start killing germs immediately these products are easy to use because they coat the surfaces of your hands and aren't relying on perfect technique or the certain amount of time also you can put up hand sanitizer dispensers all over the building at the bedside even which is hard to do with sinks and the good news is that hand sanitizers are less drying and less hard on your skin think constantly washing your hands with soap and water we don't always think about it but our nails can actually provide a safe space for germs to hide away from the killing effects of soap or sanitizers although we all enjoy pampering our hands with manicures people taking care of residents should really avoid artificial nails and keep their natural nails trimmed that way we aren't taking a chance that our hand hiking isn't effectively getting rid of all the germs we all use a lot of gloves during resident care but we have to remember that while gloves protect our hands they are not a substitute for hand hygiene we should be cleaning our hands after every glove removal and making sure we don't accidentally use the same pair of book with more than one resident we don't realize how much we touch faces or hair or our clothing during the day so be mindful of what you're touching and definitely don't cut yourself or reach into your pocket with gloved hands also although we are trying to conserve our use of personal protective equipment we should not be washing gloves with soap and water so try to use them again so remember clean hands protect everyone you your residents and even your family do your part to stop the spread of Kovach 19 by cleaning your hands frequently and reminding others to do the same we all end us together and sometimes it helps to have a friendly reminder when we get busy support your residents been cleaning their hands too before meals after toileting and throughout the day if they have clean hands and everything around them also stays a little cleaner bring your good hand hygiene practices home as well so you your family and your community all stay safe here are links to a variety of resources available on the CDC website they provide more information about COBIT 19 additional guidance and tools thank you
