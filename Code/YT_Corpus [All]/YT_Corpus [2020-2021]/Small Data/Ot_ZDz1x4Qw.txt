 A key factor missing from current artificial intelligence systems - is the ability to generalize from only few examples. An example of small data is the personalized medicine case. For a particular patient, the doctor only has a few data points, - a few measurements. The decision needs to be made based on these few measurements. There are data from earlier patients, but they are not the same. If you have AIs that are able to operate even with little data, - then that opens doors to all kinds of personalization, - broadly defined now. We would have recommendation engines - that would be able to guess what we really want. For instance, I could imagine some future version of Siri - saying, "Jaakko, you haven't been sleeping well lately." "You haven't eaten your particular dish lately." "You're always more relaxed and sleep better - when you use some time for cooking." "Maybe you haven't gone for a run in a while." Sort of adapt to this context and really give personalized - opinions and recommendations, like Sami says. I really want a system that says: "Hey, you've had too much coffee - and have not done enough sport."
