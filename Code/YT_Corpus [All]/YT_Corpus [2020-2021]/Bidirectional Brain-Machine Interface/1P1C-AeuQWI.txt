 you're listening to forward faster bite-sized insights for entrepreneurs hello and welcome to ford faster i am sujatha ramanujan i am the managing director of luminate the program with the optics program within nexcor and i'm also a board member of the optical society and i'm here today with claudio mazzali he is a senior vp at corning optical communications an osa fellow and co-chair of fios this year so welcome to our program and we're excited to have you here thank you happy to be here sajanta so tell me a little bit about fios and what we can what are the big focus bios this year tell us about the conference sure yeah uh well it's a unique year i think 2020 is a unique year for for many things and it's going to be a unique year for files as well files is uh it's of course one of the most important conference that we have at the optical society um and this year uh we are following a few others and trying to manage that with the with the kovi challenges it's going to be a fully virtual conference uh this year and we're taking that with uh with a positive spin i think there are a few things that we can we can even take advantage of our challenges and making sure that more people can attend um the cost for attendees will be lower because it's going to be fully virtual so it's pretty much free for attendees uh the authors have to pay a small fee but uh that would allow an audience to be even bigger and there are so many things happening in optics these days that we're we're pretty excited um about the program uh we have uh fantastic plenary speakers we have federico capazo from harvard he's going to be talking about meta surfaces and and some really disruptive technologies uh in that area uh nurgis mavel from mit also with some amazing work on detection of gravitational waves using optics so lots of lots of different things the conference this year not only is co-located or or co-happening since it's virtually uh with ls but also with quantum 2.0 so the quantum 2.0 conference will be happening at the same time and we are taking advantage of that so there is a lot of emphasis on quantum as well and regarding regarding teams we're going to cover the typical the typical topics of frontier and optics that we do every year we're going to have a little bit more specific theme around ar vr and as i said we have some visionary speakers that will talk about some other areas quantum optics uh ultra fast spectroscopy and some other areas so we're pretty excited about it so this is the first time it's been online so do you how many people do you think will come and is it it's always been an international conference so do you expect it to be bigger or the same size what are your thoughts around as soon as we we communicated that this would be a fully virtual conference then we got a peak in the number of paper submissions i think everybody was just waiting to see if they would be able to participate and come to dc or now that's virtual uh we actually get a very large number of submissions so uh the number of papers is pretty high higher than in prior year which is great uh so people are willing to share their work and to of course interact with the community even in this in this new um format um i think the audience is going to be probably larger and the reason is because well you don't need to travel and and you can't attend from whatever you are uh there are some limitations of course when you think about time zones uh our colleagues from asia may have some more of a hard time to attend during the entire day perhaps but i i believe that we're going to have more people attending it also bring being being virtual it brings some other flexibilities right for instance um i think we're going to have more oral talks frontier in optics is very famous for the for the poster presentations of course uh we we have a a a format where it's a kind of a poster presentation online but we also have more time for oral talks so people that were on the on the edge they may be invited to give a oral talk so that may also um be pretty good so again we are i i don't want to say that we know how to do this we are learning i think optical society actually did a fantastic job at ofc ofc happened when things were starting to close in march and they had to do a kind of a hybrid uh overnight between face to face and virto and i think it worked well uh cleo was already virtual and i think we got some good feedback but every conference the optical society is learning and um i think by the time of frontier and optics in september i think would be i i think this would be a very good conference great so covert is really changing how associations serve their mem i see that we have this virtual conference which personally as a student i would have found it really exciting because i remember when we were an early professional when you couldn't go to very many conferences because they're financially limited they'd only send one or two people so this is i think very exciting for people who otherwise would not have had a chance to go so i see that as kind of a good thing that the society is doing but can you comment on some of how the association is changing in general the service members what have been some of the you know difficulties you've seen and what do you think of some of the potential opportunities that usa could take advantage of yeah so you mentioned one right i think uh we i mean we we all have that experience that when you're a student uh you you have to fight for that grant even if mainly when you're from a different country i i did my undergrad in brazil and i remember that you know you finish work and you want to present your paper and after you do that all that you have to apply for a grant to see if you can you know get your your air ticket to come to us for another place to present your paper so i think this would allow more students and we know the optical societies is in a in a continuous effort to be as global as possible and making sure that we have participation from from students and scientists and industry and of course companies uh from from all countries and increase that diversity of inputs that we get so i think this would allow us to do more however i i want to be realistic right i think that um in the in the academic world or let's say in the scientific world not only academia but also uh industrial um uh it's it is super important to have the personal interaction so i want to make sure that we don't get into the hype of like you know the world will be online moving forward uh no it won't i think that it's gonna be much more uh online than we we are used to and i think that's a good thing um but i do think that the the direct uh uh connection is super important uh and that will continue so what may happen i believe is that uh we're gonna have a lot of the the information sharing the content sharing being more online and you may end up having uh specific face-to-face interaction opportunities where really you're gonna focus on that you're going to focus on workshops where you have a group of people sitting in a in a room and discussing uh discussing a new area new technology not that not the broadcast from the speaker to the audience that can be more online but that workshop uh spirit right where you have people working on the same area that are sitting together and discussing that that is too important can be done online yes it can but uh i i think that the personal face-to-face is super important will continue uh i think so i'm going to take a little sideways step here so that's you know virtual and what covert has brought us but let's talk about optics now what are the trends you see occurring in optics what are some things that you see happening that are really exciting yeah so um well i mentioned one of our plenary speakers uh dr capaco federica paso from harvard he's going to be talking about meta surfaces in flat optics that's to me in an area that uh it's ready to provide some breakthroughs in real applications what's what's exciting to me about this technology is that uh there is fundamental understanding of optics going on in that area but is extremely close to real applications so i i come from from the industrial world right so i work for a company and we have our the company that i work with for corny invests a lot in r d so huge investment in labs and of course the the connection between a new um a new area in science without real applications in real life and products or technology that people be using if that connection is shorter right that becomes more exciting right it's more like okay we can we can learn here and we can transform that in something that's useful for people very quickly meta surfaces to me is an area that uh that has that that that aspect i see components being developed as we speak into that area that will be big disruptions for in the area that i spend most of my time which is optical communications when you think about integrated optics co-package optics silicon photonics all those areas i think we're gonna we're gonna enable a few things that were very different to now and i think the era of meta surface is one that has a huge potential and the other one um of course there is ar vr that people are excited about but then if i go to the other extreme which is something that is super cool super interesting from the fundamental of fundamentals of optics and physics in general um but not as close to products yet it would be the quantum quantum optics which is another area that we're trying to emphasize with uh fios in quantum 2.0 that specifically to me has again a huge potential for for breakthroughs including the area that i work when you think about quantum cryptography quantum communication and then you go to quantum computers uh there are different schools of thought on that area but i i am a believer that optics is gonna play a very critical role uh to to enable that and to me what's interesting about quantum optics is that um it's not only a specific new area of optics or anything like that it's an application of optics that would require many different sub sub areas of optics uh transceivers devices there are there are many different things in optics that uh will be required that to be developed at a different level to enable this kind of subsystem of a quantum quantum optic system either for communications or cryptography or quantum computers um in in i'm happy to see that countries governments and countries are putting more and more emphasis and providing more funding for that for that air in general i think we're going to get the critical mass that is that is necessary so i'm excited about that too and of course there are so many other areas we work in optics so we are usually optic fanatics but i'm giving you two that i think are unique so where do you see where do you see things in 10 years it's been such an such a strange year scientifically as well as in so many ways that um i think it's cost a lot of us to take a step back and really imagine what things will look like yeah you know i keep thinking about that sujata because uh you know again working for for an industrial uh lab um it's uh it's super even when you do road mapping right you need to kind of predict the future or you need to uh do some future shaping if you can but we keep thinking about that um if i you know the world is very broad right so if i narrow down to the areas that i feel i'm a little bit i'm allowed to talk a little bit uh one area that if you look at the last several years and what's happening more recently i think the efficiency of of us as a society is growing very quickly we are getting things done in a much more effective way and when you think about that and what's happening now there is a there is a group of things or a set of things that are happening at the same time that i think will create a bump on that that efficiency that probably is going to be something that we never saw before and let me explain a little bit more what i'm talking about uh when you combine the the availability of communications that we have today and again that's my area right optical communications when you combine how much bandwidth people have today or who have even more in their houses uh in their offices pretty soon and you combine their optical communications 5g which is connected to open communication so if you if you start looking at that ability to get information then you add the fact that this those networks now they are all symmetrical they are bi-directional so it's not just you get information from a centralized broadcasting source exactly you provide information right the the upstream uh content now is coming from everybody kids with their videos they are learning how to use that network but imagine in the future when those kids are are 10 years older so the network now allows the entire world to provide that information back and forth that's one now this is happening at the same time that things that like machine learning and augmented reality and artificial intelligence are getting to a point where they are really useful they're not just a topic of science they are useful uh if you look into the hyperscale data centers right the the google facebooks etc microsoft they are super computers right their data centers are really super computers there are huge artificial intelligence machines that are running algorithms that are transforming this amount of information that the entire world is creating and uploading to the network in useful things we always gonna go through a phase where they are not so useful or they are used just for market applications or to give you the right advertisement sure there is that peace but if you just think about the potential of that right you have all this information coming from everybody get into those humongous super machines with uh very capable artificial intelligence machine learning i think this will create a such a transformational way into health care how can we how can we discover uh solutions or or cures for new diseases how can we help with populations that are in trouble or you know poverty uh how can we how can we bring the value to those communities that don't have access to things that we do that we all have access to so um i i think that's a it's gonna be a bump in efficiency that i'm hopeful that the the human kind will actually use that in a in a good direction and and to to distribute that good view and help everybody so that's that's what i hope maybe i'm too too rosy on the future here but that's how i like to think at least well i like a rosy future as well i don't blame you there's no point in catastrophizing so i'm going to ask you one last question but before i go there is there something you want to just share with our audience something like hey this is on my mind and i'd like to let you know about it uh no i think i think connected to the your last question right i i i do think that um sometimes in the world we are united states now in this country there are so many things going on uh some of them that are making us rethink the way that we live our lives the way that we treat people the different people uh and i think we sh we should all think that we can now we can all help uh and this kind of posit positive view of the future is because i believe on that i believe that if we all realize that we have our mission here and we can help each other and we can treat people uh like uh like they you know they have to be treated and we can we realize we're not in denial uh about the differences in in the world that some people may need more help and the folks that have the capabilities they they should be helping that to spread to spread that uh uh that richness that we have in this planet right um i i think we may be going through a phase now where we're realizing that and and i hope not only um for where we are today but for the future things will be much better so anyway it's back to your to your last question i'm i'm a uh a naturally optimistic person so so tell me something and this is that standard question that interviewers ask what are you reading lately what's on your book shop yeah right i need to have a uh an answer ready for that well i'm uh i have to tell you that i'm not a very uh disciplined reader from the following perspective i don't read like one book than another i i have this problem that sometimes i start two or three books at the same time and reading them in parallel and then i keep jumping from one to the other and uh just being sometimes it works pretty well because i start making connections between them sometimes create a big mess in my in my brain but that's what i do and i uh just recently i finished a book uh uh that was about boatsman and talk about his equation uh uh but that's what i finished uh right now i'm i'm in between two books one is a re-write a re-reading uh the book is called the beat and the pendulum uh it's from tom siegfried it's an it's a very interesting book about the physics of information so it basically goes into the fundamentals of uh you know how a beat is how much energy you need to create a bit of information how much energy you need to delete a bit of information and tom the author tom sigrid he's a he's actually not a scientist he's a journalist and he interviewed many people's academia industry etc and he wrote in a beautiful way uh how this the physics and the energy behind information which we usually don't make that connection between real a real entity a real physical entity and information uh but i have a pet passion for that topic so the beat and the pendulum tom secretary that was a good one it's a notebook and i'm rereading it uh and the other one i i actually i learned about this book in one of those interviews when somebody asks somebody what you're reading uh and it was uh life 3.0 life 3.0 is a book about it's from max techmark it's from mit and it's about special intelligence but it's a different approach is basically explaining a few fundamental concepts of artificial intelligence and the impact of that on society so um yeah i'm in this right now i'm in my my phase of information and ai and in this learning excellent so uh i'd like to take a moment here to thank you for joining us this is a fun thing that we like to do so to
