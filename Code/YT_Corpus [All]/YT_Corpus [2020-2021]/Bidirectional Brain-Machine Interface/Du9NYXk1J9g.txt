 hey guys Kriben Govender from the gut health gurus podcast I've got a background in food science and today I have an amazing guest his name is Roland pankovitz do I get that right Roland nailed it wonderful and good and he and he's he's known as a prodigy of a guy with an equally difficult name to pronounce tag Ted it's a crew say I'm not too sure if I got that right but Roland's being very very kind to me so I do appreciate appreciate the sentiment Roland and roll of what I want to say is huge thank you for coming on to the podcast oh it's absolutely my pleasure thank you for uh thank you for exposing me to more of the Commonwealth I mean you're in Australia right yeah Melbourne Australia and today so we back we got that connection so it's good to make friends right exactly connecting from halfway across the world I love that and and I really I really want wanted to get someone on to the podcast with that kind of scientific mouse behind mitochondria because we've had some mitochondria people amazing mitochondria people but what I wanted to do is really break down the connection between mitochondria the gut gut microbiota gut microbiome so I thought Roland who's an amazing speaker such an engaging knowledgable fellow and I thought I have to get him on to the podcast to have a chat and and make it crystal clear that mitochondrion gut are implicitly connected and fundamental for our wellness so firstly Roland and I always ask this question who is rolling penguia CH oh my goodness well it was a dark day in August of 1986 when no joking that's a good question you know it it's hard to pigeonhole myself to Who I am I'm someone who loves what it is I do for a living and I'm someone who I hope one day can play a role in changing the perspectives of how we see health I don't necessarily want the notoriety or the glory for that I actually am quite crowded verse but it's more like I see what people are becoming pulled towards in health and wellness and it's becoming more knowledgeable it's becoming more accountable for their actions and along the way I think there need to be specific nodes in the network who can help shine lights and shed perspectives you know you mentioned my mentor I remember a conversation I had with dr. tad who is brilliant man who's done everything and anything and he said you know Roland the most valuable thing someone can share with you in the world is perspective so You Know Who am I I would like to be someone who shares perspective with people and even if I never meet a multitude of these people that this ends up helping I know that I would be happy just the knowledge that that could potentially be so that maybe is it's part of the question and the other aspect is um you know I'm someone who's always been interested in health and wellness I used to be a high level athlete doing professional and amatuer martial arts I had a background in exercise the mechanics for many years so I used to fix broken people from a physical perspective and then was encouraged to go to school for nutrition because those who were in exercise kept asking me advice on nutrition because I knew it was my interest went to school at a nutrition school called the Institute of holistic nutrition in Toronto after I got out of there I knew I wanted a little bit more as far as the clinical side and the the intersection between alternative health and clinical was at the time functional medicine so I started studying some functional medicine and as I got through that I started podcasting myself and I started interviewing these greats no different than what you're doing although just sounded like I called myself a great man you are really awesome at what they did and they share amazing perspectives so it helped me learn more and then I got connected with the founder of health optimization medicine and in the interview he actually said to me you know you're gonna bring it to Canada and at the time I would come again because for me it was this holy shit moment and then lo and behold January 2017 the first gathering of health optimization happened and now it's become a world movement to where I have a clinic I operate in Toronto just outside rather I have clients all over the continental United States I have clients in Manila I'm taking off the Zurich for a conference in evolutionary medicine next week so it's become this world global scale thing that has me always just laughing and so grateful for this you know as Canadian guy who liked health and look where it is now you know I have someone from Australia who wants to know what it is I have to say so I'm just enthralled by the whole process absolutely and I mean it's such an honor you know that was one of the questions I was gonna ask you is how you actually met met Ted because I look at Ted and I think man when I when I get to that age I have no idea how old Ted is ageless timeless and formulas exactly I think well if I when I get to that age I hope I look half as good as Ted because I mean I mean the way you look is not the only metric but the guys I mean the aura that he puts out when you watch him on screen is like just wellness and you just look so healthy if I could describe what healthy should look like without doing blood works or anything like that I would say yeah I want to look like this guy when I hit that eight yeah I mean that's the key right it's you know I always say we are the sum of our inputs meaning that if you imagine the human body as an organic robot and it has all these inputs most of them external some of them internal the some of our inputs can be harmonious and and know that harmony should be to the tune of health hmm and then the output is a manifestation of health as you see it as you live it you look at someone be like yeah person knows something or I want to know what it is they do it now that's kind of that's the infection the health and wellness addiction that I want to put out to everyone so that's my whole that's the ethos that's the whole purpose that's wonderful thank you thank you so much for sharing your origin story for one of a better word Roland so let's let's dig into it say say today we so I said it again a shovel that's thinking to it her let's dig into it absolutely so what what I thought we would lay the foundation for the conversation by defining some of the the broader topics that we're gonna be talking about today so how about we start with let's start with the mitochondria because I know Ted's huge on mitochondria and his work of mitochondria and yourself it's a big area of focus yeah so let's define to the people and we've had other guys talking about mitochondria Berlitz let's from your perspective what what is a mitochondria well you know it's funny I actually was doing some research and there's one thing that everyone knows as a buzzword when they hear mitochondria powerhouse of the cell I can tell you that term was invented in 1957 as I read still the main thing that one associates mitochondrial function with it's the organelle so it's a it's a structure inside of the human cell that takes the proteins the carbs the fats but hopefully mostly the cards and the fats that we eat and it converts them into what I call the cell cellular energy currency ATP adenosine triphosphate through a series of enzymatic steps both with and without oxygen so basically if one is eating a sweet potato or they're having some coconut or whatever it is they're eating after the digestion process has been facilitated those compounds are being transported to the cells because energy is primordial to function and an optimal function of that you know without optimal energy a cell doesn't have the ability to do what it is as a cell it can't divide it can't output various compounds it can't operate in its specialized nature so the mitochondria is the thing that primarily helps power up the cell it also has some other important functions like it is the thing that senses any kind of external threat to the cell you know there's something by a very awesome researcher of a Robert Navi oh he coined something called the cell danger response and you know when a virus a pathogen something is trying to get access to the resources of our cells it's the mitochondria that change the sensing switch inside the cell in order to help make it inhospitable for that thing to survive mitochondria also regulates cell lifespan via attack fujian apoptosis and they also regulate calcium metabolism inside the cell so they have a multitude of different roles I should probably mention they also are a major factor in epigenetic control - mmm baby health of a cell is down to the health of the mitochondria and then the health of all future mitochondria is directly correlated to what you do to them or subject them to based upon your lifestyle your diet your activity factor even your thoughts and your emotions all of those things are influencing mitochondrial function so they really are one of the guys that's been charged in terms of making sure that cell can function optimally well that's that's incredible that that's such a succinct description of the function of mitochondria and and one thing we could explore a question for you what's what's your thoughts on mitochondria and the production of matrix water matrix water is that like the special kind of water like the deuterium depleted stuff that house is absolutely you know here's the thing there are a lot of I don't want to put them as gimmicky things but there are things that are promoted in the industry I'm not an expert in the deuterium depleted water or anything of that nature in regards to consumption of it I know that you know through mitochondrial function there's this process it's called uncoupling which increases the thermal heat production of your mitochondria and water in our cells if you've read the fourth phase of water by dr. Gerald Pollack you know it acts like a battery because it becomes charge separated so the exclusion zone water happens close to that infrared heat to the spit out I don't know what happens when you consume swallow and digest the water via oral consumption I think that if one has optimal mitochondrial function there might be optimal amounts of matrix water inside their cells providing that their cells are healthy and functioning optimally I don't think it's gonna hurt you to drink that kind of water but at the same time I don't know how we measure a difference you know what I mean because the health optimization perspective is testing and measuring everything so your objective is you can be in a health practice versus the subjective thing to say say someone subjectively feels better from something I'll never discredit that but I don't know what mechanisms are at play so enjoy that I haven't really dug into it too much fun being honest yes the like where I was going with that was wasn't consuming a de team to play the water it was about the cell itself having a proton gradient I think in use we've spoken about this before as well the cells ability of the mitochondrial ability to discriminate between deuterium and normal hydrogen yes yep said to your point producing your own de Tyrian depleted water for one of a better word say a hundred percent it's one of the perspectives in evolutionary biology is that you know we've been doing these things long before someone realized a methodology of finding in other ways so if one wants to optimize that process do what you can back to the explanation of the inputs to optimize the input so your mitochondrial function can uncouple and not uncouple or it can optimize a gradient versus spitting out too many free radicals or create deuterium rather than concentrate hydrogen absolutely yeah absolutely and I think you now the next one point there as well the mitochondria are producing Heat they do yeah so that that's that that's gonna be what pretty important if if you jump on a time machine and go back 20,000 years I'm thinking of this poor old caveman sitting in this freezing cave maybe somewhere else in Alaska Canada that's the thing and if you look at a lot of people who have chronic low body temperature you know you look at thyroid issues you look at people who have things like chronic fatigue syndrome various elements where there's always a mitochondrial connection and if there's mitochondrial dysfunction you know the gradient listen so efficiently and the uncoupling proteins which are what attach electrons from that gradient to increase heat production thermogenesis it doesn't work so well and that also means that fat metabolism will be compromised because that's the only way that you can burn fat for energy is via mitochondrial function exactly and there's this anyways we can go down so many different rabbit holes but one I did want to explore and you touched on it and which I found fascinating listening to you speak about it was about the defense mechanism in the the sensing aspect of a mitochondria and how does that work wrong so the mitochondria are always speaking back and forth with the nucleus of the cell to basically check in for like a better description and that's how you know I I don't want to use the word a quarterback because I also don't know what Aussie Rules Football equivalent quarterback is it's something that makes major calls in terms of changing the internal status of the cell do they make it more oxidized or do they make it more reduced you know and reducing agents are attractive to things like viruses pathogens whatever because they want to utilize the resources inside the cell to replicate their own DNA like a virus will insert its DNA into the nuclear DNA and it will use the resources of the cell to feed itself and sustain in itself and that is not you know health-promoting to the hosts us the human being so the danger response usually initiates from binding mechanisms there are these things that are called pattern recognition receptors PRRS and there's two main ones that get triggered there's damage associated molecular patterns damps and then there's pattern associated molecular patterns which would be pimps that's how I remember the shorthand bacterial antigens are various things can bind to these receptors inside the cell and then the binding of those receptors it's almost like initiating a program response because if the cell is sensing threat and that threat is gonna have the resources of the cell be consumed and not for the sales benefit but for something else's benefit well then the mitochondria will start spinning out a whole bunch of reactive oxygen species it will oxidize the cell which will take energy away from the cell to build compounds that those viral or bacterial factors could then use for their own resources so it's responding to an external threat you know if you look at a imagine a movie right and then you're inside this camp and then there's there's cameras on the exterior and there's motion detectors when something trips the motion detector the alarm beep starts going off and then all the troops are going to their positions it's the same kind of fractal pattern that's existing inside the cell so the mitochondria are the thing that changed the internal status of the cell because if Estelle's more oxidized it's a more inhospitable environment for anything to live in so it's either the cell will choke out the virus or the pathogen or the cell will commit its own suicide via apoptosis in order to prevent the spread of that viral pathogen whatever it is into other neighboring cells and as a result it will communicate with neighboring cells so they might initiate the same program Wow that is right that's just wow what a way to start the podcast with that bit of that treat bomb and it's it's incredible like the night intelligence of these these little archaic bacteria they originated to be a bacteria totally separate from a eukaryotic cell let's just see when you think about the the body it's really the story of microbes isn't it you've got you've got the mitochondria which are a colony of a cake bacteria that are living in the cell that now have become organelles within the cell and then you've got the microbiome which we will dig very deep into very shortly sorry say that again it's a deep shit exactly pardon the pun that's okay yep say you met there's a couple of other so it's very clear to me that they are very important in terms of the immune system and the way the immune system functions and correct me if I'm wrong but they initiate this almost this alert status if this if the body becomes invaded with a virus or some form of pathogen so it's putting all the troops all the immune cells on high alert is that how you would wear the cells yes but also it changes the activities going on inside the cell you know what I mean so whereas you know the ribosomes are gonna be building proteins and stuff of that nature you know now the old coins these as polymers there are structures that are being complexly built then what a country will actually oxidize this tell enough to have those broken down so the cell goes catabolic so it basically stops the growth process starts the initiating the breakdown process and as a result it will attract the mean cells and various other things that can maybe go to the site of that infection and help gobble up some of the collateral damage for like a better description but you know a lot of the immune cells have their own mitochondria as well so if there if the danger response is being initiated then it's changing the default state of the immune system to be more reactive it may be raising th one or th two or th17 style responses and it's going to direct certain immune cells to make higher levels of cytokines those inflammatory signal molecules and then direct certain immune cells to activity via gobbling you know macrophages started building things up you know monocytes go to the site of inflammation and they basically start to help break down the inflammatory tissue or the inflammatory byproducts so yeah it's gonna be a body on high alert and it's an on it's a specific but a nonspecific response what I mean by that is this likely happens in various scenarios of inflammatory conditions so it's not necessarily pigeon-holed into oh this is only with autoimmune it's with an inflammatory status so this is what's happening inside the body so you can imagine if this is localized to an organ then that organ isn't going to become to a degree dysfunctional because an organ is nothing more than a collection of specialized cells mm-hmm absolutely so in layman's terms if I get this right the mitochondria are modifying the environment around the cell and within Coran within the cell and you mentioned these words and some people might not be familiar with it react reactive oxygen species or Ross you're able to define what these are and how they are created and how they signal yes so I mean reactive oxygen species a synonym is called a free radical so it's a fancy way of saying it's something with an unpaired electron an unpaired electrons are somewhat renegade they're unpredictable in their behavior and because they crave an electron anything they touch they oxidize right they steal an electron from it and leave that thing with an unpaired electron that's the textbook way of explaining it the layman's terms way of thinking of a free radical or a reactive oxygen species it's a compound that's a signaling molecule and the signal or the message it promotes is oxidization because one of the main concepts inside the cell is what's called redox reduction and oxidization balance and a healthy cell a cell can reduce and oxidize that will because it's always gonna be making reactive oxygen species via mitochondrial existence the main purpose for reactive oxygen species their signaling molecules if there's too many of them and the cell is enough antioxidants you know superoxide dismutase catalase glutathione peroxidase and in some cases compounds that we eat from various foods then if it goes to oxidized then something in act as an antioxidant and bring it back in the balance i'm trying to do this little teeter totter thing in my hand however in some cases the mitochondria or series of mitochondria because there's never just one like a book to fix inside the cell there's up to a thousand in certain cells or more it will overly oxidize and respond to a threat of its internal environment so the reason you overly oxidized a cell if something is causing a cell to be unable to function that cell will then oxidize to either initiate destroying whatever is trying to inhabit it or it will kill the self or trying to contain what's in there via apoptosis you know there's two ways to settle death apoptosis is an implosion so the cell dies the mitochondria is also the main switch with that with something called cytochrome C oxidase and the apoptosis will basically say initiate self-destruct but don't damage anything peripherally Wow crow sis is the opposite that's an explosion and then all those inflammatory compounds are going to affect peripheral cells and maybe cause them to become overly oxidized so the free radicals have a double-edged sword they're great signaling molecules it's how the mitochondria communicate with a nucleus to correlate energy status inside the cell or various other things inside the cell to change the genetic transcription of that cell but in high quantities it overly oxidizes the cell so think of it as rusting the cell prematurely hmm so you kind of rusting from the inside out if there's too much oxidation going on and then a car that's overly I mean in Australia and for you guys don't see too much rust but in Canada with all the salt in the crap we put on the roads in the winter if a car starts to rust on the surface it's just a little bit of surface rust it's more cosmetic but if the rust enters the chassis systemically then the chassis rigidity becomes compromised because the rust and metal is weak so if you get an accident the car is gonna fold in half like an accordion same kind of concept of the body right a little bit of rust here and there you can buff it out east and it you know you patch it paint it but if it's systemic then you know that the the tissue is becoming very damaged because the healthspan of that tissue is shrinking it's reducing and then symptom disease state whatever happens I love the analogies you gonna keep those analogies scary they're awesome and now these are metaphors I was just teaching tools ever so good you can't you kind of look like Jesus a little bit say it's like it like the Passover Jesus fuck Isis like if I guess today is Jesus Christ it's a great like I know this guy from somewhere but I don't know why I like him by the way he comes up with all these parables do you think well there's a really strong scientist and what and what I kind of I love about that connection Mart with Rosa did we phrase just the video part you know can he me hello ah you're back Oh oops welcome back welcome back yes thank you a slight technical issue that we're back we're back online so what are we saying maybe but what I was saying about the the engine analogy and maybe you could elaborate a little bit more about this but whatever it is that the the mitochondria I have this what we call an ATPase that spins literally like an engine yes smallest rotary motor yeah yeah are you able to expand on that yeah I mean well basically go into cellular respiration a little bit right so the whole goal of the mitochondria is ability to create energy is to survive or to promote cell proliferation optimization of function and it does that through a gradient right so it's a difference between positive and negative charge and it's the energy potential of that gradient meaning if the inside of the matrix is negatively charged and just outside is positively charged it's the protons rushing through that motor that initiate the spin so something is powering it and the spin is doing nothing more than combining ADP which is identifying adenosine diphosphate with in organic with organic phosphate so it just basically smashes these things together and spits them out and it basically throws them into the cell from my understanding to be utilized by anything that requires energy to do work so the motor is being turned to generate energy currency for the cell and that energy currency is being gobbled up by the cell in order to perform work the process of aerobic respiration which is the one that that we should focus on based upon that's what mitochondria are meant to do is you know you have these cytochrome proteins you have first fret cytochrome you have your complex two you have your coenzyme q10 you have your third complex you have set a chrome C oxidase and you have your v complex ATP a s right so it's basically that electrons that come in from the Krebs cycle are being passed across these cytochrome proteins for every electron that comes in a proton gets pumped out because the body likes balance positive and negative charge together neutralize each other so when they're pushed apart these you know cytochrome so rather these electrons are going across as gradient and they're creating this difference in charge for energy potential and the whole goal is to get that energy potential to spin this little rotary motor to make ATP and you know we talk about ATP everyone knows aerobic respiration via glucose you know you make 38 ATP but if you look at the other side of it your body can also burn fatty acids and one molecule of palmitic acid yields about a hundred and nine ATP so it's more energy efficient to be burning more fat for energy predominantly than it is for carbohydrates it's just you know more common to study glucose because it goes from glucose to pyruvate to acetyl co a and what I always say is to a degree your body doesn't care what it turns into energy because fats and carbs both get converted into the same molecule that enters the TCA cycle and that spin of that cycle just spits out electron donors that run the electron transport chain to the mitochondria so the goal is just to keep that process moving very efficiently and to come back to your original question you know how about free radicals or reactive oxygen species they get formed when electrons don't go down the gradient they leak out at specific static room sites the principal side of is the first set of chrome and I believe the most second common sight is the third set of chrome where they leak out so the problem is when this electron leaks out and combines with a molecule of oxygen you get a reactive oxygen species molecule of oxygen with an extra electron without a pair and then that thing can go around and oxidize whatever it does end up touching so if someone is experiencing high levels of Ross it just means that the gradient and their mitochondria isn't very efficient maybe there's a protein assembly issue maybe the membrane itself is too porous there's too much leakage out of the membrane and we can't measure those per se you can measure certain things on the results of metabolomics testing clinically but usually when you're looking at anything where there's mitochondrial dysfunction you know there's a down regulation of gradient potential there's a regulation of reactive oxygen species production and that alone will set off a chain of reaction of the events inside the mitochondria but also inside the cell mmm that's a wonderful description I did want to cover that as well with all the different different sites on the mitochondria and you've so eloquently described it and hopefully people can follow along with with how it functions the electron transport chain there's something really quickly to share my screen yeah absolutely this might help see right here on the left-hand side mm-hmm so that that's what I was basically talking about right you know you have your first complex you have your complex 2 if your third complex you have your cytochrome C oxidase which is a little guy that's in lighter blue here you have complex 4 and this rotary thing this this thing that looks like kind of like a weird shape and chess piece upside down that's the guy you were mentioning in regards to creating ATP you're taking the sum of adp adenosine diphosphate plus one phosphate molecule and you are actually creating ATP from it so it mean the process in and of itself is pretty simple it's getting to the point to say the process is simple that's a little more difficult because it requires digging into some textbooks and making sense of systems and processes and then you say well how do i how do I apply this oh okay I get it now absolutely I'm 100% with you rollin and if someone there's listening to this and their heads starting to hurt the key takeaway is that there's this literally this little spinning motor inside the mitochondria that's producing an energy currency that then the body uses and if you're not if this whole system is not working properly we're gonna see dysfunction in mitochondria which correct me if I'm wrong role in our present in all cells aside from red blood cells yes they give off their mitochondria as they're being formed to donate the iron because there's a lot of iron sulfur clusters inside but they don't have any mitochondria you're absolutely correct there's also a gradient of my mitochondrial concentration in certain cells you know muscle liver and brain cells from my understanding of the highest concentrations of mitochondria per cell right energy absolutely makes perfect sense and I think that's a great segue now to talk about the gut yes because my understanding is cuz you mentioned all these major organs in the body the brain the heart the gut is also the the biggest interface to the outside world and I think you've touched on this as well it's the gut actually sits outside of the body it's the last line of outside of the body I've said that in but in the podcast before because Kelana sites and tera sites every cell and in the gut has a high concentration of mitochondria because those cells are so important for absorption for mucosal production for the creation of immune cells antimicrobial peptides so the mitochondria in the GI system the cells themselves are the direct interface with the rainforest that is our microbiota microbiome interaction so yeah that that's a great segue and those mitochondria have the ability to influence the function of the mitochondria systemically through the activation of certain genetic transcription factors things like PGC 1-alpha AMPK certain proteins because what happens locally affects the body systemically nothing is truly separate medicine we segregate cardiology neurology and nephrology but well affects one thing affects everything question-there just pause you for sick why do we see this is a subtle elated question I'm glad but why why do we see typically this dysfunction showing up in the gut very early dysfunction of what context like just general dysfunction in relation to other disease states yeah you see you know how this like this this sang from who was it one of the philosophers all disease just begins in the gut Hippocrates Hippocrates he's the one exactly well you you coined it very well it's the last interface with the outside world so if something from the outside world is becoming a problem being an input signal or if the the organ that I call the microbiota has become imbalanced then that's gonna drive an inflammatory response or an imbalance a disharmony inside the gut that will then ultimately affect everything else in the body why because there is a as a paradoxical thing about the GI system what I mean by that is if it were meant to be super not permeable meaning if we're meant to be such a rigid barrier it wouldn't be constructed as it was it's actually meant to be an absorbent of system first a barrier second because if you look at how the guts constructed there's only one layer of cells that is basically between the absorbent of surface the lymphatic system in the bloodstream and then the gut itself which is the lumen the tube so the reason that we see things show up early in the gut and then later on downstream is because it's very possible for whatever the result of the inflammatory response being in the gut to then get through that poorly constructed barrier and get into the general circulation and when something gets into your bloodstream it goes systemically that's why leaky gut hyper permeability of the GI system can be the impetus or the the the tipping point for lack a better description to a lot of other diseases because it involves the immune system mmm remember that the purpose of the immune system is either to hurt or heal right it's the only system in our body that can do both so when we piss the gut off we piss the immune system off because most of the immune cells reside in the GI system because of how big it is if you were to take the GI system and flatten it out it would be a couple tennis courts worth of air surface area because it's meant to be absorbing it as possible but there also requires a lot of policing because the immune cells that reside there if they cover a lot of ground and there's a lot of them that are needed so that's why we see something show up in the gut before it usually shows up somewhere else and that can be said for a lot of diseases a lot of conditions absolutely I love that analogy rolling that if I could summarize they get the gut is like this massive interface to the outside world it's it's a barrier that's trying to absorb nutrients in so letting things in that the body can use but then trying to keep out things that can potentially harm the body is that is that fair to say absolutely and you look how its constructed its cells that are bound together with proteins tight Junction proteins and these proteins are actually porous meaning they're meant to let water through but if these these tight Junction proteins due to an inflammatory state start to become compromised the proteins don't construct themselves properly they start to miss fold then that really tight space starts to do this and then rather than you know para cellular transport through the cell like so it actually can fall through that small gap directly into the bloodstream which initiates an immune response because it's likely something that was never meant to get through the tube it's meant to take it out when you you know have a poop mmm exactly so with this big big hollow tube running through the body with lots of different winding little curves to expand out that the surface contact so we can absorb as much material as possible widen curves I got this like this picture of these bacteria riding on top of a turd going guys but either way we have this like ecosystem that is you know a post natal Oregon we are we're born and we're inoculated as we go for the birth canal ideally there are other methods of being born the changes how we run our culated and that thing develops based upon the exposures to things we put in our mouth things that get in our you know our nasal cavity things that get into our blood stream whatever not our blood stream but things that get into orifices right and then development of that is constantly dynamic based upon a multitude of factors and the whole goal with gut health microbiota development is you want to create a microbiota that helps create a symbiotic relationship with not only the host us but the mitochondria that live in the very cells that you mentioned because that that little we love us the mitochondria the microbiota and the host ultimately determines if the body is in a healthy state or an inflamed state I love that that's beautiful and it's that that harmony between these macro biotic cultures that are living within our body the mitochondria within the cell and then the gut microbiome microbiota which is huge diverse range of bacteria protozoa funghi yeasts viruses everything sorry was that and phages which favors absolutely phages washes or phases or have a you pronounce it at some part of the world but i love how you put that is it's like this harmony between these two symbols to create a harmonious relationship between themselves but then also hopefully protecting the house because that promotes their own survival agenda as well I mean you know you want to create as hospitable an environment for yourself the patterns exist within the microbes they maybe not have the same conscious level of thought I mean when I'm designing a space I want to balance the energy in the space and decorate it the way I want to see it but a microbe wants to live in an environment that I can adhere to that it gets enough food and then it has a harmonious environment with the other species of microbes that live in there so it becomes a dynamic ecosystem hmm and you know the the problem that we're running into nowadays and I say this in my presentations you know I call people with healthy guts unicorns because I don't see them very much anymore and we're gonna capture them we got to study them figure out what it is they do because the vast majority of people I see they come to me for GI issues they come to me for gut related issues and I use functional lab testing usually Genova Diagnostics is my go-to with health optimization so I can at least get some insight into what's going on with their gut be it you know inflammatory protein up regulation be it digestive insufficiencies bacterial infections or yeast and festoons as you mentioned you know with Candida albicans or Citra malic acid from you know sacrum Isis for example or various other things that might say okay something in the gut is causing this imbalance you show itself and we can maybe pick this up years before this becomes an actual symptom but the vast majority of people you know you look at the commercials for Ozan tack this is an antacid this is something for GI distress this is imodium so you don't have liquid diarrhea that's a sign that something's wrong don't like it's like putting Cologne on a piece of shit it doesn't fill a piece of shit move that in the first place so that's the dance when it comes to being able to maintain that dynamic ecosystem is if there's something that's going on with it how do you remedy that then how do you push it in the right direction in order to maintain or continuously improve the long-term health consequences consequences sounds like a negative turn along some help opportunities of what that person can hopefully experience love that Rowland and I think at this point people are saying to understand how important the gut microbiome is the interaction with mitochondria now let's talk now how do these two colonies communicate with each other yes so they basically can communicate it's bi-directional right so mm-hmm the gut microbiota create these metabolites that can affect the health of the cells for example they can create lactate lactic acid that can then be converted into something that the cells the mitochondria can use for fuel they can create short chain fatty acids that directly actually enter the kelana sites of the intera sites butyrate propria nate and acetate - the three major ones butyrate being the most well researched they can create things called your olefins which are improving the the ability for the mitochondria to stimulate the biogenesis process which is increasing the concentrations of mitochondria or the health and well-being of them mm-hmm as a result of the microbiota producing these compounds they can actually influence the health and well-being of the gut barrier they can influence the health and well-being of how robustly the mitochondria take the food inside your cells and turn it into energy which then can have a systemic effect by uh purring up regulating total body genetic transcription factors that I mentioned before things that influence the body being better turning food into energy and less adapted storing energy in the form of body fat because you improve fat metabolism mmm conversely mitochondria can affect the gut barrier function and ultimately the health and well-being of the microbiota by spitting out things like reactive oxygen species changing gut barrier function and resulting in creating a scenario where an inflammatory response or a dysbiosis can develop because of dysfunctional and terror sites and gut barrier itself so they have this back and forth crosstalk I think I think I think I think I don't have it on this one I had a graphic but I don't know where it is that's like a black poor thing so the redox status of the cell will affect the gut barrier and ultimately influence the microbiota and the between them and the compounds of the microbiota create will directly affect a mitochondria because they'll crosstalk back and forth like hydrogen sulfide nitric oxide can inhibit energy production inside the colano sites so it really depends what's going on within the isolated microbiota and what's going on within the mitochondria themselves and how the to interface with each other mmm and if we could just get get a massive microscope and zoom in right into the the lining of the gut and talk about those gut cells I think he calls into our sites yes so what's the scenario of may the little zoo of animals running around that is the microbiota and the the actual antara site being the cell the little organelles inside the mitochondria now how does that dynamic work if we could give an example example it can be directly through though so let's look at some of the positive elements mm-hmm if those microbiota are breaking down adequate amounts of soluble fibers that come in through diet they're creating these short chain fatty acid compounds that can diffuse through the mucosal layer and they can directly enter into those antara sites and they can feed them so we talked about a symbiotic relationship the bacteria living in our gut providing that we create an optimal environment will then produce food for the colon themselves with a mid self rather so the bacteria will break down these fibers and it will use the creation of those fibers to improve the environment for the proliferation of a healthy gut bacteria for example an acidic environment is one that yeast doesn't grow in very well and so the colon should be a very acidic oxygen-free environment so we have a lot of diverse populated anaerobic bacteria that is also dependent on the gut cells being able to make a nice physical barrier so you know in the colon for example we have something called a bi lipid or a bi mucosal layer so you have a thick layer of mucus the cells are here you have a watery layer of mucus the bacteria live up here so the goblet cells our secreting mucus constantly and they require strong mitochondrial function in order for that mucus to be constantly synthesized on top of that you know there are certain specialized cells like in terror endocrine cells and various other things that influence the turnover of those in terror sets your digestive cells return over every three to five days so it's like the the dances you have this innate stem cell which needs to be powered up in order to be able to differentiate and become an entire site or a goblet cell or a Paneth cell or whatever and it requires the mitochondria to be fed a direct stream of those short chain fatty-acids or certain elements of lukas coming in from diet so they create this dance back and forth but they can't do this without each other the bacteria have to be there to power up thus the colano sites maintain I got barrier function of the mucosal layer and the entire sides need to be there so they can actually create an environment for the microbiota to live Ian yeah that's incredible isn't it Rowan beautiful help mother nature's designed this this system it's just phenomenal like we're only just dying to scratch the surface in terms of how these things work but Wow you know we are I called myself a glutton for punishment and arias podcast because I've chosen to specialize in a field that moves faster than any other field in science seemingly seemingly but that's what I get so excited about because it's that that constantly elucidates new things new targets you know like new drug targets are gonna be based upon your microbiota profile because certain microbiota make drugs ineffective and certain actually make drugs more effective you know what I mean mm-hmm certain elements that that we're now figuring out you know with certain elements of autoimmunity being something that causes the immune system to become confused molecular mimicry thing that can maybe be connected to certain elements of autoimmune disease manifestations so these things are all becoming very interesting I was just reading an article today that outlined the role of the microbiota mitochondria interaction in colorectal cancers ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease well so these things are all starting to become a lot more connected because to understand that would mean that we figured them out but you said that it's we're just learning the innate wisdom of mother nature and all she's done to create us and how complex yet pattern istic simplicity we we have right there's this pattern istic simplicity in that symbiosis symbiosis and balance is really what we're trying to strive for absolutely and the conversations just being flowing so well that we've pretty pretty much a time but line over time we've gone we've got we smashed the time element but I think that there's a few more rabbit holes to explore if you wouldn't mind absolutely yeah we can do and I'm all yours my man's let's do it awesome so I think we covered we covered a lot of ground in terms of how these why what they are how they interact and why they're so important but I think what we can explore is perhaps how do we improve communicating like we could explore both systems individually and then come back with improving the whole thing or we could just say like how do we if we start with mitochondria how do we improve the function of the mitochondria that's a good question I thought about this a lot because there is this saying that I like and it's if you're a clinician so someone sitting in front of you so what do you do I can't measure ampk I can't measure a lot of these cool pathways that we've spoken about but I can assume that there are things based upon how the pathway is activated for example if someone is looking at how to optimize mitochondrial function through diet well you know that metabolic flexibility is a big thing the ability to burn carbohydrates or fats someone who has some degree of metabolic dysregulation type two diabetes metabolic syndrome even hypoglycemia you know that there's something that's not function flowing smoothly as you just put it with our conversation from the food choice process to the digestive process to the absorption and utilization process something simple as restricting the time feeding window that you give yourself because when you restrict food you force your body to turn over to stored energy and that's in the form of fat cells right stored fat and fat cells can then shift the body back into a state words more able to actually burn fat as a predominant source of fuel so not only do we regulate that hunger signal by tapping into that there are some elements of that that become very anti-inflammatory to the body because constantly feeding the body is like constantly shoving food into a kitchen there's only so much food that can be cooked before the stove is either full or you run out of power and electricity so that's one of the first things I would say something else that you can also do too is looking at what cofactors are needed to create energy via the mitochondrial oxidation process you know if the turn carbs in energy vitamin b1 magnesium vitamin b2 to turn fat to newett energy you know vitamin b5 is one of the most important things and then when it comes to that cycle that we spoke about you know you need vitamin b1 b2 b3 iron sulfur manganese all these cofactors are needed so if you're not getting them from your diet you might have a scenario where you have all this energy coming in the form of carbohydrates macronutrients fats but your micronutrients are deficient so eating a more micronutrient energy-dense i'm sorry micro nutrient dense energy Sparks diet is going to make sure that you have the requisite balance of you know both nutrients in order for that process to be taken care of seamlessly and then you look at disposal on the other side certain elements of activity push the mitochondria to actually have to up regulate their process it could be something simple as walking you know outside on a nice day because you're using fat as an energy source providing that your blood sugar is balanced and then when you want to really push the mitochondria doing resistance training interval training short duration Sprint's activates your anaerobic system which powers up your aerobic system to regenerate those energy stores so you can do it again and again so you're basically looking at the input and the output variables from attic Andreea and looking at how do i optimize those to my diet my lifestyle my sleep my activity factor and then because I know we're a little bit short on time maybe I'll come back to do you know a part two of this if you want to dig deeper when it comes to the GI system it all starts with the digestive process is if the digestive process is compromised you don't chew your food enough you're not relaxed enough to activate the parasympathetic nervous system you're not making enough stomach acid you're not making enough enzymes enough bile then that food is not gonna get properly digested segmented and broken down to something that can be properly absorbed and then you dig a layer deeper is looking at the food choices themselves you know high starch low fiber high sugar foods are great at supporting the overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria and yeasts especially if someone's at a history of antibiotics making sure we get adequate amino acids because the mucosal layer is very amino acid real amino acid rich rather and the glycocalyx where the bacteria live in is a carbohydrate and amino acid rich so making sure those substrates are there and then finally choosing different kinds of plant foods that vary the kinds of fibers the kinds of phytonutrients the kinds of resistant starches that actually feed the bacteria you know when I go to a restaurant and I'm looking at a menu in my head I have this little like instant analysis of okay what micronutrients are in this what kind of fiber is what phytonutrients what is it gonna do to my blood sugar and I make my food suggestions based upon that and the simple challenge is see how many different foods you can eat in it so this way we don't know what food necessarily feeds what bacteria other than there are some companies that are targeting fiber but if you vary what you bought your body experiences from a food perspective you vary your micronutrients you vary your fibers and if you combine those foods well so you digest them optimally and you're going to the bathroom on a regular basis you're likely gonna do much better than the vast majority of people out there who eat for convenience or don't try parrot eyes food quality or quantity or selection whatsoever hmm those are all wonderful suggestions and one area that a lot to cover off is how about home Isis well what is home ASIS hormesis hormetic stresses hormesis you know why don't we look at a very specific example of our missus intermittent fasting as hormesis why because you're subjecting your body to a stressful condition in which the response to that stress will yield a positive net solution what I mean by that is fasting is basically cutting off the energy input assembly right so no energy is coming in but the body still needs the same amount of energy to sustain itself so it changes the influence of how your cells have to perform and have to react to that situation if we're not ingesting food then we know that via body fat we have stored energy that's sitting on our tissues so the hormetic stress of fasting is actually going to upregulate the enzymes and the endocrine system to be better at breaking fat down from storage delivering that fat to the cells and metabolizing that fat for energy so you restore metabolic flexibility from fasting via hormesis of fasting itself mm-hmm another way like cold exposure or heat shock proteins via asana exercises hormesis the only thing I will say with hormesis in regards to being an option for someone is make sure it's an appropriate stress for you for example someone who's hypoglycemic who wants to do a 24-hour fast yeah that might not be a good idea you might want to start with like 8 or 12 hours or so as chronic fatigue syndrome you know doing cold exposure or going for an ultra intense on a session I might push you over the edge and you might be laid up for a little bit mmm hormesis is what what stimulates the body to be more dynamic and its ability to thrive under certain conditions and scenarios it's whatever that hormesis is for you that might be the appropriate choice or it might be a little you know consider the the stresses of the environment and the stresses of the activity before you go forth so choosing a sensible stressor to challenge the body and elicit metabolic flexibility forward antioxidants are hormetic stress to the cell because they cause a reduction in stress that forces the cell to be able to balance out the reduction oxidization thing that I spoke about so when antioxidant is actually a very very mild stress that improves the antioxidant defenses of the cell so by eating colored vegetables you're doing hormesis technically mmm-hmm there's a lot of those polyphenols in the coloring compounds of the fruit end up in the the colon isn't it yeah and they influence the change in microbial diversity yeah because the body can't digest it the the microbiota actually digested the there was one thing I wanted to ask you oh is that ah a couple of things that you just just a few definitions just to round off the conversation now you mentioned something called my tofu G and then you mentioned something called mitochondrial biogenesis what are these terms actually mean so my top four G is mitochondrial specific autophagy which is a process of the the way I look at it is the recycling of old worn-out material to repurpose for building new material so it's a way for the cell to utilize resources that may be old and worn out and underperforming break them down and incorporate them into new resources so for mitochondria they can go through my tofu Jie in some cases that involves clearing out old dysfunctional mitochondria that will create too many reactive oxygen species and incorporating those components into the birth of new mitochondria because they divide and they fuse together and they caught they do something called fission where they birth new mitochondria at AA fuji and my tofu Jie can donate materials to what's called mitochondrial biogenesis which is the creation of new mitochondria usually to suit the increased energy requirements of the cell an example of mitochondrial biogenesis as someone can engage in is through intensive exercise you know that's why endurance athletes are so good at aerobic exercise is because they have a lot of mitochondria density in their muscle cells because the constant you know biking running swimming if they're triathletes if the stress at the body becomes more adaptive to so they will increase the amount of mitochondria in the muscle cell via mitochondrial biogenesis and the body will break down old worn-out mitochondria via my tofu Jie so you don't have dysfunctional energy production organelles in the cell mmm so the the pomaceous lends itself to creating more mitochondria density it can absolutely against that exercise because if you keep telling your body via through exercise that I need to be able to produce a lot of energy then the body is going to respond by making you better at producing a lot of energy it's just more like the adaptive mechanisms that exists within us to better suit our environment right wonderful I think we're gonna start to rap now we've covered an immense amount of ground and hopefully people have been falling along the journey and you know certainly if there's any questions do you drop us a note check to chat further about some of these concepts but what I like to just cover cover off now if you could dig into your memory banks and think of something someone that stands out in your mind perhaps a patient or a client you're working with a particular challenging situation and you know what was the issue in how you went about dealing and helping this person address that particular issue preferably related to something digestive if possible yeah you know there's one that was actually really cool I was actually working with a colleague in in Canada her name is Ayla Reed and we do health optimization together and one of her clients we were working together on they were experiencing something that was a combination of GI distress but also something related to the inability to metabolize energy properly from a body composition and an energy metabolism perspective so I ran some functional lab testing and then we looked and dig we dug into the actual information that resulted in elucidating that there was an overgrowth of some yeast and fungus there was some dysbiotic bacteria there was some compromised abilities to run the krebs cycle but also the inability to burn fat effectively for energy and via a combination of supporting energy metabolism supporting GI health so managing the dysbiosis improving the digestive process and then helping to build a more proliferative microbiome through supplementation but also removing specific foods I think within a matter of like 11 or 12 days they dropped the equivalent amount of pounds like 11 or 12 pounds totally changed how they looked how they felt energy this person was very young and though that was a really cool thing in the sense of young people heal really quickly really really quickly if I think of another case where it was actually quite profound I have a client here who had a combination of chronic anxiety couldn't leave the house without knowing where every bathroom was within a square kilometre radius of where they were going for fear of what would happen and I think she's now at the point where she goes to the gym and she's showing her husband up in terms of her performance levels totally change her mindset changed her career she says she got her life back because everything inside of her Missouri imbalance it was a combination of mitochondrial dysfunction the inability to regulate energy metabolism of course and there was some overgrowth of yeast and dysbiosis based upon the results of our testing so I find you know you balance out these things in the system you move a couple nodes in the network and then you restore the body's ability to just do what it's meant to do and that's optimize its function and maintain health yeah he doesn't know how to disease itself it's what we do to it that does it absolutely I'm a firm believer of the principle that it all comes back to nature I mean we're all we're trying to understand the mechanisms of how these things work and then trying to adjust it but it seems to always go back to the body's innate intelligence and going back to how we naturally evolved for one of a better word and that's that's you know but dr. Ted's principle so the health optimization are you know you have these pillars that support what the body's trying to do and one of the long views is evolutionary biology and evolutionary medicine you know how did humans get to this point and a lot of the things that that we implement to get someone better are mimic Riis of you know what the body's optimized to upo to you know environmental factors the sun's circadian rhythm food choices stress management all of that stuff play a massive role in maintaining our health long-term massive absolutely rolling with pretty much come up to time but if there was always ask this question at the end if there was one thing you could do for your gut health because it is the gut health gurus podcast after all what would it be one thing oh my gosh you put me on this you know it's you're not gonna be super sexy it's not gonna be revolutionary but eating in a relaxed environment focusing on being mindful in the process of eating and chewing thoroughly is the easiest thing that someone can do to optimize not only that experience because it's for you but tasting the food getting involved in the experience not watching like intense videos on YouTube while you're something or shoveling something in your face as you're driving somewhere you know make your mealtimes a sacred time make it your version of meditation where you're just actually in the experience because your body will be primed to do what it is that meant to do with that food and the downstream effects of everything will yield a better outcome Wow wonderful sim full actionable advice to take on today so I'm holding station sometimes so simple and rolling now if people are fully engaged we're saying today they'll want to work with you they want to reach out with you now how can they find you and connect with you and and if they need help how can they get yeah the one thing I will say is I'm actually looking to find a way to bring health optimization to Australia via via telemedicine and so I know that there is a place in Australia that does the testing that I need to do um I have to figure out where they're located so what I could do is if there are people that are interested they can reach me in two different ways the company doctors head and I actually have a company in Canada called RT TR Corp so if you go to R T TR Corp comm there is a contact field there and it does have some explanation about how optimization and some of the other services we offer and then I'll give you the same option as I gave to Ari where if people want to contact me they can use my business email which is my full name role in rol a nd an Enka which PA n ke w IC h at gmail.com mm-hmm and there if people are interested in figuring out what it is I do what the process is and if we can move forwards they can shoot me off an email and I will get back to them as soon as possible I'm about to take off to Zurich for a conference soon so if those do email and there is a little bit of a lag time I will get to you and the jetlag is adjusted but yeah and that that's a great way to get a hold of me and inquire about what it is that I do and if they are interested in optimizing their health you know health optimization focuses on measuring wellness it's not the best thing to treat disease directly because that's not the focus but those who want to perform in a better level and maintain their health as long as possible that's what we do a wonderful man huge amount of gratitude rolling fountain of knowledge you break it down for us so eloquently and succinctly and I hope people find value in this podcast thank you so much for your time oh thank you for having we'll have to do this again one day it was fun we're on TV for sure man all right man thank you so much thank you so much take
