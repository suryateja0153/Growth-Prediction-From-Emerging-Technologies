 good afternoon everyone i'm Marie-Reine Velez with  USC visions and voices the arts and humanities   initiative welcome and thank you for joining us  for today's event politics and policies fighting   for the health and well-being of children at  the border a lecture by Dr. Colleen Kraft it is   amazing that we have people tuning in from across  the country here today and at visions and voices   we believe it's important to open our events by  acknowledging the indigenous land that we share   by presenting lectures and conversations  like the ones we have today   part of the work that we do is to make the  invisible visible we also believe that it is   not the responsibility of those who have been made  invisible to remind us that they are still here   therefore the visions and voices program  acknowledges that the university of southern   california both the university park campus and  the health sciences campus were built on the   ancestral and sacred land of the Tongva nation  we honor the Tongva and all indigenous people   past present and future and we pay  respect to their to their continued   survival and contributions to our society we  also honor the legacy of the African diaspora   and recognize that this country would not exist  without the free and slave labor of Black people   we share these acknowledgments to raise  the awareness about histories that are too   often erased or forgotten to pay respect to  the original caretakers of this land and to   recognize our place in this history we hope that  this work continues beyond our events and helps   to inform our individual and collective actions  in the years ahead and for generations to come   thank you i would now like to hand this off  to the wonderful people who have worked hard   on the organizing and production for today's  event with Dr Colleen Kraft please welcome   Dr Pamela Schaff who is the director of the  humanities ethics art and the law or HEAL program   and director of Keck school of medicine's master  of science in narrative medicine graduate program welcome Dr Schaff welcome everyone thank you so  much Marie today's visions and voices talk by   Dr Colleen Kraft is of course because of COVID an  online event and i want to begin by thanking the   entire visions and voices team Marie of course and  Daria Yudacufski for their flexibility and their   creativity in helping us deliver today's session  i also want to thank our incomparable audio visual   team Patrick Crispin and Dan Villasenor as well as  my faculty colleagues Alex Capron Ron Ben-Ari and   Erica Wright thanks also to our captioners for  their work on today's program Dr Colleen Kraft   received her undergraduate degree at virginia  tech her md from virginia commonwealth university   and her mba from the university of cincinnati  she completed her residency in pediatrics at   virginia commonwealth her background includes  work in primary care pediatrics pediatric   education and health care financing she led a  pediatric accountable care program at cincinnati   children's from 2014 to 2017 where her financial  model incorporated investments to address the   social determinants of health population health  data driven quality improvement initiatives and   improved payment for primary care services since  2019 dr kraft has been a professor of pediatrics   at keck school of medicine and an attending  physician at children's hospital los angeles   since the 1998 landmark adverse childhood  experiences or aces study in the american journal   of preventive medicine research has confirmed  the relationship between adversity and childhood   and higher levels of morbidity  and mortality in adulthood   and uncovered the connections between the two  at molecular behavioral and societal levels   the devastating effects of  emotional trauma and toxic stress   in children are nowhere more evident than  in the crisis of the u.s mexico border a past president of the american academy of  pediatrics dr kraft is best known for her advocacy   for humane treatment of migrant children at the  border her work to explain to the public the harms   to young children caused by the zero tolerance  policy that included separation of children from   parents helped to mobilize advocates advocates  across the political spectrum to end this policy   she continues to advocate for the rights  and health of children throughout the world   in ways that mobilize and inspire dr kraft  will speak to us for about 35 minutes   and then we'll have time for a few questions you  may submit questions through the q a function   at any time and we will answer she will answer as  many as time allows dr kraft welcome and thank you   so much for being here well thank you so much dr  schaff and to all of the faculty and the staff and   those to help to put this together  and let's go ahead and get started so we're going to be talking about policies  and politics and fighting for the well-being   of children at the southern border some faculty  disclosure information and then our learning   objectives so first one recognizing the sources  of trauma for one young children migrating   from central america secondly describing the  unfortunate additional trauma these families   given the united states immigration policy  currently and then finally as healthcare as a   healthcare community committing to incorporating  the adverse childhood experiences into your   approach to medical care for individuals in our  immigrant refugee and asylum seeker community   so let's get started i'm going to go through an  overview of what we'll talk about this afternoon   first of all the path into the united states  and what it takes for an individual to leave   their home and come to the united states to seek  asylum secondly the focus on adverse childhood   experiences and its relationship to early brain  development then i'll talk about separation   of parents and children at the border and our  experiences in 2018. we'll talk about children and   families and unaccompanied minors who are being  treated in all kinds of horrific ways right now   we're going to talk about public charge and   immigration raids and some of what we're  seeing happening in the united states currently   some recent updates what's happened because of  covet 19 and the migrant protection protocol   which is the remain in mexico policy and  then finally our voices of medical community   what is it that we can do to help out individuals  who have come to our country from central america so let's get started with some some definitions  who is an immigrant an immigrant is a person who   migrates to another country usually to take a  permanent residence this includes people who   may have come to the united states legally they  may have come with a visa they may have come   as a traveler and then they've stayed  our undocumented immigrants are in   that specific category of immigrants  who describe people who enter without   legal permission as well as those who fail  to leave when their permissible time ends   what's the difference of between an immigrant  and a refugee a refugee is somebody who owing   to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for  reasons of race religion nationality membership   in particular social groups is is coming to our  country out of fear they are fleeing an area where   they may lose their life or lose other privileges  and they're unwilling to return to that country   the difference between a refugee and asylum  seeker is that an asylum seeker is the same   except that their request for sanctuary is yet  to be processed so let's talk a little bit about   some of the images you see at the border and  who's in charge of which places this is really   important because we see so many images and it's  important to know where these come from and who's   in charge of these facilities so the department of  homeland security runs two agencies the u.s custom   and border protection and the u.s immigration and  customs enforcement customs and border protection   run the cbp border facilities the cages when  you've seen pictures of people crowded in these   facilities cages sleeping under mylar blankets  those are run by customs and border protection   ice or immigration and customs enforcement run  the family detention centers as well as other   detention centers where there are not children  but there are three in the united states where   you will find children the first one is in dilly  texas and those are mothers and children the   second one is in carnes texas and those are  fathers and sons and then there is one more   facility in pennsylvania that has other parents  and other children now this is different than   the department of health and human services which  runs the office of refugee resettlement or orr and   they run the shelters so these are the shelters  for little kids the tender age shelters and these   are the children who were by and large separated  from their parents as well as the shelters for   unaccompanied minors and again this comes from  the department of health and human services so let's start about with the countries  that people come from guatemala honduras   and el salvador the the northern part the northern  triangle of central america is where we see most   of our families coming from and the united states  has assorted history with this part of the world   and this really is owing back to the united fruit  company back in the 1900s that planted the banana   plantations primarily in guatemala but in other  countries as well in central america and what   happened was the united fruit company took over a  lot of the land and had very close relationships   with some of the leaders in these countries and  when the people decided to elect a democratically   elected president to take back some of the land  the united fruit company went to the united states   and said oh these are they're communists and  so we have to get rid of communists and then   what would happen is there would be militia  that would take care of the communists and the   communists would come back and become guerrillas  and fighting ensued and over a century of this   these companies have been left in in rags and  with lots of violence and lots of gangs and lots   of problems in these countries and that's really  where our kids are coming from and our parents are   coming from and when you ask your families why did  you come they will tell you it's violence in the   home country violence in the home deprivation no  opportunity at all and and families are actually   very graphic when you talk with them about that  i've talked to several families who have said   we woke up and the family next door was machine  gun down because they wouldn't pay the fees to   the gangs coming through so there is definite  fear and the fear to the point of motivating   people to leave with little children the path  is long and arduous at its shortest difference   distance the travel from honduras to the  us-mexico border is about 1500 miles and   it's a dangerous journey there are gangs there is  exposure to lots of crime there's hunger there's   thirst there are medical conditions that are not  being cared for and this is something that our   families come to the border with already having  experienced if you think about this as a child   this is an adverse childhood experience and  is a problem as these kids come to the border   but this is only part of the scope of global  displacement so we see the numbers of people   coming from central america to the united states  they are a small part of the almost 71 million   people who are forcibly displaced worldwide and  if you think about where people are going to   the bottom part of this slide shows the kids and  the people coming from central america to the   united states they are far in the minority when  you look at the number of people coming from syria   to turkey and to other countries from venezuela  from the democratic republic of congo our refugees   are just a small part of this global movement  of refugees because of violence and deprivation   in home countries so what happens when people get  to the border the process was is that you would   come to a customs and border protection official  and you would claim asylum because of fear you   would be given a credible fear interview and then  processed and wait your turn in immigration court   and then eventually be connected with families  in the united states this isn't happening so   the picture on the right is the picture of the  reynosa bridge where our migrants are coming and   they are staying there for days because customs  and border protection are not processing them   or they're processing two people a day and i  actually saw this when i was down there in june   of 2018. we ran into a mother from honduras who  was standing there crying with her five-year-old   because she had been there for days and she didn't  have water and she didn't have food and nobody   would let her in and so being being the americans  that we were we said you know what what about   this lady out here can we just bring her along  here with us and and of course customs of border   protection processed her right away but she was  an exception people stood there for days so what   happens when you can't get through the right way  well you come across any way you can which is the   picture on the left people crossing the rio grande  and swimming in very dangerous conditions and many   people have lost their lives doing this because  they're not allowed to come in the legal way so very different than 20 years ago when we had  a number of adult males coming from mexico and   central america to cross the border and find work  in the united states these people came across the   border and they did everything they could to avoid  customs and border protection our families are not   doing that they are seeking out customs and border  protection to claim asylum to leave the fear and   to leave the violence in their home country and  what's happening is they are winding up first of   all in these customs border processing facilities  and they have been very crowded they are very   cold they are kept cold the there there's little  food and water there are open toilets lights are   on 24 7. these are really horrible places and  if you talk with customs and border protection   they will tell you these were designed for  adult males not for families with children well let's talk about adverse childhood  experiences because we've seen some pictures   of some really awful experiences what  are they they're a mix of experiences   and exposures in childhood that are a major risk  for certain illnesses and poor quality of life so   these include physical sexual emotional abuse   neglect exposure to mental illness or substance  abuse or domestic violence within your household   divorce or separation of parents and caregivers  incarceration of a parent or caregiver   and what we know is that early on the more  adverse childhood experiences you have as a very   young child in the first three years of life the  more likely you are to have developmental delay   if you have more than four adverse childhood  experiences you are 50 likely to have a delay in   your development and that is a lifelong disability  so how do we define adversity or stress because   we know that different people react different  ways to different experiences well the national   scientific council on the developing child came  up with some some ideas and language based on   the hypothalamic pituitary axis reactivity based  on measuring stress through levels of cortisol   epinephrine and norepinephrine and other  inflammatory markers and they named the reactive   patterns of stress as positive tolerable and  toxic stress and again this is based on the human   reaction or animal reaction objective physiologic  responses to some of these adverse experiences   so what is positive stress positive stress is the  brief and infrequent mild to moderate intensity   stress that happens in normal childhood you fall  down and you hurt yourself and as you're crying   those levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine  and cortisol are rising and in the the presence   of a caring adult there's a social emotional  buffer and those levels return to baseline we   see this all the time the 15 month old and  you tell them no to something and they have   that temper tantrum and you can just see their  cortisol and epinephrine and norepinephrine rising   and that loving parent lets them get through that  calms them down redirects them well what that does   to the brain is it actually builds motivation and  resiliency and that child learns that somebody can   say no to me and i'm gonna be okay understand that  positive stress is not the absence of stress those   of us in pediatric practice see lots of families  where we could use a little bit of positive stress   but this is a really important differentiator  than toxic stress which i'm going to talk about   this is very different this is long-lasting  strong intensity the most extreme precipitants   of adverse childhood experiences these  are kids who are exposed to neglect abuse   household dysfunction and the real key to toxic  stress is this that there is insufficient social   emotional buffering there's not that adult  who can help you process these feelings and   help these these chemicals return to baseline  and because of that the kids who are exposed to   toxic stress stay on red alert all the time they  don't know when something is going to be hurtful   or harmful or good for them these are the children  who may be in foster care who have been abused and   neglected and somebody comes to give them a hug  and they bite them they lash out them because   they are on high alert all the time and this  causes potential permanent damage to the brain and it's most important with very young children  because we know that by age three eighty percent   of synaptic connections are already made and by  the second decade of life the brain starts pruning   these connections if the strong connections are  love our emotional responsiveness our language   our reading our math and building that stays and  what gets pruned away is fear and some of the   adverse events in your life but if those strong  connections our fear our loneliness our abuse our   hunger then that stays and what gets pruned away  is the ability to speak to understand to begin to   relate to somebody else and if you think about  this in terms of brain development we're born   with our cerebral cortex and our occipital  lobes we've got visual processing   the cerebellum which coordinates our smooth  movements and brain stem and cranial nerves for   vital functions and swallowing somewhere around  four months of age the parietal lobe kicks in   and that's that integration of sensory data and  movement that's where you reach out purposely and   grasp something a child who has been exposed to  toxic stress might not do this you think about the   limbic system which comes in at about 12 months of  age this is emotions and impulsivity this is the   reason why a four month old doesn't have temper  tantrums their limbic system isn't developed yet   but think about that 12 month old who is taken  away from that loving parent and they don't have   somebody to help them control their emotions and  impulsivity that part of the brain doesn't develop   think about the temporal lobe around age two  this is when we process sound and language   this is why we can't tell a 12 month old to use  their words they don't have them yet but we can   tell a two-year-old to use your words when you're  upset and let's see what we can do about that   and if there's toxic stress occurring at  two years of age language doesn't develop   well let's think about some of our parents  and some of our teenagers and frontal lobe   so i get the question a lot if that early  brain development is so important then   what happens to a teenager well a teenager is  developing abstract thought reasoning judgment   planning all of what we talk about in terms  of executive functioning and if that trauma   occurs then then what you have is inattention  distractibility poor judgment depression anxiety   you can see how this develops with kids and and  so that impact of childhood stress is that chronic   fight or flight norepinephrine cortisol causing  changes in the brain architecture which which   results in hyper responsive stress response and  decreased common coping and that's toxic stress   and this is how toxic stress is so  damaging for that early brain development   so let's get back to the border here i was  president of the american academy of pediatrics   in 2018 and many of our pediatric colleagues  in texas were saying children are being taken   away from their parents at the border and  we heard later on that in fact this was   the president's zero tolerance policy and  it happened because these people are felons   and they have to take their children  away i was able to go to one of the   tender age shelters that was run by the office of  refugee resettlement in 2018. and the first room i   walked into is a room of toddlers and you've been  in a room of toddlers before they're rambunctious   they're busy they're talking they're allowed and  in this room everybody was quiet except for one   little girl little 18 month old who was just  screaming and crying and couldn't be consoled   and the staff were trying they were trying to give  her toys and they were trying to give her books   the staff are not allowed to pick up and  hold children and comfort them in that way   and they were doing the best they could and we  all looked at these children and we knew what they   were missing they were missing their parent out  of no fault of their own they were taken away from   their parents and you could just see the toxic  stress ensuing in these little children's brains   and because of that i actually wrote an article  that that appeared in the los angeles times in may   of 2018 that was called separating parents from  their kids at the border contradicts everything we   know about child's welfare and applying the whole  idea of toxic stress to these young developing   brains and knowing that taking them away from that  one important loved parent would actually create   brain damage with them i called this what it was  and still is government sanctioned child abuse   well that actually got a lot of press and one  of the first calls i actually got while i was in   clinic and seeing a patient was from oprah winfrey  and oprah wanted to know what she could do about   this and so she said i'm going to get you in touch  with gayle king at cbs this morning and we went   down to the border to the ursula processing center  and talked about brain development and toxic   stress and what we were doing to damage these  young children coming across the border and in   the next week we had 55 interviews talking about  toxic stress and brain development and separation   of parents and children and we mobilized people  from across the political spectrum we were from   gayle king and oprah winfrey to laura bush saying  you do not take children away from their parents   that that is wrong and that this is going to cause  brain damage and the zero tolerance policy was was   technically ended in june of 2018 although sadly  it is still going on so what about what would we   know since then we know that about 2600 kids had  been separated from their parents at that point   but that the us had planned to separate 10  times that many before this public outcry so our   advocacy worked at a point we were able to prevent  a lot more damage going on there but there still   are problems down at the border so what happens  with children and families once they actually   are across and through that that customs and  border protection the cages they are brought to a   family detention center and this is a picture  some pictures from dilly texas which is one of the   family detention centers where there are parents  mothers and children and you walk in there and we   actually had a guide from ice who took us around  and showed us everything including the playgrounds   and the clinics and where people were able to eat  and get snacks but there was a huge disconnect   between what we were shown and what was actually  happening and i went with a human white rights   watch group who wanted to interview families and  when we talked with the families the family said   our children are sick and we go to the  clinic and they say come back tomorrow   go away that playground that you see there look  just like that so when you go to the playground   you have mothers and children clinging to each  other nobody playing on the playground and when   you ask the parents why they say well the guards  tell us that if something happens to your child   it's on you and again you can see the stress  you can see the toxic stress happening with   these children who are not allowed to do  some of the normal things that children do   incidentally we saw some very sick children when  we interviewed the parents and at one point i took   the ice agent around and i said this child needs  to go to the emergency room this one needs to and   these are kids with fever with dehydration with  boils who were not allowed to go to the clinic well what about unaccompanied minors and who are  unaccompanied minors these are children who by and   large are sent by their families across the border  because it's often the kids who have the threats   it is the young man who doesn't want to join a  gang and the gang has said you will join us or   we will kill you or we will take your sister and  she'll become a gang girlfriend and so many of the   families we're sending there are kids as young  as 10 years of age alone to cross the border   when you become an unaccompanied minor you are  apprehended at customs and border protection   placed in the department of  homeland security detention center   and then if you're deemed to be under 18 years of  age you're transferred from department of homeland   security again to the department of health and  human services and into a shelter within 72 hours   the shelters for unaccompanied minors were  designed to be a temporary holding place until   a sponsor could be vetted and by and large most of  these kids have sponsors in the united states they   have family members or others in the united states  there is supposed to be a limit of 20 days in   maximum in the shelters and that there  are categories of potential sponsors   many times it is a parent or an immediate relative  a brother a sister an aunt a grandparent who   wants to sponsor this child coming into the united  states category three are other sponsors distant   relatives or friends and then category 4 no  sponsors identified but the vast majority of kids   actually do have sponsors well at one point in  2018 there was a great delay in getting these   children from these shelters to their sponsors  and what was happening is that the administration   was requiring that the everybody in the household  where that child would go be fingerprinted rather   than one person from that household who was the  sponsor and as you can imagine there were a number   of undocumented people in these households and so  they were afraid to be fingerprinted at the same   time the trump administration was not requiring  people working in the shelters to be fingerprinted   so you can imagine how that would go you're not  requiring people who are taking care of vulnerable   youth to have a significant background check while  at the same time not letting these kids leave and   so what happened was eventually it was ruled that  that this was not appropriate and that these kids   went to to back to their families so one really  important concept here is the flores settlement   agreement this was an agreement that that was made  because of a plaintiff jenny flores and how she   was being treated as an as an unaccompanied minor  and the flora settlement agreement actually is an   agreement that sets forth how these kids will  be treated proper physical care and maintenance   routine medical and dental care with a evaluation  in the first 48 hours getting into the country   individual needs assessments educational services  the ability to call a parent or a relative   a minimum of one counseling session per week  and two group counseling sessions these are   the protections that unaccompanied minors have in  the united states and this is why so many families   would send their kids up there because they knew  there were going to be some protections there   but this is also why we never had an agreement on  the wall back in january of 2017 february set 2017   when congress appropriated up to 25 billion  dollars for the wall it didn't happen because   some of our our folks in congress wanted to give  up these flora settlement agreement protections   as part of the deal and there were enough of our  republican colleagues who said no you can't you   can't decrease human rights abilities for these  children as part of the settlement so we never   got the wall and the flora settlement agreement  remained intact but it is always something that   is is under under attack so i'm going to move over  to public charge public charge is the whole idea   that if you come into the country you need to be  able to support yourself and this came back to   the early 20th century when when immigrants  received stipends from the united states   by and large that has gone away but in many of  our states our immigrants and refugees do receive   medicaid do receive food stamps to receive receive  some other services section 8 housing vouchers   and the idea of public charge is that if you  are coming to the united states even as a   legal immigrant you're going through the green  card process if you use any of these services   you can be deported and this has caused a  great deal of fear in our communities this   is something that we see day to day in at chla  is that families don't understand what services   they can apply for for them or for their child who  by and large is usually a united states citizen   and they are making the hard choice between  staying in this country with their child   or or getting some of the services that they  need to eat to live to to live somewhere ice raids that target migrant families this has  been something that has been problematic as well   too we have had ice that has targeted places  where migrants were recruited to work many of   them meet packing plants and other places where  where companies couldn't get american citizens to   to work and so they they brought in migrants and  their visas expired and sadly as kids were going   to school ice raids were coming and taking these  families away or taking these people away and so   kids were coming home to an empty household or  one parent and a father who was being deported the migrant protection protocol  which is known as the remain   in mexico policy was something that was enacted  at the end of last year and the idea is that   you come and you claim asylum  to customs and border protection   and you are sent back across the border to remain  in a camp until your immigration case comes up   this has not been a safe opportunity for any of  our families there have been gangs that infiltrate   these camps and migrant protection is really  kind of a misnomer it really puts people at   risk we have had kids come across the border and  talk to us about how they have watched the gangs   beat up or rape a family member  and and really is quite horrible   and what's happened because of the migrant  protection protocol is that the families are going   across the border they are remaining in these  camps and they're making the horrible decision to   send their child across the border because they  know about the flora settlement agreement they   know that their children will be treated kindly  and they want the best for their children even if   that means separating from them what happened  with covet 19 in asylum this is really this   is just one additional horror for these families  this was a cdc ruling in march of 2020 the order   suspending introduction of certain persons from  countries where a communicable disease exists   this is an old cdc's order that was designed  to help protect americans from tuberculosis   and dengue fever and things like that and it was  applied to coronavirus even as the united states   has been the epicenter of coronavirus in the  world and the order was extended indefinitely   in april 2020 what this is sadly done is it  effectively ended asylum in the united states   so people are not being allowed in to even  claim credible fear and it effectively ended the   provisions of the flora settlement agreement in  the united states and and this has had some really   devastating consequences with our children so now  what happens is that minors crossing the border   are placed in a department of homeland security  detention center and then placed in the   custody of a prison private prison contractor and  sent to stay in a hotel so there's no interview   there's no medical exam there's no psychological  assessment there's no contact with family members   there's no access to legal advocates and these  minors are being expelled to their country of   origin within 72 hours with their parents  in mexico which is absolutely horrific and   we know that nearly 9 000 unaccompanied migrant  children have been expelled from the us and i'm   saying expelled and not deported because being  deported means that you have had the due process   that you are that you are deserving of and  that's not happening here these kids are   going from the border to the private prison  system to a hotel back to their home country so what do we do about this as a medical  community we understand that there are barriers   of care to immigrants and there's a lot of fear  and knowing this there are some resources that we   can look to the american academy of pediatrics has  put in a statement on providing care for children   and immigrant families and in addition there is a  resource called the immigrant child health toolkit   and you could actually just google the  immigrant child health toolkit and you will find   background some clinical care immigration  status faqs what are our immigrant families   eligible for what is something one of the  best things that you can do in practice   knowing the trauma that these families have  experienced is let them know what are the   resources that they are eligible for what can they  access for themselves or their children that is   not going to raise the ire of public charge and  and then there's state legal resources as well   too because california is very different  than texas is very different than new york   and knowing what you can do for your families  in your state is mo is most important translating science to the public one of  the activities we've done a lot through the   american academy of pediatrics and particularly  the council on immigrant families and children   is this it's talking about toxic stress  it's talking about separation of parents   and children and what that damage is doing and how   we really need to reframe the idea of illegal  immigration to victims of a global refugee crisis because if you look at this sadly  we are at stage seven of genocide   if you think about this we have been divided  into us people were forced to identify themselves   even people who are citizens of the united  states there has been systemic discrimination   you have heard some of our leaders equating our  people coming to the southern border as vermin   animals diseases there are specific groups to  enforce these policies and we here propaganda   to turn the populace against the group and  now we've got that official action to remove   and relocate people we are going down a very very  solemn hard dark path here in the united states   and history will remember the 2017-22 period  of time in the united states as a time that was   really very dark for human rights where there were  a number of human rights and child rights abuses   what do you do to try to keep  yourself hopeful during this time   i find that every time i can connect a family to  the right resource or i can let a family know that   their child will be safe that they can get that  medical care that this is something that brings   me hope and i have one great story from my time  in dilly which was really particularly horrifying   i saw two little girls who were both from  honduras and they were friends in their fifth   grade classroom and they happened to make very  separate journeys up to the united states and they   happened to wind up in dilly together and they  saw each other from across the room and they ran   over and hugged and i had a pad of paper and they  were drawing pictures and writing their names   and writing i love you and it was actually very  humanizing and come to find out at the beginning   of this year one of these little girls is in  los angeles and i happen to see her in ultimate   and you see this and you know that her  family is doing okay and that there's hope   we have a service at children's hospital los  angeles with altermed called la lanterna which   is a a it is a clinical service for some of  our families who've come across as immigrants   and refugees and this puts together health mental  health and immigration services and attorneys to   help out these families that there is hope there's  a lot that we're doing as advocates here and   i'm going to end off with one last letter that i  got that i read all the time because i need to do   this and it really helps to focus me in terms of  where our youth are and where our kids are with   regard to diversity and inclusion and welcoming  people who have come from places of trauma   and this letter was from a fifth grader and it  said dear president of the american academy of   pediatrics i think the world needs you especially  the children they have done nothing wrong   they are practically in jail because they're  immigrants and it doesn't mean they should be   treated differently gandhi changed the world  with kindness and i thank you for all you do   and understand that as a health care provider as  a physician as a doctor as a nurse as a therapist   advocacy is part of your dna and your patients  drive what you do in terms of what you do   in the office what you do in the clinic  and what you do outside the clinic   so be the change that you want to see in this  world and with that i'm going to say thank you   for being part of this visions and voices thank  you for the healing that you do and will do and i   will open up for questions thank you thank you so  much dr kraft before we turn to questions i just   wanted to acknowledge i failed to recognize  one of my faculty partners Dr Sofia Gruskin   and we're really grateful for her partnership  as well as for our partnership with the ins usc   institute on inequalities and global health which  she directs so i'm so sorry um Dr Gruskin for   failing to acknowledge you um so dr kraft we  have some really wonderful questions for you   um the first is from karen rogers who asks if  you can speak to reports of therapy sessions   provided under flores being used  against children in their hearings so what has happened is that that many  children who've been traumatized have been   connected with therapists when they're in one  of the office of refugee resettlement shelters   and sadly what was happening is that  therapists were were being forced to disclose   some of the things these kids had  told them and and some of these kids   had to to do horrible things um to defend  themselves so they might have had to murder   somebody they might have had to steal something  and what was happening is that this was being   used against these children in immigration court  to call them a criminal and and then deport them   um again just just part of the inhumanity that's  happened through this whole process thank you   um does the uh laura longoria asks does the world  health organization have any programs to help with   situations like these um all the refugee issues  around the world donations around the world help   contribute to an international fund to help can  the u.n help and she expresses her sadness and   disheart disheart just being dishearted about all  of this so the un has the human rights commission   and they have programs for refugees around the  world as well too and there are many non-profits   that actually do much of this work i was actually  in beirut about a year ago this last year and   worked with a group called war child that actually  went into the syrian refugee camps which were   really different than our our family detention  centers when you went into there there were   this group was working with girls and the girls  were telling me i want to be a teacher when i   grow up i want to be a doctor when i grow up and  you can use some of your nonprofits to really help   with trauma-informed care and help these families  in that that whole resettlement in their whole   displacement and becoming full through this  process the united states has not chosen to do   that but it is happening in other places around  the world and again this is really reframing   illegal immigration to victims of a global  refugee crisis and if we do that then we can take   advantage of ngos as well as some of the un and  world health organization resources to help people   great thank you um how can individual american  citizens keep the momentum moving forward to   reverse the stage of genocide where we're now in  i think again the the greatest thing that we are   going to be able to do in the next few weeks  is vote we have an administration who has set   forth these policies that are abhorrent and we  need to stand up and say this is this is awful   we do not accept this as americans we are better  than this and vote that will be the ultimate   amount of change but i think the understanding too  that people come because of fear and understand   that if somebody is in this country illegally  that that there's a reason why they're here and   to show some compassion to be able to give to some  of the organizations around that help out families   there's one locally called every last one that is  helping to connect some of these kids with their   parents and with their families but look up some  of these organizations and be part of the solution   thank you another participant says thank you  for speaking with us and for all the work you do   i'm a first year in the occupational therapy  program this is the exact population i want to   work with where should i begin to volunteer  which organization should i connect with   i would start to work with ask some of  your professors in occupational therapy   about opportunities to do this there may  be some um there may be some opportunities   to work through some of our regional centers or  through some of our school systems or through some   of our our family organizations that work with  with some of our displaced population but but all   a good place to ask to to start to look at where  can you connect with folks thank you do you have   um any insights about aces the epigenetics and the  long-term generational effects that you can share what we see with aces and long-term effects are  our depression our anxiety our difficulty with   getting into school and i think that that  what's important to know is is that there   is great evidence that these things exist what we  see on the other side is somebody who's not doing   well with school somebody who's getting into a  lot of fights somebody who's having depression   and anxiety and the important part here is to  connect them to trauma-informed care resources   because somebody who looks at that disability and  looks at that problem through that traumatic lens   has some specific skills in helping these  families address that and begin to heal   yeah i um a question from me i've had  some difficulty uh finding resources   for trauma-informed care for my  little patients and i know that   children's hospital is a great um you know place  for this but i think the need outstrips the um   the resources sometimes do you have to say  you're right i think that that we're beginning   to understand this but first of all getting that  child connected and secondly especially with covid   continuing to do that connection and particularly  in a virtual world where many of our very   underserved families don't have broadband access  so that that virtual appointment is tough to do   these are all things that that that  really become challenges for our families   um i would love to see an organization like a  spectrum or a cox actually do some work in just   providing broadband to some of our families  who need it that that would that would be a   great first step but um again this is kind of  advocacy and beginning to put it into action   correct um we have a question that says thank you  for sharing this is so important to acknowledge   that this is government-sanctioned abuse are  there steps we as future clinicians can take   to help push educate and advocate for this  change and that and so it never happens again i think as doctors we you start with your  patient you start with what you see from   your patient you start with the science and what  you want to do is be involved and be informed in   policies and you can start at your local your  local practice level your local hospital level   but talk with your legislators and talk with  your elected officials and talk with people   who run businesses and run organizations that  all of us use but particularly some of our are   more underserved families those are all good  places to start and as you work within the   community you begin to find who it is you can  talk to about certain issues and certain problems   whether it is getting jobs whether it is accessing  health care whether it is accessing safe housing   so find one connection that you're interested  in maybe on behalf of one of your patients and   that's where you start all right i think we have  time for one more question um let's see here   any specific websites organizations or  specific representatives we should contact your best your best representative contact is  your representative because they represent you and   and let them know particularly if you take  care of families who have been refugees   what's going on what's happening with these  people that uh particularly if you're in an   area that that isn't california in an area that  tends to be more conservative the rhetoric is   is that they're crossing illegally where we know  that they they're not allowed to cross legally and   people are being sent back to dangerous  conditions using that one patient's story   with a legislator means the world means  more than any data that you can show them   and then offer with a particular legislator  to be a contact in case they want to know   more about what's happening with families because  that begins that bi-directional conversation   where you can work together and make a difference  in something all right thank you so much dr kraft   there are many more questions sadly too  many for us to answer here um and many   um expressions of gratitude for your talk so i  will relay those to you and um i i gonna ask you   i'll put you on the spot um because you are part  of our our trojan family may um people who are   who have additional questions or need resources  contact you um absolutely absolutely i'm happy   to to answer any questions that anybody has i'm  really thrilled that you tuned in to this vision   and voices to hear about this topic because it  is sadly so timely and and and the good thing   is is that we're at a point where we can make a  change and it's so important for our own humanity   thank you so much i want to um just take a moment  as well to again thank our visions and voices team   and to let people know that this is the first  in a series of three events um that my faculty   partners and i are presenting this year in january  homer venters who's a physician and epidemiologist   uh we'll talk about his work as he's the  author of life and death in rikers island um   and grew out of his work as chief  medical officer for new york city's   um jails and kate gilmour will be here in  march and she just completed five years as   united nations deputy high comm high commissioner  for human rights so we hope you'll be able to   join us for those events as well with that we  will sign off thank you so much again thank you
