 you we have a fantastic discussion coming up on fostering innovation I'm going to like double up the mics here so we're going to do four presentations then we're going to have a brief discussion of the themes that come up what I might do is just encourage people to kind of come forward and then after the presentations we can have something of a sort of discussion as a group so that where we're opening that up so we're gonna hear from Gillian Docherty who's the CEO of the data lab from Amy Williams who's the founder and CEO of good loop from Zoe Webster who's the director of AI and the data economy at UK RI and from Chris Wright who's the CTO of Moixa - am I saying that right Chris boom okay brilliant so without further ado there was a clicker right here Gillian this stage is all yours thank you very much I mean I just like to echo my thanks for hanging on in there five o'clock and it's been a long wait as they say the Australian so way did you and delighted to be here and to represent the data lab and some of the work that we're doing in Scotland and gonna just touch a little bit on what we do so the data lab is Scotland's Innovation Center for data science Andy I we are on the whole publicly funded but our mission is to help maximize the value of data for Scotland which is the beg mission it's something that gets myself and my team up eager and excited every single morning to try and make a difference and we get involved in lots of different things and I'm going to just talk you through a few examples of some of the way that we are working with both industry and public sector and academia and Scotland to help enemy using data science and AI so what we do we do three real pillars of activity collaborative innovation skills and training and community building and essentially they represent that support to enemy scales and community so in terms of support tennety essentially what we do is we perform guide install for organizations who are looking to build new products or services or build productivity or optimisation benefits for their organizations we provide a matching function for those industry or public sector partners to academics in Scotland so if someone of the some of the world's best academics who work with global companies and export their talent all around the world and our challenge and task is to get them working with the industry and company down the street we support cohorts and companies to bed and tenement UK and so other funding goals and Zoya will tell you a little bit more about that and provide resources from our data science team onto projects on the funding element we have a small fund that we can use to buy an academic team and over the last four years we've invested in over a hundred projects and those projects range massively from startups to large multinationals to large parts of our public sector and really I'll give you a few examples because that's what brings it to life so we've been working with the beats ins cancer hospital is Scotland's largest cancer unit and we've been working with academics from Strathclyde University building algorithms and computer vision technology to the Lenni tumors from healthy tissues for complex neck cancers we've been working with our legal startup who were building a claims management dispute platform and using natural language processing to analyze all previous case law and main statistical modeling to give you the probability of success of your claim before you even engage a lawyer all the way through to working with a subsea pipeline inspection company who were using computer vision algorithms to automatically annotate high-definition video feed from the seabed as our Ovie's flyover pipelines and energy cables two-sport things like few joints and aggregation and the cable automatically rather than a human setting on a ball and then annotating the video themselves so that's just three examples of the kind of projects that we've been involved in and it's great to support organizations on their journey to provide that matching process with any academic from across Scotland fantastic universities or to deploy or data science team onto those projects to run pilots or proof of concepts now the companies that we've worked with are predicting an increase in their revenue of over 105 million pounds and the creation of over 350 high value jobs as an outcome of the projects that we've done and it's great to be able to showcase that and she'll kiss that innovation so bringing considering the stage that we learn from the labs from research enter live production applications so that's the first pillar of activity that we do I think the second pillar is skills and talent and one of the things we realized really early on and many of you will know this the biggest inhibitor in this space to innovating is getting access to the right skills and talent so over the last four years we've been investing and helping to create and nurture and develop that talent and that includes sponsored master's students so we're we have funded the student ships for a number of master students we've drawn that program from 40 students in our first year across three universities specialties to this year I have a hundred and fifty five students across 11 universities and 23 different masters courses and we pull that cohort together for Mehta scale training for introduction to industry for a challenge ennovation week that happened last week in Glasgow actually and it was really there too right through to placement opportunities to run their master's dissertations and endlessly and this week we have a hundred of those students Oh across industry in Scotland from Chevron to Glasgow City Council to the NHS and to really start ups around ecosystem and Edinburgh and Glasgow we also can Kofun doctorate programs so PhDs and engineering doctorates and the engineering doctor which we piloted with some Andrews had never been done before in this subject field of data science and that's because the researchers spend 80% of the time and Industry working on real problems and are awarded the doctor on the back of that program right through to partnering to run continuous professional development and both data science boot camps introduction to machine learning data visualization courses right through to executive education where over the last 18 months we've taken 1,200 people through the opportunity that data presents for senior business leaders how do you get your board team-based why is it important we'd argue in the maturity curve what do I do next those questions that many c-suite ask and many of you in the room will have been in the situation for the c-suite have said to their cio go and get some of that AI stuff that's what we need or actually I want you to go and hire 20 data scientists we're going to throw our data over the wall and they're going to tell us something we don't know so part of our rule is telling them to hang on hold on that's not quite how you do it that's not how you get the best of either the data scientists that you may well hire or the best for your business so it's been really exciting to work great across that suite and then at the other end of the scale supporting the other agencies or in building modern apprenticeships and graduate level apprenticeships for data analysts and data scientists and rake down to supporting organizations who work in schools so we were really honored earlier this year to work with plamen in secondary engineers and we launched a program called stat Wars which was a competition for 10 to 12 year olds using felon view data to design the next movie heads so it's very much like the Netflix model and it was great to see the presentations from these group of 10 year olds and they've made up bad juice for themselves I am a data scientist I am a visualization expert and it was really motivating to see actually we need to see that future talent if we're really going to maximize the opportunity from data and finally as a community in an event program where we run to data festival rate across Scotland and March this year we had 65 events and four and a half thousand people participate 500 skill heads all the way through to ministerial events and everything in between and it was just really good to see the whole country energized I mean we had ballistic datasets from the Leverhulme forensics Institute what's not to get excited about getting your hands on that type of data and it's been great to run traps data learning journeys with Scottish develop international to support cohorts from all around the world that are coming to Scotland to see what's going on there to work in building foreign direct investment opportunities for companies saying I need to build a data team wait am I going to do it well my answer is in Scotland and with that I'm going to hand over to the next speaker thank you very much hi my name's Amy I'm the founder and CEO of good loop good loop is actually Scottish business and my CTO has worked quite racing with the data lab so segue cool smooth so as I said we come from Scotland Goodley it was founded in Edinburgh October 2016 and as you can hear I am NOT Scottish I'd been working in London a big ad agency called Ogilvy Ogilvy worked with big brands like British Gas British Airways Unilever so I've been learning a lot about the industry and my co-founder Daniel he'd been living in Scotland working he did a PhD in artificial intelligence from Edinburgh University and then he started winter well associates which was building white label advertising technology software which used a AI to basically creepily follow you around the internet so I've been working in making adverts and he had been working in ad tech using AI so we'd come from very very different worlds and very different perspectives but we both sort of realized the same sort of broken element of the industry and it was really illustrated by this scandal last year with Cambridge analytical completely damaging the public's trust in how they manage their data and you look at things like ad blockers we have 600 million devices using ad blockers worldwide and it grows 30 percent year-on-year so the the relationship between advertisers and the human beings they're trying to advertise to is inherently broken I had an idea which was there's a lot of money in advertising is so much money and if we could use some of that money to actually fix some of these issues then you could make a hell of a lot of good happen in the world so I went on a website called work in startups comm it's like a forum you post ideas about businesses and I wrote a post that said I have no money I have no idea what I'm doing but I have this idea around using big big this big market of advertising creating a more respectful and meaningful relationship between the consumer and the advertiser and get in touch if if you want to work with me a lot of weirdos replied to that text a lot of strangers but one guy in particular Daniel based in Edinburgh said oh yeah I think I could probably help you with that so much to my mum's absolute she was just completely terrified about this but I flew up to Scotland to meet a man I met on the Internet he didn't kill me he actually founded a business with me and we decided together to use ad money to solve the world's problems it's quite a lofty goal but we were on our way to doing that and the reason it using ample money to solve the world's problems is actually realistic is that being a good brand being an advertiser that represents social issues more important sort of social environmental issues that consumers care about it's because the data backs up if you look at surveys around why people connect with brands a huge part of that is the social values that they illustrate 89 percent said they were more likely to buy from a company leading with values and it will also increase their loyalty and Unilever they have social brands so dove would be an example of a social brand where they talk about championing real beauty and challenging fake beauty standards so they found that they're sustainable and social brands grow 50% faster than their non social brands because soap is boring but talking about like challenging beauty standards is important and interesting and since it's it's a really powerful message and I think it's quite exciting to think about how being a good business can also be good for business so I'll briefly explain how good loot works we take adverts that advertisers are already running on YouTube on TV we wrap it in oh sorry we wrap it in what we call our ethical ad player so this is an interactive ad format which has a 15-second count down along the bottom once you've watched the ad for 15 seconds without pressing that very tempting skip button you then unlock a donation funded by the advertiser and you can choose which charity to give it to so this example is with Doomba Doomba Roy Cornish via they're all brewed bait down in Cornwall they're a proud of that heritage so when you watch the doom barrage you unlock a donation to surface against sewage which is a Cornish charity and you can choose if you want to fund beach cleanups or their schools initiative or their safest surface initiative so the user gets a little bit of choice you get to do good for free just by watching an ad and we also run on social channels with a swipe up to donate message or the swipe down to select a charity message on on some premium publishers as well so we run across all different websites all different social channels and all you have to do to engage all you have to do to donate is is give some of your time it doesn't just do good though and I think that's one of the things I've learned building this business is if you build an ethical company just because you're a good person you're never gonna make any money so you have to really drive first and foremost from the from the benefits to the business thinking about what is it the advertiser is looking for and how can I deliver ROI for them you're going back to my point at the beginning around how you can be a good business and also that can be good business so driving results like completed view rates is an important way that we illustrate you're not just donating because you're a good person you're using good loot because it actually drives higher engagement with your content we also look at brand uplift so we'll send retargeting studies sabotage to people that have been advertised too and we'll ask them to what extent you think of KitKat as a charitable brand or to what extent do you think of Pepsi as lining with your values and we find a real shift away from negative responses and towards and positive responses which is a really important illustration of what I think is the underpinning of my business which is that you can be both ethical and effective in your marketing purpose and performance don't have to be an either/or decision you can have both especially in today's world where consumers are driving their purchase decisions based on their social values so in summary good route connects brands with purpose in a way that is scalable because we plug into global programmatic advertising effective because we deliver 75% higher engagement and impactful because we literally fund good causes with every view so that's us thank you excellent hi I'm Zoe Webster I'm director for AI and data economy that's innovate UK I'm going to say a bit more about what we do to support innovation in the UK and then I'll add at the end some shameless plugs for some of our funding opportunities open to you all so in the mat UK is part of relatively new organization called UK research and innovation it started life in April 2000 18 it brings together innovate UK with the seven Research Council's and with a new body called research England which is part of hefney our job is to support world leading research and innovation in the UK to maintain and strengthen the UK's position in R&D we're there for economic impact for social impact environmental impacts but also to generate new knowledge and to see where that takes us and hopefully a lot of that will take us to huge positive benefits for everyone so although there are some new ideas floating about both in the research base and in business and we're there to help bring those out and get them to make that impact so in the written UK is primary for the business facing part of UK research innovation and what we really care about alongside those other things is around economic growth so we want businesses like yours to grow hugely in the UK and you'll hear about one in more detail shortly so we help companies by funding them many many people now are support providing grants where we share the cost of R&D with you with other partners we also more recently provide other funding solutions it's not all about money though some of it's about connections and introducing you to partners customers investors other people like-minded in the community that you can meet the spark ideas from a bit perhaps safer than the text and going to fly off to see someone you've ever met but that sounds fun so so we funding connects and we cover the whole of the UK not just the Golden Triangle so um we've we've got a good track record in terms of delivering impact I'll skip over these very quickly but we measure ourselves by you know how many companies were helping having jobs being created how much value add to the economy is it generating so it's all really important that we track what we do but as you can see we've helped a lot of organizations in over 11,000 different projects now many of you will know about the industrial strategy that was set out by the government's we are a key partner in delivering that industrial strategy ideas was one of the five pillars that were set out and ideas is what we're all about in terms of making money out of those ideas the strategy also sets out four grand challenges and of course we're here today to talk about AI and data specifically but I would argue that AI and data underpins the other three very strongly so that's aging Society and thinking about the technologies and the business models that might allow us or to pay for the care that we will all need eventually clean growth so whether we driving more cars we're you know flying more planes we want energy that is there when we need it but done in a very sustainable way and the future of mobility being driven around by drivers cars potentially powered by batteries that are perhaps built and developed in the UK lots of opportunities there but as I said AI and data really underpins them all and actually for us AI data itself is underpinned by many different technologies whether that's 5g satellite communications cyber security all sorts of other technologies now I've mentioned a few ways we helped with innovation and Chris will shortly tell you about how our grants can help a company to grow we've recently been providing loans by if there are pilots 50 million pound pilots and that's been going very well I think that money's been deployed now we're looking at how that has helped those businesses and whether or not we should do more of that there's SBR I which I mentioned a bit later which is where we help government departments who have problems to solve they need to procure new innovations not often not available on the shelf so we work with them to frame the challenge to put it in a way that businesses across the economy will get excited about and will respond with their solutions and also as I said it's not all about money it's partly about connectivity so the knowledge transfer Network because Pollock's which I'll talk about in a moment are there to help people reach out and find what they need when they need it so a couple of examples that would set out in terms of the catapults because I think they illustrate something interesting about AI and you what what else apart from money can help so the digital catapult has launched something called so I shouldn't take a step back so a catapult is a physical technology or Innovation Center that is there to help people get access to facilities equipment skills expertise they might need to innovate we've got nine around the UK one of which is called digital that we've got others in offshore renewable energy high-value manufacturing stuff like applications a few others and this one in particular digital catapult has AI as one of its key priorities they're based in Houston they also look at future networking and the massive technologies and they're also looking at how a I into plays with those technologies obviously but here they have something called the machine intelligence carriage because they recognize that for many companies it was access to compute power that was limiting their growth particularly where they're using deep learning which as we all know is very hungry so they have set up a means with partners to allow companies to bid in to get hold of the compute power they need to validate their technologies to excite investors and to get that investment they need to grow and that's working incredibly well it also involves cut workshops and experimentation events as well to get people thinking about new ideas so that's something that is one way that we with the catapult are helping to support AI going forward and he's we've heard before as well data availability is often a limiting factor and actually this is keenly felt in some of the sectors that the catapults work with in particular here we've got the offshore knuble Energy catapult which is playing its role in helping companies who wouldn't normally share data to share data for the benefit of many of them so for example with offshore wind wave and tidal energy projects you know that's huge heavy equipment that's going out and operating often in harsh conditions and that she what's needed is for the operators to understand how that's all going and they need the data for that and that's data from various assets from various components but need bringing together in the same place to be properly harnessed so they're helping provide that access to data to manage it in a trusted way and that's the kind of role a catapult can play but also start to look at what's needed to then crunch that data what kind of information architectures are needed to crunch that some sectors are perhaps further down the line and with this than others but but that's what they're doing there how help diffuse that across their sector and then before handing over to Chris I want you to talk about some very specific funding opportunities that are open right now that might suit your businesses and you might want to think about applying to the first one is what goes smart grants so these are truly open in scope that open to any company in the UK to apply for we're particularly interested in SMEs in this case so this could be an SME working alone or it could be an SME involved in a consortium of partners the Eakins you see that can be full project sizes roundabout from 25,000 pounds up to half a million pounds in the case of a single company or up to two million pounds and the collaborative setting so this is again across the economy we're not pinned down to any particular technology it's open to AI as much as any other technology these are quite competitive but we do fund the strongest ideas that come forward if you want any advice about putting that location in the tn are there to help and all the information is on our website the other competitions I wanted to mention just in case but anyone in the room has a particular interest in this is using data and digital technology to improve adult social care we all recognize as a problem is an opportunity to potentially help and I believe that's an SP RI competition which is 100% funded the grants you can see is you get a percentage of your project costs back as grants normally about 75% if you're an SME but it depends on the competition another one which again is s Bri is around AI supported early fracture diagnosis again lots of AI data technologies that could be of use there but we have other competitions that might pique your interest at the moment we've got some in energy systems were quite a few in energy systems actually and immersive technologies as well but it's also it's always worth looking on our website for the latest opportunities so shameless plugs over and I'm going to hand it to Chris right from wit sir a company that is growing like billy-o and has received a grant from us in the past so we were to Chris to toe your story thank you thanks I'm gonna tell you a little bit about our journey and also where where we've got to as a bit but we've been working with innovate for more or less ten years more or less we're involved with one of your very early competitions around deploying kind of technology and manufacturing plants so just a very quick overview of more exert what we do with so we're working in the in the energy space we have largely two strands of what we do on the one hand we make energy storage hardware to go into homes so it's basically a big battery that goes in if you have solar panels on your roof most of that energy would basically be exported to the grid when you're out at work now if you have a big battery there you can store that energy and then when you are home in the evening in battery can deliver it to you to use but if you've got thousands of homes with battery Tim and they're all Internet connected devices and suddenly you can access a kind of aggregated was a resource across all of these batteries to deliver a large amounts of energy individually they're really quite small devices in electricity grid terms but as an aggregate they've become quite significant and that's something which can help to to avoid the need to turn on a fossil fuel powered power station when the grid needs extra energy or balance the grid and so on the other hand we've built a platform that controls many assets starting with the the the the hardware that we've made the thousands of things in the in the UK and now rolling that out into other domains so that's where the sort of AI machine learning piece comes in for us is kind of that optimizing those and predicting what will happen with them and predicting and managing that the best way to deliver value to customers so just to go back to innovate so these are three projects which have been funded by in a way the first one actually not funded by innovate but managed by innovate so it's a European money but somehow innovate seem to manage the whole process and one thing that I want to kind of make clear is we're a little company we're now sixty people when we started getting innovate grants we were less than ten and and so at that stage the opportunity for not only to get some equity free money to help you fund your your your product and develop it but also the opportunity to work with really big players because you can it gives us structure around which you can pack a kind of consortium and say so we take the pressure Eric there that started quite some time ago and at that point you know getting British Gas and SSE to come play with us inside the structure and genuinely participate in kind of helping us to make our technology better and through partners in that was at least as important as the money to be honest because actually you know that gives a huge amount of credibility as a tiny company hey yeah we're partnered with British Gas we've partnered with SSE that makes a massive difference to what you're doing so that is I think not to be underestimated in the kind of benefits that kind of like doing stuff in with innovate has brought but it's also really been really great to kind of like have these projects help fund the progress of our of our company and so we've done so the bottom one project Eric we were doing localized energy so how you can control a sort of using our platform at a community level we had a hundred homes in Oxford so how you can control the energy flows inside of those hundred homes to maximize the amount of renewable energy that that community self-consumed decreasing their reliance on grid energy and that was kind of also can I thought bringing along yeah British Gas and SSE and saying hey there is another way of thinking about how energy works at the community level and then we have the fs project which stands for something completely unpronounceable which I can never remember but that one we were working with some really great partners to deliver the very very early vehicle to grid so there we're taking the technology that we've developed for static batteries in homes and then saying okay now we're going to make that work for batteries in cars so if you plug those in and you have a bi-directional charger so you can actually suck energy out of the car as well as pushing it back and suddenly you can use the battery that's in your car to balance your home balance your building so demonstrating that technology was really great and then the final one with Hitachi so again an example of how that sort of structure gives you a chance as a tiny company to work with really big partners and for them to take you seriously and be engaged on that level is really key and that one was was doing flexibility market stuff with with electric vehicles and static batteries in in the ours are silly and I'm off this off the coast of so just to kind of say okay well where have we got to with this so one example of a partner we have is a company that most people in the UK haven't heard of can they touch you so they are a large Japanese corporates it's a very open YZ type of company called a trading houses so they're kind of there are a hundred billion dollar company so they're bigger than Sony for example as a company and one other thing they do is putting out larger than our systems about ten kilowatt hour energy storage systems into homes in Japan and they're doing about 1500 of theirs a month or something so those are already managed on our platform so that's the kind of we've moved managed to move from being all about the hardware to being a software play in japanese and we're now controlling over 70 megawatt hours of storage in japan through kind of doing a commercial deal and they explicitly brought us as that sort of brain of their system so they had a capable battery but with no intelligence attached to how that managed energy and so that they've bought our platform as the brain of that system and i think the other thing that they found was that through working with a small company like us agile that they could move much quicker so we signed a deal with them a little bit of equity investment from them at christmas 18 months ago and by July that year we had 3,000 of their system our platform when we're delivering services having you know integrated with their Hardware localized our interface to Japanese work with all of their partners and got that happen so that was you know I think much much quicker than they ever expected that they would be able to get this sort of technology working and say you know that sort of thing can be really fun and then just this Christmas we signed a deal with Honda so taking that experience that we developed in an innovate project and that was a key kind of part of of our due diligence with Honda was kind of like you know we have done this before here's the project results here's the thing that we did in this project at small scale yes you can trust her to deliver this for your global ambitions for how you manage your fleets of cars as you electrify transport you know so that was absolutely key showing those two projects I showed earlier the FS project where we demonstrated vehicle to grid and then there are the silly project where we demonstrated that we were working with another Japanese the corporate itachi and delivering those services those gave us the credibility to say to Honda yes we can and so now we're developing with them a platform to kind of electrify how they think about delivering energy to electric vehicles as they roll out so that's that's whether this year's kind of focus and really exciting I've actually got back from Japan yesterday and kind of lost touch with what day is meeting the most partners moving those all to the next level and with them we're starting in Islington just down the road so we're doing a little vehicle-to-grid trial so there isn't enough that they're going to have to electrify all of the cars that they own they owned their whole fleet including rubbish trucks and stuff sure a bit harder so they're starting with the kind of cars that they use around the town and interestingly you know say isn't and hound holds a massive building but even with only five cars kind of parked behind the hall we can actually take them off grit off their baseline so it's kind of like you know there's a huge amount of energy stored in electric vehicles and delivering that into buildings balancing it so that both we can try and move the energy to when it's least expensive and lowest carbon but also occasionally they have they have a venue as part of the things in Town Hall and sometimes when they have a really big rock band they ship all the circuits and we can actually prevent that as well we can kind of like pull suck energy from the cars and deliver it to the rock bands perhaps our first vehicle to rock band integration and and deliver that and then and then rolling that up next year to 250 sites in West Sussex with another kind of council that's looking to kind of smell the mustard and see that they have to change to zero carbon vehicles so that's kind of fun and just very quickly because I know we should move on to a discussion but we kind of think about delivering these things in in in in tranches so delivering value to customers directly through sort of grid share client we call our platform grid share you know through lovely interfaces and stuff but also through optimizing the system using this AI machine learning technology to take all of the data that we have which is a lot about how people are using energy and generating energy and weather forecasting all other things taking they're making a prediction for what will happen home by home each one at a time tomorrow and then out of that we can then say okay and what's the best way to use the asset that they've expensively bought to manage their energy and deliver the most value to them and then we partner with people so we partner with utilities and energy companies and makers and people who make heat storage systems partner with those to deliver those service to them and out of that if per customer you want to understand how much value you're getting from the system as a partner you want to understand how much value you're delivering to all of your customers who we're serving and then the final thing is okay so I've got all this flexibility on this platform now I need to deliver that as a service to the National Grid and to energy utility companies until the deer knows so that's our services piece of that guy and then you can kind of see some of the people that were working with in that space so it talks you I've talked about before Honda I've talked about before but also it isn't in council a bunch of housing providers Scottish Power and Power Grid centrica so we're taking that kind of like you know gone from being a little company and we really kind of growing up in terms of some of the clients that we're actually delivering this to you now and you know a lot of that you can see names on there the way we've worked with innovation projects in order to enable us to get to that next level and that's been really kind of very much part of our journey over the last ten years or so and what we do here is that I mean I've just spoken about this a little bit but sort of building recognition of how things have been how Energy's being used as patterns making an optimized plan for each system one by one risk profiling each Pearce person so sometimes use an example of kind of so if you're trying to understand how much energy a person is going to use and what their key to that is understand what they're going to do tomorrow and then actually a freelance journalist it's a very different beast from someone who works for a corporate and goes to work at 7:43 a morning but understanding that risk is really important because then you know okay I can bid this person into this flexibility service and get this value for them or no that's too risky I have to kind of use them as a backup or whatever and I went through talk through this but some of the kind of illustration of some of the kind how we do that forecasting and how we then take that and turn that into sort of plans that the systems run to deliver the most value for people including kind of then taking that prediction turning it into a forecast for when flexibility is available and then bidding that back to National Grid or EDF saying hey cross our aggregate fleet here is the flexibility not for you so you have to pay this money to our customers and they get to sweat their assets and get more value from that and we love ikki graphs and this is really just to say as a final thing this is something that we've kind of thought about and worked on for quite some time so we filed a pattern on this in 2008 she's quite a long time ago in this space where we talked about powering the car from you're powering using the car the energy in your car to power your home aggregating demand side resources such as domestic load to deliver flexibility in the home managing when that energy is used and when it's integrated with renewables and then we found since then that actually about now more than 200 corporates are forced to cite our pattern and and reference it because it's a key early piece of IP in this space it provides a really good leverage for us when we go and so again so kind of Honda or it taught you hey yes we do know what we're talking about in this place so that's a little kind of journey that we've been on and and really yeah we're very very grateful to innovate for kind of helping us like move down that journey and bring the partnerships that we've had together and and give us the money it's been good thank you stay back I'd love to invite the other speakers up on stage as well I'm going to abuse my position to ask one question then I'm going to open it up to the to ask some more fantastic so what what a spread of perspectives we have across this group it's brilliant and ask a really selfish question here goes I have dinner tomorrow evening with a few ministers of AI from different companies different countries we've heard about what's happening in Scotland we've heard a bit about what's happening across the UK maybe both from the people trying to create the communities and people in communities making their own companies happen if I'm the Minister for AI for country X what should I do to try and foster the kind of innovation that we've just seen and enjoyed across the four talks anyone anyone burning or should I just pick on Jilly and tend to hold these mics a little bit closer than yeah okay I tell me moved to Scotland for the weather for the weather absolutely hey um I think what we've learned over the last few years has been really interesting we've not done everything right we've had to alter the way we create the collaborations the way that we work and build those partnerships between academia parts the public sector and parts of the private sector I think what's really good about the size and scale of what we do is we can get our arms around it so I can a core Scotland that's like the Goldilocks economy it's not too big it's not too small too hot or too cold and by being able to get your arms around that you can make things really happen because if you know the data lab you know what's happening in Scotland now England and Yuki's much bigger than that but how do you keep communities that you can get your damage owned whether you create something in the north the you know London is just a beast in itself but but I think that's really important to make the most valuable connections you need to know what's going on yeah and maybe Chris or Amy any thoughts from the flipside you know there's this question about our innovators born or made and it feels like you both very clearly have some kind of entrepreneurial spirit but what's helped you to was taking the barriers out of your way as you've gone on this journey well I think if I was talking to a bunch of innovation like government ministers then then the obvious place to start is open data mm-hmm so publish your data and let people take that and make innovation out of that you know and do work that's between them there's a huge amount of kind of very valuable data locked away and the government has no idea how to use it so making and the UK government has actually been surprisingly you know relatively good at this in parts and and it's led to some really interesting work some really interesting innovation so I think if I'm talking about you give government people that's the place to start and then you know offer some offer some challenges up what are the challenges that you have you know governments will spend gazillions of money on completely useless consultants and if they gave a tiny fraction of them that money to this you know there should be perhaps like no one ever got five for hiring IBM that maybe NOAA should be hired for spending 1% of the IBM budget on young companies who are really hungry to prove that they can do amazing stuff got it any other thoughts from from your perspective what what could government do to take barriers out of your way or to put booster rockets on the back so we've had a lot of support from various different organizations in Scotland and one of the things I've been really impressed by is how open that the approaches are often worried that when we took funding from Scottish Enterprise or from edge you'd have to actually spend it within Scotland but they have what they call the International Scots Network so I can call up my account manager at Scottish Enterprise and say we're thinking of launching in Canada and he'll go in this network and find Scots living in Canada and I can talk to them and it's so good it's such a clever open way of thinking about things and we have an office in London which is where most the ad agencies are so when we get Scottish funding some of it pays wages in London which on the surface might seem like the wrong idea but actually means that we're kind of growing the pie for everyone so I've been really impressed by that quite open global perspective there's even a place called Nova Scotia right good good network questions from the audience you for braving the rain and you deserve to ask questions so at the back if you can shout I'll then repeat your question so we have some people watching live so don't don't take offence it's just for the for the people watching on streaming so there's a question on intellectual property that the pattern from 2008 was that a pattern in the US and I guess there's a subsidiary question which is why we filed that in the UK and then translated that into a European patent and that gave us priority on a US patent so you choose a geography to start but then you go down a journey where you have to you have a sort of time frame where you're able to then turn that international at some point you have to choose am I going to do all countries in the world because that becomes a very expensive exercise we didn't do everywhere because we didn't have the money to do that but we did do the US as part of that along with Europe and in the UK and the work the approach we took at that point was too far what we thought of as a big book patent so we wrote down all the things that we could think of around this space because it again even this was pretty speculative and early in this space 2008 no one was thinking about electric vehicles powering and we wrote down all all of the different a complicated claim structure and what that's meant is that later we can come back around ago that want me Sidra pattern and then filing that instruction that we've chosen super thank you it was on power systems in homes we have we have do have patterns on batteries but the one that I showed was about how a sort of power networks in homes and how those could then be aggregated with more with many homes yeah so that's and I'm I'm sorry I might I might just ask you to pick this one up one to one after so I want to create enough chances for other questions as well but maybe you guys can catch up offline pretty yes on the front here so another question are a hot topic of intellectual property so this is how do you go about sort of navigating that Zoe maybe do you have any thoughts on that from the sort of overall ecosystem perspective how can you help innovators to engage with this for pretty complex subject I mean we because we take a bit of a we don't get involved too much on the IP side when we fund projects and companies like Mike so it's up to them or in the way that some of the cost related to looking at patterns taking a look at if it's new IP then that can be covered looking doing patterns away we don't particularly have a department that helps with patent searches we have a strong relationship with the International Property Office and they're always there to help so I think that's that main way but but when new IP they are generating that's something that can be included in as part of the grant costs Gillian do you have any perspective on this from from data lab yeah I guess SEM similarly to innovate Yuki when we fund a project we're not unchaste in IP because we are not the best people to hold that the companies are the best people to hold that to then maximize the value it does get very interesting when you're partnering industry up with academia it gets and how does open-source feed into that do you have a policy on that or not really so the just probably the day club we don't take we are not the right place depending on the university some universities are much happier than other shusei to say actually the company should do with any resulting IP others less so so it really for us the challenges when we talk with an organization around a player idea we need to use our understanding of weird the flexibility lies across that academic sector to do the right matching process yeah so that's really really the other aspect that certainly we found as you get into a lot of dialogue and debate over IP and really in the cold lady I want to on the IP when is that anything that you can actually protect theory anyway yeah and there's a factoid is the number of patents being filed within machine learning data spaces going off the cliff is really really low any other questions on other topics these are in the in a very bright jacket well done a great question so how can we foster innovation at a younger age either in the university or even even younger in some school systems that's really interesting question I'm sure Gillian can say more but I mean one thing we've been doing quite recently as part of our diversity and inclusion programs to diversify the range of innovators that we engage with is we're Anna and young innovators program where we got people from 18 to 35 from backgrounds not tradition you know the kind of people who maybe didn't go to university and went a very different routes through life but have got ideas and don't think they had some support they really could so we ran that in partnership with the Prince's Trust and we've now got young innovators taking rather the fact we were doing that and where we're seeing some you with other relevant Department well getting that the ten twelve year olds getting excited in becoming data scientists for the day and for the rest of their lives potentially I think this is such a huge area and actually there's no one single organization I think can touch every school child in the way that we ought to in terms of inspiring them and enthusing them so I think the rule that we play but also many other partners in Scotland that I see Stephen here from codebase who do a huge amount of work I think the biggest take hanky beta in Europe right but it's really supporting and encouraging entrepreneurship at all levels we do a lot to support founders for skills which is sherry Coutu s company who connect local skills with entrepreneurs and business people in their local area to go in and inspire school kids about their journey and their story and having platforms like that and they've they spun a what founder as well which is a platform for schoolchildren to find what placements not just you know go to your local X but really meaningful what placements I think if we all get behind these initiatives because there's not a single organization that can do all and we really need to help the teachers I think it's really tough for teachers and career guidance I mean even in the tech industry we can't keep up so our responsibility is working in the industry is to support them inspire children to what they can do and what they're capable of and making those connections for them and it's is so impressive isn't it that my now ten year old daughter last year had a badge on her school blazer that said digital leader and this year she has about her school blazer that says digital Apprentice and I said huh okay interesting so you've gone from a leader to an apprentice like how does that work cuz you know I thought that like maybe a leader was more senior than apprentice and I got totally slammed by her she said look no no no daddy and leader just talks about stuff that's the kind of stuff that you do an apprentice actually gets their hands dirty and build stuff that's what I'm doing okay I've just been owned I think all models are pretty key as well I think just long before the young innovators program we did women innovation and we work with with Getty as well with a photography exhibition where we shows we can show to school kids under people around the world what women innovators look like and perhaps challenge people's preconceptions so I think there's something there I think a lot more we can do in UK or I to engage people whether they're in zillah's school or later on their career and they want to change career and come into STEM subjects or innovation question fantastic and so I'm going to close with their quote that's come up just a couple of times on this stage today which is the the old Peter Drucker quote culture eats strategy for breakfast and so maybe a me Chris in your environments what do you do to try and create that culture of innovation well maybe first you believe the quote and second what do you do to try and create their culture of innovation what does that look like day to day by the coffee machine Chris maybe then yeah I mean think for us and being very self conscious about what you like about your company and what you think it makes it great and holding on to that while you grow up as a company is quite hard and requires you to think about it quite self-consciously and be like okay that's the thing that's not right and let's kind of like how do we steer that in this environment the win is is yeah it's self-consciously breakfasting your way to greatness this is the home and you take 60 people for breakfast every two weeks no no it's like it's a kind of invitation open appreciation breakfast lovely I didn't steal that Network this is the knowledge transfer network in action so we have just had our first company away day so we're a team of 13 split across London and Scotland so you know some other people hadn't even met each other so it was our first one literally just Thursday and Friday just gone and it was it was partly just a like let's reflect on what we love about us like what we love about our team and what we want to become and who we want to be as individuals and who wanna be as a as a group and then I think also digging down a little bit on how we can actually use the Lean Startup methodology which is really all about if you have an idea for an innovation how can you bake it down to its most simple hypotheses you know like as good loop our business the most simple hypotheses of it was people would be happy to give some of their time and attention in exchange for a donation to charity if that hypothesis isn't true nothing else really matters so that was the first one we focused on so whenever someone comes to me and Daniel with an idea it's like will come to us with an idea the first hypothesis that underpins that idea and how you're going to test hypothesis and if you have those three things we can have a meaningful discussion about how it fits into the roadmap fantastic so keeping it simple eating your breakfast and getting those barriers out of the way please join me in thanking our presenters and panelists and then we're going to have a you you
