 Founder of Spacex and Tesla, Elon Musk , the research and Neuro technology founded in 2016 When the human brain is connected to the computer, Technology is introduced on the live broadcast So what exactly is the brain-computer interface and why does the incredible human brain connect to Zehra Space Space studies and teslayla Automotive field An advertisement that we know is a name that we know Actually also play in different fields. One of these initiatives is Any time You are active Named research established in 2016 What is its purpose To be able to set up a series between human brain and machines, that is, computers with thought to our brain and connected to them know everything routing facility which actually Matrix a similar technology in the movie knows already seen that follow those very well so far rather superficial explain our brain machine or brain-computer interface well, it's simple and increasingly childhood of the liquid is not a concept computer that widespread use of Virtual enhanced single is technologies in a period These technologies are an important work until transferring human brain to computers what Rollings he was not in the boy Brings Let us now look closely teminl in short this event first brain-computer interface brain truth Placing detect and analyze signals that occur on the desired action and conducting Computer ceiling systems Brain-computer interface or called brain-machine interface English Computer interface to form Sold Wi-fi known as these technologies are in principle all kinds can be used with a brain signal the brain in which the implant is either able to catch said signals through electrodes placed on the scalp in other words, science fiction movies or TV series are being taken the first step of the technology we have seen in the perform Script by interpreting and receive signals on brain-computer interfaces human brain c virtually control any device connected to the Internet will become a force that included memories of our brain object at the same time exciting and ke Contrasting with a technology that needs to be challenged The reason why brain-computer interfaces are promising Being able to make lives of people with disabilities easier than ever This technology meets our optimistic expectations that will be possible For example This Keyboard I read is possible to write by just thinking Of course, are these good expectations On the other side of the coin is the brain -computer interfaces with unmanned aerial vehicles in the world's other end either armed unmanned aerial vehicles there are expectations scary that you can control with the power of thought as in every technological developments appear to be will determine our expectations Intentions in here recently in a working brain-computer interface shown they describe believe Already meet with expectations Give the images  But he does not believe It is not the owner of the only company that works in this. Brain-computer interface is the subject. Known researches of companies like Facebook and On the other hand, studies in this area continue in the scientific world. iyor not believe you spray sex and inventor acquired the test you worthy of horses, including successful business people will not see iznet Not His rivals even Faso narrow that has also developed the Internet personally US $ 35 million remains laboratory studies with an investment of Facebook has yet net quantity descriptions 500 million to $ 1 billion  a a private research company working on this matter with investments purchased TT Arena Therefore whatever Each I see you do not believe this will be a prototype Maybe ever seen in brain-machine interface of the Professional Figure in makeup were followed version as seen now some scientific play Colombia in the field of brain-machine interface University with brain waves But they managed to vocalize this way Pass the mind of the human being used in the side experiment. Thanks to serious thoughts Voiced clearly by the computer Do not speak The famous fizz we lost in Gallipoli 2017 Buy Hawking Computer The subject of Hawking computer Eye movements We have to write before that's Thinking conversations with the discovery can be read from the brain to the equine science before the play Speech made the world a prosthetic home Motion Such developments Motor placing the artificial skeleton of persons with disabilities lost their road showed that we have a future Relatives s that can get rid of all obstacles also have a 2016 interface that chimpanzees connect with wheelchair Does robust ability to control provided to write 12 words of text per minute by thoughts Meanwhile, chimpanzees can be a learning with comprehension of a limited number of words Brain-computer interfaces Last situation told you at Figure All you can Now the eyes do not believe love Euroleague All developments are located at the bottom continue to transfer subscribe to click and turn on notifications Discuss
