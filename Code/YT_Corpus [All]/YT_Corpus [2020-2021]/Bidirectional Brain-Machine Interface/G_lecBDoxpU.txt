 hey guys I'm Louise I'm a staff writer at Wired where I usually cover security surveillance Amazon those kinds of things but today I'm actually gonna go off my typical beat and I'm gonna be covering a scientific paper about a brain interface which is a way for people to communicate with each other only using their minds our brains are going to interact with the physical world in ways that we can hardly imagine today we're on the cusp of a cognitive revolution brain interfaces have been used to control prosthetics synthesized speech and even fly planes but now researchers are using them to allow multiple users to collaborate with each other so we're gonna do three things first we're gonna read the paper and break it down then we're gonna figure out what kinds of questions we have and try and find some answers for them and lastly we're gonna reach out to the authors of the paper and other researchers in the same field all right so let's get started with the paper so it's called brain net a multi-person brain-to-brain interface for direct collaboration between brains let's see we got here I read a lot of papers for my job and there's always usually kind of an introduction here that backs up a little bit talks about the topic more broadly because that allows them to then explain how their contribution is relevant here's a good example here we have the first brain-to-brain interface is demonstrated by Rao and colleagues in 2013 so we could look up those researchers or to pull the bibliography out you always want to kind of shout out other researchers in the field they can evaluate the research for us in this paragraph they're kind of explaining what's different about their research those are good things to mention because you want to contextualize this research why are you writing about this paper okay so now I've kind of gone over the basic parts of the paper and this is how their experiment works there's three people and two of them are sending signals to a third person about a game of Tetris the first two people kind of decide how they want the blocks to move and the third person receives that signal and moves the blocks so they can not let the blocks stack on top of each other with something really out there like this we definitely want to make sure that we have a paragraph really early on in our story that talks about some of the kind of technologies that they used they use transcranial magnetic stimulation and EEG technology that's something that we're gonna want to look up and try to understand more about so here are the results they used five groups three subjects in each group and the accuracy was pretty good eighty one point twenty five percent one thing that's interesting here is that they keep making an analogy to social networks so this is good you can see some of the epic stuff in here those kinds of epics things are definitely good to look for in a paper like this because you're helping the reader to understand better the ethics considerations behind this technology so that's almost it normally have to read the paper the first step I would take is getting some basic terminology down okay so let's start by learning a little bit more about transcranial magnetic stimulation alright here's an article from Johns Hopkins okay so what uses magnetic pulses which paths easily and painlessly do this fell into the brain okay so next we're gonna learn a little bit about eg tech oh interesting so it looks like Facebook is also working on something like this I might be good so this is a test that detects electrical activity so we're just gonna make some notes about TMS and EEG okay so now we're gonna see kind of like what our readers might already know about this what's already out there about this topic so we're just gonna type in brain-to-brain interface what I'm always looking for at this point in my reporting is references to other things that people might have seen because you never want to write a story that feels really context list so they really come away not only understanding how that one paper worked but what they should think about this field of research yeah a lot of this is about the Elon Musk coverage so it's good to keep in mind you can add that to kind of our question to ask the researchers like what do they think of Elon Musk proposal that might be something we might want to ask good thing to check here is I'm going to look up Google Scholar and I'm gonna type in brain-to-brain interfaces to see it maybe someones written about this Google Scholar is just like will accept all of the results here are published in academic journals ok so interesting brain to mate interfaces military neurosurgical and an ethical perspective here we learned that DARPA which is the research arm of the US military is also working on technology like this so that's a good thing to note ok so now I have a little bit of background to contextualize this research a good place to start is just the lead researcher on the paper so I'm just going to look them up ok great so we're gonna send him a message and now that we've kind of got a little bit more context we're gonna look up some of the papers that we looked at here to see if you can find some other outside sources to comment on this paper for us the monkey brain a very good band name these researchers may be good sources for us I also saw here an article about like the ethics of this kind of thing so another source would be a bioethicists episode studies brain computer interfaces perfect ok I see if maybe there's at least one other one so we can see a Duke the majority of the research is on brain machine interfaces so it's perfect we're gonna actually look up the main researcher at this lab journalist rely heavily on academics so it's really important to ask them very clearly for what you want from them I so sometimes everybody emails a lot of times now I'm gonna call a senior editor here at Wired name's Sandra Robson I'm gonna see if she has any tips or advice as I'm reporting on this topic so what do you think of ask them how could you make this information like have more depth [Music] yeah that's one thing I kind of liked about this work is that they're not uh opening anyone like jr. sort of surgery or anything which is great yeah well thank you so much dad I really appreciate your help it's been a couple of days and some of the researchers that have reached out to got back to me hadar sure how are you can you hear us yeah this is Louise thank you so much for making the time to talk to us today I really appreciate it okay great so can you kind of just walk us through the experiment and I'm really curious about why you designed it the way that you did back in 2013 we demonstrated the very first brain to brain communication system and this involved one sender and one receiver so that was the very first time that I know we had demonstrated that he could use non-invasive technology in humans to convey information from one brain to another human brain researchers didn't stop by connecting one brain to another they introduced a third person and tested sending conflicting messages through researchers refer to as a social network of brains and how would you define a social network of brains like what does that mean there's not so reliable and so the social network of brains here corresponds in a very limited way to you know solving the simple tetris-like problem but if you can generalize that that would mean brains that can take in what it needs to ignore the other unreliable information ignoring fake news tweets and the fake brains that are telling us the wrong information hopefully I think will be great for you to explain is just how the technology works like why are you having the subject stare at lights right like what is that doing to the brain and the cow does that actually transmit the information to the other person there are several different ways in which you can extract information from the brain non-invasively using EEG so the idea here is called a steady state visually evoked potential or SSB EP so if I want to select yes I look at a light that's flashing at the frequency of you know 17 Hertz if I want to say no I look at light that's flashing at a frequency of let's say 15 Hertz and so when you are paying attention and looking at a particular LED that is flashing at a particular frequency the visual cortex it starts to respond at that frequency to that flashing light and then we can even recognize that frequency from the EEG signals we recording doctor explained that once the subject actually focuses on a frequency researchers detected using EEG signals which are then sent to the receiver via a magnetic stimulator attached to their head the pulses are translated in the brain is an image which effectively shows the receiver something they aren't actually seeing and the binary part is like it's it's yes or no it's I see something or I don't and that's the that's the binary yeah the last question I want to ask is what do you want to do next so there's several different you know potential future directions that we're looking at right there you know right now we use this yes-or-no answer based on some flashing lights but then you know if you use that tomorrow you can start to extract more abstract kinds of information including potentially emotional signals also abstract kinds of thoughts and so on so we're hoping that you know we can start to get at that kind of information which would then allow us to potentially convey more complex forms of information than just a simple yes-or-no answer and so we are addressing that also at the center that I'm directing well thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us I really appreciate it sure thank you so much thank you like now we're gonna talk to a researcher at Duke who's been studying brain to brain interfaces for around 30 years he wrote a book about a decade ago about this technology oh good are you can you hear us yes I know that I'm about a decade ago well I guess was in 2011 you wrote a book about this topic and about what you thought the future of it would be and I'm curious about what you think has happened since then and like where you think this technology is going like I know that Elon Musk wants for you to be able to type without using your hands and just thinking I actually find it very amusing that Elon Musk is proposing things that have already been done everything that he proposed in terms of what is going to happen we already done it some things 10 years ago but I'm hearing press to the fact that now you have applications of brain machine interface for people have lost the ability to speak on throw devices in remote environments there are too dangerous or too difficult for a human being to penetrate BMI is being used for robot control and there's a lot of confusion of whether you should really use non-invasive technology versus invasive technology invasive technology meaning getting inside the brain and putting electrodes inside the brain that my opinion should be left to very critical applications in people who are completely disabled or cannot move at all and obviously for ethical reasons it seems a lot easier to be doing the non invasive research I think that you've done some with monkeys too right where you can do a little bit more invasive research than you might be able to do on human subjects yes in monkeys and rodents for instance is very useful to do the invasive approach because you are trying to learn about the brain but I think the using clinical applications and of course other applications is going to be limited by the ethical considerations the risk and the cost you bring up a good point which is right now it seems like with these brain to brain interfaces you can really only communicate pretty binary information human brain attributes they are primarily analog and they are encoded in a completely different way than you do in a digital machine so translating your emotions or my emotions or my intuition my creativity to an algorithm is not what happen we haven't really figured out a ways to produce or to deliver messages they're more complicated but you're never going to reach the level resolution that you get when you're inside the brain is there anything kind of about this paper and that you think is important to note or some of the limitations how would you think about this research as you know an expert in this area I think is a proof of concept this is an attempt to show that it can be done to some degree using a non-invasive method in humans the only major concern I have is that we should not consider this as a possibility of weaponizing the brain of using this technology and there are science to control weapons right it's so great to see these people who are paralyzed be able to speak and communicate and then on the other hand to see like DARPA is interest in all of this it's definitely really the opposite yeah does reason is important to speak up well thank you so much for guys I really appreciate you making the time to talk to us thank you I appreciate it now we're gonna talk to a bioethicists about some of the moral concerns that might arise with the use of this technology so I wanted to kind of talk to you about some of the ethical considerations with these brain-to-brain interfaces and these brain-machine interfaces we were trying to understand the phenomenology of being implanted with a brain-computer interface so what we will learn they're actually being merged with an accountable device which is linked with a an artificially intelligent component can lead actually to some radical attempt uses this means that the patient and the individual become very dependent and / brilliant on the device right right and just like more generally when you're thinking about these brain interfaces and these brain-to-brain interfaces I'm curious as an ethicist like what are some of the things that you're concerned about or that you you think about one of the first article that we're seeing is when the technology is reading the brain it's trying to select specific brain data but in reality it's not only looking for that specific data is also downloading all the data it can find in the brain if you will so that's mean that when you have two technologies reading your brain it's also pumping out some of the information that you might not want the technology to take in addition to privacy concerns frederick discussed the problem accountability what happens when brain interfaces assists in illegal or endangering actions either on purpose or because it's a problem with the technology well thank you so much Ryder I really appreciate you making the time to talk with us thanks for having me thank you very much yeah he's done the brain-to-brain but he's also a lot of brain computer stuff but that's like a part of this so I feel like one of the big things we learned here is that there's technology they can pick up on electrical signals that you could actually send to another brain I think some of the biggest things you really want to hit and would definitely be the future applications and the ethical concerns and also where is this going what are the things you need to think about as this technology is developing that's always a really good way to think about framing an article so I hope you enjoyed seeing kind of how a reporter at Wired works it was really interesting for me to learn about this topic that I really don't usually report on you
