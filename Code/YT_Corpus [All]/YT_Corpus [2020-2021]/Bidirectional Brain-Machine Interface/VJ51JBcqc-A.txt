 hello my name is Bruce Luber I'm a staff scientist at the NIH National Institute of Mental Health and I'd like to talk about some of the basics behind TMS transcranial magnetic stimulation by talking about the the basic parameters the physical parameters that we use to change TMS as we apply it to the brain and then give you some idea of some of the protocols we use to test its effects so what is TMS basically we're looking at by be field I mean magnetic field we're looking at magnetic field a changing magnetic field which produces a changing electric field inside the brain and that leads to depolarization of neurons in the brain locally right near the coil that we use to produce it so there's for instance an example of a coil the magnetic field surrounds the coil and sort of a toroid ship-shape in this case as you see this yellow line moving around that's the electric current moving around the coil inside of it it's a very large current it creates a magnetic field that's on the order of an MRI machine for instance you can go up to 2 Tesla and that Chi and the thing is that that that electric field only lasts for less than a millisecond one pulse is less than a millisecond long it's a very fast rising and falling changing current that creates a magnetic field also very fast rising and falling which induces electric current in the head near the coil and that creates changes this is a little section of an axon changes in a neural membrane such that you get neuronal depolarization and that can lead it to sub-threshold changes even before an action potential gets created so then if the fields not big enough to actually create an action potential it still can create effects in the membranes of the cells and in a synapses of the cells then create a longer term effects and in terms of inner coracle inhibition or an Oracle facilitation or excitation but it also does create when it's strong enough field it also creates action potentials it sets the neurons off and that of course leads to neurotransmitter release you know that in a synapse is a cell and that further leads to a synaptic action there and then sets off the you know the neurons that it's connected to and so on in the brain leading to changes in behavior so I'm very excited I'm an experimental psychologist I'm very excited about TMS myself I've been doing it for 24 years now because you can non-invasively affect behavior change the brain and test what's going on where you know locally in the brain for various functions like memory or sensation and but it's also very useful in terms of therapeutic applications so TMS is already fda-approved for depression and OCD and it's already being looked at in terms of long term changes they might be able to make in schizophrenia and anxiety it's been used for a long time looking at pain and looking at a recovery from stroke as well as movement disorders and and it's also looked at and studied for in terms of tinnitus and epilepsy and and it's basically being used in any kind of thing that neurologically or psyche or in terms of psychiatry can you know Stan she ated in the brain and you know can't we do things about it there are many targets of TMS in the brain the dorsal prefrontal cortex the temporal parietal areas in the brain motor areas the motor systems of the brain temporal memory systems and and sensory systems as well so this is this is a tool that that can be used in a variety of ways and hopefully in many therapeutic ways for instance TMS like I said has already been approved by the FDA for use in depression and this is an example of the one of the large studies that led to that approval and you can see the the blue columns now the blue columns that you see here show that the rate of recover of response rate in terms of depression increasing as you go from week two to week four to week six okay and we actually give TMS the way they give to us in the world right now is to give give it for six weeks you can see that six weeks you know after six weeks there was there was a notable notable increase of response to the TMS and a and a decrease in depression relative to placebo so that's why we're using TMS but let me just start talking about the various parameters they're involved in TMS there are a great number of them so there's a single pulse that that's given and so each pulse has a certain characteristics to it and you can have a certain shape to it the shape that you actually use determines how the neuron is locally the membrane is locally affected by it but you can also do more than one TMS pulse you can do trains of TMS pulses and that provides a number of other parameters so you certainly can talk about the intensity of the pulse all right you know how strong we make the pulse but also then in a train it the frequency of the train how many pulses per second you apply how long the train is how much time between trains you allow how many trains you do and then you know how many sessions of all these trains that you do all these things can be explored and it even gets more complicated because you don't have to have one frequency you can have one frequency inside of another frequency another fda-approved form of TMS now is called theta burst and in theta burst you actually do small bursts of pulses that are high frequency say 50 times a second or 50 Hertz and then do those bursts every 200 milliseconds and that means you're doing them five times a second or at five Hertz alright so you're doing five Hertz and 50 Hertz at once it's called theta burst because theta is the theta rhythm in the brain is about five Hertz 50 Hertz is actually the intrinsic gamma rhythm in the brain and so you're using the rhythms of the brain and nesting frequencies inside of other the frequencies in a biological way that that's actually interesting and probably very potent in the brain this is called pattern stimulation and it's just another way to combine you know inter train intervals and frequencies you know in the brain and and and those these are just a temporal parameters there's also spatial parameters so the shape of the coil that you're using the target the actual spatial target where in the brain you stimulate are also very very important to what happens with the TMS so I'd like to go over some of these parameters and I'll start with the spatial parameters themselves and basically looking at it in terms of targeting our coils so there and I there are a number of different ways to target your coil outside the head to aim at different places in your brain now you can do it the FDA approved method that originally I'm sorry the originally approved method was to use a probabilistic location in other words to find the place in the brain and over the motor cortex that produce a stimulation of a muscle that you could see for instance a hand muscle that you could see and then just move five centimeters in front of that and that placed you approximately over the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex which is a target of for alleviating depression now another way of doing scalp positioning of the the of the coil is to use the the 1020 the International 1020 eg system that sets up exactly where in a relative way depending on the size of the person's head you you put electrodes on the brain and there are electrodes that are right over that we know from imaging are right over various places like door sloppy frontal cortex in the brain so you can use that system as well to position your coil these aren't great ways to do it because you're essentially blind to what's you know you know that the actual location that brain you're looking for so you can use things like MRI say a structural MRI of that person and then be able to target based on the person's MRI since everybody's a little bit different their brains are form a little bit different where everything winds up in the brain is a little bit different in each person this allows you to target much you know more precisely the site that you're looking for to stimulate you can do very nice targeting on the scalp in one sense you can look for a spot say over motor cortex that will stimulate a certain muscle okay one muscle rather than another muscle and just by moving a coil around and stimulating and see and watching the muscles move so that's one of the very few times you can do this on the scalp in any kind of precise way you can also do it in terms of phosphines in terms of the visual system you can create phosphines in the in the brain by stimulating the back of the head over occipital cortex where the visual cortex is and you can move it around and find the best spot to stimulate there and you can do that actually in different places the visual field so you can do it relatively precisely there too but the rest of the cortex is basically silent to that kind of procedure so we need imaging to really help guide us to if we really want to precisely aim our magnetic field and so other ways to do it are by looking at a structural MRI and targeting that way and further you can actually use functional MRI you can have people for instance do a task say a memory task look what lights up in the brain and and target that spot that lit up in the brain as well that's a little bit more precise in terms of being able to stimulate the part of the brain that is functional and associated with with the function that you're trying to change in the brain you can take that one step further because you can do that on a group basis which is kind of how you'll see most MRI research but you can do this on an individual basis which is really where we'd like to go in terms of helping people on doing finding therapies because each person is different and exactly where a certain function might be instantiated and so you can actually do imaging and do fMRI on an individual basis and look at where in the brain that person is using the brain for that given function and aim at that and we think that's probably the most precise way to do this so just in terms of the EEG sites you can see for instance that that these are these are the kind of the general regions that this is this is based on a number of people that were brought into a cat scan with the electrodes on and they saw what part of the brain they are actually you know given an electrode side actually wound up being over and is it kind of a large you know multi centimeter area that the electrode could be over any one person you know what cortex it's over the important one for depression for instance is it would be this this site over door sloppy frontal cortex so if you if you use the site f3 in the eg 10-20 system you you may wind up somewhere and I just lost there it is I somewhere over here so it's not quite precise you know it's not a very specific region but at least it gets you over door sloppy frontal cortex that's kind of the best you can do with with scalp derived targeting at the moment you can use what's called neuro navigation you can use infrared cameras that can very very precisely pinpoint exactly where the coil is relative to an MRI online with a person so you can have a coil be over a person's head and know exactly where you are and even if a person is moving a little bit you can see exactly where the coil is relative to the target in the brain so this is something that we all use now that this kind of frameless stereo taxi just in terms of a comparison of these different methods there was a group socket owl in 2009 that ran a study to compare these and I won't go over in detail the tasks they use but they found a task at the Stroop based task and basically they showed you two numbers and the numbers could be the same size that's a neutral condition but they could also show you to where that where one was bigger than the other now the aunt the way to answer this when these numbers come up you say which one is bigger and they mean bigger in terms of like four is bigger than two but in this case it's actually also in size it's bigger as well and so that actually helps you answer faster whereas if the two is bigger you kind of get slower because in one sense two is bigger in another sense 4 is bigger and it slows you down a little bit and you can just see that over here if this is the reaction time you can see that when there is no TMS that you know you answered about you know this many about 480 milliseconds you're a little faster in the congruent case when the the 4 for instance is bigger and you're much slower in a case where they're incongruent so you have this normal effect you know without TMS in general the TMS itself when you stimulate the right parietal area you actually get faster you it makes you be faster in the incongruent stage condition rather and so this is a TMS effect that enhances your performance slightly and we can look at how many people it takes to see this kind of effect you know how many people it takes to statistically see how many uh it takes it with using the various targeting methods and so this was done and so they used the scalp 10:20 system so they went over right parietal cortex based on the scalp and when they did that's this group of five people here five brains you can see that they stimulated in different places in the brain when they actually looked at their MRIs so there was a variation in where they ended up over the brain if you just use a scalp based system that variation is just random and sense of what's going on in the brain functionally they used MRI guided you just use their structural MRIs then you're going for a specific spot in the brain that they found in a group level activation and the other way they tried to do this was to do the individual visual guided MRI so they found in each of these brains where that task most activated in the parietal area and they stimulated that okay and what they found was they did an analysis and this is basically the alpha the statistical level and what you want to do is see when this the effect is significant and this is like how many people it takes to see that significance you can see that it takes about forty seven people if you use a scalp based method alright to see that TMS effect okay but it only takes five people if you use the individual targeting method and this is just an example of being able to you know that you really want to use this neuro navigation on an individual basis that allows you to most effectively in terms of spatial parameters stimulate the brain and you can increase that precision by the way humans human operators are trying to hold a coil over the head and keep it right over a head that's not so easy in itself even using neuro navigation and then the the subjects receiving the TMS also move so if you're sitting there for a while even unconsciously even if you're trying hard not to move you still move there are now robot coil holders that stay with the person stay on target and position it with millimeter accuracy that allow incredible precision in terms of putting the magnetic field in the brain where you want to put it now having said that if you stimulate any part of the brain and you create action potentials in the brain using the TMS you're actually stimulating whatever that area of the brain is stimulated is connected to you stimulate a network so you you know even though you have great precision in stimulation you have less precision a sense of you're stimulating a number of other areas too so you really kind of want to know what you're stimulating the brain when you stimulate any one part and there are ways to do that you can actually use fMRI for instance you can use you can put people in a scanner and stimulate them with TMS in the scanner and using the fMRI imaging see we're in brain they actually wound up getting stimulated or activating this is something that that can be used by the way to defeat one of the problems of TMS which is TMS itself and here's a coil okay at the scalp of the head alright and it creates an effective stimulation to a certain depth in the brain the depth is only right about here into the brain a few centimeters in that you are effectively stimulating neurons and creating action potentials but say you wanted to reach a much deeper place now for instance area broadband area twenty five sub genuine cortex is in target now in in depression research but you can't get there directly with TMS alright the question is can I get there indirectly trance and optically and the answer we found was yes so if i stimulate in a certain place you know can i reach this area you know an aim for it and you can by doing imaging and doing a thing called diffusion tensor imaging or DTI and if you see the this area of interest alright and see where it what if this DTI does is is map out the the white matter the wiring of the brain the white matter tracks okay and you can see where they come out to the surface where you can stimulate with TMS and so we did that just to show this works we did that we seeded it and see where they the white matter tracks came out on each individual person and then we put people in the scanner and using fMRI we stimulated people in a scanner to see if we could activate that area by by activating where those white matter tracks came out and when we did that so here's here's like ten people here's the sites on their heads and the front of their heads where the white matter tracks came out okay when we did that we showed that as you increase the strength of the TMS okay the dosage of the TMS you actually increased oops you do that you actually increase the activation in Broadman area 25 and you can see that here that we actually increase the activation the number of voxels being stimulated as we increased the strength of the magnetic field as opposed to other areas of the brain that did not see that kind of increase you can also by the way look at the through imaging and this is the case EEG look at what's happening in the brain over milliseconds over time so if you can use a high-density EEG and I say stimulate the motor cortex I can see its effect in the motor cortex in the first 5 milliseconds when I look 15 milliseconds or so afterwards I can see that that activation has moved a little bit to premotor areas in front of that and in fact after 24 milliseconds I can see has moved the activations moved to the homologous areas on the other side of the brain so I can actually watch the activation happened over time using EEG as well as over space using MRI and you can see the same thing in the visual cortex in the back of the head you can see that after after 28 milliseconds it's moved across the corpus callosum and into the other hemisphere the activation caused by the TMS so we are very good at precisely locating where we want to put a stimulation into the head and so we have a very good control over the spatial parameters another aspect of that is to look at coil shape okay different shapes of coils for instance a figure 8 coil which is most commonly used a double comb coil right here which is less commonly used but it we can get a little bit deeper in the head a round coil those who use much less nowadays metal core coils an H coil which is into a very large round coil produce different effects in the brain dr. Z Deng will be talking about that in later lectures in terms of the trade-offs that you see in terms of how deep you can go versus the folk ality okay so the deeper you can go with TMS usually the less focal the stimulation is unless you do this trance inapt ik that I just mentioned before another very important aspect is in terms of for instance the orientation of the coil so if you have a figure 8 coil it actually has kind of a horizontal axis to it because it has two loops okay and you have a handle here all right you can move the handle all right without moving the the center of the coil you can move the handle so that the whole shape of the coil moves around when you do that that actually changes where in the what in the brain is getting stimulated where it's getting stimulated and that matters a whole lot so that the coil orientation is very very important to as well and that's something that people aren't paying as much attention to but need to and we're showing that in two different ways here I'm showing that in terms of don't try to read this table here but this is this is 13 people being stimulated with the coil at various angles and and finding how much it takes to stimulate their motor cortex to produce a certain level motor what's called a motor threshold which we'll also be talking talked about later in terms of dosing but you can as you change the orientation you can see that there is an optimum spot an optimum orientation to stimulate that coil and as mostly to do with exactly how the motor cortex in its gyrus is situated and what you want to do is stimulate so the current from the coil is the current Direction is going into the gyrus as opposed to going with the gyrus and depending on how you turn the coil that will change the current direction so current direction and it's it's a accompanying motor or the orientation of coil matters quite a bit another iCLASS this parameter in with spatial parameters because intensity determines how deep the stimulation goes and how wide it's spread okay spatial which is spatial parameters and intensity is one of the first and easiest things that there are is to manipulate with TMS it's just a knob on the machine and you can turn it up to a hundred percent of the machines capacity or not however intensity what we found early on the higher the intensity the more chance of something like a a seizure happening and so we there been actual studies that have shown given a frequency that you use higher frequencies also lead to seizures and this is the intensity based on the motor threshold I just mentioned before so increasing intensity means that you can see that if I stimulate at ten Hertz you actually have to make the trains of TMS how long you can stimulate before you risk seizure those those numbers go down with increasing intensity so we know a lot about what happens with high intensities we know a lot less about what happens with low intensities but sub-threshold intensities actually can can also affect neurons as well and we're just starting to learn about that too but that that is something we're finding out more about now as well so now I've gone over spatial targeting now I like to talk a little bit more the temporal parameters that are involved as well which include waveform frequency in our training interval and cumulative effects so just in terms of the waveform of the TMS so TMS itself a single pulse can look like this particular kind of pulse the other standard pulse is a bipolar pulse okay where the current goes this way that way this way that way again and so those are the standard kinds of pulses now I can use these pulses over the motor cortex and create responses you know in a given muscle alright and I can just get an average of those responses ahead of time and then I can stimulate with a different kind of waveform each time so for instance I can use the standard biphasic waveform which is it basically a dampened cosine wave but I don't have to do a cosine I can actually use something that's more like a square wave and it turns out neurons like square waves better they respond to them better and I can also form a square wave okay mono physically instead of just by physically so I can try these different sorts of waves alright and then I can test again to see if I created an effect so if i stimulate for about 15 minutes with thousand pulses say one second okay I create a an effect in the brain that can last on the order of 15 minutes or so before it goes away goes back to baseline this is by the way and I'll get to this later is one of the very standard pre-post protocols that one uses to see a TMS effect so if I look at the various kinds of waveforms I use across in this case 13 people what happens if I do 1 Hertz stimulation I'll talk about this in a second is that you tend to inhibit you tend to reduce the response in the motor cortex and so I'm expecting an decreased response sorry this is the people that got the standard waveform in this group that you actually didn't see an inhibition I didn't see a decrease their response would below the baseline but with the various square wave waveforms I did alright and those all gradually go back to baseline over time this is 10 minutes 20 minutes 30 minutes and so it gradually goes back to baseline but the point is that I that that the square wave was much more efficacious and created an effect whereas a standard form didn't so the wave form that can actually create different effects of TMS and that's actually something that we're exploring now as well one of the first kind of parameters that we found that had very different effects was the frequency and sort of a rule of thumb that we found was that if you use high frequency which is means that greater than 3 times a second and we tend to go from high frequency tends to go from 3 times a second up to when you're doing trains up to about 20 or 25 Hertz ok that tends to make the brain more excitable and you can see here with a pet image that stimulating right here activated a very large amount of cortex when we when we did when we actually measured the the pet activation of these this high frequency stimulation low frequencies tend to down regulate cortical excitability they tend to inhibit the response and so the stimulation was was done about well up here done about here and you can see that this blue means that there is a deactivation and there's a you know around where we stimulate it here so here it is around where we stimulate there's a deactivation but that's the kind of the rule of thumb that we use low frequencies around one Hertz tend to to inhibit activity whereas high frequencies tend to excite that may have a lot to do with the actual frequencies of the oscillations that are going on in the brain you know for instance the Alpha rhythm or the theta rhythm that are going on the brain that seem to have a lot to do with function and this was tested out for instance you know even 20 years almost twenty years ago in a study where a klemish at L in this case stimulated at the person's own alpha frequency with the TMS over parietal and prefrontal areas while they did a task alright and what they found was the accuracy in the task increased quite dramatically 15% sprit II good they enhanced the people's response by stimulating at their own alpha frequency whereas when they stimulated at 3 Hertz less than err than their alpha frequency or stimulated just at 20 Hertz they didn't see this enhancement so there may be something to do with how frequently the reason that the frequencies affect the brain the way they do interact with the brain way they do has to do with the brains own oscillatory dynamics you can look at this in another way for instance remember that uh that the protocol I showed you that with the wave forms ok where we do a motor evoke potential ok that's the response of a muscle of a target muscle when i stimulate motor cortex if I look at the average mep motor voc potential and get kind of an average of that and then i stimulate alright and then i look at the motor evoke potential so I'm looking at pre post changes you know in that response to stimulation and motor cortex if I just do the normal 1 Hertz remember that that should just create an inhibition it did okay in this particular study here's the baseline it went the response after 10 minutes of 1 Hertz stimulation did indeed go down and return slowly to baseline it's back you know up around 30 minutes or so if I stimulated at high frequency first so I do about 10 minutes of that first and then to stimulate at 1 Hertz and then measure it again I created a much more much more enhanced inhibition that and much more long-lasting inhibition so there's an interaction between different frequencies that I used and just trying to show here that it's very complex how they how all the different frequencies actually work with each other in this particular case it may have worked because this high frequency would excite the cortex all right and then after a little bit you know it's returning to baseline so the brain is actively pushing you know back towards baseline a mechanism that does that so it's doing that and at the same time I next add the 1 Hertz which also decreases activity so it's already going down and this shoots it even further down so we're playing with the brains own homeostatic mechanisms to create even larger effects another example of these kinds of interactions is with that theta burst stimulation TBS I had mentioned before remember TBS is little bursts of high-frequency stimulation given every 200 milliseconds so that I'm doing it a theta so that's the theta part of the theta burst and this pattern stimulation if I if I do as a continuous amount of that pattern stimulation for about 90 seconds I create an inhibition of these motor if i stimulate motor cortex I create an inhibition of these the motor of opah 10 shalls' afterward if i see if i put a little time in between if I do a train of theta bursts for two seconds and then I wait eight seconds then do it again and keep doing that for about four minutes I often affect alright suddenly I'm exciting the motor cortex and it's producing exciting you know a higher amplitude motor evoke potentials so I'm able to create opposite effects inhibition and excitation alright just by adding in a little time between the trains so there's this interaction between the inter train interval the duration of the trains are and the frequency of the trains that are you know very very complex and we're just starting to learn you know how that all works okay and the last parameter I want to talk about is the duration of the stimulation so you can create and I'll be using this particular slide quite a bit now as I go into protocols excuse me is that you can create acute effects namely you can create create effects that happen right away in the brain that you can see for instance you can create if I stimulate the occipital cortex with a single TMS pulse all right and I do it at a certain time after I show say three letters so I'm showing you three letters and I'm asking you repeat the three letters what they are and I show those three letters are very very briefly like 10 milliseconds so if I do I lost my inheritance if I do the TMS pulse okay and these are the tracings of three different people but if I do the pulse at the same time as I show those three letters nothing happens people are getting about three letters right okay three out of three letters right if I do the TMS pulse at 80 or 100 milliseconds after I showed the three letters okay in other words the time it took to go from the other eye the retina back into the brain and back to the occipital cortex is about you know in this range okay then I can actually interfere with people's ability to see it in fact they can't report the letters at all this was originally called a virtual lesion effect but the idea is that that for you know there's a little time period say for 50 milliseconds when I can interfere with what's going on in the brain very very precisely in time so I can create what's called an acute effect a direct effect and you know for instance I can do that with the muscle I can make a muscle twitch that happens right away I can do this kind of visual I'm asking I can actually show that I can speed I can make people better or worse all right you know in an immediate kind of way these effects only last on the order of milliseconds to seconds okay they're their effects it directly on the the membranes that the electrophysiology of the brain immediately but if you keep stimulating if you stimulate for instance for 10 minutes with say 10 Hertz as I said showed you before you can create lasting effects that go on after I turn off the TMS and so if i stimulate for around 10 minutes or 15 minutes or 20 minutes with say 10 Hertz I create enhanced activity say in the motor cortex that lasts on the order of 20 minutes to an hour and then it goes away that kind of effect you're changing synapses okay in a way that the synapses are responding to the stimulation and they're kind of adapting to it and they're there they're there they're actually changing uh you know their properties alright and adapting to it and that kind of lasts for a little while till it all returns to baseline you can make those changes last a lot longer by repeating over and over in these 10 20 30 minutes you know bouts of stimulation alright and that's what we saw right in the beginning when we were looking at you know this is weeks of stimulation stimulating every single day for 37 minutes okay and you did that from week you know after two weeks after four weeks after six weeks and you see the effect growing and growing and and now those effects can last months to years okay and what you're doing there is creating epigenetic changes in the brain you're creating an innocent APS's rather you're creating changes that last much much much longer because you're programming them in through the DNA in a way that lasts you know even years okay but basically at least months so there are a number of temporal scales at TMS can act on depending on what you do and how long you do it that you can look at so there's all kinds of levels of cumulative effects that you can create and this is our great hope for therapy is that we can create these long lasting effects okay so that's base the you know the parameters of TMS that we can manipulate you know through neuro navigation through brain imaging through robotic coil positioning through realistic head modeling and II feel modeling you know we can deliver a very very specific dose rate into the brain right where we wanted to go and that allows us to effect very specific networks in the brain very specific sites and networks that lets us learn for instance their functions gives us the ability to diagnose you know when you have disease populations for instance and gives us a really great handle over spatial parameters although again we have we have a tremendous control over the first millisecond and then after that you know it's how the brain responds to things and that matters quite a bit because what the brain is doing at the time you know at that end place that you're stimulating at the point of stimulation really determines the effect of the TMS so it's not you know just the the parameters that we use externally but what the brain is doing to is is a big interaction there that we're just trying to learn how to handle in control from and indeed what happens next is is something that we can look at in terms of temporal parameters and so you know I mentioned the TMS waveform and how it really can have affect literally on the membrane time constants you know using them and and using a square wave for instance versus a cosine wave can matter quite a bit in terms of how the neuron responds also the TMS frequencies how they're related to the endogenous oscillations of the brain can you know matter in terms of what TMS affects that we create the Train duration and the iti the inter train interval rather can have big effects you saw that with for instance theta bursts just changing that the training or the the the inner training interval can change whether things are excitatory inhibitory and and if you do durations long enough of TMS you're changing long term potentiation in the synapse you change you you're affecting plasticity mechanisms repeating creating human of effects by repeated TMS sessions hopefully create long term Network changes that we can use therapeutically okay so given all those parameters I just like to talk a little bit about the basic TMS protocols that we use and they're kind of divided into two separate kinds of protocols one is online protocols looking at acute effects the other is offline protocols looking at lasting effects so online protocols are stimulating and and and seeing an effect okay right away these these effects are very short lasting and it's just it's usually a matter of probing and exploring you know what the brain is doing in certain points and they can also be used as you know for biomarkers and diagnostics and I gave you an example of that already for instance the acute effect here is only a 40 or 50 millisecond effect in the brain individual system using the somalian study that's what axis is by the way one of the very first studies ever done in 1989 in TMS so you to do these kind of acute effects that do these online protocols you know stimulating at a certain time for instance relative to a task that you're giving people at the same time so you can functionally see changes you can do single pulses and and and as a probe you can also do two pulses all right for instance or are multiple pulses that are occurring very very close together in time on the order of a few milliseconds between them those produce various effects and I'll talk about that in a second or you can just do short trains of TMS say two three four seconds of a certain frequency of TMS all these can create acute effects that you can use to study the brain the offline protocols were you trying to create lasting effects cumulative effects you know the best the prototype example we have of that obviously is the is what we see in depression trials where as we increase the number of sessions we're increasing the effect overall effect of the TMS and you can see these lasting effects by the kind of protocols you you basically use for instance in a given session of TMS is pre post testing and I've given you a couple examples of that already where we stimulate you know we do that for instance motor evoke potentials and then you know baseline and then we do some intervention with TMS and then we look at what changes that did to the MEP so you do a pre/post kind of test and looking for these kind of short-term plasticity effects and you can also you know do that over multiple sessions and then look at what you know look at pre posts the whole series of sessions have you made any changes in people's behavior in in their disease or for instance in their imaging and they're the actual networks of the brain through imaging okay and in fact the idea in these protocols is well how do I see a TMS effect all right so I can see it for instance online by looking at behavior so looking at in this case at people's accuracy or I can do a pre post effects over time so I can actually look you know at various mill you know milliseconds apart right do stimulations at various times and see if there's a difference in effect so I can actually do a control in time of you know this time oh there's no effect this time there is an effect and and just be able to my statistics that way for instance or you know I can do these pre post studies like you saw with with looking at the waveform you know where we do look at em EPS ahead of time and look at their changes depending on what stimulation I give so I can look across time and that sense as well I can also stimulate in different places so if I effect if I expect to have an effect on say a visual tasks alright by stimulating occipital area I might stimulate the vertex of the head where there is no visual area right and there presumably should be no effect on the visual tasks that I'm doing so I can compare across different sites that can have a problem because it's kind of hard always to find a place in the brain that isn't somehow involved with your various tasks and behaviors but those are two different ways to control but you can also look across other parameters as well for instance you live across frequencies and so you saw that in that pet study where you use high frequency versus low frequency and saw dramatic differences in the brain imaging other parameters like intensity you can do as well so for instance we did that with the look you know doing that transcend optic depth study where we were able to stimulate Rodman's area 25 deep in the brain and were able to show a dosage effect that we had control over the activation of that deep area you can also use and actually the first thing people might think oh well I could do TMS and then not do TMS alright no TMS and compare what happens when you don't do TMS and when you do the problem there is TMS itself has its own effects peripheral effects alright when you stimulate on the head it feels like something right and the more you increase the intensity the more it feels like something alright so you could tract muscles you on the head you contract and you affect peripheral nerves and things like that it's usually just kind of startling it feels like a little bit of a thumping it can be painful sometimes in certain places but it creates and and for instance if you hit the right superficial nerve you can create a night which you can twitch your jaw but there are peripheral effects that you create alright so if you do know TMS versus TMS you're creating effects in one case that can you know interfere with tasks that have nothing to do with affecting the brain so that's something of a problem and by the way that and the other peripheral effect is it makes us out a clicking sound alright so every time you do TMS is always a clicking sound the clicking sound gets louder with increases of intensity so all these things can create other effects and they're the reason you really don't do no TMS to compare with what you try to do in this kind of situation is sham TMS and it has its own problems because how do you create that clicking sound and the other kind of peripheral effects the thumping for instance and all those without actually giving people TMS and people have been working on that there are ways you can at least make the sound you can have a coil on the head and not apply the magnetic field into the brain but still make the sound and people actually put a little electric currents they put a few electrodes right under the coil and give people a little bit of a surface jolt of electricity right when the pulse happens to kind of mimic the TMS thumping effect okay it's not quite the same but it's the same similar enough but there are there are problems with it but the idea is to create superficial stimulation that mimics TMS without affecting the brain and then comparing that with the TMS so if you do various combinations of these controls you can actually see you know you can find ways to compare you know TMS with with a you know no TMS either a different or TMS at a different time or a different place and in these ways you're able to you know pull out TMS effects and what are the TMS effects how do I measure them so they're changes in behavior you know I mentioned that first you know there's changes in performance for instance and in your accuracy in this case with the visual stimulation or reaction time that's that's a good one to use too they can be changes in clinical ratings so that the response as you see here are in terms of people's ratings and madres scores are in Hamilton scores and depression so you can actually look at those kinds of changes you can actually look at physical changes that are occurring right away by looking for instance and motor evoked potentials and you can actually do that with with EEG and look at TMS evoked potentials you know right on the head you know right underneath the for instance where you're stimulating you can actually see the response to that stimulation you can also look at brain imaging changes you know I've talked a lot about MRI changes as well as pet changes and then this study down here for instance you can use high-density eg I showed you an example of that as well so there's a number of ways you can measure the TMS effects both physiologically and behaviorally so other ways I mentioned before other ways to actually stimulate to do kinds of different protocols that create different kinds of TMS effects okay so for instance here's an example of an MEP right so I do a TMS stimulation right and this is the MEP the motor evoke potential I might measure in hand muscle that I was targeting if I do a second pulse right or rather a conditioning pulse a pulse right before that the the that pulse that I did you know right before I mean for instance like two milliseconds okay if I do a two milliseconds before and this conditioning pulse isn't even strong enough to contract this muscle or create its own MEP for instance I can excuse me I can create an effect so this is the response I see you know with just a single pulse and we've traced that again here if I do a little conditioning pulse ahead of time okay I've actually inhibited or quite dramatically decreased the response if I extend that time say to 10 milliseconds I can actually create a facilitation an increase all right in against the baseline all right so here's a baseline response and here's the increase that I see okay so that the time the ISI are the inter stimulus interval that I choose to use can play with what's going on there what we think we're playing with is a response of different neural systems in a very local location some that respond to gaba some that respond to glutamate so exhibitory excitatory neurons and you're playing with their dynamics with each other okay and so you're able to actually look at separate gaba systems and glutamate systems you know inside one particular area in this case motor cortex by using what we're calling paired pulse stimulation and you can increase for instance two pair of pulses this is called long interval cortical inhibition if I stimulate with with with the conditioning pulse say right here all right and that with one that's strong enough to actually create a motorboat potential and then I wait 52 to 200 milliseconds I can create you know that this would be with the test stimulus if I didn't have the conditioning stimulus you know I get a nice healthy MEP but if I have this conditioning pulse I have a much more inhibited response that's long term cortical inhibition and that's actually a that separates gaba a and gaba B systems for instance in the brain so you actually able look at different neurotransmitter systems in the same area just by playing with paired pulses and the time between them and in fact you can see that for instance if I look over a period of 1 to 12 milliseconds that I get in relative to the the baseline the test pool all right I get inhibited responses if I have short term short interestingness intervals is is if I have longer is eyes I start creating in a facility if I extend this out further you know I create inhibitions again and so on but you seeing nice and very reliable responses that have to do with neurotransmitter systems locally so it's a very useful stimulation and people do also steam you can you you don't have to just do pairs you can actually do say for right or quad repulse all right there's even an octupole stimulation leader they're essentially very high frequency right you know if there's only two milliseconds that's that's 500 Hertz right but they're there they're very closely spaced stimulations or short trains all right and those create their own kinds of effects if I do short trains of stimulation this is an example for instance if I look at a memory task alright so I can show you a letter or and then I can wait a little bit of time and then show you another letter and you tell me as fast as you can is that letter one of the letters I just showed you that's a very typical skull of Sternberg tasks and working memory tasks that people use here's another example here's I show you six letters way a little bit of time and show you a letter in this case you'd answer no because it wasn't one of the stimulations I can do it a train right of our TMS say in that time between the two sets of letters alright when I do at the right place in this case the parietal area and I use the right frequency in this case five Hertz okay so that solid areas are active the lighter areas are sham comparisons okay so we're doing active in sham comparisons here and we're using different frequencies so one Hertz and twenty Hertz doesn't show very much this is with a set size of six letters okay you can see that I've speeded up in the reaction time to these letters alright if i stimulate parietal area okay at five Hertz during this this delay period and that also happens at at set size of one as well if i stimulate later like during the probe period i don't see a difference between active and sham but i was able to replicate in a different group the same facilitation of reaction time enhancement of performance okay by stimulating during the retention period so would you can play with trains of TMS and you can create an enhancement or disruptive effects with those trains if they're placed at the right time relative to how the task is going on and in the right place in the brain and with the right frequency this is an example of an online protocol they were directly affecting acutely affecting you know behavior and by the way we're able to show that if we if we sleep-deprived people for two days here's a network that activated with the working memory task and we stimulated inside that Network these people that were sleep deprived for two days we also stimulate outside the network the same people and stimulate that same parietal area that's actually inside the network we can't see that from here and what we saw was people's reaction time when it was just sham TMS so again we're using a sham control okay and we're using a space control we're using different locations okay we see that if i stimulate right outside nothing happens right but if i stimulate inside the network here and here i actually decrease the reaction time okay so i make people a little bit better and help them recover a little bit from their sleep deprivation what happens when you're sleep-deprived is you get slower right and so you know we're able to help them recover a bit another kind of offline TMS that you can see it's a very interesting one is called parrot associate stimulation in this case people again we're using you know these motor evoked responses to see this so here's a typical one you see by stimulating motor cortex an average one you see but what I do is I'll do 90 pairs of stimulation where I stimulate the median nerve in the hand that's associated with this muscle okay and 25 milliseconds later in other words the amount of time it takes for this stimulation to get to that part of the brain okay and stimulate at that time when just when it arrives okay i stimulate with the TMS alright so I'm doing paired associate stimulation I'm creating a hebbian like change of fire together wire together situation and I do that 90 times then I could then I test this area again I get an enhanced response okay so you can actually change the wiring a little bit and it's temporary unless again you do cumulative effects but you can show these plasticity effects directly it's a nice way to measure a plasticity in the brain in fact another kind of offline protocol is again that theta bursts that I've talked about a few times so if I look and to do a pre post measurement okay so that's what you do offline now is I'm doing a pre post measurement just like the previous just like the the pair associate I do pre post with a motor evoke potential here I'm doing that again I'm looking at motor evoke potentials and seeing the changes after I do say continuous state of burst you know or if I do intermediate this theta burst namely theta births where I put that eight seconds in between each two-second train and look at the differences in the post response in the M EPS all right with the inhibitory and the excitatory I'm sorry excitatory inhibitory TBS so again looking at theta bursts you do this pre post with the intervention in the middle measurement and that's that's your typical offline kind of protocol another example of that is using again a pre post measure okay this time instead of using M EPS or motor evoke potentials I'm using T EPS TMS evoked potentials and I'm looking at the evoke potentials of the EEG directly in the brain all right when I do this intervention between the pre post measurements okay of stimulation this case it's five Hertz stimulation okay over I believe it's like 15 minutes okay and when I do this 15 minutes of 5 Hertz dim you elation I can see and this is this is that this is the pre TEP responses okay averaged in a group and across the brain I can see that I've enhanced the the amplitudes right of the response okay after all this stimulation alright so again it's this pre post measurement that I do when I'm doing this kind of offline sort of protocol here's another example of kind of putting a lot of that together so again with that sleep deprivation protocol that I showed you before this time during the two days of sleep deprivation here okay we had four sessions so we're trying to create a cumulative effect right we're doing four sessions of TMS for an hour each while people are doing the memory task the working memory task right so they've done four sessions of it and then at the end of the sleep deprivation period we measure you know we have them do the task again all right with no TMS so it's like almost a day later now and no TMS so we're looking for a lasting effect and so people that got Sham TMS this is this is a reaction time and against baseline against the pre baseline but the pre sleep whatever deprivation baseline you can see that that the sleep the people that got is just sham TMS no TMS slowed down like you usually do with sleep deprivation but people that got the active TMS look like people that weren't sleep derived all right they they get a little bit faster alright and a little bit faster because they've had a little more practice but practice didn't help these people with a sham but it did help people that were the active TMS so they're not showing the effects of sleep deprivation in this task in fact people that are sleep deprived off also laps you know they don't answer they have little micro sleeps and the number of lapses it actually occurred with people of sham were pretty typical but they were much much fewer almost none and in most people in people that got active TMS and in fact the coil was right here over the brain and the only difference between even sham was in that area in that area there was more activated area right under the coil that was associated with people's ability to be able to defeat a sleep deprivation effect in this task so we were able to actually show pretty much complete remediation in this task of the effects of sleep deprivation just like human love effect you know of using TMS and so again a nice offline strategy in this case to try to create a therapeutic effect so overall then in terms of protocols all right you have online protocols that create a acute effects these can be used to both probe and explore the brain and its networks and to diagnose alright to use it to look for biomarkers repetitive TMS lends itself to both online and offline you saw the last example I gave was repetitive TMS five Hertz stimulation in short trains okay but you also with repetitive stimulation and things like TBS pattern stimulation can create cumulative effects as well and so and these are the offline effects where you're looking pre and post something alright some kind of change and I you know I mentioned earlier about that changes themselves okay that actually concludes my exploration of parameters TMS parameters and basic ideas the basic physical effects of TMS and how we measure them through various TMS protocols
