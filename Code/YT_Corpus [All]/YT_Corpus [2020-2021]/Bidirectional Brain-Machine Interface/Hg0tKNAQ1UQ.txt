  HEY, FRIENDS, WE'RE LAUNCHING VISUAL STUDIO 2019 TODAY AND WE WANTED TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT. SURE, THERE'S GOING TO BE DEMOS AND CODE AND LOTS OF FUN. I THINK IT'S EASY TO FORGET ABOUT PEEL. AND I DROVE UP FROM PORTLAND FOR THIS EVENT TO SHOW YOU THERE'S HUNDREDS OF FOLKS IN WASHINGTON WORKING HERE REMOTELY WHO ARE EXCITED TO MAKE SOFTWARE FOR AND I THOUGHT WHY DON'T WE TALK WITH THEM. BUT FIRST, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE LIVE STREAM SESSIONS AFTER THE KEYNOTE. THERE'S A VIRTUAL ATTENDEE PARTY ON TWITCH. AND THERE'S ON-DEMAND SEXSSIONS AVAILABLE TODAY. I ACTUALLY WANT YOU TO GO TO TWITCH BECAUSE THERE ARE PROGRAM MANAGERS THAT BUILD VISUAL YO STUDIO 2019. REMEMBER, VISUAL STUDIO 2019 AND VS FOR MAC IS NOW AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD. IF YOU'RE USING VISUAL STUDIO TODAY, YOU'RE PROBABLY USING ONE OF THE MANY EXTENSIONS AVAILABLE. OUR AMAZING PARTNERS HAVE UPDATED OVER 1,000 EXTENSIONS TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH 2019 AND YOU CAN GET THOSE IN THE MARKETPLACE. WE'RE ALSO RELEASING VISUAL STUDIO LIVE SHARE TODAY WHICH IS INTEGRATED WITH VISUAL STUDIO 19 AND ALSO CAN BE USED IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE. ALSO DEVOPS IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF LIFE CYCLE AND AAZURE DEVOPS 2019 IS GENERALLY AVAILABLE AFTER MARCH 5th. WE'RE GOING TO COVER DEVOPS AND MORE IN THIS KEYNOTE. I ALSO WANT YOU TO KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR THE GEMS AND EASTER EGGS THAT WE'VE HIDDEN IN THIS VIDEO. LET US KNOW USING #VS2019 IF YOU FIND THEM. HEY, FRIENDS.  HEY, SCOTT.  HOW ARE YOU?  WELCOME.  THIS IS A GREAT ROOM. BUT IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY OUTSIDE. SO, IF YOU DON'T MIND, WE CAN HAVE OUR MEETING ON THE DECK.  SURE. WHY NOT.  YES.  GET SOME CHAIRS.  YEAH, GRAB SOME CHAIRS. GOOD. I'M GLAD WE GOT SUCH GOOD WEATHER.  AND IT'S GORGEOUS.  IT'S BETTER TO BE OUTSIDE THAN IN A CONFERENCE ROOM. JULIA, YOU'RE IN CHARGE, AND YOU'VE WORKED HERE FOR A WHILE AND YOU'VE HAD BASICALLY EVERY JOB, HAVEN YOU?  I SURE DID.  AND THIS IS THE WORST NAMED MICROSOFT PRODUCT EVER.  DID YOU WORK ON THIS?  ACTUALLY, I DID. IT'S VERY USEFUL, VISUAL BASIC FOR THE WEB.  IT SAYS YOU CAN MAKE DYNAMIC APPLICATIONS.  IT IS.  ARE WE STILL USING SOME OF YOUR CODE?  I THINK IT IS IN THERE INDEED.  WE'RE ALSO ON VISUAL STUDIO, RIGHT. WE'RE DOING 2019. THAT WAS 22 YEARS AGO.  THAT'S RIGHT. THAT WAS FIRST VISUAL STUDIO EVER. WE CELEBRATE 20 YEARS OF VISUAL STUDIO. I'VE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH EVERY SINGLE VERSION OF VISUAL STUDIO. SO IF YOU EVER HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH IT I HAVE SOMETHING TO IT.  I ALSO HEARD IT'S IMPORTANT THAT EVERYONE BE ABLE TO DEVELOP. THERE WAS A HUGE PUSH FOR ACCESSIBILITY. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY, NO MATTER WHAT LANGUAGE THEY SPEAK.  SO, WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN MAKE DEVELOPERS MORE PRODUCTIVE. WE'RE LOOKING AT DEVELOPERS IN EVERY CORNER THE WORLD AND FEEDBACK. 27% OF OUR TEAM LOCATED OUTSIDE OF REDMOND. THAT'S AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF INFORMATION.  THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE REMOTE, MYSELF INCLUDED. I WOULD SUGGEST IT WAS SINGLE DIFFICULT BUT IT'S OVER 25% OF PEOPLE REMOTE. WE CAN USE LIVESHARE. MA AMANDA, YOU OWN -- THAT'S A FUNNY TERM.  YOU OWN VISUAL STUDIO 2019, RIGHT?  YEAH, I OWN VISUAL STUDIO.  YOU'RE SO MODEST. YOU OWN THAT, WHEN THAT MEANS OWNERSHIP, THAT MEANS THE SHIPPING, GETTING IT OUT THE DOOR AND MAKING SURE IT'S FOCUSED ON THE RIGHT THINGS?  YEAH. BASICALLY MY JOB IS MAKING SURE WE SHIP THE RIGHT PRODUCT AT THE RIGHT TIME.  I'M TOLD FROM PEOPLE THAT KNOW BOTH OF YOU, YOU SOMETIMES STILL FIND TIME TO CODE. THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THE CODE DOESN'T DO THE THING I WANT IT TO DO. I'VE HEARD PEOPLE SAY, WHEN TALKING ABOUT YOU, JULIA, HOW DID SHE KNOW THAT? THEY SAY, OH, SHE HAD YOUR JOB BEFORE YOU. ENGINEERING MANAGER BEFORE THAT. OR SHE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS. YOU BOTH HAVE HAD BASICALLY EVERY JOB AS YOU'VE WORKED UP TO THE PLACES THAT YOU'RE AT.  YEAH. I MEAN, I'VE BEEN IN THE DEVELOPER DIVISION AT MICROSOFT SINCE 2001.  YEP.  SO ALMOST 18 YEARS, I GUESS. AND I'VE WORKED ON PRETTY MUCH EVERY PRODUCT AT MICROSOFT BUT FROM THE DEVELOPER LENS. SO, I'VE WORKED ON XBOX AT SOME POINT, SQL, AZURE AND OFFICE. PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING. TO YOUR POINT EARLIER, AROUND DO I ACTUALLY STILL GET TO CODE, YES, I ACTUALLY DO. IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AS OFTEN AS I LIKE IT TO. BUT PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY ON MY TEAM. AND WE'RE THE P.M. TEAM, THE PRODUCT MANAGER TEAM, EVERYBODY ON MY TEAM CODES. WE HAVE TO FOR CUSTOMER US AND DEVELOPMENTERS. FOR US TO EVALUATE THE PRODUCT WE HAVE TO DO IT.  IT'S SURPRISING TO SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WRITING DOCUMENTATION. SOMEBODY SAW CHECK-INS THERE SCOTT GUTHRIE, HE MAY BEEN UP LATE AT NIGHT.  ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID, WE REBUILT THE DOCUMENT ENGINEERING SYSTEM BASED ON GITHUB. FOR EVERY SINGLE LANGUAGE AND PEOPLE CAN DO THAT IF THEY FIND ANY ISSUES WITH OUR DOCUMENTATION. WE REALLY ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO WORK AND HELP IMPROVE THE DOCUMENTATION IN OUR CUSTOMER MEET AND GREET.  IT'S INTERESTING THAT YOU BRING THAT UP BECAUSE THERE'S A SERIES OF SYSTEMS MAKING ALL OF THE LOOPS. WE TALK ABOUT THE DEVELOPER INNER LOOP AND OUTER LOOP. ALL OF THESE LOOPS ARE BEING TIGHTENED UP, ON HOW WE MAKE SOFTWARE, SHIP SOFTWARE. QUALITY BARS. EVERYTHING IS INTEGRATION.  THAT'S RIGHT. IT SEEMS LIKE THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT IT, EVEN THOUGH PEOPLE SEE VISUAL STUDIO AS A CLIENT STOPPER TO INSTALL ON MACHINES, INTERNALLY, WE TREAT IT AS A SERVICE. WE'RE LOOKING AT THE CUSTOMER FEEDBACK THAT CUSTOMERS GIVE US IN ANY WAY THEY DO. AND OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE THE PRODUCT BETTER AND BETTER EVERY DAY.  THAT'S PRETTY COOL. IN THE PAST I WOULD USE SKYPE OR TEAMS AND I WOULD SEND A SCREEN SHOT. LIKE A MOVING PICTURE OF MY VISUAL STUDIO. BUT THAT WAS REALLY INEFFICIENT, ESPECIALLY WHEN I WAS TETHERING MY PHONE OR OVERSEAS I WAS HAVING A CHALLENGE. I WAS NEVER SEEING LIVESHARE COMING, I DIDN'TIDN'T KNOW I NET BUT THEN I NODEEDED.  WE DID A LOT OF INTERVIEWERS OVER THE YEARS, FOCUSED ON TEAMS FROM TIME TO MARKET ON WHEN THEY CHOSE THEIR TOOLS AND PROCESSES. AND WHAT WE FOUND IS A LOT OF TEAMS WERE REALLY STRUGGLING WITH COLLABORATION. AND THEY WERE ESPECIALLY STRUGGLING WITH COLLABORATION WITH REMOTE EMPLOYEES. AND THEIR DEFINITION OF WHO WAS A REMOTE EMPLOYEE IS ACTUALLY PRETTY STATIC, YOU KNOW, IT WAS EVEN TO THE POINT THAT SOME PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO HIRE ANY MORE ENGINEERS ON THEIR TEAM, EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD THEIR SYSTEM. BECAUSE DEALING WITH SOMEBODY WHO ACTUALLY WAS PHYSICALLY IN A SEPARATE ROOM EVEN IF IT WAS DOWN THE HALL WAS TOO MUCH COST. IT WAS CLEAR THAT WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING IS THAT WAS PRECHECK-IN TIME. THE CHECK-IN TIME IS BASICALLY TOO LATE.  YEAH.  AT THAT POINT, YOU ALREADY HAVE PRETTY HIGH COSTS TO BE ABLE TO GET REVIEW FEEDBACK. THEN YOU END UP WITH ITERATION CYCLES WHERE YOU HAND IT OFF AS OFFICIAL AS EMAIL. THAT'S REALLY WHERE LIVESHARE CAME FROM. IF WE COULD FIGURE OUT TO NAME A COLLABORATION AHEAD OF THE CHECK-IN AND MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO COLLABORATE REALTIME AND THAT WOULD BE A LOT MORE PRODUCTIVE. WE ALSO HAVE SITUATIONS WHERE PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT ACCESSIBILITY NEEDS. THEY MIGHT HAVE DIFFERENT SETTINGS ON THEIR DEVELOPER DESKTOP. THEY USE NARRATOR, WHICH MIGHT MAKE IT UNCOMFORTABLE FOR YOU TO SHARE MY SCREEN, BUT WITH LIVESHARE, YOU CAN ACTUALLY CONNECT INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING TO GET YOUR BOX SET UP TO HAVE VISUAL STUDIO OR VS CODE ON YOUR MACHINE. YOU CAN INTRODUCE THE TERMINAL FOR THAT ACCESS.  I'M A C# FAN AND ALL OF THAT, I LOVE C#. WITH MICROSOFT, I'M NOTICING HYBRID SOLUTIONS, POLYBROUGHT SOLUTIONS. NOT EVERYBODY IS USED BOTNET. VISUAL STUDIO BASICALLY SUPPORTS EVERYTHING. WAS THAT A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO SUPPORT ALL OF THIS?  WE WANTED TO BE ONE OF THE BEST TOOLS TO SUPPORT ANY CUSTOMER, NO MATTER WHAT KIND OF APPLICATION OR SERVICE YOU WANT TO DEVELOP IN THE OPERATING SYSTEM. THAT IS A CORE PIVOT OF WHAT WE'RE DOING FROM A STRATEGY PERSPECTIVE. YOU SEE US FOLLOW THAT UP WITH OUR INVESTMENT IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE AND OPEN SOURCE AND DYNAMIC CROSS PLATFORM AND THAT HAS BECOME A COMMON THEME IN HOW WE DO EVERYTHING. I HAD A MOMENT WHERE I WAS LITERALLY UNTIL VISUAL STUDIO IN DOING DEBUGGING TO LIMITS. IT JUST WORKED, IT WAS A JOY, IN THE MIDDLE OF IT, I THOUGHT I'M DOING REMOTE TO VISUAL IN DEBUGGING, IT WAS GREAT. I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS DOING SOMETHING I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN.  YEAH WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHEN I CAME TO MICROSOFT AND USED VISUAL STUDIO FOR THE FIRST TIME. BECAUSE THE FIRST VERSION WAS OUT IN THE DOTNET ERA. I COME FROM AN EMAX BACKGROUND IN COLLEGE. I EXPERIENCED INTELLISENSE FOR THE FIRST TIME. IT'S THIS MAGICAL THING. YOUR PRODUCTIVITY FROM AN EMAX ENVIRONMENT TO A VISUAL STUDIO ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU HAVE THIS ASSISTED EXPERIENCE IS PRETTY DRAMATIC. I STILL REMEMBER THAT MOMENT. BUT NOW, THINKING BACK ON WHERE VISUAL STUDIO WAS THEN AND WHERE IT IS TODAY, WE CONTINUE TO CREATE MORE AND MORE OF THOSE MAGICAL MOMENTS.  I MET -- I WAS MEETING WITH SOME KIDS AT A COLLEGE RECENTLY, AND THEY TOLD ME THEIR PROFESSOR WAS FORCING THEM TO USE NOTEPAD WITHOUT INTELLISENSE WOULD HAUNT YOUR BRAIN. NOW WITH AI, WITH VISUAL STUDIO IN 2019, I'M ASSUMING THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING OF WHAT WE CAN DO WITH AI.  YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. AI CAN REALLY IMPACT THE ENTIRE CYCLE. FROM EVERYTHING, TO OBVIOUSLY, COMPLETING YOUR STATEMENTS, RIGHT? AND WE WILL GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE WILL NOT JUST COMPLETE WHAT IS THE NEXT INTELLISENSE COMPLETION. BUT ACTUALLY THE ENTIRE CODE, LINE OF CODE THAT YOU'RE RIGHTING OR THE ENTIRE CODE SNIPPET.  WOW.  BUT NOT JUST THAT, TIMING CODE DEFECTS, FOR EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW, WE'VE FOUND CLASSES OF ISSUES THAT AI CAN UNCOVER, THAT YOUR CLASSIC STATIC ANALYSIS REALLY COULD -- BUT THEN WE WERE THEN ABLE TO TAKE IT FURTHER INTO, YOU KNOW, THINGS LIKE TESTING. OR ENCOURAGING YOU TO FOLLOW CERTAIN PRACTICES IN TERMS OF, YOU KNOW, WHO YOU SEEK CODE REVIEWS FROM. SO THIS IS REALLY JUST THE BEGINNING.  THAT'S EXCITING. SO THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF AI AND WHAT IT COULD MEAN FOR VISUAL STUDIO?  YEAH. AND I THINK THE GOAL JUST LIKE WITH INTELLISENSE, WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE EVERY KEYSTROKE YOU WRITE IS MORE EFFICIENT, RIGHT? WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE WRITING THE CODE THAT ONLY YOU CAN WRITE. IF THERE'S ANYTHING IN THE SYSTEM THAT WE CAN AUTOMATE THAT MAKE YOU BECOME MORE EXPRESSIVE, THAT'S WHAT WE WANT.  YOU ADD VALUE WHERE YOU CAN ADD VALUE.  RIGHT, WE ADD VALUE WHERE THE MACHINE CAN ADD VALUE. THE CLOUD AND MACHINE CAN ADD VALUE AND MAKE YOU MORE PRODUCTIVE AS A DEVELOPER, GOODNESS, YOU CAN ACTUALLY WRITE MORE CODE FOR YOUR BUSINESS.  HOW DID YOU DECIDE WHAT WAS GOING TO BE IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019. WHAT IS THE VISUALS AND PARITY AND THE SCOPE?  WELL, FOR 2019, FOUR CORE THINGS. THE FIRST ONE IS PERFORMANCE MAKING SURE IT'S FASTER AND FASTER. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO CUSTOMERS. THE SECOND ONE, WE LOOK AT BIG INDUSTRY STRTRENDS. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE CUSTOMERS ARE DEVELOPING CONTAINERS IN AN EASY WAY. THE THIRD THING IS HELPING WITH A TEAM COLLABORATION AND IDENTIFYING ISSUES AS CLEARLY AS POSSIBLE. AND THE FOURTH ONE, WE LOOK AT OUR FEATURES ACROSS THE PRODUCT WHERE PEOPLE FIND VALUE WITH UPGRADE.  BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT SHE'S SAYING IS CORRECT AND THE CUSTOMER WANTS THAT?  WELL, FOR EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE AREAS, WE ACTUALLY GO THROUGH AN INTERATIVE PROCESS. WE GO THROUGH LABS AND CALLDOWNS OR INTERVIEW THEM. AND THOSE LAB STUDIES ARE WHERE PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY PLAY WITH EARLY PROTOTYPES OF THE PRODUCT. IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY CAN WATCH HOW SUCCESSFUL THEY ARE. I WOULD DEFINITELY ENCOURAGE YOU TO GO CHECK OUT THE UX LAB.  IT'S HARD TO FIND CUSTOMERS WORKING IN A LAB.  YES.  I'VE SOME EXPERIENCE WITH COMPANIES LIKE MICROSOFT AND MICROSOFT IN THE LONG PAST WHERE MICROSOFT WAS THERE TO VALIDATE ASSUMPTIONS AND PUSH AGENDAS. BUT YOU DIDN'T EVEN START WITH THAT. YOU'RE IMMEDIATELY, LET'S GO TO THE CUSTOMER AND LET THEM LEAD THE DISCUSSION.  YEAH, I LIKE TO USE THE TERM "CUSTOMER LED INQUIRY." IT'S THE IDEA, WE DON'T KNOW WHEN WE FIRST START THAT CONVERSATION WHERE IT'S GOING TO LEAD, TO RIGHT? WE SHOULD BE OPEN TO THE IDEA THAT IT WILL LEAD TO SOME PLACES THAT WE DIDN'T EXPECT. AND IF WE CAN UNCOVER KAY MORE URGENT PROBLEM THAT THE CUSTOMER HAS THAT WE CAN ADDRESS, THEN THAT'S MUCH MORE VALUABLE THAN GETTING VALIDATION AT THE IDEA THAT WE THOUGHT WAS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM TO SOLVE IS ACTUALLY WHAT WE NEED TO GO SOLVE.  WHEN WE'RE BRINGING NEW PEOPLE IN, THOUGH, I'VE NOTICED IN THE PAST, IT HAS TAKEN LIKE MONTHS AND MONTHS TO ROUND PEOPLE UP. YOU CAN'T REALLY JUST HIRE SOMEONE AND HAVE THEM SIT AROUND FOR SIX MONTHS. YOU REALLY WANT TO ONBOARD THEM. HOW DO YOU BRING PEOPLE ON TO THE TEAM IN AN ORGANIZED FASHION AND GET THEM INTO THE CULTURE AND TOOLING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE?  YEAH, I MEAN, ACTUALLY, ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN DOING IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IS THIS MISSION OF BOOT CAMP. IF YOU'RE A NEW EMPLOYEE OR ON ANOTHER TEAM OR JOIN OUR TEAM OR BRAND-NEW TO MICROSOFT ENTIRELY, YOU'LL SPEND BASICALLY TWO WEEKS GETTING IN THE BOOT CAMP.  HOW DO YOU DEVELOP A SENSE OF SHARED CULTURE AT INDENTED SO EVERYONE IS FEELING THE SAME ABOUT THE PRODUCT AND FEELING THE SAME ABOUT EACH OTHER?  WELL, FOR CULTURE, ONE OF THE KEYHINGS WE LEARNED WE REALLY HAVE SHARED GOALS, SHARE LANGUAGES AND MAKE SURE WE'RE CHANGING OUR ACTIONS TO ACTUALLY EMBRACE NEW CULTURAL VALUES. FOR US, CUSTOMER OBSESSION SAY CORE KEY VALUE THAT WE'RE EMBRACING. WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW WE'RE DEVELOPING A PRODUCT IN A DIFFERENT WAY TO REALLY EMBRACE THAT PARTICULAR VALUE.  IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S BEEN A REAL FOCUS ON DATA. I'VE SEEN MORE DASHBOARDS. TVs, EVERYWHERE I TURN, THERE'S A DASHBOARD SHOWING THE BUILD AND BURN-DOWN CHART. ALL OF THESE THINGS. ARE YOU REALLY PUSHING TO BE DATA DRIVEN IN YOUR SOLUTION?  ABSOLUTELY, NORTH FROM A DEVELOPING PERSPECTIVE. BUT LOOKING AT DATE THAT CUSTOMERS ARE GIVING US, THEIR PARTICULAR FEEDBACKS IN THE MILD. NOT ONLY IN THE ENGINEERING INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT. THOSE ARE CRITICAL DATA POINTS TO HELP US UNDERSTAND, WHAT IS THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE WITH OUR PRODUCT THAT THEY'RE USING EVERY DAY.  I WAS TOLD THAT EVERY RELEASE HAS TO BE BETTER THAN THE LAST RELEASE.  ABSOLUTELY.  THAT'S AN IMPORTANT GOAL.  THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT METRIC THAT WE TRACK EVERY DAY. THEN WE HAVE WEEKLY MEETINGS, THAT WE LOOK AT THE CUSTOMER SUCCESS ISN'T ACQUIRING THE PRODUCT, UPDATING THE PRODUCT BETTER TODAY THAN LAST WEEK. THAT CUSTOMER'S EXPERIENCE WITH RELIABILITY AND CRASHES AND PERFORMANCE BETTER THIS WEEK THAN LAST WEEK? AND HOW ARE WE RESPONDING TO CUSTOMER FEEDBACK THAT THEY'VE PROVIDED.  THAT'S SUPER COOL. WHO SHOULD I TALK TO FIRST ABOUT VISUAL STUDIO. %  YOU SHOULD REALLY GO TO BUILDING 18 AND TALK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH VISUAL STUDIO. I ALSO SUGGEST YOU GO TO THE UX LAB AS COOL. I'M GOING TO WANDER AROUND BUILDING 18. I'LL CHECK OUT THE UX FILE AND FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON. THANK YOU.  THANK YOU.  THANKS, SCOTT. [ MUSIC ] HEY, SCOTT, WANT TO PLAY? I DON'T REALLY PLAY SMASH THAT MUCH, COMPETITIVELY.  YOU GUYS READY?  HEY, WE'RE READY.  VISUAL STUDIO 2019.  IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT.  WITH THAT, WE BEGIN.  VISUAL STUDIO 2019.  LET'S DO IT.  YEA!  YEA!  I'M VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE. I JUST CAME OVER FROM THE TREEHOUSE. I SAW AMANDA. I SAW JULIA. SHE SAID YOU ALL ARE THE FOLKS TO TALK TO TO SHOW ME SOME OF THE COOL STUFF UNTIL VISUAL STUDIO. AWESOME. I REMEMBER WHEN I STARTED AT VISUAL STUDIO 2019, I WAS SURPRISED HOW FAST IT STARTED. IT WENT RIGHT TO THE START WINDOW.  YEAH, IT'S A SMALL UI. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT LOADS IT'S SYNCHRONOUS AND LOADS THE MOST RECENT PROJECTS. THE SAME AS 2017. ALL OF YOUR PINNED ITEMS, SOLUTIONS, FOLDERS, REMOTE REPOSITORIES SHOW UP IN THIS LIST FOR YOU TO ACCESS REALLY FAST IN A SINGLE CLICK AND GET TO YOUR CODE REALLY FAST.  WHOLE POINT IS TO GET ME TO MY CODE AS FAST AS MOBILE. A POSSIBLE. CLICK ON CODE, PASTE, ENTER.  YEAH, IF YOU HAVE THE URL, THAT'S AWESOME. YOU CAN PASTE IN THE URL, HIT ENTER AND CLOSE THE CODE. IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER THE URL OR YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE WEB TO GET IT, YOU CAN SIGN INTO GITHUB ACCOUNTS AND CAN YOU SEE A LIST THAT YOU OR YOUR ORGANIZATION HAS. WITH THAT YOU CAN SEARCH FOR AND CLICK ON AND CLONE IT DOWN AS WELL WITHOUT THE URL.  AUTO COMPLETE.  YES, EXACTLY.  AWESOME. THIS IS NEW, LIKE A TAGGED NEW VERSION?  RIGHT, YEAH, WE TOTALLY REVAMPED THE CREATE NEW PROCESS. INSTEAD OF A SINGLE WINDOW THAT HAS A PREVIEW THAT HAS BEEN A LITTLE OVERWHELMING TO SOME OF OUR USERS, WE DECIDED TO SIMPLIFY IT AND MAKE IT A SEARCH-BASED VIEW. SO YOU CAN REALLY EASILY AND QUICKLY SEARCH FOR THE TIMES OF COMPASS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SEARCHING FOR, YOU CAN USE A FILTER. SO THERE'S LANGUAGE, PLATFORM AND PROJECT-TYPE DROPDOWNS. YOU CAN FILTER BY THEM AND GET THE SMALLER LIST AND NARROW IT DOWN THERE. AND THEN IT GOES FURTHER. CLICK ON THE ONE YOU WANT. THAT'S ONE DECISION. MOVING YOU TO THE NEXT DECISION, WHICH IS CONFIGURING THAT PROJECT. ENTER YOUR NAME, LOCATION, HIT GO. AND YOU HAVE YOUR PROJECT CREATED.  I LOVED WHEN I WAS SCROLLING AROUND IN THE WINDOWS HERE AND LOOKING FOR WHAT I WANTED. IT GOT THE IMPRESSION MAYBE I WASN'T FINDING WHAT I WANTED AND OFFERED, ARE YOU FINDING WHAT YOU NEED? ARE YOU GETTING WHAT YOU WANT HERE? IT'S A MUCH, MUCH SMARTER WINDOW.  YEP, YEP. THAT'S WHAT WE TRIED TO DO.  ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS IMPRESSED WITH IS HOW MANY CHOICES THERE ARE WHEN YOU PULL DOWN PLATFORM OR PROJECT TYPE. IT'S WEIRD TO SEE LENNIX AND PLATFORM. YOU AND YOU DON'T KNOW THAT VISUAL STUDIO DID PIPELINE DEVELOPMENT AS WELL. THIS OFFERS IT TO YOU. THIS TOOL OFFERS SUPPORT FOR PYTHON AS WELL. YOU CAN QUICKLY SAY, WAIT, I DON'T HAVE ANY TEMPLATES BUT PYTHON LETS YOU ALL IN THEM. IT INSTALLS THEM AND THEN YOU GET PYTHON TEMPLATES AS WELL.  VERY COOL. I SEE ALL OF THE THINGS I POTENTIALLY COULD BUILD IF I DON'T HAVE THAT WORKLOAD.  EXACTLY.  THAT'S HOT. WHAT DOES THIS IS A HERE? RECENT PROJECT TEMPERATURE LALATE TEMPLATES. WHERE WHAT'S GOING ON THERE?  WHENEVER YOU CREATE A TEMPLATE, IT STAYS ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE SIDE. YOU CAN EASILY GO TO THE LEFT AND JUST CLICK ON A TEMPLATE FROM THERE AND GET STARTED WITH THAT INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE MAIN LIST.  THAT'S COOL. THERE'S A NICE SMET IYMMETRY.  THAT WAS THE START WINDOW IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019.  THAT'S VERY COOL.  SO, I LOVE THE START WINDOWS IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019 AS WELL. I LOVE HOW EASY IT IS TO GET STARTED FROM GITHUB REPOSITORY. I CAN GET STARTED I CAN PULL DOWN A REPOSITORY WITHOUT STARTING UP VISUAL STUDIO AND DOING RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING. AND THE URL IS BAKED INTO MY IT AS WELL.RY AND I CAN BROWSE -  IT'S INTERESTING HOW GIT HUB IS BAKED INTO OUR LIVES. I CAN STAY IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019. JULIA MENTIONED AT THE TREEHOUSE SHE WANTS TO BAKE QUALITY IN. BEFORE THE COMMIT.H THINGS - BUT ONCE THE COMMIT HAS HAPPENED THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THE QUALITY GETS THROUGH THE ENTIRE PROCESS.  THAT'S CRITICAL. I CAN WRITE COAST INSIDE OF VISUAL STUDIO 2019 BUT I ALSO WANT TO CATCH THAT AS SOON AS SOMEBODY OPENS IT. IF I HAVE A PROJECT ON GITHUB, I CAN MAKE SURE THEIR CODE IS GOOD. I WANT TO MAKE SURE IT BUILDS AND MAKE SURE THE TEST IS FAST. I WANT CONTINUOUS SINTEGRATION FOR GITHUB AND AZURE. READY TO GO. WE'VE GOT HOST-TO-BUILD AGENTS IN THE CLOUD. WE'VE GOT MAC, WE'VE GOT WINDOWS AND LINUX. I CAN ACTUALLY DO MY CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION RIGHT THERE.  WE TALK ABOUT HOW GIT IS GETTING INCORPORATED INTO OUR LIVES. AND REMOTE. YOU'RE ACTUALLY REMOTELY COLLABORATING WITH JON RIGHT NOW.  JON.  YEAH, I'M WORKING REMOTELY WITH MY FRIEND JONATHAN. HE'S TRYING TO DO A SCREEN WITH ME. INSTEAD OF IT BEING LOCKSTEP TRYING TO NEGOTIATE CONTROL, ONE PERSON DRIVING OR NOT. WITH LIVE SMAHARE, WE'RE ABLE T INDEPENDENTLY COLLABORATE. RATHER THAN PUSHING FOR TEAMS FROM A REMOTE APPLICATION. YOU'RE ACTUALLY REMOTING THE CONTEXT OF THE ENTIRE APPLICATION?  YEAH, IT'S A SIMPLE LINK. I CAN HOP INTO HIS PROJECT. AND GET THE ENTIRE CONTEXT. I CAN SEE ON THE SIDE, ALL OF THE FILES AND FOLDERS. I GET FULL CONTEXT INTO THAT. AND FINALLY, I AM ABLE TO SEE THE FILE THAT HE'S WORKING IN. WE CAN SEE THE HIGHLIGHTS AND CURSORIES.  AS I WAS PEEKING OVER HERE AND SEEING WHAT HE WAS DOING BEFORE IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS IN VS CODE IN MAC. SUDDENLY, I'M SEEING THE SAME CODE IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019 ON WINDOWS.  I'M WORKING ON WINDOWS VISUAL STUDIO 2019. IT'S ALL WORKING ON MY SIDE BECAUSE IT'S ALL BEING FORWARDED FROM MY MACHINE.  I NOTICE, HE'S SELECTING CODE AND SHOWING YOU WHAT TO BE LOOKING AT.  YEAH, WITH THE HIGHLIGHTS, HE'S ABLE TO GIVE ME CONTEXT ON THE ISSUE THAT HE'S LOOKING INTO INTO.  THAT'S SUPER COOL.  WHAT ABOUT DEBUGGING, THOUGH?  ACTUALLY, I'M ABLE TO SET DOWN BREAK POINTS AND THOSE BREAK POINTS ARE GOING TO JONATHAN'S MACHINE. I'M ABLE TO HILT F5 AND IT GOES TO THE SCREEN. DO YOU DO HAVE TO DO SCREEN SHARE?  WITH LIVESHARE, IT'S ABLE TO BE SEEN ON MY SIDE AS WELL.  YOUR LOCAL HOST 5,000 IS HIS LOCAL HOST 5,000?  EXACTLY.  AND THEN YOU CAN CLICK AROUND THE WEBSITE TO HIT THE BRAKE POINT. . YEAH. STEPPING OVER AND INTO METHODS BETWEEN THE TWO OF US.  I'M IMPRESSED.  THAT IS VERY COOL. LAST QUESTION, WHAT ABOUT INTINTEL INTELLISENSE?  YOU'RE ACTUALLY ABLE TO GET DOT AND GET A FULL COMPLETION LIST.  EVERYTHING FROM HIS MACHINE, WATCHES AND ALL OF THE CONTEXT THAT IS THE APP IS BEING SENT OVER TO YOU?  YES, I'M ABLE TO GET THAT FULL CONTEXT AT MY SIDE AND WORK AT MY OWN PACE.  INTERESTING. WOULD EVEN YOUR FEATURE BE FORWARDED?  I DO BELIEVE IT WOULD.  INTELLICODE WORKS HERE. WHAT'S THIS DEMO WE'VE GOT?  I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THE BASE CASES. FOR YEARS WE'VE HEARD FROM USERS, INTELLISENSE IS WONDERFUL. I LOVE IT, YOU HAVE TO BE BETTER THAN ALPHABETICALLY. WE'RE ALL SCIENTISTS. WE'RE SMART, WE CAN MAKE IT BETTER. WHAT WE DID, WISDOM OF THE COMMUNITY. WE TO BE HUNDREDS OF SOURCES ON GITHUB, WE SCANNED THROUGH THEM TO GET THE PRACTICES FOR API FOR STRINGS OR CERT. AS WE USE THOSE IN VISUAL STUDIO IF I DO SOME STRING VARIABLE DOT, IT WILL GIVE ME A LIST OF RECOMMENDED SUGGESTIONS.  ARE YOU SAYING YOU TAUGHT VISUAL STUDIO WHAT I'M MOST LIKELY TO TYPE BASED ON WHAT THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PROGRAMMERS WHO ARE BETTER THAN I HAVE ALREADY TYPED?  YES, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE DID. AS I SAID, THE WISDOM OF THE COMMUNITY, WE TOOK THE WHOLE WISDOM COMMUNITY AND INFUSED INTELLISENSE WITH IT TO GET BETTER RECOMMENDATIONS. ON THE TOP OF YOUR INTELLISENSE LIST YOU GOT THE STARRED RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE MOST LIKELY WHAT YOU WANT. THAT'S AMAZING THAT YOU BROUGHT ME THES WIT WISDOM OF T ANCIENTS FROM THE OPEN SOURCE BUT I WANT A CUSTOM MODEL THAT'S FOR ME AND MY TEAM BUT THAT'S NOT FOR YOU.  YEAH, ALL YOU DO IS OPEN THE SOLUTION THAT YOU WANT A CUSTOM MODEL FOR. HEAD TO THE STAGE, CLICK TRAIN ON MY CODE, AND WE CREATE A CUSTOM MODEL JUST FOR YOU. IT'S PRIVATE TO YOU AND WHOEVER YOU CHOOSE FOR SHARE IT WITH. IF YOU THINK YOUR TEAM WOULD BENEFIT FROM THESE CUSTOM RECOMMENDATIONS, YOU COULD ALSO SHARE YOUR WISDOM WITH THEM.  OKAY, USED WITH THE UNION OF IT, I GET BOTH THE PUBLIC WISDOM AND THE PASSWISDOM OF MY OWN TE?  SKRCORRECT.  THOSE ARE GOING TO KEEP ME FROM THE SCROLL.  YES, IT CHANGES DEPENDING ON YOUR CONTEXT. IF YOU'RE IN THE BODY OF THE METHOD, VERSUS IT STATEMENT FOR FOR OR ELSE, YOU CAN GET DIFFERENT RECOMMENDATIONS. IDEALLY, YOU HAVE TO TAB/ENTER, TAB/ENTER.  ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY THAT --  IT'S GOING TO TWO TWO THINGS, YEAH.  WHAT LANGUAGE?  RIGHT NOW IN VISUAL STUDIO C# AND -- YOU HAVE IT FOR TYPE - SCRIPT, PYTHON AND JAV JAVA.  NOW, YOU'RE JUST SHOWING OFF.  RASPBERRY PIE WHICH I THINK IS AMAZING. IS THIS MACHINE TALKIN TO RASPBERRY PIE?  IT IS. IT ACTUALLIES ALLOWS ME TO DEPLOY IT. NOW, IT'S SUCCESSFULLY ON OUR RASPBERRY PIE BECAUSE REIFF INSTALLED WINDOWS 10 ON IT.  THAT'S OVERACHIEVING.  THIS APPLICATION WILL TELLING IF VISUAL STUDIO IS READY TO LAUNCH. IN FACT, IT SAYS, ARE YOU READY TO LAUNCH, DO YOU WANT TO TRY IT?  TOUCH SCREEN.  IT'S COOL.  YEAH, REALLY COOL. I HOPE EVERYONE TRYS IT OUT.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHOWING ME THIS. I'M GOING TO FIND A SODA POP, ANYBODY?  I'M GOOD.  AND TALK MORE ABOUT VISUAL STUDIO 2019. SEE, Y Y'ALL.  NOW, WE CAN RELAX. WASN'T THAT COOL? I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT MORE OF THESE FEATURES LATER ON. I JUST LOVE TALKING TO ALL OF THESE PASSIONATE PEOPLE BEHIND THE FEATURE AND HEARING ABOUT HOW WE BUILD THEM. YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I LOVE HERE? THE SODA HERE AT MICROSOFT. YOU CAN DOWNLOAD VISUAL STUDIO 2019 ON PC AND MAC. VISUAL STUDIO COMMUNITY USERS CAN HEAD OVER TO VISUALSTUDIO.COM. OR IF YOU'RE A PROFESSIONAL OR SUBSCRIBERS THERE'S EVEN MORE AVAILABLE AVAILABLE TO YOU FOR THE PORTAL. YOU CAN DOWNLOAD VISUAL STUDIO BUT YOU'LL ALSO FIND AZURE DEVOPS, THAT'S UP TO $150 IN OPTIONS AND TECHNICAL TRAINING. HEAD OVER TO LAUNCH.VISUALSTUDIOS.COM. NOW, LET'S HEAD OVER TO THE UX LAB WHERE AMANDA MENTIONED EARLIER HOW TO DO CUSTOMER RESEARCH IN DEVILLE. I'M GOING TO THE LAB IN THE BUILDING. I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING SOME STUDIES RIGHT NOW. I WANT TO KEEP MY VOICE DOWN BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO INTERRUPT EVERYBODY. IT'S OVER HERE. WE'VE GOT DR. RICH. LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE DOING A STUDY RIGHT NOW. ALL RIGHT.  HI. HI, SCOTT, SO GLAD YOU COULD JOIN US.  HOW'S IT GOING? WHAT DO WE GOT GOING ON HERE?  COME ON IN. THIS IS OUR RESEARCH LAB. RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE A PYTHON STUDY HAPPENING. AND THIS IS OUR ENTIRE PRODUCT TEAM. YOU'RE GOING TO GET TEAM MEMBERS THAT ARE FROM ENGINEERING, P.M., DESIGN, DOC, AND THEY'RE ALL ACTUALLY WATCHING IT ON THE OTHER SIDE INTERACT WITH THE PRODUCTS.  THIS IS REAL. THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE. WHERE DO THEY COME FROM?  YEAH, SO THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE. IN REDMOND, WE RUN STUDIES EVERY DAY IN OUR LAB.  EVERY DAY?  YEAH. SO, WE HAVE OVER 10,000 CUSTOMER CONNECTIONS A YEAR.  WOW.  WHAT YOU SEE RIGHT HERE IS JUST ONE OF MANY STUDIES THAT WE RUN. THE ENTIRE PRODUCT TEAM JOINS US BECAUSE BASICALLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS UNDERSTANDING HOW THE CUSTOMER IS USING OUR PRODUCT. BUT ALSO THEY CAN SEE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE CUSTOMER, RIGHT? SO, THEY CAN SEE THEIR FACIAL EXPRESSIONS. THEY CAN SEE IF THEY LEAN BACK IN THE CHAIR. CROSS THEIR ARMS, IF THEY'RE SMILING IN DELIGHT. THIS ACTUALLY FOSTERS EMPATHY WITH OUR PRODUCT TEAM AND INSPIRES THEM TO TAKE ACTION TO CHANGE THE PRODUCT IF IT DOESN'T FIT OUR CUSTOMERS' NEEDS.  WOW. ACTUALLY, I RECOGNIZE THIS GUY. JEFFREY, YOU GOT A SECOND?  HEY.  HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN A WHILE. WHAT ARE YOU GUYS TESTING HERE?  SO, WE'RE TRYING OUT NEW DESIGNS FOR AZURE STORAGE ABK LIBRARIES. WE HAVE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT DESIGNS WE BRING PEOPLE INTO THE FEASIBILITY STUDY AND GIVE THEM TASKS TO PERFORM TO DOWNLOAD. THEY TRY IT WITH VERSION ONE AND VERSION TWO, A COUPLE MINUTES AGO YOU JUST MISSED IT BUT THEY JUST HIGH-FIVED EACH OTHER BECAUSE THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. AND REASSURING THE TEAM.  IN REALTIME WHAT THEY GET RIGHT OR NOT?  EXACTLY. AND HOW WE CAN DO BETTER. THAT'S FANTASTIC. THANK YOU. WE'VE GOT PYTHON, PC, MAC, CAN WE PEEK INTO ONE OF THESE?  LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT LAB ONE. THIS IS THE VISUAL STUDIO PYTHON STUDY. WHAT YOU'RE SEEING PEOPLE WHO ARE DEVELOPS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH PYTHON BUT USING THE VISUAL STUDIO FOR THE FIRST TIME.  MAY I OPEN THE DOOR?  ABSOLUTELY.  I DON'T WANT TO ANGER THE BEAST.  WHAT YOU'RE SEEING HERE, ON THE OTHER SIDE, OUR PARTICIPANTS, THEY CAN'T SEE US, IT'S A ONE-WAY MIRROR. THINK "LAW & ORDER." THEY CAN'T SEE ANYONE ON THE PRODUCT TEAM. BUT THE PRODUCT TEAM CAN SEE EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING ON THE OTHER SIDE. THE BEAUTY OF THESE TYPE OF STUDIES, WE CAN NOT ONLY SEE EVERY MOUSE CLICK ON THE SCREEN, BUT WE CAN SEE THEIR BODY LANGUAGE.  YOU'RE DOING THIS EVERY SINGLE DAY?  YES, WE HAVE OVER 10,000 CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENTS EVERY SINGLE YEAR. SURVEYS, ONE-ON-ONE INTERVIEWS, FOCUS GROUPS OR SITE GROUPS. THIS SOUR CULTURE ROOM. LET ME GRAB TRAVIS.  HEY, WE'RE SHOWING THE CULTURE ROOM. THE CULTURE ROOM IS A ROOM THAT WE WALK TEAMS THROUGH TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE REALLY BECOMING CUSTOMER OBSESSED. WE KNOW THAT SATYA IS WALKING US THROUGH EVERY DAY TRYING TO TRANSFORM THIS COMPANY CREATING ZERO DISTANCE BETWEEN US AND THE CUSTOMER. SO, WE SPEND A LATOT OF TIME IN THIS ROOM AND BRING ZERO DISTANCE BETWEEN US AND ENGAGING THE CUSTOMER. WE TALK A LOT ABOUT HACKING OUR CULTURE. WE ARE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME WITH OUR CUSTOMERS SO IMPORTANT IN OUR DEVELOPER COMMUNITY THAT GIVES US FEEDBACK EVERY SINGLE DAY IN TERMS OF WHERE WE'RE HEADING WITH THE PRODUCT.  IT'S SO MUCH MORE INSPIRATIONAL AND CUSTOMER SUCCESS THAT'S BAKED IN ON EVERY LEVEL. I'M EXCITED THAT YOU DO THE LABS EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND THIS IS HAPPENING.  THE IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE IN THE UX LAB. THERE ARE SO MANY WAYS TO GIVE US FEEDBACK, EVEN WITHIN VISUAL STUDIO, FOR INSTANCE, CUSTOMERS THAT WE'RE HERE, LISTENING AND ENGAGING.  I'M GOING TO FIND MORE PMs WORKING ON THE PROJECT.  THANK YOU.  MY PLEASURE.  LET'S GO FIND SOME MORE PMs. HEY. SWEET. HEY, FRIENDS.  YEAH.  HOW'S IT GOING? ALL RIGHT. I'VE JUST COME FROM THE UX LAB. IT'S AMAZING. UP GOT TO CHECK IT OUT. I HEAR YOU HAVE FUN DEMOS FOR ME.  I DO.  ALL RIGHT. LET'S SEE THEM. I WAS TALKING WITH JULIA AND AMANDA ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS SOME VISUAL STUDIO 2019, LITTLE FEATURES THAT MAKE YOU HAPPY DEBUGGING. YOU WORK ON SOME OF THOSE THINGS, LESLIE?  YEAH, ONE OF THE COOL THINGS WE ADDED FOR VISUAL STUDIO 2019 ARE DATA BREAK POINTS. NOW WITH C# AND DOT NET USERS CAN REJOICE.  YEAH!  IT'S IN OUR MANAGE CODE LIVES. THIS IS A FEATURE THAT ALLOWS TO YOU BREAK WHEN A VALUE CHANGES. IF YOU WANT TO HONE IN ON A SPECIFIC VALUE AND NOT JUST THE WHOLE SUBJECT, THAT'S THE WAY TO GO.  THAT'S A COOL THING, YOU WANT TO KNOW IF THAT THING CHANGES AND THE BREAK?  RIGHT.  IT'S SUPER COOL.  SOMETIMES, YOU MIGHT HAVE A BIG APPLICATION, MAYBE LIKE A BIG GAME OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. YOU CAN USE MANY DATA BREAK POINTS? YES, ABSOLUTELY. THE PROBLEM IS WHEN YOU HAVE A LARGE APPLICATION LIKE A GAME, SOMETIMES, IT CAN BE HARD TO DEBUG IT IF YOU'RE USING A PREVIOUS ITERATION. TEAMS ACROSS MICROSOFT, FOR INSTANCE, JUST THE OFFICE TEAM, AND EDGE TEAM AND XBOX, THEY'VE ASKED US CAN YOU LET US DEBUG US AND BECAUSE WE'RE CONSTANTLY GETTING MEMORY ERRORS. NOW IN 2019, WE'VE MADE SAMPLES OT OF IT YOU'RE ABLE TO DEBUG THOSE APPLICATIONS WITHOUT CONSTANTLY GOING THROUGH THOUGH AREAS.  I THINK I RECOGNIZE THIS GAME.  YES, THIS IS GEARS OF WAR. THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A REALLY BIG GAME. AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S BEING DEBUGGED IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019. WE'VE ALSO, JUST TO COMPARE IT WE TRIED TO DEBUG IT IN 2017. IF YOU LOOK IN THE TASK MANAGER AT THE MEMORY CONSUMPTION BEING USED, THE AMOUNT OF MEMORY BEING CONSUMED IN 2019 IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN WHAT IT IS AT 2017. SO -- NICE.  -- NO SWEAT THERE.  AND ALSO IT'S GAME OF WAR WHICH IS SO AWESOME. WORKS GREAT LOCALLY.ION THAT - MAYBE A CLOUD SERVICE. BT THAT UP ON THE CLOUD. WHAT IF IT DOESN'T WORK WELL IN PRODUCTION? HOW DO I CONVERT THAT?  REALLY, IN THE PAST, WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS MAKE A REFILL LOCALLY WHICH COULD BE TRICKY. OR YOU HAVE TO TRY TO GARNER WHAT THE ISSUE IS FROM A BUNCH OF LOGS THAT YOU MAY NOT EVEN GET THE RELEVANT INFORMATION THAT YOU NEED. VISUAL STUDIO 2017 INTRODUCED SNAPSHOT DEBUGGING WHICH ALLOWS TO YOU TAKE A SNAPSHOT OF YOUR APPLICATION AND DEBUG IT WHILE THE CODE IS STILL RUNNING IN PRODUCTION WITHOUT ANY IMPACT ON THE ED USER'S EXPERIENCE. SO WHAT WE'VE ADDED ON 2019 ON TOP OF THAT IS TIME TRAVEL. WHICH BASICALLY ALLOWS YOU TO STEP THROUGH YOUR CODE USING THE DEBUGGER.  SERIOUSLY, LIKE TIME TRAVEL? YEP. FORWARD BACKWARDS, FRONT WARDS.  YOU GET THAT?  YOU STILL GET THE FULL FUNCTIONALITY. WATCH WINDOWS, LOCAL WINDOWS.  THAT'S AWESOME. I HAVE THE APPLICATION IN THE PRODUCTION, BUT IF IT'S GOT A BUG AND IT NEEDED DEBUGGED IT PROBABLY DIDN'T PAST MY UNIT TEST. WHAT HAPPENED?  WELL, LIVE UNIT TESTING CAN HELP YOU MAKE SURE EVERYTHING YOU PUSH INTO THE CLOUD HAS ACTUALLY HAD A TEST RUN. SO, UNIT TESTING CAN AUTOMATICALLY RERUN TESTS EVERY SERIOUSLY. A CODE CHANGE.- EVERY TIME YOU SAVE IT?  YEAH, HERE I CAN MAKE A QUICK CODE CHANGE. AND YOU CAN SEE IT'S RERUNNING IN THE BACKGROUND AS I'M TYPING.  AS YOU'RE TYPING?  YEAH. AND I CAN GET FEEDBACK.  THAT WAS WRONG FOR ME TO PUSH THAT. WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON?  SO, THIS IS ACTUALLY A LITTLE TWITTER SENTIMENT ANALYSIS THAT WE COOKED UP. SO, IT'S -- IT GETS ALL OF THE RECENT TWEETS ON VISUAL STUDIO AND RUNS THROUGH AZURE COGNITIVE SERVICES TO GAUGE SENTIMENT. SO HERE I HAVE AN I LITTLE EMOJI, SEARCHING FOR AN EMOJI TEST BECAUSE EMOJIS ARE SUPER IMPORTANT?  I'VE GOT TO ASK, HOW DID YOU GET THE EMOJIS IN THAT?  BECAUSE VISUAL STUDIO IS AWESOME AND RECOGNIZES IT. THE REFACTORING THAT I JUST TRIGGERED ARE JUST ALL OF THE CODE FIXES AND REFACTORING THAT YOU CAN ACCESS THROUGH CODE DELUXE. THAT WAS ONE OF THE NEW REFACTORING. IT'S ONE OF MANY THAT WE ADDED IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019, WRAPPING PARAMETERS. IF YOU HAVE SUPER LONG PARAMETERS AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO SEE, SOME PEOPLE PREFER THE CODE STYLE AS WRAPPING A NEW PARAMETER.  ONE OF THE THINGS MENTIONED IN THE OLD DAYS I USED TO REMEMBER THE HOT KEYS. NOW IT'S CONTROL KEY, CONTROL DOT, CONTROL Q.  WELL, CONTROL DOT WILL OPEN IT, AND CLEVER. CONTROL T IS OUR MAIN NAVIGATIONS SHORT CUT FOR ANYTHING INSIDE YOUR COAT. AND CONTROL Q IS ANYTHING WITHIN YOUR MENUS, VISUAL STUDIO AND TOOLS OPTIONS, THAT KIND OF THING.  I JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THOSE THREE HOT KEYS AND HAVE THE POWER OF VISUAL STUDIO.  YEAH. AND WE HAVE JUDVISUAL ICONS THA YOU CAN OPEN, TOO, IT'S A LITTLE SCREWDRIVER.  AND I'M NOW GOING TO PUT EMOJIS IN ALL OF MY CODE.  EXCELLENT.  ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS YOU'LL NOTICE AS YOU OPEN VISUAL STUDIO 2019 IS THE NEW COLORATION. THEY HAVE NEW ROSLYN CLASSIFICATIONS. THEY GET NEW COLORS. YOU CAN SEE PURPLE HERE. PARAMETERS ARE DARK BLUE. WE TRIED TO MIMIC THE VISUAL STUDIO CODE NUMBERS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. THOSE THAT ARE EVEN SUPER SUCCESSFUL IN THE COMMUNITY. AND WE GOT A LOT OF FEEDBACK THAT PEOPLE LOVE THEM.  THAT'S COOL. SO YOU GAVE VISUAL STUDIO A LITTLE POP. THE COLORS THAT I'M USED TO WITH MORE CONTEXT.  IN REFACTORING THAT WE ADDED TO VISUAL STUDIO 2019 IS THE FOUR LINK, WE HAVE LINK TO 4H. LOOP TO 4H, AND CONVERTING BACK. MANY OF THEM ARE SUPER FUN TO TRY OUT.  IT MAKES ME FEEL SMART. I MAY BE CAN'T WRITE THE LINK FROM SCRATCH. AND I CAN GO -- AND IT TURNS INTO LINK?  YEAH. YOU CAN USE LINK?  YEAH.  SERIOUSLY.  WHAT ABOUT GETTING STARTED WITH A CODE BASE? A LITTLE QUESTION AND I'D LIKE TO GET A JUMP START. I DON'T WANT TO REFACTOR, LIKE STEP-BY-STEP.  YES, A GREAT WAY TO APPLY OLDER REFACTORING IF YOU WANT TO IS CODE CLEANUP. YOU'VE PROBABLY CONFIGURED ALL OF THE RULES AND TOOLS OPTIONS. WHAT LEVELS OF REFACTORING SUGGESTIONS YOU WANT THIS TO BE TRIGGERED ON. YOU CAN EXPORT THOSE TO EDITOR CONFIG FILE THAT LIVES YOUR REPOSITORY. ALL OF YOUR TEAM MEMBERS CAN HAVE THE FILE AND CODE CLEANUP WILL RUN THE REFACTORING THAT YOU SET IN THAT.  OH.  THAT'S A GREAT WAY TO CLEAN UP THE CODE.  THAT WAS FANTASTIC. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. WHAT DO YOU HAVE FOR YOU?  OH, MY GOSH, I HAVE SO MUCH TO TELL YOU. I'M EXCITED. KENDRA WAS TALKING ABOUT THE CODE FIXES AND REFACTORINGS THAT WE HAVE ON VISUAL STUDIO 2019 FROM WINDOWS. WE'VE ACTUALLY BROUGHT THE C# FROM VISUAL TO MAC. IT HAS THE SAME INTELLISENSE, AND CODE REFACTORING THAT YOU GET.  YOU'RE LITERALLY SHARING COATED BETWEEN THE TWO?  WE ARE, YEAH.  VERY COOL.  HERER IN A XAMARIN FORMS PROJECT. SCOTT, AS YOU KNOW XAMARIN IS OUR DOT-NET FRAMEWORK. AND THIS PROJECT IS XAMARIN FORM. SO 100% OF THE FRONT END IS IN XAML. AND IT RUNS ON BOLT.  YOU'RE SHARING THE UI ACROSS IT ALL?  IT'S GREAT. IT'S AN APP WE DEMOED IN THE FALL. IT'S 100 XAMARIN FORM. WE'RE USING A NEW FEATURE CALLED SHELL THAT DOES ALL OF THE NAVIGATION FOR YOU.  SERIOUSLY?  YEAH. SELF-COLORING, CHANGING IT'S TABS, VERY EASY TO CUSTOMIZE. THAT WAS VISUAL STUDIO 2019 FOR MAC. LET ME FLIP TO WINDOWS HERE. MORE GREAT STUFF TO SHOW YOU FOR XAM XAMARIN. FIRST OFF, WE HAVE INTELLICODE SUPPORT FOR XAMARIN OUT OF THE BOX.  NICE. YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND TYPE YOUR CONTROLS AND ATTRIBUTES AND IT TOPS UP WITH SUGGESTIONS. YOU CAN CHANGE THE COLORS OF YOUR CONTROLS, THE LAYOUT, THE WAY THEY'RE POSITIONED, THE TEXT, ALL OF THAT WITHOUT HAVING TO WRITE A NEW XAML WHICH IS VERY HELPFUL.  ONE OF THE THINGS THAT KEPT ME FROM USING DATA BEFORE. THAT'S WAY SMALLER IN 2019.  RIGHT. WE DROPPED THE INSTALL SIZE FROM 23 GIGS TO 7 GIGS WHICH IS FANTASTIC AND MAKES IT QUICKER TO GET STARTED. WE DID A LOT OF WORK ON ANDROID BUILD AND PERFORMANCE. IT WAS PREVIOUSLY REALLY SLOW AND TOOK UP TIME TO SPEED UP THE EMULATOR AND THEN YOU HAVE TO PULL YOUR PROJECT. AND THAT INNER DEAD LOOP, WE CALL IT, WAS TAKING PEOPLE A LONG TIME.  I HEAR THAT THE ANDROID BUILD TIMES ARE WAY FASTER AND A LOT MORE FUN.  BUILD TIMES ARE FASTER. AND SUPPORT TIME AND EMTU LATER.  THAT MEAN YOU CAN HAVE ANDROID, EMULATOR AND DOC SERVER TALKING TO IT ALL.  OH, YEAH. IT'S SMOOTHER AND A LOT OF FUN.  YOU'VE GOT A PHONE LINE HERE?  I DO. I ALSO HAVE THIS PAIR OF PLIERS. USING 100% XAMARIN FORM WE CAN TAKE A PAIR OF PLIERS AND USE THIS.  IT'S TALKING TO THE BACK YEEND?  IT ALREADY HAS.  THAT'S SO COOL. THAT'S A BACK END WRITTEN IN AZURE.  YEAH ALL UNTIL AZURE.  WE HAVE GREAT TOOLS IN VISUAL STUDIO TO ENABLE YOU TO GET STARTED. I CAN RUN IT BACK QUICKLY STARTING WITH VISUAL STUDIO 2019.  THAT IS CORRECT. ONE WAY TO GET STARTED WE HAVE TEMPLATES BUILT INTO AZURE TYPES AND AZURE FUNCTIONS. WE HAVE THAT CORE WHICH IS A GREAT BACK END TO BE HOSTED IN A LOTS OF PLACES RUNNING IN AZURE. THEN WHEN YOU'RE DEVELOPING AS A USER, WE HAVE ALL SORTS OF EEM MOVE EMULATORS TO RUN THINGS LOCALLY. YOU DON'T WANT TO BE RUNNING UP THE BILL. STORAGE, DATABASES, ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE AVAILABLE LOCALLY. SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A CLOUD-CONNECTED DEVEOPER ENVIRONMENT EVERY DAY. I KNOW YOU TRAVEL A LOT, SCOTT. YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO IT ON AN AIRPLANE.  I WAS SURPRISED HOW MANY THINGS I WAS DOING FOR THE CLOUD AND AZURE FOR IT ON STORAGE AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS ON AN AIRPLANE DISCONNECTSED.  THAT IS ONE OF OUR GOALS. WE HEAR FROM PEOPLE THEY WANT TO TIGHT LOOP BEING ABLE TO DO THINGS LOCALLY WITHOUT THE CLOUD DEPENDENCY ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS.  I'VE LANDED FROM THE PLANE AND I WANT TO PUTS UP IN AZURE.  WE WORKED HARD TO MAKE THAT EASY FROM VISUAL STUDIO. ALL YOU DO IS RIGHT CLICK THE PROJECT. CHOOSE PUBLISH AND YOU'LL SEE RUN IT. IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN OPINION YET, WE RECOMMEND YOU THAT START WITH AZURE APP SERVICE, WE FIND THAT'S THE EASIEST PLACE TO GET STARTED. AFTER YOU PUBLISH, THE CORE PART OF YOUR CODE THAT'S GOING TO RUN WE MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO CREATE OTHER PORTIONS OF THE DEPENDENCIES THAT YOU NEED TO FUNCTION CORRECTLY INCLUDING SQL STORAGE AND AZURE STORAGE DIRECTLY FROM VISUAL STUDIO. ONCE YOU'VE PUBLISHED IT, EVEN IF YOU DON'T NEED IT INITIALLY, ONE OF THE NEW THINGS WE'VE MADE IN 2019, WE'VE MADE IT EASIER TO ADD THOSE AT ANY POINT IN THE DEVELOPER CYCLE.  YOU'RE MAKING THAT PUBLISHER RE-ENTRY, YOU CAN GO BACK IN AND ADD THAT TO THE EXISTING STORAGE?  ABSOLUTELY, IF YOU DECIDE YOU NEED STORAGE THREE MONTHS INTO THE DEVELOPMENT, YOU ADD THAT TO THE SERVICE DIRECTLY FROM VISUAL STUDIO. WITHOUT THE NEED TO GO TO THE PORTAL OR SOME OTHER TOOL.  THAT'S COOL. I LOVE EVERYTHING YOU JUST SHOWED ME EXCEPT MY BOSS WON'T GIVE ME ACCESS TO CREATING ANYTHING NEW IN AZURE.  WE HEAR THAT A LOT. ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WE OFFER IN VISUAL STUDIO IS THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE EXISTING RESOURCES. AS LONG AS YOU HAVE CONDITIONS TO PUBLISH THROUGH THE RESOURCE, YOU CAN THROUGH THE RESOURCE SELECT AN ALREADY CREATED RESOURCE IN AZURE AND THAT SAME SUMMARY TAB WILL GET POPULATED LIKE YOU DID EVERYTHING YOURSELF. IN FACT, WE'RE EVEN ABLE TO SHOW YOU IT IN STORAGE DEPENDENCIES.  FANTASTIC. I'M GOING TO TAKE OFF FOR THE NEXT THING. TAKE SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.  BYE.  BYE-BYE. THAT WAS SO MUCH FUN FOR ME. I HOPE YOU ENJOYED GETTING TO KNOW SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO WORK ON VISUAL STUDIO 2019. AND TAKING A PEEK BEHIND THE SCENES. AS I MENTIONED AT THE START, THERE'S A TON MORE CONTENT COMING TODAY WITH LIVE LAUNCH SESSIONS COMING RIGHT NOW. BE SURE TO ASK QUESTIONS AND LET US KNOW WHAT YOU THINK ON TWITTER AND #VS2019. OR JOIN US FOR LIVE CONVERSATIONS ON TWITCH, AT TWITCHTV/VISUAL STUDIO. WHOO, THAT WAS A LOT.  GOOD JOB, SCOTT.  YEAH. WELL, I HOPE WE FIXED THAT IN POST. COOL, THAT'S VERY COOL. SO, WHO DO YOU THINK I SHOULD GO AND SEE -- SEE, IT'S FAKE, ISN'T IT?  IT SOUNDS WEIRD.  IT DOES SOUND WEIRD, BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU JUST SAID.  I CAN ACTUALLY DO MY CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION RIGHT THERE.  THAT WAS SO GOOD.  YEAH, I HAVE IT RIGHT HERE. AND IT'S HOOKED UP TO THE INTER-LIST. AND RUNNING THE BACK -- HIGH-FIVE ON THIS.  HIGH-FIVE.  IS THAT OKAY?  YEAH. KENDRA. STOP GIVING ME THE ILLUSION YOU'RE STANDING NEXT TO SCOTT.  SO, I WAS ABLE TO SIGN INTO GITHUB FROM THE START MODE.  THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. THEN I'M GOING TO SAY SOMETHING -- HELLO AND WELCOME LIVE TO THIS CHANNEL 9 STUDIOS. WE'RE HERE FOR THE VISUAL STUDIO 2019 LAUNCH. I'M SUPER EXCITED. LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT I'VE GOT AND WHY I'M EXCITED. THIS YEAR, MY FRIEND, WAS THE VERY FIRST PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM VALUE. I THINK IT WAS THE FIRST VISUAL STUDIO, SO IT'S REALLY EXCITING FOR ME TO BE HERE. I'VE ALSO GOT SOME FRIENDS WITH ME, BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT A LOT OF STUFF TODAY. JEFF, ARE YOU OVER THERE IN STUDIO "C," MY FRIEND?  YEAH, I'M OVER HERE IN STUDIO "C" GETTING READY FOR ALL KINDS OF INTERACTION WITH OUR COMMUNITY THROUGHOUT THE DAY TODAY.  AWESOME. SO, TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO. THEN WE'LL GO OVER SOME OF THE STUFF THAT WE HAVE FOR TODAY.  SO, THERE'S A BUNCH OF LIVE WATCH PARTIES GOING ON RIGHT NOW. I KNOW YOU'RE WATCHING IN PLACES LIKE HELSINKI, AND IRELAND, ARIZONA. A GROUP OF FOLKS IN MUMBAI WATCHING US RIGHT NOW. TALK TO SOME OF THOSE FOLKS - THROUGHOUT THE DAY TODAY. THEN A LITTLE LATER ON, WE'VE GOT A COUPLE MVPs JOINING US BACK HERE IN STUDIO "C," WE'RE GOING TO WRAP THINGS UP WITH A PARTY LIVE HERE.  MY UNDERSTANDING, THERE MIGHT BE PRIZES DID I GET THAT WRONG?  OH, THERE MIGHT BE. THERE MIGHT BE A LOT OF PRIZES. WE'VE ACTUALLY GOT 21 PRIZES THAT FOLKS CAN WIN.  21? DID YOU TRY TO GO WITH A ROUND NUMBER?  WE DID A ROUND NUMBER. BUT SOMEBODY SAID, HEY, HERE'S A COOL PRIZE TO GIVE AWAY SO WE HAVE 21.  ALL RIGHT. JEFF, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR BEARD, MAN?  I DON'T KNOW. I'VE BEEN TOLD THIS IS MY COLOR. WHAT DO YOU THINK? DOES THAT LOOK GOOD? VISUAL STUDIO PURPLE?  I WANT TO READ THE SCHEDULE NOW. ALL RIGHT. SO, YOU JUST SAW AN AWESOME KEYNOTE. I LOVE THAT KEYNOTE BECAUSE YOU GET TO SEE A LITTLE BIT OF THE PERSONALITY OF PEOPLE THAT WORK HERE. WE ARE PEOPLE AFTER ALL AND WE'RE OBSESSED BY DOING THE RIGHT THING BY YOU. IF YOU EVER HAVE FEEDBACK FOR US, WE WANT THAT. HOPEFULLY, YOU SAW SOME OF THAT IN THE KEYNOTE. WE'RE SUPER PASSIONATE MAKING SURE DEVELOPERS ARE PRODUCTIVE. AND THEY HAVE THE LATEST AND GREATEST TOOLS I'VE BEEN USING THEM FOR ALMOST NINE -- ALMOST 20 YEARS. MAN. WE HAVE AMANDA AND WE'LL BE TAKING THEM ON THIS BOARD USING THE #2019 WE'LL GET THEM ON HERE. I HAVE QUESTIONS, WE'RE ALL ABOUT THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. MAKE SURE YOU GET THOSE IN. WE ALSO HAVE COMING UP, BEAUTIFUL CODE CLASS WITH KENDRA HAVENS. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO MISS THAT. IN THE MIDDLE OF THESE THINGS, AS JEFF WAS TELLING YOU, WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO GET SOME PEOPLE BECAUSE THERE ARE OVER 70 LIVE VIEWING PARTIES ACROSS THE WORLD. 160 THAT ARE GOING THROUGH MAY. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO BE ENJOYING THIS, I HOPE. NEXT WE HAVE A STREAMLINE YOUR DREAM DEV TEAM WITH ALLISON AND JOHN. WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT SQUASHING BUGS AND IMPROVING QUALITY WITH LESLIE RICHARDSON. I'M EXCITED ABOUT THAT. AND DEVOPS. DEVOPS IS SOMETHING I WAS GETTING INTO. I WISH I WOULD HAVE DONE THIS DURING THESE DAYS. JEFF, HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN CODING?  I'VE BEEN CODING FOR 25 YEARS ALSO. I STARTED IN BB6, RIGHT -- THAT WAS WAY THING. HEY, YOU CAN'T TELL. YOU CAN'T TELL.  IT'S MY BEARD THAT GIVES IT AWAY. YOU START COLORING THE BEARD, EVERYONE KNOWS YOU'RE TRYING TO HIDE THE GRAY.  I'M TRYING TO HIDE THE FORTRAN REMNANTS THAT ARE HANGING AROUND.  WHAT IS THE MOST AMAZING THING IN VISUAL STUDIO? I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN IN VISUAL STUDIO ALMOST YOUR WHOLE CAREER?  WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT HAS COME OUT WITH VISUAL STUDIO 2019 I'M A HUGE FAN OF NOT JUST LIVESHARE BUT INTELLICODE. IT GIVES ME THE STARS, THE FEATURES, THE THINGS I WANT TO USE IT MY CODE, THE PROPERTIES, METHODS, EVENTS MOST APARTMENT TO LEARN IN AAPI THAT I MIGHT NT BE FAMILIAR WITH. I HAD SOMEBODY WORKING WITH VISUAL STUDIO LAST WEEK THEY WEREN'T FAMILIAR WITH SOME OF THE LIBRARIES WE'RE WORKING WITH BECAUSE THEY SAW THOSE INTELLICODE CHARMS COPPING UP AT THE START, A HINT AT DIFFERENT FEATURES, THEY IMMEDIATELY KNEW HOW TO MAKE THE MOST OF THE API WE WERE USING. REALLY GREAT HEM TO FOLKS.  I SAW WE SAW IT ON TWITCH -- WATCHING AS WE TALKED, I SAW SOMETHING WHERE WE NEED TO DO THE THING WHERE WE HOOK UP SOMEBODY'S HEAD AND WE JUST WRITE THE CODE THAT THEY THINK.  THAT'S INTELLICODE AND MACHINE LEARNING.  WE'LL CALL IT INTELLIBRAIN. SHOULD WE GET THAT? ALL RIGHT. AFTER TALKING DEVOPS, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN AI-INFUSED BREAK WITH AI. I JUST ACTUALLY LEARNED A LOT OF STUFF FROM VISUAL STUDIO AND PYTHON.  PYTHON IS AMAZING.  I KNOW. I'M SUCH A FAN. LIKE I SAID, I DID VISUAL STUDIO FOR MANY YEARS THEN I WENT BACK TO SCHOOL BECAUSE I HAD TO GET AN EDUCATION AND I USED PYTHON THERE. NEXT THING WE'LL DO IS ACCELERATE C++, I JUST DON'T LIKE COMING AFTER MYSELF. THAT'S A PROGRAM ITSELF.  THAT IS. WE LIKE OUR GC PROCESSES IN DOTNET.  AND THEN TO THE CLOUD AND VISUAL STUDIO AND AZURE. HERE'S THE THING. WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO GET THESE UP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE ASKING US WHETHER THEY'RE GOING UP, LIKE IN DRIBBLES, THEY'RE WORKING AS FAST AS THEY CAN IN THE BACK. WE'VE PUT AN EXTRA LARGE WHEEL AND THEY'RE RUNNING AS WE SPEAK.  FOLKS WATCHING HERE ON TO WIT OR ON MIXER, YOU CAN MEET THAT VIDEO ON DEMAND BUTTON AND REWIND TO EARLIER IN THE DAY TO CHECK SOMETHING EARLIER IN THE DAY.  HE KNOWS HIS STUFF. HE'S OVER IN THIS AREA, NOT IN THIS AREA.  YEAH, PHYSICALLY, I'M ON THAT SIDE.  ALL RIGHT. DAN ROTH IS GOING TO COME AND TALK ABOUT BUILDING AMAZING WEB APPS WITH.NET CORE. AND I HEAR THERE'S A LOT OF COOL STUFF WITH JOSEPH HERE IF YOU WANT TO ASK HARD QUESTIONS, AMAZING DEVS DOING AMAZING THINGS. THAT'S WITH YOU, JEFF? RIGHT?  YES, WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF MICROSOFT MVPs JENNY AND OREN. WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THINGS IN THE PREVIEW CHANNEL VISUAL STUDIO 2019 AND WHAT THEY'VE BEEN WATCHING AND SOME OF THE THINGS THEY'VE BEEN SEEING IN THE NEXT PREVIEW CHANNEL FOR VISUAL STUDIO.  FANTASTIC. I THINK WE'VE LATHERED ENOUGH. LET'S GIVE TIME TO AMAZING PEOPLE. WE'VE GOT ABOUT 60 SECONDS BEFORE WE GO TO THEM, WHAT WE WANT TO DO, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU STAY TUNED FOR COOL STUFF. THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF TO LEARN. A LOT OF STUFF TO LEARN AFTER. AND WE WANT YOUR COMMENTS. THERE'S 24 ALREADY. I'LL PUSH THIS BUTTON AND WE'LL ASK THEM. I'M GOING TO BE THE VANNA WHITE OF VISUAL STUDIO 2019 TODAY. I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, LET ME -- LET'S HAVE YOU INTRODUCE YOURSELVES, JOSEPH AND AMANDA. TELL US WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU DO. AM AMANDA. I'M AMANDA SILVER DIRECTOR OF. I'M JOSEPH AND I'M DIRECTOR OF XAMARIN.  VIPs. WHY DON'T YOU GIVES A SMALL RECAP. WE CAN GET TO WHERE PEOPLE ASK QUESTIONS. START WITH YOU, JOSEPH.  AS I SAID, DIGITAL STUDIO, XAMARIN. PRETTY EXCITED. VISUAL STUDIO 2019 DEVELOPER, EXCITED ABOUT THE IMPROVEMENTS WE'VE MADE FOR PRODUCTS AND STABILITY AND FOR MAC IN "THE VOICE" OF MOBILE DEVELOPMENT TOOLS ON MY DESKTOP, IT'S, LIKE, 1/3 THAT SIZE NOW. SO YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY OPT IN TO THAT. FANTASTIC. JUST ZIP STUFF UP OR -- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. LIKE SOMEBODY INTRODUCED US TO THIS ARCHIVING TOOL AND WE'RE LIKE, WOW, THIS IS GREAT. WHY AREN'T WE USING THAT?  THAT'S AWESOME. AMANDA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?  TODAY IS THE BIG NEWS OF VISUAL STUDIO 2019 BEING READY FOR EVERYONE TO TAKE ON. THERE IS A GET FIRST START EXPERIENCE TO GET IN THE FLOW OF THE CODE YOUR OTHER TEAMMATES ARE WORKING ON. THERE IS VISUAL STUDIO LIVE SHARE. IN THE VISUAL STUDIO 2019 IN THE BOX OUT THE GATE. BASICALLY WE HAVE BOTH COLLABORATION AT THE CHECK-IN TIME, SO THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY GO AND REVIEW PULL REQUESTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT INSIDE OF VISUAL STUDIO, BUT PRE-CHECK-IN SO YOU CAN HAVE A REAL-TIME COLLABORATION SESSION WITH SOMEBODY ELSE THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH. THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE SUPER EXCITING IS VISUAL STUDIO INTELICODE, KIND OF THE FIRST STEPS TOWARDS AI AND MACHINE LEARNING ENHANCING YOUR EXPERIENCE AS A DEVELOPER. THERE ARE SO MANY I CAN'T NAME THEM ALL -- WE IMPROVED THE UI SO IT FEELS CLEANER SO YOU HAVE HEADSPACE TO FOCUS ON THE CODE THAT YOU'RE WRITING. WE IMPROVED THE SEARCH CAPABILITY IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019 SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY DISCOVER NEW FEATURES THAT YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN FAMILIAR WITH PREVIOUSLY. ONE OF MY FAVORITE FEATURES IS ACTUALLY THAT WE'VE MOVED THE C++ DEBUGGING OUT OF PROCESS. THAT HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY HUGE FOR PEOPLE WORKING ON VERY LARGE-SCALE C++ APPLICATIONS, ESPECIALLY FOLKS THAT ARE WORKING ON AAA GAMES BECAUSE THEY USED TO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THEY WOULD BASICALLY RUN INTO OUT OF MEMORY EXCEPTIONS IN THE DEBUGGER AFTER ABOUT FIVE, TEN MINUTES OF CODING AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN NOW THEY REALLY DON'T RUN INTO THOSE THINGS ANYMORE. THEY CAN HAVE, YOU KNOW, HALF HOUR, HOUR, YOU KNOW, COUPLE HOUR-LONG DEBUGGING SESSIONS. THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING. I SAW THERE WAS DEBUGGING A HUGE GAME. JUST A GAME BY ITSELF IS PRETTY BIG. WHEN YOU HAVE ALL THE DEBUG SYMBOLS AND HAVE TO KEEP TRACK, IT'S PRETTY AMAZING WHAT YOU'RE ABLE TO DO WITH ALL THAT. WE HAVE A LOT OF TESTIMONIALS FROM FOLKS BUILDING LARGE C++ APP APPLICATION THAT IS A GAME CHANGER.  LET'S GET TO SOME QUESTIONS. WHAT FEATURES DO THE COMMUNITY ADDITION SHIP WITH. ACTUALLY, IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME AS OUR PROFESSIONAL EDITION. IT JUST HAS DIFFERENT LICENSING RESTRICTIONS ON IT. ANY OF THE FEATURES IN OUR PROFESSIONAL EDITION ARE ALSO AVAILABLE IN THE COMMUNITY EDITION. THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY THOUSANDS AND,000S AND THOUSANDS OF FEATURES. I CAN'T NAME ALL OF THEM. THAT'S COOL. LET'S START WITH SOME OF THE STREAMLINING THAT HAPPENED. YOU BOTH MENTIONED THERE WAS SOME STREAMLINING THAT HAPPENED WITH VISUAL STUDIO. CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE MORE IN DEPTH ABOUT THAT. I INSTALLED THE RC LAST WEEK. THERE WAS SOME SNAPPINESS TO IT. HOW DID WE MAKE IT FASTER. JUST TO START WITH VISUAL STUDIO FOR MAC, WE'VE STARTED TO TAKE CODE FROM VISUAL STUDIO OVER TO VISUAL STUDIO FOR MAC, AND LUCKILY LIKE OUR EDITOR IS WHERE WE'VE BEEN PUTTING A LOT OF THE WORK. IT'S WRITTEN IN C-SHARP. MICROSOFT ALREADY HAD AN EDITOR WRITTEN IN C-SHARP. WE HAVE 95% OF THE CODE FOR OUR NEW EDITOR COMING FROM THE WINDOWS IMPLEMENTATION. BUT IT'S ALSO SNAPPY BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO MOVE TO A NATIVE FRONT END AND SO WE GET, LIKE, NATIVE SCROLLING AND BETTER SUPPORT FOR RIGHT TO LEFT RENDERING, WORD WRAP. A LOT OF FEATURES WE WEREN'T ABLE TO DO IN OUR PREVIOUS EDITOR WE'RE ABLE TO BUILD ON WITH, LIKE I SAID, STREAMLINING IS WHERE IT'S AT, WE'RE EYEING THE FUTURE OF THE ROADMAP. MORE FEATURES THAT WE CAN BRING OFFER FROM VISUAL STUDIO AND DEVELOP FEATURES IN CONJUNCTION WITH VISUAL STUDIO. AMANDA MENTIONED EARLIER GET TO CODE. WE'RE SUPER EXCITED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THAT'S A FEATURE YOU'RE ABLE TO BRING BOTH AT THE SAME TIME WITH LAUNCH TODAY. WHAT DOES GET TO CODE MEAN?  SO GET TO CODE IS BASICALLY THE IDEA THAT WE WANT YOU TO GET INTO YOUR CODING ENVIRONMENT AND BECOME PRODUCTIVE IN THE ZONE WHILE YOU'RE PROGRAMMING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. RIGHT.  SO, YOU KNOW, VISUAL STUDIO ORIGINALLY WAS DESIGNED IN AN ERA WHERE EVERYTHING WAS INSTALLED ON A BUNCH OF DISKS YOU WOULD BUY OFF OF A SHELF AT SOME LARGE, YOU KNOW, BIG BOX, YOU KNOW, DIGITAL STORE AND THEN YOU'D INSTALL ALL OF IT, INCLUDING HELP AND ALL OF THE TEMPLATES AND THAT KIND OF STUFF. NOWADAYS, A LOT OF DEVELOPERS EITHER START WITH HOSTED REPOSITORIES HOSTED ON A PRIVATE SERVER OR HOSTED IN A PUBLIC REPOSITORY. IF THAT'S REALLY WHERE PEOPLE ARE STARTING, WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IS REALLY A SUPER PRODUCTIVE EXPERIENCE INSIDE OF VISUAL STUDIO 2019. SO IF YOU OPEN UP VISUAL STUDIO 2019, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE KIND OF A STREAMLINED START EXPERIENCE, WHERE THE OPTIONS ARE START FROM AN ONLINE REPO, START FROM A TEMPLATE, CREATE NEW PROJECT, START FROM AN OPEN PROJECT OR ANYTHING YOU'VE OPENED RECENTLY AND SO ON SO YOU CAN REALLY GET INTO THE ZONE OF CODING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. HONESTLY, THAT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE FEATURES WHERE I STARTED UP AND IT ACTUALLY STARTS UP. BECAUSE USUALLY, LIKE, IT TOOK A LONG TIME -- LOOK, I'M BEING HONEST HERE. WE'RE ALL FRIENDS HERE. NOW IT'S, LIKE, REALLY SNAPPY. I GET TO, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO WORK ON?  YEP. I THINK THAT'S REALLY THE GOAL. WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY WHO IS NEW TO THE PRODUCT BUT ALSO THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN USING THE PRODUCT FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS CAN BASICALLY GET INTO THE ZONE CODING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.  NOW, JOSEPH MENTIONED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE STREAMLINING THAT HAPPENED IN VISUAL STUDIO FOR MAC. CAN YOU DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT SOME OF THE STREAMLINING THAT WENT ON IN VISUAL STUDIO FOR WINDOWS?  WELL, I MEAN IN SOME WAYS -- JOSEPH WAS TALKING A LOT ABOUT THE INSTALLER AND THINGS LIKE THAT. WE HAVE DEFINITELY IMPROVED THE INSTALL EXPERIENCE, THE UPDATE EXPERIENCE AND THINGS LIKE THAT IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019 A LOT, BUT SOME OF THE WAYS THAT IT'S BEEN STREAMLINED ARE ACTUALLY KIND OF UI CHANGES. SO IF YOU START UP VISUAL STUDIO 2019, YOU MIGHT NOTICE THAT THERE IS A SLIGHT COLOR THEME CHANGE FROM VISUAL STUDIO 2017. IF YOU PUT THEM SIDE BY SIDE, YOU'LL ACTUALLY -- I FIND THAT VISUAL STUDIO 2019 FEELS JUST CLEANER AND YOU'RE NOT REALLY QUITE SURE WHY, BUT WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK TO ACTUALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE, YOU KNOW, CUT, YOU KNOW, REPETITIVE TEXT AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO THAT YOU CAN REALLY BE FOCUSED ON YOUR CODE. WE'VE ALSO KIND OF STREAMLINED THE MENUING SYSTEM SO THAT IT ACTUALLY OCCUPIES ONE LESS ROW, SO THAT YOU HAVE ONE MORE ROW OF CODE THAT YOU CAN FOCUS ON. AND THEN I THINK THE OTHER THING IS, YOU KNOW, WITH THE ENHANCED KIND OF SEARCH EXPERIENCE, YOU NOW DON'T NEED TO AS OFTEN HUNT AND PECK THROUGH THE MENUING SYSTEM TO FIND THE THING THAT YOU NEED. WHAT I FIND USING VISUAL STUDIO 2019, IF I WANT TO USE A CERTAIN FEATURE OR, YOU KNOW, INSTALL A COMPONENT THAT I HADN'T INSTALLED PREVIOUSLY, I CAN ACTUALLY GO TO THE SEARCH MENU, TYPE FOR WHATEVER I'M LOOKING UP FOR. IT WILL COME UP THERE AND THEN KIND OF STREAMLINE MY EXPERIENCE EXACTLY TO THE MENU THAT I NEED.  AWESOME. JOSEPH, YOU HAD SOMETHING?  I WAS GOING TO ADD TO THAT. ON XAMERIN, WE REALLY IMPROVED THE LOAD TIME AND SOLUTION CREATION TIME. SO, YOU KNOW, THAT'S A SNAPPY --  I DIDN'T EVEN TOUCH ON THAT. PERFORMANCE IS ABSOLUTELY HUGE. I TALKED ABOUT THE C++ DEBUGGER BEING OUT OF PROC. AND THE IMPACT THAT HAS. WE'VE ALSO DOESN'T AMAZING THINGS IN SOLUTION LOAD TIME, PRODUCT LOAD TIME AND UNIT TEST DISCOVERY. GETTING STARTED IN ANY TYPICAL PROJECT IS, YOU KNOW, TENS OF PERCENTAGE POINTS BETTER. THAT'S AWESOME. I PERSONALLY NOTICED IT. LIKE I SAID, I USUALLY -- I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF WORK IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE WITH PYTHON. THEY WERE LIKE, HEY, YOU GOT TO DO THIS AI THING. YOU CAN DO PYTHON IN VISUAL STUDIO. OH, CAN YOU? IT'S SURPRISING. IT FELT LIKE I WAS BACK IN MY C-SHARP DAYS BUT IT WAS PYTHON. WHICH WAS REALLY COOL. FROM FRANK ALL THE WAY FROM NIGERIA. WHERE THERE BE AN OFFLINE ISO INSTALLER FOR COMMUNITY USERS TO HELP DEVELOPERS WHO DON'T HAVE STABLE INTERNET CONNECTION THERE?  YEAH, SO WE ACTUALLY HAVEN'T BEEN DOING AN ISO INSTALLER. WHAT WE HAVE IS A LAYOUT OPTION SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY CREATE YOUR OWN OFFLINE INSTALLER AND ACCESS IT THAT WAY. YOU CAN CERTAINLY USE AZURE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO CREATE THAT LAYOUT AND THEN INSTALL IT FROM THERE. COOL. ALL RIGHT. SO FROM KEN WE HAVE, CAN A SINGLE DEVELOPER RELEASE A COMMUNITY APP. ARE THERE RESTRICTIONS? CAN YOU PLEASE ELABORATE. SO THE COMMUNITY EDITION IS BASICALLY FOR TEAMS THAT ARE SMALLER THAN FIVE. SO THAT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT IS SUPPORTED WITH COMMUNITY. AWESOME. HERE IS ANOTHER ONE FROM SHANNON. WILL THERE BE AN VU IF ISSUE IF TEAM USES VS-2017. MEANING IS THE SOLUTION DIFFERENT?  TO THE SOLUTION GENERALLY SHOULD NOT BE DIFFERENT. YOU SHOULD ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO COLLABORATE ON THEM. FOR THE MOST PART WHAT WE SUGGEST IS THAT YOU HAVE BASICALLY A TEAM THAT IS LOOKING AT MIGRATING YOUR SOLUTION TO 2019. AN INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPER CAN KIND OF GO AND SURVEY THE NEW RELEASE, AND THEY CAN DO IT SIDE BY SIDE ON THE SAME BOX WITHOUT ACTUALLY IMPACTING THE REST OF THEIR THEIR SOURCE CODE AND EVALUATE IT AND MIGRANT MIGRATE THE TEAM.  THAT'S RIGHT. YOU CAN INTEL 2017 RIGHT NEXT TO 2019. IN FACT, I DO USE SOME SOMETIMES AND SOME -- AND WHEN THE OTHER -- THE OTHER TIMES. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE REALLY WORKED ON IN THE LAST VERSION AND STREAMLINING THE UPGRADE EXPERIENCE FROM 2017 TO 2019. SO WHERE IN 2017 YOU WOULD HAVE TO KIND OF PICK THE WORKLOADS, WHAT PROJECT TYPES YOU WANTED TO WORK ON, IF YOU'VE ALREADY DONE THAT IN 2017. THEN YOUR UPDATE EXPERIENCE TO 2019 SHOULD BE SUPER, SUPER EASY BECAUSE WE'VE BASICALLY MOOIGRAD ALL OF YOUR SETTINGS TO THE 2019 INSTALLER.  NOW HERE'S A FUN QUESTION. WAS THERE ANY BIG FEATURES THAT YOU WANTED TO INCLUDE BUT DIDN'T MAKE THE CUT? NOW, IT FEELS LIKE RECENTLY VISUAL STUDIO WE'VE BEEN PUTTING OUT STUFF SUPER EARLY. IT'S NOT LIKE IT USED TO BE, YOU KNOW, WE'D WAIT TWO YEARS AND THEN IT WOULD COME IN THIS HUGE BOX. TELL US A LITTLE BIT HOW YOU PLAN AND WHAT GOES INTO RELEASES.  DO YOU WANT TO TAKE THAT ONE, JOSEPH?  IT SPEAKS RIGHT TO THE HEART OF THE VS FOR MAC RELEASE. WE LISTEN TO FEEDBACK FROM USERS AND TEST FEATURES AS WE'RE THE REALLY BIG PUSH WE HAVE FOR VS FOR MAC 2019 IS TO SWITCH THE EDITOR TO THE EDITOR I WAS DESCRIBING EARLIER. THAT'S A PREVIEW TODAY IN VS FOR MAC 2019. YOU CAN GO INTO YOUR PREFERENCES AND SELECT THE NEW EDITOR. IT'S A GREAT EXPERIENCE AND I RECOMMEND YOU DO IT. RIGHT NOW IT IS IN C-SHARP. HE HELD IT BACK FROM TURNING IT ON FOR DEFAULT BECAUSE IT WASN'T THE BEST CALL FOR USERS. AS THAT COMES ONLINE, WE'LL HAVE IT IN DEFAULT VERY SOON, FOLLOWED BY ADDITIONAL LANGUAGES, JAVA SCRIPT, RAZOR, BLAZER, ET CETERA.  AWESOME.  YEAH, I MEAN, SO I, YOU KNOW, ESPECIALLY WITH YOUR UPDATE CADENCE WHERE WE NOW HAVE PREVIEW RELEASES COMING OUT SUPER REGULARLY AND WE HAVE UPDATES COMING OUT EVERY FEW WEEKS OR SO, I DON'T -- I NEVER FEEL TERRIBLE ABOUT ACTUALLY NOT GETTING A PARTICULAR FEATURE INTO VISUAL STUDIO BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IT'S COMING DOWN THE ROAD SUPER QUICKLY. THERE ARE A COUPLE THAT ARE IN BASICALLY, LIKE, PREVIEW AT THIS POINT THAT WILL MAKE IT INTO AN UPDATE SHORTLY. ONE THAT COMES TO MIND IS TIME TRAVEL DEBUGGING. ANOTHER ONE IS THE INTELICODE KIND OF BEING IN THE BOX. THE OTHER ONE IS THE PR EXPERIENCE. ALL OF THOSE THINGS WILL BE COMING UP IN FUTURE UPDATES. AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S REALLY CHANGED OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IN TERMS OF HOW WE MANAGE VISUAL STUDIO AND KIND OF TALK ABOUT IT WITH THE COMMUNITY IS WE'RE ACTUALLY PRETTY TRANSPARENT ABOUT WHAT OUR ROADMAP LOOKS LIKE. YOU CAN ACTUALLY LOOK FOR VISUAL STUDIO ROADMAP AND SEE ALL THE FEATURES COMING DOWN THE PIKE. THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT IT USED TO BE BECAUSE I REMEMBER WE USED TO BE, OH, WOW, IT'S OUT. I HAVE TALKED TO, FOR EXAMPLE, JUST WITH LANGUAGES. I HAVE TALKED TO HIM YEARS IN ADVANCE BEFORE SOME -- LIKE C-SHARP AIDS COMING OUT. I TALKED TO HIM A YEAR AND A HALF AGO ABOUT THE FEATURES THEY WERE THINKING ABOUT, WHICH IS PRETTY COOL. I'D LIKE TO MOVE ON TO INTELICODE. THIS IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION WE'RE GOING TO TABLE FOR JUST A SECOND WHILE YOU TALK ABOUT INTELICODE. WHAT IS IT? MAYBE THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS THAT PEOPLE HAVE. FOR EXAMPLE, HE'S WORRIED IF INTELICODE SUGGESTS CODE ACCORDING TO WHAT CODE MOST PEOPLE USE, COULDN'T THAT INVOLVE BAD PRACTICES FOR MOST PEOPLE USING OLD AND INEFFICIENT PRACTICES?  YEAH, SO INTELICODE IS THE FIRST STEPS IN A LONG ROAD TOWARDS ALLOWING MACHINE LEARNING TO ENHANCE YOUR DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE. SO THE FIRST THING THAT WE DID IS WE ACTUALLY TRAINED IT ON PUBLIC REPOS THAT WERE HIGHLY RATED. SO WE ASSUMED THAT IF THEY WERE HIGHLY RATED, THAT PROBABLY MEANT THAT THEY WERE DECENT CODE. WHAT WE'VE NOW ADDED IS THE ABILITY TO TRAIN YOUR INTELICODE TRAIN LEARNING MODELS ON YOUR OWN CUSTOM CODE, EVEN PRIVATE CODE, THAT IS UNIQUE TO YOUR TEAM. YOU ACTUALLY CAN SUSPECT WHICH REPOS YOU USE TO TRAIN THOSE MODELS.  YEAH, SO IT'S BASICALLY YOU GET TO CHOOSE WHAT MODELS YOU DO. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. NOT ONLY THAT, ONCE YOU DO THAT, ONCE YOU CHOOSE TO TRAIN ON A MODEL, WHICH MIGHT TAKE A COUPLE OF MINUTES TO ACTUALLY GET THE MODEL BACK BECAUSE IT HAS TO GO AND CALCULATE IT IN THE CLOUD, CREATE THE LEARNING MODELS. YOU CAN SHARE THATLE MODEL WITH YOUR OTHER TEAMMATES. LET'S SAY YOU'RE A DEVELOPER IN A LARGE ENTERPRISE WITH LOTS OF DEVELOPERS ON IT AND YOU BUILD A COMMON FRAMEWORK FOR YOUR TEAM, YOU CAN ACTUALLY TRAIN THE INTEL IT'S INTELICODE MODEL AND SHARE THAT LIKE YOU WOULD SHARE ANY LIBRARY OR SOURCE REPO WITH THE OTHER DEVELOPERS ON YOUR TEAM. THEY DON'T EVEN NEED TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF TRAINING IT ON THAT CUSTOM LIBRARY. YOU'VE DONE THAT. YOU'VE CURATED THAT. YOU CAN MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE EXPERIENCE ON THAT LIBRARY. I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION, RIGHT? HE BRINGS UP A GOOD POINT. WHAT IF IT'S NOT ACCORDING TO THE POINT WE WANT TO DO IT. THAT'S THE WAY I READ IT. YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE YOUR OWN CODE AND TRAIN IT ON THAT AND HAVE YOUR OWN STYLE AS A COMPANY IN THE MODEL. RIGHT. OKAY. A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS. THERE IS ONE NEW COMING IN HERE. THIS ONE IS A FUNNY ONE. HOW FAST CAN I INSTALL VISUAL STUDIO 2019?  SO THE ABSOLUTE MINIMUM INSTALLER FOR VISUAL STUDIO 2019 SHOULD TAKE ABOUT 2 1/2 MINUTES. BUT, OF COURSE, THAT COMES WITH NO WORKLOADS, SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET WITH THAT IS BASICALLY LIKE A LIGHTWEIGHT EDITING EXPERIENCE WITH LIGHTWEIGHT LANGUAGE SERVICES. SO, YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT GET SOME GRAMMAR AND SYNTAX CHECKING, BUT NOT REALLY KIND OF SEMANTIC ANALYSIS.  IT'S PRETTY FAST. I MEAN, LIKE, I DOWNLOADED A COUPLE OF WORK LLOADS. I ALWAYS CHECK ALL THE THINGS WHICH I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T DO. IT TAKES TIME. BUT YOU HAVE CHOICE IN WHAT YOU PUT ON. YEAH, THAT'S FOR SURE. WE'VE DEFINITELY BEEN WORKING TO MAKE SURE OUR INSTALLERS FOR VARIOUS WORKLOTSADS ARE A LOT ME LIGHTWEIGHT. INSTALL TIMES HAVE DROPPED SO SIGNIFICANTLY. MINIMAL, TWO MINUTES, FOR SURE. FOR YOUR WORKLOADS, YOU'RE GOING TO BE PLEASED.  WE LEARNED HOW TO ZIP, OF COURSE. IS A NEW VISUAL EDITOR 2019 ADA COMPLIANTIER. WECOMPLIANT.  YES, SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON TO IMPROVE IT. 2017 I BELIEVE WAS ADA COMPLIANT, BUT WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT AND IMPROVE THAT.  OKAY. AWESOME. SO WHAT OTHER FEATURES DID YOU -- WE TALKED ABOUT SPEED. WE TALKED ABOUT -- WE TALKED ABOUT INTELICODE A LITTLE BIT. IS THERE ANOTHER FEATURE THAT YOU FEEL PEOPLE SHOULD REALLY LOOK AT IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019? FOR BOTH OF YOU.  I SURE LEFT IN TO FILL SOME AUDIO SPACE. I'M STALLING FOR AMANDA, BECAUSE I KNOW SHE'S GOING TO HAVE A GREAT ONE. NO, I MEAN, I THINK SOME OF THE STUFF WE'VE DONE, LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, WE'VE INTRODUCED DEBUG SEARCH. SO BASICALLY IF YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A DEBUGGING SESSION, YOU CAN ACTUALLY GO AND SEARCH FOR DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ALL OF THE VARIABLES THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET VALUES FOR. SO YOU CAN BASICALLY KIND OF SEARCH ON POSSIBLE EXPRESSIONS THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO EVALUATE IN THE DEBUG SESSION. WE HAVE A LOT OF NEW, LIKE, REFACTORING FEATURES, SO ONE OF THE BIG CAPABILITIES THAT WE'VE INTRODUCED IS CODE CLEANUP. SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY KIND OF GO AND, YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAVE STYLE GUIDELINES WITHIN EDITOR CONFIG, WHICH CAN BE INFERRED USING INTELICODE, YOU CAN GO AND HIT A HOT KEY, CONTROL-D FOR MOST PEOPLE AND IT WILL CLEAN UP THAT ENTIRE FILE. SO THERE ARE TONS OF GOODIES LIKE THAT. TO AZURE ABOUT DOCKERS OR CONTAINERS. SURE THAT THEY'RE SUPER EASY TO AUTHOR WITH VISUAL STUDIO 2019. THAT'S COOL. WE CAN WRITE ALL THE CODE WE WANT, BUT IF IT FALLS IN THE FOREST AND THERE'S NO ONE AROUND, DOES IT EVEN MAKE A SOUND? WE GOT TO PUT IT IN THE CLOUD, RIGHT? A QUESTION FOR YOU. WHEN WILL THE PYTHON TOOLS AND WINDOWS VERSION LAND IN THE MAC VERSION?  NO ETA YET. WE'RE LISTENING TO FEEDBACK. WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO ADD NEW LANGUAGES AND WE'RE DOING THAT ALL THE TIME, BUT, YOU, PYTHON IS NOT ON THE IMMEDITE DELIVERY. BUT REACH OUT TO ME AND I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR HOW YOU WANT TO USE PYTHON. IF ENOUGH PEOPLE YELL AT JOSEPH -- IT MAKES IT HAPPEN.  I'M JUST SAYING. WE HAD DONUTS HERE THIS MORNING BECAUSE WE ALL YELLED AT JOSEF. FROM EVAN, HOW DO I GET THE NEW COLORATION IN VS 2019 IF THE INSTALLER IS AUTOMATICALLY IMPORTING MY COLOR CONFIGURATION. THIS QUESTION IS AMBIGUOUS. I WILL ANSWER IT TWO WAYS ASSUMING IT'S TWO DIFFERENT QUESTIONS. I SPOKE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE THEMING UPDATES IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019. IF YOU'RE USING THE DEFAULT LIGHT THEME, YOU'LL AUTOMATICALLY GET THE DEFAULT LIGHT THEME. YOU CAN ALWAYS GO BACK AND RESET YOUR SETTINGS FOR THE THEME AND SET IT TO THE DEFAULT THEME AND YOU'LL GET THE NEW COLOR OPTIONS. THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY IMPACT YOUR TEXT EDITOR OPTIONS BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE YOUR OWN CUSTOM SETTINGS FOR WHAT YOU WANT YOUR EDITOR TO LOOK LIKE THEN THAT WILL OVERRIDE WHAT OUR THEME -- OUR DEFAULT THEMING DOES, AND SO FOR THAT YOU'D HAVE TO GO INTO TOOLS OPTIONS AND BASICALLY RESET. RESET.  YEAH. SO WE CARE MORE ABOUT WHAT THEY SET IN THERE AS OPPOSED TO WHAT WE WANT?  YEAH, BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE VERY PARTICULAR PREFERENCES.  IT'S TRUE. I SAW SOMEBODY -- I THINK THIS WAS AN APRIL FOOL'S JOKE, BUT I SAW SOMEBODY TALKING ABOUT YESTERDAY THE HOTDOG THEME THEY'D LIKE TO SET ON THEIR COLLEAGUES. BASICALLY IT'S A RED BACKGROUND WITH YELLOW TEXT. IF SOMEBODY STEPS OUT WITHOUT WALKING THEIR MACHINE, THEY DO THAT TO THEM.  THAT WOULD BE -- I WOULD SPILL MY DRINK. I'M JUST SAYING. FROM SANDER, IS THERE AN OPTION TO SHOW THE CURRENT SOLUTION IN THE TITLE BAR? I BELIEVE WE HAD IT BEFORE. YEAH. SO THERE ACTUALLY IS AN OPTION TO GO INTO TOOLS, OPTION AND RESET THE TITLE BAR BACK. OH. SO JUST A LOT OF RESETTING IF YOU WANT TO GO IN THERE. WILL LIVE UNIT TEST BEG AVAILABLE IN THE PROFESSIONAL VERSION?  NO, LIVE TESTING IS A VERSION THAT IS EXCLUSIVE TO VISUAL STUDIO ENTERPRISE. NEXT QUESTION. ARE YOU PLANNING ON WORKING TO IMPROVE THE DEBUGGING EXPERIENCE FOR MICROSOFT DYNAMIC CRM? THIS IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION. WHEN PEOPLE ASK THIS, I FEEL LIKE THERE ARE TEN OF US HERE AT MICROSOFT AND WE'RE ALL, LIKE, TALKING TO EACH OTHER. WHY DON'T YOU DESCRIBE WHAT IT TAKES TO BUILD SOMETHING LIKE THIS. EVERYONE'S GOING TO HAVE A QUESTION, ARE YOU PLANNING TO WORK ON FU FOR VISUAL STUDIO. DESCRIBE THIS PROCESS. SURE. THE DYNAMIC CRM. THIS IS KIND OF A LITTLE BIT OF INSIDER BASEBALL, BUT THE TEAM IS OBVIOUSLY A DIFFERENT TEAM THAN THE VISUAL STUDIO TEAM. WHILE WE COLLABORATE WITH EACH OTHER, WE'RE NOT SITTING IN THE SAME ROOM. WE'RE NOT SITTING IN THE SAME BUILDING. SOMETIMES WE'RE PRETTY FAR AWAY FROM EACH OTHER. WE MIGHT TALK, YOU KNOW, EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN, WE'RE NOT TALKING ALL THE TIME. THE DYNAMIC CRM DEVELOPMENT EXPERIENCE THAT'S IN DYNAMIC CRM IS PART OF THE DYNAMIC CRM PRODUCT NOT THE VISUAL STUDIO PRODUCT. THEY HAVE SOME EXPENSES FOR VISUAL STUDIO. YOU KNOW, ALL THE DEBUGGING IMPROVEMENTS IN C-SHARP THAT WOULD SHOW UP THERE, SHOW UP IN VISUAL STUDIO, WOULD SHOW UP FOR DYNAMIC. HAVING SAID THAT, THOUGH, TELL US WHAT YOU WANT. YEAH, OF COURSE. IF SOMEONE COMES AND IS LIKE, HEY, WE REALLY WANT THIS PRODUCT TO BE SUPER GOOD IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019, WE WILL GO TALK TO WHOMEVER ABOUT WHATEVER. YOU SAW THAT IN THE KEYNOTE. IT'S ALSO SUPER IMPORTANT IF THAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU YOU'RE ALSO GIVING THAT FEEDBACK TO THE DYNAMICS TEAM. AWESOME. I MOVED THIS ONE AWAY. FOR YOU, WHAT'S THE MAIN IMPROVEMENT OF VISUAL STUDIO 2019? I KNOW WE KIND OF HARP ON IT, BUT IF YOU COULD CONDENSE IT DOWN TO ONE THING, WHAT WOULD IT BE FOR YOU?  I THINK THE THING THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE GOING TO NOTICE IS THAT STREAMLINING THEME, YOU KNOW? AND I THAT I WOULD INCLUDE PERFORMANCE, WUUI IMPROVEMENTS, THE SEARCH EXPERIENCE, THINGS LIKE THAT THAT WILL JUST BASICALLY MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE SAILING THROUGH CODE.  THAT'S AWESOME. JOSEPH?  IT'S SNAPPIER. YOU'RE GETTING TO CODE QUICKER. GET TO CODE, THAT'S THE MOST IMPROVED THING. IMPROVED GET SUPPORT AND, YEAH, YOU'LL DEFINITELY FEEL IT'S, YOU KNOW, IT'S A NEW -- IT'S A NEW IDEA.  IT'S NEW. SHININESS. NEW IS NICE. I LOVE IT.  SO WHAT WE'VE REALLY BEEN WORKING ON WITH THE ECOSYSTEM IN THE 2019 ERA, AS WE'VE BEEN DEVELOPING IT, IS BASICALLY GETTING MORE THINGS OUT OF -- OUT OF PROCESS AND ASYNCHRO ASY.  AWESOME. FROM ARWIN, HE INSTALLED THE ABSOLUTE MINIMUM, WHICH IS 2.5 MINUTES. I THINK THAT'S WHAT I SAID. COMMUNITY VALIDATION THIS IS ACTUALLY THE RIGHT THING. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE YOU KNEW THAT. DOES VS 2019 HAVE AN ARM TEMPLATE VALIDATION IMPROVED INTELLIGENCE. I'M ASSUMING THEY MEAN AZURE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. YEAH, THAT'S ACTUALLY A HIGHLY REQUESTED FEATURE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT FOR THE NEXT, YOU KNOW -- NEXT SEMESTER, BASICALLY. COOL. SO HERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT -- BECAUSE THEY'RE SO EXCITED. ACTUALLY, THIS -- THERE IS AN ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION. ANY IDEA ABOUT WHEN WILL THE INTELICODE BE AVAILABLE FOR VS CORRODE FOR C-SHARP?  SO THE INTELICODE ITSELF IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR VISUAL STUDIO CODE. AND IT'S ACTUALLY THE SAME EXTENSION FOR ANY PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE THAT YOU'RE PROGRAMMING IN. SO IF YOU'RE DOING PYTHON OR C-SHARP OR TYPE SCRIPTS DOWN THE ROAD, IT WILL JUST AUTOMATICALLY PICK UP WHICH PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE YOU'RE PROGRAMMING IN AND KIND OF THE COMPLETION LISTS WILL START TO SHOW UP. COOL. IT'S SO SUBTLE THAT YOU MAY NOT EVEN KNOW -- JUST LOOK FOR THE LITTLE STAR. YEAH. RIGHT? SOMETIMES I MISS IT. OH, YEAH, THAT'S THE ONE I WANT.  THAT WAS A BIG DEBATE. WE WERE TRYING TO DECIDE IF WE SHOULD ACTUALLY DISTINGUISH THE INTELICODE RECOMMENDATIONS OR JUST CHANGE THE REORDERING. IN THE END WE DECIDED TO INCLUDE THE STAR SO YOU KNOW WHAT'S COMING FROM THERE. OTHERWISE I THINK YOU PROBABLY MORE PRODUCTIVE, BUT YOU FEEL - WOULDN'T REALLY KNOW WHY. NOT ONLY THAT. WHEN IT COMES TO AI THINGS, WE NEED TO BE PRETTY UP FRONT IT'S BEING GENERATED BY AI. I AGREE.  WHAT CHANGES HAVE YOU MADE FOR DEPLOYING TO DOCKER? YOU MENTIONED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. WE'VE ACTUALLY IMPROVED A LOT OF THE ASP.NET PUBLISH EXPERIENCE THAT YOU CAN GO AND DEPLOY DIRECTLY TO A DOCKER CONTAINER. WE'VE MADE IT EASIER TO DISCOVER A DOCKER CONTAINER THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO ATTACH TO. THINGS LIKE THAT.  THAT'S AWESOME. NEXT QUESTION. IS THERE A INTEGRATED -- LIKE CODE. GREAT FEATURE, WOULD LOVE TO HAVE IT IN VS. I THINK HE MEANS AN INTEGRATED TERMINAL EXPERIENCE. YEAH. SO ONE OF THE THINGS -- ACTUALLY, THIS CAME FROM LIVESHARE. WHEN WE FOUND THAT PEOPLE WERE COLLABORATING, A LOT OF TIMES THE ISSUE, LIKE, THE BUG REPROS ON YOUR TIME BUT NOT ON MY MA SHINE ARE ACTUALLY DUE TO ENVIRONMENT, SETUP AND CONFIGURATION. THE ONLY WAY TO FIGURE THAT OUT IS TO GET TERMINAL ACCESS TO THE OTHER PERSON'S MACHINE. WEE VA LIVESHARE, WE INCREASED THE PROSECUTOR OF INTRODUCING AN INTEGRATED TERMINAL IN 2019 FOR THE PURPOSES OF LIVESHARE. SO NOW IT IS THERE. THAT WAS A GOOD ANSWER. ABSOLUTELY. HOW HAS VS 2019 IMPROVED OVER VS 2017 IN PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS FOR LOW CONFIGURATION DEVICES. MAYBE THEY MEAN NOT SO POWERFUL MACHINES. YEAH, THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION, KIND OF THOSE DIMENSIONS SUPER RECENTLY, SO I DON'T KNOW -- I CAN'T JUST CITE THAT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD.  I COULDN'T SPEAK SPECIFICS, BUT JUST TO POINT ON THE MAC, I RUN A 2013 MACBOOK BECAUSE THE KEYBOARD WORKS GREAT. AT LEAST ON THAT SIDE, OUR IMPROVEMENTS ARE WORKING GREAT ON OLDER HARDWARE. VERY VISIBLE. THAT'S GREAT. WE HAVE ABOUT TWO MINUTES LEFT. IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THAT COME IN, I'LL MAKE SURE TO GRAB THEM. WHAT'S THE TAKEAWAY FOR PEOPLE? WHAT DO YOU WANT THEM TO DO? WHAT DO YOU WANT THEM TO TELL US ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE? BECAUSE, LIKE, I'M A PROGRAMMER. USUALLY I'VE LEARNED OVER THE MANY YEARS THAT IF A CUSTOMER SAYS, YEAH, BUT CAN IT ALSO -- IT MEANS THAT I DID THE RIGHT THING. YEAH. SO I THINK THE BIG THING IS GO INSTALL VISUAL STUDIO 2019. IT'S SAFE TO INSTALL ON YOUR MACHINE RIGHT NEXT TO 2017. YOU CAN OPEN UP YOUR PROJECTS AND START WORKING ON THEM. AND I THINK IF YOU'RE ENCOUNTERING ANY KIND OF ISSUES OR HAVE ANY KIND OF FEEDBACK, YOU CAN ALWAYS GO UP INTO THE RIGHT-HAND CORNER WITH THAT LITTLE MESSAGE BOX AND BASICALLY SEND US A MESSAGE OF FEEDBACK TO OUR DEV COMMUNITY.  AND WE LOOK AT THOSE. IT'S NOT LIKE A -- WE LOOK AT EVERY SINGLE ONE.  YEAH. I MEAN, I KNOW THAT ONE OF YOUR -- BECAUSE I WORK IN THE CLOUD ADVOCACY GROUP. ONE OF OUR PEOPLE PUT IT IN AND GOT AN EMAIL. EVERY TIME I DO STUFF AT MICROSOFT, I GET AN EMAIL FROM SOMEONE, HEY, HOW WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE? THEY DON'T KNOW WHO I AM. WE USE SOFTWARE TO ACTUALLY --- DETECT DUPLICATES AND THINGS LIKE THAT, AND SO IF WE FIND THAT IT IS A DUPLICATE, WE MAY RESOLVE IT AND SAY, HEY, THIS IS A DUPLICATE, BUT IT IT'S A SUGGESTION OR A FEATURE REQUEST, YOU KNOW, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR AN ISSUE THAT YOU'RE ENCOUNTERING, THAT WILL DEFINITELY BE LOOKED AT BY A PERSON ON YOUR TEAM. AWESOME. WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. IT IS TIME NOW FOR US TO CHECK IN WITH JEFF. JEFF, ARE YOU THERE, BUDDY? HE'S -- OH, WE'RE NOT CHECKING IN WITH JEFF. OKAY. THAT'S OKAY. HE'S RUNNING -- I SAW HIM GRAB HIS HAT AND RUN OVER THERE. I THINK HIS BEARD TURNED WHITE AFTER THAT. PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. WE HAVE HERE TO MY LEFT KENDRA HAVENS' GOING TO BE TALKING ALL ABOUT WRITING BEAUTIFUL CODE FASTER. HOW ARE YOU, KENDRA?  I'M DOING FANTASTIC. HOW ARE YOU, SETH. GREAT, THANK YOU. FOR THOSE WATCHING, SEND IN YOUR QUESTIONS BECAUSE WE'LL HAVE A LITTLE RAP AT THE END. WELCOME TO WRITE BEAUTIFUL CODE FASTER WITH KEVIN RA KENDRA HAVENS. THAT'S THE TITLE THEY MADE ME USE. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT ALL THE DOTNET IMPROVEMENT IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019. A TON START OFF WITH UX AND SHELL. FIRST OFF, YOU MIGHT NOT BE TOTALLY READY TO MAKE THE JUMP SWITCH TO 2019, AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY OKAY BECAUSE WITH THE VISUAL STUDIO INSTALLER YOU CAN HAVE MULTIPLE VERSIONS OF VISUAL STUDIO 2017 RIGHT NEXT TO 2019, BOTH INSTALLED ON YOUR MACHINE. YOU CAN SWITCH BACK TO 2017. IF YOU RUN INTO ANY ISSUES AND USE 2019 FOR ALL OF THE PROJECTS THAT, YEAH, THAT YOU ABSOLUTELY CAN. OKAY. SO AS SOON AS I OPEN IT UP, YOU MIGHT SEE -- NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE. I'M IN THE BLUE THEME. IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE PURPLY, AS I LIKE TO DESCRIBE IT. AMANDA WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE UI CHANGES YOU MIGHT SEE. ONE OF THE BIGGEST, MOST USEFUL PRODUCTIVITY TIPS I WANT TO CALL OUT IS CONTROL-Q SEARCH. SO WE HAVE THIS IN 2017. IT WAS ACTUALLY OFF TO THE RIGHT JUST A LITTLE BIT. WE'VE CENTERED IT SO IT'S -- AND WE'VE INDEXED WAY, WAY MORE IN IF IT AND WE'VE ENABLED THIS FUDGY -- FUZZY SEARCHING. SO LET'S SAY I'M TRYING TO OPEN UP THE START WINDOW AND I CAN MISSPELL IT AS STAR WIDOW, AND I CAN ACTUALLY STILL GO AHEAD AND LAUNCH IT. JUST TALKING ABOUT GETTING TO CODE REALLY QUICKLY. SO WE HAVE KIND OF SIMPLIFIED THE EXPERIENCE AND YOU CAN STILL SEE ALL OF YOUR MOST RECENT FILES, AND THAT'S WHAT I DEFINITELY USE THE MOST. MORE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO IS, LIKE, ADDING ITEMS FROM CONTROL "Q," AS WELL AS ALWAYS LOOKING UP DIFFERENT CODE STYLE OPTIONS THAT THE YOU MAY HAVE. SO I'LL BE USING THIS A TON THROUGHOUT THE REST OF MY DEMOS. SO A MAJOR THING THAT WE WANTED TO -- SPEAKING OF IT -- SPEAKING OF GETTING TO CODE FAST IS WE HAVE ENABLED A WAY TO LOAD SOLUTION FILTERS. SO LET'S SAY YOU'RE WORKING ON A PROJECT, YOU'RE WORKING ON A SUBSET OF CODE, YOU DON'T WANT TO LOAD THE ENTIRE SOLUTION, ONLY A FEW PROJECTS. YOU CAN ACTUALLY UNLOAD CERTAIN PROJECTS IN YOUR SOLUTIONS. SO I HAVE UNLOADED MY TEST. RIGHT CLICK ON THE SOLUTION FILE AND SAVE IT AS A SOLUTION FILTER. AND I HAVE ONE SAVED ALREADY THAT I CAN GO AHEAD AND OPEN UP. SO I -- IT SAVES AS A DOT-SLNF FILE. WHEN I CLICK ON IT, IT ONLY LOADS THE PROJECTS THAT WERE LOADED WHEN I SAVED THAT SOLUTION FILTER. SO THAT IS A HUGE DEAL FOR ENTERPRISE WITH HUNDREDS, MAYBE EVEN THOUSANDS OF PROJECTS IN ONE SOLUTION. WE'RE NOT HERE TO JUDGE YOUR ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS FOR SURE. SO IT'S A GREAT WAY TO OPEN CODE REALLY QUICKLY. REALLY EXCITED ABOUT SOLUTION FILTERS. I THINK AMANDA JUST CALLED THIS OUT IN THE Q & A, BUT YOU MIGHT NOTICE THAT THESE CODE LENS REFERENCES ARE NOW SHOWING UP IN THE COMMUNITY. SO, YOU CAN -- YEAH, GET REFERENCES, YOU CAN GET YOUR GET HISTORY, YOU CAN SHOW, LIKE, AUTHORS AND RECENT CHANGES. CODE LENS IS SUPER USEFUL. IT'S A SUPER GOOD JUST PROMPT FOR LEARNING A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT YOUR METHODS AND THE CODE THAT YOU'RE WORKING IN, AND HELPING YOU LEARN MORE CONTEXT. SO YOU CAN EDIT WHAT CODE LENSES APPEAR ON YOUR SOLUTION, ALL I DID IN CONTROL "Q" SEARCH, I TYPED INCO LENS. I HAVE EVERYTHING ENABLED BECAUSE I WANT TO LEARN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. THAT IS IN COMMUNITY. SO, YAY. ANOTHER THING THAT IS NEW IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019, WHICH IS A HUGE REASON TO UPGRADE, IS PER MONITOR AWARENESS. IT USED TO BE WHEN YOU LAUNCHED VISUAL STUDIO ON YOUR LAPTOP AND DRAGGED IT TO ANOTHER MONITOR BECAUSE YOU'RE LIVING THAT BLESSED MULTI-MONITOR LIFESTYLE, VISUAL STUDIO WOULDN'T ALWAYS RESIZE CORRECTLY. SO NOW WE'RE MUCH MORE SMART SAAB ADJUSTING FONTS FOR RESOLUTION. WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL. OKAY. SO NEXT OFF, ALL OF THE TOOLING IMPROVEMENTS WE HAVE IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019. SO FIRST OFF, NEW CLASSIFICATION COLORS. YOU WILL NOTICE YOUR EDITOR IS MUCH MORE CLEVOLORFUL. KEY WORDS, USER METHODS, PARAETER NAMES AND OVERLOTADED OPERATORS ARE ALL GETTING NEW COLOR CUSTOMIZATIONS. YOU CAN CHANGE THESE IF YOU DON'T LOVE THE ONES WE'VE LOADED FOR YOU. THEN, I USE CONTROL "Q" SEARCH. I DIDN'T NEED TO GO THROUGH ENVIRONMENT AND FIND FONTS AND COLORS AND ALL OF THAT. IF I SCROLL DOWN TO USER MEMBERS, THERE IS MY PROPERTIES AND LOCALS AND CONSTANTS AND ALL OF THAT I CAN ADJUST MYSELF. SPEAKING OF WEIRD HOTDOG THEMES, NO, AS WE WERE DEVELOPING THIS, A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE EXCITED TO SEE STATICS WERE BOLDED IN SOME OF OUR FIRST ITERATIONS. WE GOT A LOT OF PUSHBACK BECAUSE IT WAS JUST JUMPING OUT TO TOO MANY PEOPLE. I WAS DEFINITELY LIKE ONE OF THE PEOPLE LIKE, WHOA, STATICS, WHY ARE YOU YELLING AT ME? SO IF YOU REALLY DID LOVE THAT, YOU CAN STILL ENABLE IT BECAUSE ALL OF THESE ARE EXTENSION POINTS THAT WE OFFER FOR YOU TO CUSTOMIZE BECAUSE WE DEFINITELY WANT TO BE A PLATFORM AND NOT MAKE ALL YOUR DECISIONS FOR YOU. SO, YEAH, THAT'S A NEW ONE. SO, ALLISON WILL BE MENTIONING EVEN MORE ABOUT INTELICODE. YOU'VE SEEN A LOT OF EXCITEMENT SO FAR IN THE KEYNOTES. I CAN TOTALLY USE INTELICODE ALL OVER MY PROJECT. IT'S AN EXTENSION. WE'RE HOPING IT WILL SOON BE ON BY DEFAULT AT SOME POINT. YOU CAN GO AND GRAB IT AT AKA.MS/INTELICODE. IT'S IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES, AS ALLISON SUGGESTED. IT LEARNS FROM YOUR CONTEXT. WHICH IS SUPER HELPFUL. IT EVEN INDEXES THINGS THAT, LIKE, IS NOT A MICROSOFT LIBRARY. IT'S A SUPER POPULAR PACKAGE IN THE COMMUNITY. IT STILL LEARNS WHAT SUGGESTIONS ARE MOST POPULAR IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS. SO WE STILL HAVE IT BEING OFFERED HERE. SO SUPER EXCITED ABOUT INTELICODE. ANOTHER THING I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT TOOLING IS -- I'LL GO AHEAD AND RELOAD MY TEST PROJECT. IS FOR SDK-STYLE PROJECTS THEY'RE USING DOTNET CORE PROJECTS OR DOTNET FRAMEWORK ADOPTED TO THE SDK STYLE, YOU CAN SIMPLY DOUBLE CLICK ON THAT PROJECT IN THE SOLUTION EXPLORER AND IT OPENS THE CS PROJ IMMEDIATELY. WE ARE SO FAR AWAY FROM THE DAYS OF HAVING TO LOAD YOUR PROJ. JUST A SIMPLE DOUBLE CLICK. IT IS ALL ABOUT THE LITTLE THINGS, TRYING TO MAKE YOUR EXPERIENCE BETTER. ANOTHER THING ABOUT THE CS PROJ IS YOU CAN NOW FIND CS PROJES IN A GO TO ALL NAVIGATION. SO I CAN TYPE "GOAT" CONTROL "T." THAT'S HOW I GET TO RECENT FILES. MY PARTICULAR FAVORITE NAVIGATION. AND WE INDEX CS PROJES. WE EVEN SHOW A PREVIEW. SO IF I CLOSE OUT OF THAT AND I THINK RETYPE HERE IT WILL SHOW CS PROJ IN YOUR LITTLE PREVIEW WINDOW WITHOUT FULLY OPENING THE FILE. PRETTY SWEET. OKAY. SO SPEAKING OF BEING ABLE TO FIND CODE QUICKLY, WE ADDED A NEW CATEGORY INTO OUR FIND ALL REFERENCES, SO I -- THAT'S SHIFT "F-11." THAT CATEGORIZES REFERENCES BY THE REFERENCE TYPE. READ/WRITE. NAME ONLY. YOU CAN ACTUALLY FILTER ALL OF THESE TO, FOR EXAMPLE, ONLY THE RIGHT REFERENCES. SO YOU CAN SEE EVERYWHERE THAT THIS PARTICULAR VARIABLE IS BEING WRITTEN TO, WHICH IS VERY HELPFUL. SUPER, SUPER BIG ASK. AND TOTALLY NEW IN 2019. AND I AM EXCITED TO SHOW OFF THE SEARCH LOCAL AND WATCH WINDOWS DURING DEBUGGING, BUT I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO LEAVE THAT FOR LESLIE, THAT HAS A TALK LATER IN THE DAY. SO STAY TUNED FOR MORE DEBUGGING FEATURES. REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. OKAY. SO I MENTIONED IN THE KEYNOTE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CODE STYLE AND MANAGEMENT. SO LET'S DIG INTO THAT A LITTLE BIT FURTHER. SO MANY OF YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH ADJUSTING CODE STYLE THROUGH YOUR TOOLS OPTIONS. SO YOU CAN SCROLL AROUND, YOU CAN SET YOUR PROJ PREFERENCES TO PREFER A BAR OR EXPLICIT TYPE OR YOU CAN SET THE SEVERITY OF THIS AS WELL. SOMETHING NEW IN 2019 IS BEING ABLE TO GENERATE YOUR EDITOR CONFIG FILE FROM YOUR SETTINGS. SO I HAVE ONE GENERATED HERE. AND THIS IS WHERE I CAN MANAGE ALL OF THESE SETTINGS. SO IF I WANT AND LOOKED UP MY VAR RULES, I CAN SAY THAT RIGHT NOW IT'S ACTUALLY PREFERRING THE EXPLICIT TYPE BECAUSE IT'S SET TO FALSE, AND I CAN GO AHEAD AND CHANGE IT TO A SUGGESTION AND WE CAN SEE IT IMPACT MY CODE. SO HERE I'M USING VAR IN MY TEST PROJECT. I CAP GO AHEAD AND SELECT ALL MATCHING USING SHIFT ALT DOT AND CHANGE THAT TO A SUGGESTION. THAT'S MULTI-CURSES, BY THE WAY. MULTI-CURSER, BY THE WAY, IF ANY OF YOU WERE SHIFT ALT DOT TO INSERT AT THE NEXT MATCHING. IT'S VERY COOL. SO NOW WHEN I GO HERE, I AM NOW GETTING THESE DOTS UNDERNEATH MY VAR. SO THE CODE FIX FOR THIS IS GOING IN AND CHANGING IT TO EXPLICIT TYPE. LET'S SAY I WANT TO DO THIS FOR MY ENTIRE FILE AND I WANT TO GO AHEAD AND FIX SOME OF MY INCONSISTENT SPACING. I HAVE CURLY SOMETIMES ON THE FIRST LINE, SOMETIMES THE SECOND, I WANT TO APPLY ALL OF MY FORMATTING FIXES AND MY CODE FIXES ALL AT ONCE. I CAN DO THAT USING CODE CLEANUP. SO WE ADDED THIS LITTLE BROOM ICON TO THE BOTTOM OF FILES. SO I CAN CLICK IT TO EXECUTE A CODE CLEANUP, WHICH IS CONTROL "K," CONTROL "E," OR I CAN GO AND CONFIGURE CODE CLEANUP AND ACTUALLY SPECIFY WHAT FIXERS I WANT CODE CLEANUP TO APPLY. SO I'VE PROMOTED THAT TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH MY CODE CLEANUP PROFILE. SO THIS IS JUST DECIDING WHAT FIXERS EXACTLY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A CERTAIN KEYBOARD COMMAND. SO IF I APPLY CONTROL "KE," FIXES ALL MY SKPASINGS AND CHA SPACINGS AND CHANGES MY VAR INTO EXPLICIT TYPES. THE OTHER COOL THING I WANT TO CALL OUT, WE HAVE A LOT OF ASKS FOR CODE CLEANUP TO BE ABLE TO WORK ON YOUR ENTIRE SOLUTION. WE ARE WORKING ON THAT. WE ALSO HAVE A LOT OF ASKS TO HAVE IT SOMEHOW WORK ON THE COMMAND LINE SO PEOPLE WILL CHECK IT INTO CICD. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A DOTNET GLOBAL FORMAT TOOL THAT WILL APPLY FORMATTING OPTIONS, SO NOT ALL CODE STYLE FIXERS, MORE LIKE THE CURLY BRACE FIXERS WOULD BE A GOOD EXAMPLE. THE PARENTHESIS OF A METHOD. YOU CAN HOOK UP THE DOTNET FORMAT GLOBAL TOOL RIGHT NOW TO YOUR CIDC PIPELINE. IT WILL DO SOME FORMATTING. NOT ALL CODE AREA. WE'RE STILL DEVELOPING THE AREA IS REALLY OPEN TO FEEDBACK ON IT. COOL. SO NEXT I'LL MOVE ON TO DOTNET REFACTORINGS AND CODE FIXES. I HAVE A TON TO GET THROUGH. LET'S SEE HOW FAST I CAN GO. NEXT UP IS SYNC NAME SPACE AND FOLDER NAME. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN REALLY EXCITED IN REQUESTING THAT ONE. SO IF I WENT AHEAD AND DRAGGED MY EMOJI TEST.CS TO MY HOME CONTROLLER, SO I JUST CHANGED ITS CONTAINING FOLDER NAME. IF I GO TO MY NAME SPACE IS HIT CONTROL DOT, WHICH IS THE TRUSTY KEYBOARD SHORTCUT FOR ACCESSING ALL OF YOUR TOOL TIPS AND LIGHT BULB SUGGESTIONS FOR WHEREVER YOUR CURSES IS. I WILL GET THE SUGGESTION TO CHANGE MY NAME SPACE TO MY FOLDER NAME. BOOM. SO NOW IT'S IN THE HOME CONTROL AND NAME SPACE. THIS WILL ALSO CHANGE ALL OF THE REFERENCES TO THIS NAME SPACE AND UPDATE ALL OF THEM AS YOU WOULD SORT OF EXPECT. OKAY. SO IN THE KEYNOTE, I WAS SUPER GLAD THEY GOT THIS IN. WE HAVE CONVERT FOR EACH TO LINK. SO YOU HAVE THE LINK QUERY BODY OR YOU COULD ALSO USE THE LINK METHOD SYNTAX OR THE CALL FORM SO IT'S ALL IN ONE LINE USING A LAMDA. VERY NICE. WE CAN INVERT CONDITIONALS. SO RIGHT HERE -- OH, I CAN TELL YOU WHAT THIS APP DOES. AND ACTUALLY, I CAN GO AHEAD AND RUN IT. SO THIS APP GRABS ALL OF YOUR TWEETS THAT YOU'RE CURRENTLY MAKING ON TWITTER AND IT RUNS IT THROUGH AZURE COGNITIVE SERVES TO GET THE SENTIMENT SCORE. AND WHEN I CLICK ANALYZE HERE, IT WILL GIVE ME BACK THE SCORES ALONG WITH THE TWEETS. WE ALSO HAVE THIS ABILITY TO ANALYZE THE AVERAGE. SO IT KIND OF TOTALS THE AVERAGE SENTIMENT FOR EACH USER. WHICH IS A PRETTY NICE LITTLE CODE. TWEETS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO ME, OBVIOUSLY. SO HERE IS WHERE WE GAUGE WHETHER OR NOT THE TWEET SENTIMENT SCORE QUALIFIES AS HAPPY, SAD OR INDIFFERENT. SO I HAVE SOME CONDITIONAL OPERATORS HERE, AND MAYBE I WANT TO -- THIS TO READ HAPPY, INDIFFERENT AND THEN SAD. I CAN GO AHEAD AND HIT CONTROL DOT AFTER I PLACE MY CURSER RIGHT NEXT TO A LODGEAL OPERATOR A LOGICAL OPERATOR AND IT WILL INVERT THAT CONDITION. IT DIDN'T CHANGE THE MEANING. SCORES LESS THAN 0.3 WE WOULD QUALIFY AS SAD AND ABOVE THAT IS INDIFFERENT. SO IT JUST CHANGED THE WAY THE CODE WAS WRITTEN. SO A NICE LITTLE REFACTORING TO HAVE. OKAY. ANOTHER ASK THAT WE -- WAS VERY POPULAR WAS BEING ABLE TO NOT ONLY EXTRACT YOUR INTERFACE, BUT EXTRACT YOUR INTERFACE TO THE CURRENT FILE. SO I CAN ACCESS THIS BY HITTING -- JUST PLACING MY CURSER IN ANY CLASS AND I CAN HIT EXTRACT INTERFACE. IT OPENS THIS LITTLE DIALOGUE. AND NOW I HAVE AN EMOJI SEARCH INTERFACE AND IT'S IMPLEMENTING IT. WHAT IF I MEANT TO ADD MORE MEMBERS TO THAT INTERFACE? WHAT IF I ADDED SOME TO MY TYPE AND I ACTUALLY WANT TO PROMOTE THEM SO I CAN USE THEM IN OTHER PLACES THIS INTERFACE IS INHERITED? I CAN DO THAT WITH PULL MEMBERS UP. SO I PLACE MY CURSER IN ANY OF THE MEMBERS AND I CAN PULL MEMBERS UP TO A BASE TYPE. SO IT RE-OPENS THAT DIALOGUE AND I CAN GO AHEAD A SELECT ALL THE MEMBERS. AND I CAN PULL THEM UP TO MY INTERFACE. SO HANDY DANDY LITTLE REFACTORINGS THAT WE OFFER NOW. OKAY. SO HERE I HAVE A SUPER LONG LIST OF PARAMETERS, RIGHT? IT GOES ALL THE WAY OFF THE PAGE. I'M LOOKING AT MULTIPLE DIFFERENT EMOJIS. NEW REFACTORING OFFERING IS WRAP EVERY PARAMETER. SO I CAN DO THAT HERE. NOW I CAN ACTUALLY READ NOT ONLY MY LIST OF STRING, BUT MY STRING TEXT. SO PRETTY HELPFUL THERE. OKAY. AND LET'S SAY THAT -- THIS IS ANOTHER VERY POPULAR REFACTORING. I'M TRYING TO TYPE OUT A FUNCTION THAT I KNOW I HAVE THE DEPENDENCY INSTALLED IN MY PROJECT, BUT I JUST DON'T HAVE THE USING STATEMENT, SO HERE I'M TRYING TO CALL NEWTON -- I GET AN ACTUAL CODE FIX TO ADD THE MISSING USING. I CAN POP THAT AT THE TOP OF MY PROJECT AND NOW I CAN GET ALL OF THE INTEL THAT I ACTUALLY WANTED FOR IT. COOL. LET'S SEE. SO GOING BACK TO MY EMOJI SEARCH CLASS, I WANTED TO CALL OUT THAT WHAT I HAVE HERE YOU MAY NOTICE IT'S GETTING COLORIZATION THAT'S BECAUSE WE ADDED LANGUAGE SUPPORT IN VISUAL SUPPORT 2019. YOU HAVE BRACE DETECTION IN SOME ERROR MESSAGES AND IT CAN -- SO IT CAN SENSE WHEN YOU'RE MISSING SOMETHING OR MISTYPE SOMETHING, LET'S BE REALLY, TYPING IT IS HARD ENOUGH SO WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THAT EASIER FOR YOU. YOU MAY NOTICE I'M GETTING SOME WARNING TEXT HERE. SO I NEVER ACTUALLY USE THIS VARIABLE, AND I'M ALSO REASSIGNING IT IN SOME PLACE. SO I'M GETTING TWO DIFFERENT CODE FIXES HERE. ONE IS TO REMOVE THE REDUNDANT ASSIGNMENT, SO THAT'S WHAT I'M GETS DOTS ON. SO WHEN I TAKE THAT, IT ELIMINATES ONE ASSIGNMENT THAT I NEVER USED IN MY CODE AND THE WARNING IS FOR -- BECAUSE I NEVER ACTUALLY USED THIS VARIABLE AT ALL. SO NOW WE HAVE DEAD CODE ANALYSIS THAT WILL ACTUALLY SEE WHAT VARIABLES YOU AREN'T USING AND WHAT YOU CAN ERASE. SO THIS WILL DEFINITELY HELP YOU CLEAN UP YOUR CODE. ALL RIGHT. SO THAT'S NOT EVEN ALL OF OUR CODE FIXES AND REFACTORINGS. THERE ARE DEFINITELY WAY MORE THAT I WANTED TO SHOW OFF. YOU CAN FIND THE COMPLETE LIST IN OUR RELEASE NOTES. ALONG WITH OUR BLOG POSTS AS WELL. WE HAVE ANOTHER ONE COMING OUT TODAY. IT SHOULD BE REALLY GREAT. SO, YEAH, Q & A? ARE YOU READY FOR ME, SETH?  LET'S DO IT. I LOVE Q & A. HOLD ON. THEY'RE PROBABLY GOING TO GET MY MIC READY. THERE WE GO. I CAN START TO HEAR STUFF. SO HERE'S THE THING I LOVE ABOUT VISUAL STUDIO IS HOW PRODUCTIVE I AM WITH JUST AUTO COMPLETE. IF YOU COULD SUMMARIZE, LIKE, THE TOP THREE THINGS THAT 2019, YOU SHOULD TOTALLY LOOK AT THIS.  OKAY. I FEEL LIKE THERE ARE SO MANY HIDDEN THINGS. LIKE THE EDITOR CONFIG STUFF YOU WERE DOING. WHEN YOU WENT DEEP INTO THE MENU SYSTEM, I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT. WHAT ARE THE TOP THREE THINGS THAT PEOPLE SHOULD LOOK AT?  OKAY, FIRST OFF, I REAL LOVE INTELICODE. I WON'T STOP TALKING ABOUT IT. IT'S TOTALLY ALLISON'S THING, SHE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT IT LATER, BUT THAT SMARTER COMPLETION IS SO KEY. WE RAN OVER 2,000 OPEN SOURCE GET HUB REITPOS IN ORDER TO TRA IT. MY MIND IS BOGGLED. 2013 WAS MY FIRST INTERNSHIP. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT COMPUTERS WOULD BE MAKING MY CODING EXPERIENCE SO MUCH BETTER. I'VE BEEN DOING AUTO COMPLETE FOR SO LONG THAT NOW SEEING IT BEING EVEN SMARTER IS SUPER COOL. WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE TO GET YOUR QUESTIONS IN. SO I'M GOING TO GET THEM RIGHT HERE AS I GET THEM. HERE IS ONE FROM MIKE. GREAT VS 2019 PRESENTATION. WHERE CAN I FIND THE CODE TO YOUR TWITTER SENTIMENT ANALYSIS DURING YOUR PRESENTATION?  SOME OF THE EMOJI SEARCH CLASSES AND STUFF LIKE THAT I ADDED MYSELF. THERE IS GENERALLY A GREAT TUTORIAL ON TWITTER SENTIMENT ANALYSIS THAT YOU CAN FIND IN OUR AZURE DOCS. I'LL FIND THE LINK FOR IT AND MAKE SURE TO TWEET IT. TRAVIS, I KNOW TRAVIS. FOR CODE CLEANUP, HOW DO YOU CONFIGURE IT TO RUN FIXES LIKE THOSE FIND IN STYLE COP? WOULD LOVE TO HAVE ONE-CLICK REORDERING MEMBER AND SPACER FIXES. A LOT OF THE STYLE COP FIXERS WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED IN OUR RO ROSLYN ANALYZERS REPO. OFFERS A LOT MORE SUGGESTIONS, BUT IF YOU WANT TO GO AND GRAB THAT PACKAGE, I THINK YOU'LL GET A LOT OF WHAT YOU WOULD NORMALLY SEE IN STYLE COP. AWESOME. NOT 100%. OKAY. BUT A LOT OF THEM. ENOUGH OF THEM, RIGHT?  LET US KNOW. CAN YOU SHOW ME ONE MORE TIME? BECAUSE SOMETHING HAPPENED WITH AUDIO. I WANT TO SEE THE MENU WHERE YOU WERE CHANGING A LOT OF THE COLORING. CAN YOU SHOW THAT?  OH, YEAH. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET TO THAT IF I GO BACK. LET'S GO TO HER SCREEN IF YOU CAN. IT'S SUPER EASY TO OPEN. YOU JUST TYPE CONTROL "Q" AND TYPE IN FONTS.  THAT'S THE PART I MISSED. YOU GOT TO USE SEARCH. THIS IS THE PROBLEM THAT I HAVE. LIKE, I SAW -- I WAS WALKING BY BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE HONEST WITH EVERYBODY, I WENT TO ACTUALLY GRAB A DONUT, BUT DON'T TELL ANYBODY. I WON'T.  OUR SECRET. I SAW YOU WERE IN THIS MENU CHANGING VERY SPECIFIC THINGS AND YOU CAN SEE IT ON YOUR SCREEN RIGHT NOW IF WE GO TO THE SCREEN. LIKE, I ALWAYS HAVE A HARD TIME, LIKE, FINDING THE RIGHT THING. WHY DON'T YOU, LIKE, IMPRESS UPON ME BECAUSE I NEED, LIKE, THE IMPRESSION STUCK IN MY HEAD. WHAT KINDS OF THINGS CAN YOU SEARCH FOR WHEN YOU'RE DOING SEARCH. SO ALL OF OUR MENU COMMANDS USED TO BE THE ONLY THING SUCCESSFUL THROUGH SEARCH, AND NOW WE HAVE THINGS LIKE ADDING NEW NUGET PACKAGES AS WELL AS A TON OF TOOLS OPTIONS. NOT EVERYTHING IN TOOLS OPTIONS IS THERE. IT DEPENDS HOW WE TAG IT WHEN WE CHECK IN. WE'RE TRYING TO ADD MORE AND MORE. IF THERE WAS SOMETHING REALLY DIFFICULT TO FIND, PLEASE LET US KNOW. ABSOLUTELY. I'LL GO AHEAD AND CALL OUT THIS LITTLE GUY AT THE TOP THAT AMANDA WAS TALKING ABOUT. THIS IS OUR LITTLE REPORT A PROBLEM GUY, AND IT WILL TAKE YOU TO VISUAL STUDIO DEVELOPER COMMUNITY, AND YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND REPORT A PROBLEM THERE AND SUGGEST A FEATURE. WE WILL ABSOLUTELY GO THROUGH IT. AWESOME. AND I THINK THE CHALLENGE THAT I HAVE IS I'M STUCK, LIKE, IN THIS STAGE OF VISUAL STUDIO, WHERE,, LIKE, WHEN I SEARCH FOR THINGS I'M, LIKE, I'M SEARCHING FOR THINGS IN A FILE, BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT SEARCH IS NOWADAYS, RIGHT?  NO.  IT'S SEARCH FOR ALL SORTS OF THINGS. TOOLS OPTIONS. COMMANDS. NUGET PACKAGES, SUPER USEFUL. CONTROL "Q." YES.  OKAY. SO HERE IS A QUESTION I THINK FROM DAVID. WHEN YOU USE SOLUTION FILTERS AND DO A REBUILD ALL, WHAT GETS BUILT, JUST THE FILTERED PROJECTS OR ALL. DO YOU KNOW THAT ONE?  JUST THE FILTER PROJECTS. IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY -- IF ALL OF THE DEPENDENCIES ARE LOADED, IT WILL BUILD JUST FINE.  OH, FANTASTIC. OKAY.  WE GOT THAT OUT OF THE MVP SUMMIT WHEN I DIDN'T KNOW AND TRIED IT OUT. I'M GOING TO FIGURE THAT ONE OUT. WE ALL DO THE SAME THING, OKAY? WHEN YOU SHOW NEW FEATURES, COULD YOU ALSO STATE IF THEY ARE IN COMMUNITY? SO ALL ALL OF THE STUFF YOU WERE SHOWING, WHICH PART IS IN COMMUNITY AND WHICH ISN'T?  YEAH, THE BIGGEST THING IT CALL OUT -- EVERYTHING, YEAH, EVERYTHING I JUST SHOWED WAS IN COMMUNITY. ALL THE CODE IXES AND REFACTORINGS AUTOMATICALLY IN. CODE LENS IS NOW IN COMMUNITY. REALLY EXCITED ABOUT. HEY, THAT'S COOL. YEAH. EDITING PROJECT FILES. YEAH. EVERYTHING IS JUST IN THERE. WHAT I WANT TO DO NOW IS WE HAVE A COUPLE OF MINUTES AND AS YOUR QUESTIONS COME IN, I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CALL OUT SOME PEOPLE. HERE ARE SOME PEOPLE IN BOSTON THAT ARE HERE THAT ARE WATCHING. LOOK HOW COOL THEY ARE. THANKS, JIM, FOR THAT. HI, JIM. I WANTED TO DO A LITTLE INCEPTION HERE.  MIND BLOWN.  LET ME LINE IT UP. THIS IS COOL.  CAN SOMEONE TWEET A PICTURE OF THIS?  LET ME GET IN MORE SO YOU CAN BE READY. I'M GOING TO GET THE EXACT -- OKAY. ALL RIGHT. THEY PROBABLY GOT IT ALREADY. GOOD. GOOD.  ANOTHER COUPLE OF PEOPLE. WE HAVE PEOPLE HERE IN MINNEAPOLIS FROM MIKE. I KNOW MIKE. HE'S NICE. LOOK AT THEM. THEY'RE ALL WATCHING. THEN WE HAD SOMEONE FROM MORE FAR. HERE WE ARE. IN DENMARK. YOU CAN SEE THEY'RE IN THE EVENING HOUR OVER THERE. A COUPLE OF MORE QUESTIONS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT VISUAL STUDIO INTELICODE, THEY TALKED A LITTLE EARLIER ABOUT TRAINING A MODEL. IS THAT -- THEY'RE DOING THAT NEXT, RIGHT?  YEAH, ALLISON WILL BE DOING THAT RIGHT AFTER ME, WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE.  OKAY.  YOU GOT ME. FROM ANDRE. WHEN ADDING A NEW FILE WITH SEARCH CONTROL "Q," IS THERE AN EASY WAY TO TELL THE FOLDER THAT I WANT THE NEW FILE TO BE CREATED? I SHOULD MAKE IT BIG FROM ANDRE.  CONTROL "Q."  SO YOU CAN ADD NEW FILES WITH CONTROL SEARCH, CONTROL "Q"?  IT OPENS UP THE REGULAR ADD FILE DIALOGUE. OKAY. SO THE SAME SORT OF INPUT. LET'S SEE IF I CAN ADD NEW ITEM. YEAH, SO IT JUST OPENS UP SORT OF THE SAME PAGE THAT YOU WOULD SEE, AND WHEN I HIT ADD -- SO IT LEARNS -- OH, THAT'S RIGHT. CONTROL "Q" ACTUALLY IS CONTEXTUAL FOR WHAT YOU HAVE SELECTED VERSUS IN THE SOLUTION EXPLORER OR IN YOUR EDITOR, WHICH IS ALSO REALLY TRIPPY. I SEE. THAT'S KIND OF COOL. IT'S LIKE KNOWING -- WE'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO BE ABLE TO CODE ANYMORE IF YOU PEOPLE HAVE YOUR WAY. I'M JUST SAYING, RIGHT?  YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. THAT WILL BE REALLY COOL. SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT IT OPENS BASED UPON CONTEXT. SO SOMEONE WAS VERY HELPFUL. LET'S DO A THIRD ONE HERE, IF WE CAN. BECAUSE WE HAVE ANOTHER MINUTE. LET ME GET IN THERE HERE. OKAY. ALL RIGHT.  I LOVE THE INTERNET.  THANK YOU SO MUCH.  IT'S GREAT.  ALL RIGHT. SO HOLD ON. THANK YOU, KENDRA. WE'RE ALL DONE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS RECORDED AND PUT UP. I THINK WE HAVE JEFF AVAILABLE HERE. LET ME GET INTO INCEPTION POSE FOR YOU, BUDDY. SO, JEFF, ARE YOU THERE, MY FRIEND?  HEY, SETH. OH, MY GOSH. I'VE GOT -- I'VE GOT SOME FOLKS THAT ARE CALLED INTO US RIGHT NOW FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD. I'M TALKING TO AUGUSTINE OUT THERE IN MUMBAI. STAY HELLO. LOOK AT ALL THE FOLKS IN MUMBAI. AUGUSTINE, WHAT ARE FOLKS REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THAT YOU'VE SEEN SO FAR IN THE LAUNCH VIDEO. WHAT ARE YOU FINDING EXISTING?  I'M MAKING THE WEBSITE -- THERE IS SO MUCH EXCITEMENT OVER THERE. I CAN'T EVEN HEAR THEM IN MY EAR. ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS, VERY FAST COMPARED TO THE LAST ONE. ALL RIGHT. INSTALL. VERY USEFUL FOR GUYS UP HERE WHERE THE INTERNET IS A LITTLE BIT SHAKY, OKAY?  MUCH FASTER. SO VERY FAST. HEY, MAN.  SMALLER INSTALL FOOTPRINT. FASTER SEARCH. THAT IS AMAZING. SO THERE YOU GO. THERE IS THE WORD FROM MUMBAI. THANKS SO MUCH, AUGUSTINE. THANKS, MAN. CHEERS. YOU'RE THE BEST.  HEY, SETH.  HOW ARE YOU DOING?  OH, MAN. I LOVE SEEING THE EXCITEMENT FROM FOLKS ALL OVER JUMPING IN AND ABLE TO CONNECT WITH US.  I'M PRETTY EXCITED. LIKE I SAID, VISUAL STUDIO HAS BEEN MY HOME FOR A VERY LONG TIME, SO I'M EXCITED THAT WE GET TO DO THIS. BUT UP NEXT I HAVE HERE IN MY HANDS. SETHSEPTION. WE MIGHT GET ANOTHER WE HAVE OUR STREAM LINE YOUR DREAM DUB TEAM WITH ALLISON AND JOHN, HOW ARE YOU, MY FRIENDS.  WE'RE GREAT.  INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND WE WILL GET INTO OUR CONTENT.  I AM ALLISON AND THE PROGRAM MANAGER AND WE WILL SHOW YOU HOW TO CREATE YOUR OWN CUSTOM MODEL VERY SHORTLY.  I'M JOHN CHOO, YOUR VISUAL MANAGER ON THE TEAM.  YOU CAN REFER TO US #SHAREPAIR BECAUSE THAT IS OUR DUO NAME FOR ALL THE TALKS. SO, ARE WE READY TO GET GOING? COOL? HOT OFF THAT QUESTION FROM KENDRA, WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT VISUAL STUDIO IN TELECODE. I HOPE ALL OF YOU TUNED INTO OUR KEY NOTE THIS MORNING AND GOT A PREVIEW OF WHAT VISUAL AND TELECODE IS. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHAT MIGHT HAVE MISSED IT. WE USE MACHINE LEARNING AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO EUROPE POWER YOUR DEVELOPER PRODUCTIVITY. WE HEARD FOR YEARS THAT INTELLIGENCE IS GREAT, BUT ISN'T THERE A BETTER WAY THAN ALPHABET CAL? THERE HAS TO BE. WHAT WE DID WAS SCANNED OVER 2,000 OPEN SOURCE REPOSITORIES AND TOOK THE WISDOM OF THE COMMUNITY AND PUT IT ALL TOGETHER TO GIVE YOU BETTER SUGGESTIONS. LET ME GIVE YOU A QUICK EXAMPLE OFF MY MACHINE. IF I HAVE SOME TEST VARIABLE HERE AND I'M GOING TO MAKE IT A STRING AND IF I DO TEST DOT, YOU WILL SEE I GET THESE STARRED RECOMMENDATIONS AND IT SAYS HEY, GIVEN THIS CONTEXT, THIS IS PROBABLY WHAT YOU WANT RIGHT NOW. IF I GIVE IT A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION AND MAKE THIS A STRING ARRAY VERSUS JUST A BAR AND ACTIVATE TELLS US AGAIN, I GET SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THINGS. LINK AND CLONE AND IT'S SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT. IF I DO AN IF STATEMENT, OOH! THAT WAS UNEXPECTED, BUT YOU KNOW. LIVE DEMO. IT HAPPENS. THE TEST DOT, YOU NOTICE I GET YET A DIFFERENT SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS, WHICH IS PRETTY COOL. THIS IS JUST CLASSIC INTEL CODE RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX. I WANT TO LET EVERYONE KNOW THAT INTEL CODE IS ANN EXTENSION STILL. YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD IT TO GET IT TO WORK IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019. WE ARE SO EXCITED WE HAD TO SHARE IT. DO INSTALL IT. IT IS FULLY SUPPORTED WITH 2019 AND ALSO THE LATEST UPDATE ON VISUAL STUDIO 2017. COOL. SO THAT'S OUR BASE CASE. THAT WORKS GREAT. BUT WE HAD THAT QUESTION ABOUT HOW DO I TRAIN TO MY CODE. I'M USING THE SAME SENTIMENT ANALYSIS SOLUTION THAT KENDRA WAS USING. I'M WRITING THIS EXTREME LOVE METHOD HERE. I WANT TO GO THROUGH OUR LIST OF TWEETS AND FIGURE OUT, DO PEOPLE REALLY LOVE VISUAL STUDIO 2019? THE WAY I'M DOING THAT IS SEE FIGURE THEY ARE AT LEAST FIVE HEART EMOJIS. IF YOU WANT TO SHOW YOUR LOVE FOR VISUAL STUDIO, I NEED AT LEAST FIVE HEARTS. I WANT TO DO ES, MY CUSTOM CLASS HERE, YOU AND YOU WILL SEE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY STAR RECOMMENDATIONS. IT'S A CUSTOM CLASS. THAT'S NOT IN THE OPEN SOURCE. REALLY SAD. I WILL DO CONTROL Q AND TYPE THE INTEL CODE. I WILL HIT ENTER AND BRING THIS UP. YOU WILL SEE HERE IT HAS INFORMATION ABOUT CUSTOM MODELS AND TRAIN ON MY CODE. IT WILL GO AWAY FROM LEARNING THE CODE PATTERNS AND WHEN THE MODEL IS DONE BEING CREATED IT WILL GIVE ME THE STARRED SUGGESTIONS WHICH WE ARE SO EXCITED FOR. OBVIOUSLY THERE IS A LOT OF INTERESTING MORE THAN LEARNING RIGHT NOW. YOU HAVE TO BE PATIENT, BUT IT WILL ALL BE WORTH IT.  WHAT ABOUT IF I'M WORKING WITH THE TEAM AND THEY WANT THE STARRED RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE CUSTOM MODEL.  ONCE WE HAVE OUR MODEL HERE, YOU WILL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO SHARE THAT MODEL. YOU WILL SEE HERE IF THEY MOVE BACK TO MY SCREEN, THE MODEL IS DONE AND YOU CAN HIT SHARE MODEL RIGHT HERE. WE HAVE A LINK COPIED TO THE CLIP BOARD SIMILAR TO LIVE SHARE. WE HAVE INSPIRATION TO YOU AND I CAN SEND IT OUT TO MY TEAM AND CLICK ADMODEL HERE AND PASTE IT IN AND GET THAT MODEL, LICKITY SPLIT. I WILL GO BACK TO MY BEST TWEETS AND ACTIVATE AGAIN AND YOU WILL SEE THAT, IN FACT, I GET THE STARRED RECOMMENDATION, WHICH IS AWESOME. I WILL COUNT THE EMOJIS. ANOTHER GREAT FEATURE WE RELEASED IS ARGUMENT COMPLETION. IF I'M HERE WITHIN MY COUNT EMOJI METHOD AND I DO CONTROL SPACE WHICH ACTIVATES THE ARGUMENT COMPLETION WINDOW, YOU WILL SEE THAT IT GIVES ME STARRED RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MY ARGUMENTS. SO I CAN DO HEART, COMMA, ACTIVATE IT AGAIN, THERE IS MY TEST TWEET. IT'S PRETTY MUCH ACTIVATE, INTEL CODE, ENTER. IT'S MAGIC. I WANT AT LEAST FIVE HEARTS IN HERE. IF THAT TWEET DOES HAVE FIVE HEARTS, I WANT TO ADD IT TO MY LIST OF BEST TWEETS. BEST TWEETS.ADD AND TEST TWEETS IS WHAT I WANT AND OUR METHOD IS DONE. I DIDN'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING. IT'S PRETTY GREAT IN MY OPINION. THAT'S INTEL CODE. NOW THAT WE HAVE IT ALREADY, THIS TEST HAS BEEN FINICKY. I WANT TO DEBUG IT AND RUN IT AGAIN AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON. IT'S A DEMO. YOU KNOW, I KNOW YOU AND I HAVE BEEN RUNNING INTO WEIRD ISSUES THIS MORNING, RIGHT JOHN?  THAT KEEPS HAPPENING.  FOR GETS BETTER HOPEFULLY. WE JUST NEED TO ASK THE DEMO GODS A LITTLE BIT MORE TO BE KIND TO US. SO IN FACT, WHEN WE DEBUG THIS TEST, IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE PASSING, UNFORTUNATELY. YOU ARE THE EXCEPTION EXPERT.  I GOT YOU.  COOL. I'M GOING TO START A LIVE SHARE SESSION WITH YOU. I CAN SEE IN THE TOP CORNER HERE THAT IT SAYS COOL. I AM NOW SHARE AND I AM GOING TO SEND THIS OVER TO YOU. HOPE YOU ARE READY ON TEAMS, JOHN.  I CAN GO ON TO MY SIDE AND SEE THAT I GOT YOUR MESSAGE AND USE LIVE SHARE A LOT. CLICKING ON THAT WILL OPEN MY BROWSER AND SEE THAT I HAVE THE LIVE SHARE EXTENSION AND I CAN LAUNCH THE VISUAL STUDIO 2019. ONE OF THE COOL THINGS ABOUT LIVE SHARE IS NOW THAT IT COMES INBOX WITH THE VISUAL STUDIO. IF YOU HAVE SUPPORTED WORK LOADS, YOU GET IT INBOX AND YOU CAN START SHARING WITH YOUR TEAMMATES. WITH LIVE SHARE YOU ARE ABLE TO GET REALTIME COLLABORATION FROM THE COMFORT OF YOUR OWN TOOLS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO RECREATE THE ENVIRONMENT TO WORK WITH YOUR TEAMMATES.  DO YOU HAVE ANY WORK LOAD DOWNLOADED ON YOUR MACHINE OR IS IT LIKE THE CORE EDITOR?  THIS IS THE CORE EDITOR AND THE BEAUTY OF LIVE SHARE IS THAT IT IS ALL FORWARDED FROM YOUR MACHINE TO MY MACHINE. I DON'T HAVE TO SET UP THE WORK LOADS TO COLLABORATE. LET'S GO INTO A SPLIT SCREEN. YOU WILL SEE ON MY SIDE THAT I'M IN THE BLUE THEME AND ALLISON IS IN THE DARK THEME. YOU ARE ABLE TO WORK IN THE EDITORS OR YOUR IDE AND TOOLS WHETHER IT'S THE VISUAL STUDIO OR CODE AND YOU CAN CONFIGURE HOWEVER YOU WANT AND YOU ARE ABLE TO COLLABORATE WITHOUT CHANGING IT TO BE ABLE DO THAT. HIGH CONTRAST OR ANYTHING YOU NEED FOR THE EDITORS. ONCE I JOINED IT, I SAW THE SOLUTION EXPLORE FOR MY PROJECT. AND YEAH. YOU CAN SEE THE SOLUTION EXPLORER FOR ALLISON'S PROJECT AND I CAN EXPAND AND SEE THE FILES AND FOLDERS THAT ARE GOING ON INSIDE OF THAT PROJECT TO EXPLORE AROUND. INITIALLY AS I SAW WITH ALLISON MOVING AROUND, I SAW HER AND AS I HIGHLIGHT, I SEE THIS GOING ON AND ADDITIONALLY AS WELL, SHE SEES IT ON HERS AS WELL.  COOL. DO YOU GET SOLUTION VIEW IN THAT OR IS THAT VS SPECIFICALLY?  THAT'S A VS-SPECIFIC FEATURE AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE HEARD IN OUR FEEDBACK. A LOT OF USERS WANTED THEIR SOLUTION EXPLORER VIEW TO BE ABLE TO COLLABORATE WITH THEIR TEAMMATES PROPERLY. THAT'S SOMETHING WE BUILT BASED ON FEEDBACK.  COOL.  I SAW THAT YOU WERE TYPING AND JUST TO SHOW I CAN TYPE AS WELL. WE ARE ABLE TO WORK IN THAT WAY. TELL ME, WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THIS BUG?  BEFORE I GET TO THAT, I GOT THIS NOTIFICATION HERE IN THE BOTTOM THAT SOMEONE TRIED TO JOIN AS READ ONLY. SOMEONE IS TRYING TO CRASH THE SESSION. THAT SOUNDS COOL. IS THAT A STANDARD FEATURE?  TO HAVE READ ONLY FOR GUESTS TO BE ABLE TO JOIN IN. YOU WANT TO START UP A SESSION AND MAYBE YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO MAKE EDITS. MAYBE YOU ARE GIVING A LECTURE AND YOU ARE ABLE TO START A READ ONLY SESSION AND JOIN AS WELL.  THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN REALLY USEFUL FOR ME IN COLLEGE. I WISH YOU BUILT THIS AROUND YEARS AGO.  ESPECIALLY WORKING OUR OWN EDITORS ACROSS THE TEAM ROOM ON DIFFERENT FLOORS AT HOME AND WHEREVER IT IS YOU ARE WORKING.  THAT'S TRUE. IT WAS GREAT AT THE LAST CONFERENCE WHERE WE CAN BE IN OUR OWN HOTEL ROOMS WHERE WE DON'T HAVE TO FIND A WEIRD MIDDLE GROUND. COOL. THIS TEST HERE. THIS LOOKS LIKE THE SPECIFIC EMOJI TEST WAS FAILING. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT HERE. SOMETHING MIGHT BE GOING ON WITH THE SPECIFIC EMOJI. YOU ARE THE EXPERT HERE, JOHN. I WILL LET YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.  SO WHAT I CAN DO IS ACTUALLY EXPLORE AROUND TO GET THAT CONTEXT. YOU SAID SOMETHING WITH A SPECIFIC EMOJI. IF I RIGHT CLICK ON THAT, I CAN GET LANGUAGE SERVICE NAVIGATION TO GO TO DEFINITION. THAT'S FORWARDED OVER FROM YOUR MACHINE TO MINE. LIKE I SAID, I DON'T NEED TO HAVE IT SET UP ON MY MACHINE TO BE ABLE TO DO THE NAVIGATIONS AND I MOVE OVER TO EMOJI SEARCH.  I'M GOING TO FOLLOW YOU TO KEEP TRACK OF WHERE YOU ARE GOING.  AS YOU SAW, ALLISON CLICKED ON THE AVATAR AND IT FOLLOWED ME TO WHERE I AM. IT WOULD SCROLL ON ALLISON AND WE ARE ABLE TO MOVE IT DIFFERENT FILES AND GUIDE SOMEONE AS YOU ARE TALKING THROUGH A PROBLEM. COOL. SO LOOKING AT THIS, WE NAVIGATED TO A SPECIFIC EMOJI AND ONE OF THE THINGS I CAN DO IS THAT -- BEFORE I TRY TO FIX THIS, ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK IS REALLY COOL IS WE START TYPING MATCH. OOPS. I ACTUALLY GET START IN CODE SUGGESTIONS BASED OFF THE LANGUAGE SERVICE. I DON'T HAVE INTEL CODE AND THIS IS BEING FORWARDED OVER FROM YOUR MACHINE.  THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING THAT, JOHN. THE TEAM REALLY THINKS HE'S GREAT. WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT OF INTEL CODE.  COOL. ON THIS SIDE, WHAT I CAN DO IS I THINK I KNOW THE PROBLEM THAT IS CAUSING THIS TEST TO FAIL. I CAN CLICK ON HERE AND SEE THAT I GET REFACTORANCE AS WELL. I CAN ADD THAT IN AND IT SHOULD HELP FIX THE TEST.  AWESOME.  LET ME SET DOWN THE BREAK POINT TO DEBUG THIS. YOU WILL SEE ON ALLISON'S MACHINE THE BREAK POINT IS OVER AS WELL.  I CAN SEE IT. ARE WE READY TO DEBUG THIS TEST AGAIN?  YES.  COOL. I'M GELLTTING THE OUTPUT HERE.  MIRE DEBUGGER STARTED BECAUSE BOTH STARTED DEBUGGING AND ATTACHING ON YOUR SIDE.  CRAZY COOL.  I SAW THAT BREAK POINT.  AMAZING!  I'M HITTING THAT AND IT'S PROBABLY WORKING. ADDITIONALLY AS YOU CAN SEE, I HAVE THE LOCALS AND THE CALL STACK. I CAN EMPTILY INSPECT TO BE ABLE TO DEBUG AN ISSUE. I CAN EXPAND AND FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON THERE. WE CAN NEGOTIATE CONTROL BETWEEN THE TWO OF US TO STEP OVER OR WHAT NOT TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE FLOW OF DEBUGGING. LET ME STEP OVER. I CAN FIND THE BUTTON. STEP OVER AND IT STOPS AND WE CAN SEE THAT IT HITS THE -- IT THROWS THE EXCEPTION. YOU CAN HIT CONTINUE AS WELL.  LET ME FIND MY CONTINUE BUTTON. IT'S HARD WHEN WE ARE ON SMUSHED SCREENS SOMETIMES.  LET'S SEE IF THE TEST PASSED.  INDEED WE HAVE THE SHINY GREEN CHECK MARK. THANK YOU, JOHN. TEST.E LAST THING IS THIS IS A - SOMETIMES YOU ARE WORKING ON WEB APPS AND YOU WANT TO SEE THE FRONT END TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER YOU ARE WORKING ON IT AND WHETHER THE PROGRAMMING IS ACTUALLY WORKING. LIVE SHARE ENABLES TO YOU SHARE YOUR SERVERS. HOW ABOUT WE TRIED DEBUGGING AS WELL.  CLASS DEBUGGING.  THE DEBUGGERS HAVE START AND ON YOUR SIDE YOUR BROWSER HAS LAUNCH AND ON MY SIDE AS WELL, THE BROWSER LAUNCHED AS WELL TO BE ABLE TO LOAD THE APP. WITH THIS, YOUR LOCAL HOST -- MY LOCAL HOST IS MAPPED TO YOUR LOCAL HOST.  WHAT'S MINE IS YOURS.  EXACTLY. WHETHER YOU ARE WORKING WITH WEB APPS OR DBs OR-YOU ARE ABLE TO SHARE THE SERVER FOR THE PORT THAW ARE WORKING WITH. YOU ARE ABLE TO SHARE THAT WITH YOUR GUEST.  THAT'S SO COOL. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A PRETTY SIMPLE DEMO APP, BUT THE FACT THAT YOU CAN SEE IT AND INTERACT WITH IT IS PRETTY DARN AWESOME.  IT SHOWS UP ON BOTH OF OUR SCREENS.  YOU ARE STILL APPARENTLY -- IT'S LOADING.  IT'S STILL. IS IT OVER HERE? APPARENTLY SOMETHING HAS FROZEN. YOU KNOW, I CAN GUARANTEE Y'ALL ON MY SCREEN IT SHOWS THAT IT IS THERE. REALLY IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAT JOHN HAS IT.  I'M ABLE TO GET THE CONTEXT OF THE APP AND ABLE TO WORK FROM THE COMFORT OF MY OWN TOOLS.  SO COOL.  THE APPLICABILITY IS NOT JUST TO AND WORKS IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS AS YOU ARE ABLE TO NAVIGATE AND BE SYNCHED WITH EACH OTHER HOWEVER YOU WANT. MAYBE YOUR CLASSROOM AND WITH LIVE SHARE, WE SUPPORT UP TO 30 GUESTS AND DO MOD PROGRAMMING TO HAVE 30 PEOPLE TYPING ALLING TO FOR SOUNDS OVERWHELMING. IS THERE ANY WAY TO SELECTIVELY PROMOTE FROM READ ONLY TO READ RIGHT AND BACK. I SEE THAT IN A MOB PROGRAMMING STYLE.  YES, YOU CAN. IF YOU START A READ ONLY SESSION, YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROMOTE THEM TO READ WRITE. YOU CAN TURN THEM BACK INTO READ ONLY AS WELL. YOU HAVE THAT CONTROL. MAYBE YOU ARE GIVING A LECTURE AND YOU WANT A STUDENT TO MAKE CHANGES AND YOU PROMOTE THAT STUDENT TO HAVE READ-WRITE AND AFTER THAT YOU TURN IT INTO READ ONLY. . I REALLY WISH I HAD THAT IN COLLEGE. I WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER PROGRAMMER AND BETTER TEACHER.  COOL. SO I THINK WE FIXED ALL THE ISSUES THAT WERE GOING ON WITH YOUR TEST.  I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE SOLUTION NOW.  LET'S GET YOU READY FOR THE FULL REQUEST. THE LAST THING IS IN ADDITION COEDITING AND NAVIGATION AND SERVICE, YOU CAN SHARE TERMINALS. WHAT ALLISON CAN DO IS GO IN AND SHARE A TERMINAL.  COOL. AGAIN, IF I DON'T TRUST YOU, I CAN DO READ ONLY AND HAVE YOU CHECK IT.  LET ME SHOW YOU -- WE WILL GO FULL SCREEN.  COOL. ALL RIGHT.  THINK I KNOW WHAT THE ISSUE WAS. IT WAS ON MY MACHINE. OH, WELL. OKAY. SO ON ALLISON'S MACHINE, SHE CAN PULL UP A TERMINAL AND SHARE IT WITH ME.  COOL. I'M GOING TO DO READ-WRITE AND I TRUST YOU NOT TO MESS UP MY HARD DRIVE.  ON MY SIDE, A TERMINAL POPS UP AS WELL. I CAN TYPE COMMANDS AND THAT'S HOW THEY EXECUTE ON ALLISON'S MACHINE AS WELL. I CAN TYPE AND SEE HOW IT EXECUTES. SO YOU ARE ABLE TO RUN COMMANDS AS A GUEST TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT THOSE ISSUES. I CAN HELP YOU WITH SETTING THIS UP AND PUSHING THIS.  I KNOW IT'S HARD TO TYPE. AWESOME. COOL. YOU JUST PUSHED THAT AND WENT FOR IT.  I'M VERY CONFIDENT IN THE CHANGES THAT WE MADE.  A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE 40E7 ARE FIGURE THIS REPOSITORY. I HOPE WE DIDN'T MESS IT UP.  YOU CAN ACTUALLY GO AND CREATE A REQUEST FOR THIS USING THE GET HUB EXTENSION. FOR MORE INFO ABOUT THAT AND CREATING REQUESTS AND WORKING WITH THEM, TUNE IN LATER FOR SAMY AND STEVEN'S SESSIONS ON THE GET HUB EXCEPTION.  THEY ARE GOING TO GO REALLY INDEPTH ON HOW TO BE MORE PRODUCTIVE WITH THE FULL REQUESTS. WE WOULDN'T DO IT JUSTICE WITH THE TIME WE HAVE LEFT. ON THAT CLIFF HANGER, WE WILL LEAVE YOU GUYS TO WAIT. A LITTLE LATER ON.  A CLIFF HANGER.  WE READY FOR QUESTIONS?  WE ARE. I SEE LOTS OF HEARTS AND I'M VERY EXCITED.  MY GOODNESS. I'M EXCITED. THIS INCEPTION THING TOOK OFF AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT MYSELF. LET'S GO THROUGH QUESTIONS. I HAVE 47 NEW POSTS. HERE'S GOOD QUESTIONS. WE WILL GO THROUGH IT ALL AS FAST AS WE CAN. WE WANT TO GET TO EVERYONE'S QUESTIONS. WHAT IS THE LIMIT OF CONCURRENT USERS FOR LIVE SHARES?  WE SUPPORT UP TO 30 GUESTS INTO A SESSION.  30. WHAT HAPPENS ON THE 31st?  YOU GET A NOTIFICATION THAT THEY ARE NOT ALLOWING ANY MORE GUESTS. THE SUPPORT FOR UP TO 30 IS A SETTING YOU CAN SET IN THE TOOLS OPTIONS TO HAVE AN INCREASED GUEST LIMIT.  IT'S JUST 30 IS THE MAX FOR ALL OF IT.  UNLESS YOU TWEAK SOMETHING.  BY DEFAULT IT'S FIVE, BUT WE HAVE A SETTING TO GO UP TO 30.  COOL. THAT WAS COOL FOR CLASSROOM SETTINGS. SOMETIMES I HAVE A HARD TIME PAYING ATTENTION. I WAS GOING TO SAY IN CLASS. IF I'M IN THERE WITH THE PROFESSOR, I USED TO TEACH AND HAVING LIKE THE LITTLE BAR THAT SAYS THE STUDENT IS ON THIS LINE AND THEY HIGHLIGHT WHAT PART DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? EVERYONE HIGHLIGHTS THE SAME THING. THAT'S AMAZING.  IT'S ALSO GREAT BECAUS I REMEMBER MAYBE I WASN'T THE BEST STUDENT AND I WAS SITTING FAR BACK FROM THE SCREEN AND SITTING IN THE BACK ROWS. IT'S HARD TO SEE CODE BEING PROJECTED THAT FAR AWAY. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE IF SOMEONE NEEDS HIGH CONTRAST OR LARGER FONTS, HAVING THAT WITH THE WAY YOU LIKE SEEING IT IS INVALUABLE. MUCH EASIER TO PAY ATTENTION.  I FEEL LIKE I WISHED I COULD HAVE HAD THIS. HOW DID THE REGION HANLEY WORK WITH LIVE SHOWS?  IN TERMS OF IF YOU HAVE A CURSOR ON THE SAME LINE? I'M GOING TO GUESS THAT MIGHT BE THE CASE. SINCE THIS IS REALTIME, IF YOU HAVE BOTH USERS TYPING, THEY ARE BOTH MIXED IN TOGETHER AND IT WORKS OUT OF THE BOX.  AWESOME. THIS IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION THAT SPEAKS TO WHAT MACHINE LEARNING IS. THIS IS SUPER NICE. WHY WOULD THEY BE THE FIRST SUGGESTED ITEM AND WE ARE NOT ASSIGNING A VALUE. WE NEED TO CLARIFY THAT. WHY DON'T YOU TELL US?  IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT INTEL CODE LEARNS FROM THE WISDOM OF THE COMMUNITY. THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CASES WHERE SOMEONE IS USING THIS IN THIS SORT OF WEIRD WAY. IT PICKS UP WHEN WE DID OUR CUSTOM MODEL AND PICKS UP IN THE SOLUTION. A FEW NOT SO POPULAR WAYS OF USING STRINGS THAT ARE PREVALENT IN MY SOLUTION THAT ARE NOT IN THE OPEN SOURCE ONE. MACHINE LEARNING IS AMBIGUOUS SOMETIMES. IT'S STILL LEARNING AND WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST YEAR TO GIVE YOU THE BEST SUGGESTIONS POSSIBLE. IT'S STILL IN PREVIEW AND STILL LEARNING. IF YOU FIND THAT USE IS REALLY STRANGE, GIVE US FEEDBACK TO HELP TUNE OUR MODEL.  WE ARE NOT EXPLICITLY PROGRAMMING THIS.  NO. IT'S A SUGGESTION. IT'S A RECOMMENDATION. WE ARE NOT ALWAYS GOING TO BE RIGHT AND DON'T EXPECT TO BE RIGHT ALL THE TIME. WHAT WE HOPE IS THAT ONE OF THOSE TOP FIVE SUGGESTIONS IS WHAT YOU WANT MOST OF THE TIME.  GOT IT.  IS IT POSSIBLE TO USE LIVE SHARE LAN ONLY?  LIVE SHARE LAN ONLY? IF YOU ARE ON THE SAME NETWORK, IT FORMS A DIRECT CONNECTION. IF YOUOR DIFFERENT NETWORKS IT USES AZURE TO COMMUNICATE. IF YOU ARE ON LAN, IT USES AZURE TO COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY. THERE IS A SETTING THAT YOU CAN GO IN TO ENSURE YOU ARE USING DIRECT CONNECTIONS. BY DEFAULT, WE TRY TO DO A DIRECT CONNECTION.  AWESOME. HOW WITH LIVE SHARE HANDLE CONNECTIONS?  IT WORKS PERFECTLY. THEY ARE ABLE TO WORK BETWEEN THE EDITORS AND VISUAL STUDIO CODE. IF YOU ARE ON WINDOWS, MAC, OR LINYX.  CAN YOU HAVE LIVE SHARE WORK AND THUS DIFFERENT PROJECTS AT THE SAME TIME? IS THE REPORT DYNAMIC? I FEEL LIKE THEY ARE GETTING INTO -- I BETTER WRITE THIS DOWN BECAUSE THEY WANT TO USE IT.  YOU CAN HAVE MULTIPLE INSTANCES ON A MACHINE. I HAVE DONE THIS A COUPLE OF TIMES WHERE I'M TESTING OR HAVE MULTIPLE PEOPLE JOINING IN AND MULTIPLE INSTANCES AS WELL.  ALL RIGHT. NEXT QUESTION. CAN ALL CONCURRENT USERS WRITE ON THE CODE AT THE SAME TIME OR IS IT LIMITED TO ONE USER HAVING WRITING RIGHTS? MULTIPLE WRITING PEOPLE?  BY DEFAULT. IF YOU HAD LIKE A READ ONLY SESSION WHERE YOU ELEVATED THEM TO READ-WRITE. BY DEFAULT, EVERYONE CAN COME IN AND TYPE. IF YOU HAVE HACK-A-THONS WHERE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE COME INTO A SESSION AND INTEGRATE EVERYTHING AND THEY CAN ALL TYPE TOGETHER.  THAT'S PRETTY CRAZY.  IT IS.  AND IT KNOWS. LET'S SAY YOU WRITE THIS FUNCTION OR THAT FUNCTION, IT KNOWS TO MOVE THE LINES PROPERLY?  IT'S TAKING ALL OF THAT AND PUTTING IT TOGETHER.  YOU LOOK AT ME LIKE HOW OLD ARE YOU? GOSH. THIS IS 2019, SETH. HOW DOES LIVE SHARE WORK BETWEEN DIFFERENT RESOLUTIONS ON BOTH SIDES?  THIS ISN'T SCREEN SHARING SO YOU ARE WORKING FROM YOUR ENEDITOR. YOU CAN USE WHATEVER RESOLUTIONS YOU ARE WORKING WITH. VERY BIG FOPT OR ON A SMALL SCREEN TO WORK WITH SOMEONE ON A BIGGER SCREEN CONFIGURED TO THE WAY YOU LIKE.  IT'S AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION. YOU ARE NOT SHARING YOUR SCREEN. YOU ARE SHARING THE CODE EXPERIENCE.  YEAH. IT'S THE CONTEXT OF THE CODE, NOT THE SCREEN.  WHEN YOU ARE LOADING IT UP, YOU ARE LOADING UP YOUR VISUAL STUDIO IN YOUR FAVORITE WAY. I ALWAYS SEE AND NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU DO THIS ON PURPOSE. THERE IS ANOTHER DARK THEMED OR LIGHT. YOU WANT TO SHOW THIS IS MY STUDIO IN YOUR CONTEXT.  IF WE HAD MORE TIME, WE WOULD SHOW YOU ONE THAT IS HIGH CONTRAST WITH THE FONT WAY BLOWN UP. THAT'S HARD TO GIVE YOU NICE CONTEXT WHEN WE ARE PROJECTING LIKE THIS.  NEXT QUESTION, DO YOU HAVE TO BE ONLINE TO TRAIN ON YOUR LOCAL CODE?  YES. FOR TRAINING YOU HAVE TO BE ONLINE BECAUSE WE USE A SERVICE IN ORDER TO ACTUALLY TRAIN YOUR CODE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE AND WE HEARD IT A LOT. YOUR CODE STAYS ON YOUR MACHINE. WE DO THIS LOCAL EXTRACTION PIECE WHERE WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANT BITS, BUT THE LOCAL CODE STAYS ON YOUR MACHINE. THE SUMMARY FILE THAT YOU DO HAVE TO BE ONLINE FOR. IT'S PRIVATE TO YOU AND WHOEVER YOU SHARE IT WITH. AFTER THAT POINT, YOU HAVE TO GO OFF LINE BECAUSE WE KEEP A CASH COPY AND WE WILL USE THAT IF YOU ARE NOT ON LINE. IF YOU HAVE CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS, I'M HAPPY TO HEAR WHAT YOU GUYS NEED. SOME PEOPLE WANT FULL LOCAL EXPERIENCE AND WE ARE EVALUATING THAT.  COOL. WHAT VERSIONS OF PROFESSIONAL ENTERPRISE SUPPORT INTEL CODE?  IT'S LIKE I ALMOST FEEL LIKE THAT WAS REHEARSED.  THE SHARE PAIR. WE DID IT SO MANY TIMES THAT WE JUST KNOW EACH OTHER LIKE THIS NOW.  FANTASTIC. HOW DO UNDOES WORK ON LIVE SHARE?  WE SUPPORT A -- IT'S A GLOBAL UNDO RIGHT NOW. BETWEEN THE EDITS THAT YOU AND YOUR GUESTS ARE MAKING, IF YOU Z CONTROL Z, YOU UNCHANGE IN A STACK.  IF I CONTROL ZZZ, I MIGHT MOVE SOMEONE ELSE'S STUFF OUT.  YEAH.  THEN I COULD GET INTO A FIGHT WITH THEM AND CONTROL Z THEM. THAT WENT TOO FAR.  THAT'S WHEN THEY TURN TO YOU READ ONLY.  YOU ARE CUT OFF! IN WHAT WAY IS LIVE SHARE BETTER THAN WORKING IN SKYPE WITH A SHARED DESK TOP?  THERE IS ALWAYS A CASE TO DO SCREEN SHARING N. THE CASE WHERE YOU WANT MORE INDIVIDUAL CONTROL, YOU ARE IN LOCK STEP AND HAVING TO HAVE SOMEONE WHO IS ALWAYS DRIVING AT ONE POINT. SO YOU WOULD HAVE TO HANDOFF ONE PERSON TO MOVE THE MOUSE. WITH LIVE SHARE, YOU ARE EMPTY IN THE SAME CODE BASE. YOU CAN BE IN DIFFERENT FILES OR REGIONS OF THE CODE TO WORK AT YOUR OWN PACE AND THE WAY THAT YOU THINK WITHIN THE CODE AS WELL.  THIS IS COOL. I THOUGHT OF IT AS SCREEN SHARING, BUT IT'S NOT. YOU ARE PROJECT SHARING.  EXACTLY.  NOW I UNDERSTAND. IT ONLY TOOK A HALF HOUR. FROM HUGO WITH VS LIVE SHARE, WHEN I RUN THE FORMAT CODE FEATURE, WHOSE RULES WILL I FOLLOW?  IS FORMAT CODE A COMMAND IS AVAILABLE TO THE GUESTS? WE CAN CHECK THIS. IT WOULD BE -- LET ME INTRODUCE AN ERROR.  WE ARE GOING TO DO THIS LIVE. I HAVE TAKEN AWAY A SEMI COLON.  I SEE THE ERROR.  FOR DOESN'T LOOK LIKE FORMAT CODE IS BEING PORTED OVER. A GUEST CANNOT RUN THE FORMAT CODE. MY EXPECTATION IS WHEN JOHN SUPPORT THIS IS IDEALLY, IT WOULD RUN THE HOST MACHINES. THE HOST MACHINE IS WHAT'S POWERING EVERYTHING. YOU CAN THINK OF ANY GUEST VISUAL STUDIO IS A WINDOW INTO THE HOST MACHINE. I IMAGINE THE HOST MACHINES RULES SHOULD BE RUN, BUT IF ANY OF YOU HAVE STRONG OPINIONS ABOUT WHETHER THAT'S RIGHT OR WRONG, THAT'S SOMETHING YOU SHOULD WEIGH IN ON.  WE'RE HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE HEARING ABOUT GETTING THAT RIGHT WITH WHICH SETTINGS FROM WHO WINS OUT AND IS DEFINITELY AN INTERESTING THING WE WOULD LOVE TO HEAR MORE FEEDBACK ON.  WE ARE ALMOST OUT OF TIME AND THE LAST MINUTE FROM MAX MILLION, WHAT ARE THE LIMITS OF LIVE SHARE?  WHAT ARE THE LIMITS? THE SKY IS THE LIMIT?  YEAH!  YOU CAN DO IT WITH LIVE SHARE.  LEGAL LIKE I JUST LOGGED IT UP TO Y'ALL. GOOD JOB. ALL RIGHT. COMING UP NEXT, WE HAVE SQUASH BUGS AND CODE QUALITY WITH LESLIE RICHARDSON. WE ARE VERY EXCITED TO TOSS IT OVER TO HER. HOW ARE YOU DOING, LESLIE? TAKE IT AWAY, MY FRIEND.  I'M LESLIE RICHARDSON, A PROGRAM MANAGER ON THE VIDEO DEBUGGING AND DIAGNOSTICS TEAM. IN THIS SESSION I WILL SHOW YOU HOW TO SQUASH BUGS AND IMPROVE YOUR CODE QUALITY WITH THE BRAND-NEW DEBUGGING FEATURES FOR 2019. LET'S START. PERFORMANCE IS ALWAYS A BIG DEAL NO MATTER WHAT VERSION YOU ARE USING. WE READ THROUGH YOUR FEET BACK AND LISTENED TO YOUR FEEDBACK AND IMPLEMENTED A LOT OF THAT FEET BACK AND AS WE CONTINUE TO DO ALL THOOE OF THOSE THINGS, HERE ARE NEW DEBUGGER UPDATES. THEY ARE A SINK RONNOUS. IF YOU ARE WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO LOAD, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO INTERACT WITH THE EDITOR AND THE CALLS AND THE IMMEDIATE WINDOW AND ANY OF THOSE WINDOWS THAT YOU HAVE COME TO KNOW AND LOVE. BECAUSE THEY ARE A SINK RONNOUS, THE WINDOWS ARE DOWN BY MORE THAN 70%. THAT THAT IS FASTER THAN EVER AND BLOCK TIME BEING DOWN TO MORE THAN HALF. LAST BUT NOT LEAST, WE HAVE MADE SYMBOLS FOR C++ AND IF YOU ARE A C++ DEVELOPER WHO DEBUGS REALLY BIG APPS REICH A VIDEO GAME, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DEBUG THE APPLICATIONS WITHOUT EXPERIENCING CONSTANT MEMORY-RELATED CRASHES AND ERRORS YOU MIGHT HAVE EXPERIENCED PREVIOUSLY. TO DEMO THIS, I ACTUALLY HAVE A VIDEO OF THIS AND IT'S BEING DEBUGGED INITIALLY IN VISUAL STUDIO 2017. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A HUGE APPLICATION TO DEBUG. IT'S FULL-BLOWN XBOX GAME. THAT CONSUMES A LOT OF MEMORY WHILE I'M DEBUGGING IT. IF YOU WERE TO OPEN IT UP AND ZOOM IN ON THE AMOUNT OF MEMORY IT CONSUMES, IT'S A LOT. NEARLY TWO GIGS AFTER JUST FIVE MINUTES. YOU CAN PROBABLY EXPECT TO SEE LOVELY ERROR MESSAGES REGARDING THE FACT THAT YOU ARE RUNNING OUT OF MEMORY. IN CONTRAST IF YOU DEBUG THE SAME APPLICATION, YOU WILL NOTICE THAT THE AMOUNT OF MEMORY BEING CONSUMED IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN IN 2017 BEING AROUND 400 MEGABYTES AFTER FIVE MINUTES. THAT'S A BIG REDUCTION IN MEMORY CONSUMPTION. IF YOU ARE A C++ DEVELOPER AND YOU ARE ON THE FENCE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT YOU SHOULD BE MAKING THAT LEAP FROM 2017 TO 2019, THIS IS A HUGE INCENTIVE AND YOU MAY BE ABLE TO DEBUG THEM FOR LONGER THAN A FEW MINUTES. IN SOME CASES JUST SIMPLY BEING ABLE TO USE THE DEBUGGER AT ALL WHICH YOU MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO PREVIOUSLY. ALSO NEW IS A FEATURE CALLED JUST MY CODE. THIS WAS SOMETHING THEY INTRODUCED LATE INTO STUDIO 2017. THIS IS A FEATURE THAT WHEN ENABLED, WILL LET YOU AUTOMOBILEALLY STEP THROUGH CODE. MAYBE ONE OF YOUR TEAMMATES THAT PUSHED THROUGH AND YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED IN DEBUGGING IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT RELEVANT TO YOU. ON THE LEFT, IT ILLUSTRATES JUST MY CODE WHEN IT'S IS R DISABLED. THE EXPERIENCE IS NOT A GOOD ONE BECAUSE THEY GOT CAUGHT DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE OF HAVING TO STEP THROUGH A FRAMEWORK CODE THAT THEY CARE ABOUT. IN CONTRAST, AND ON THE RIGHT IT SHOWCASES AN EXPERIENCE THAT IS A LOT NICER AND MORE EFFICIENT BECAUSE YOU ARE ONLY ABLE TO STEP THROUGH THE CODE THAT IS YOURS. IT'S ALSO GREAT BECAUSE IT MINIMIZES THE THINKING OVERHEAD THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO DO WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE JUST MY CODE ENABLED. YOU MIGHT HAVE EXPERIENCED THAT I'M WHERE YOU ARE TRYING TO STEP THROUGH THE CODE THAT'S YOURS. YOU ARE WORRYING ABOUT IF I STEP IN HERE, DOES THAT MEAN I WILL ENTER SOME WEIRD FRAMEWORK CODE THAT I CAN CARE LESS ABOUT OR MISS OUT ON SOMETHING ELSE? YOU NO LONGER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THOSE THINGS WHEN I HAVE JUST MY CODE ENABLE UNDERSTAND. IF YOU WANT TO TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER AND PICK AND CHOOSE WHAT GEES CONSIDERED AS NONUSER CODE, YOU CAN EDIT THE FILE AVAILABLE WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO PICK AND CHOOSE THE FILES AND FUNCTIONS THAT STUDIO DEEMS NONUSER CODE. NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE FUN PART WHICH IS DEMO.  I'M ALSO GOING TO BE USING A CORE APPLICATION AND IT'S DEFORMLY GIVING ME A LIST OF RANDOM BOOKS THAT I CAN CHOOSE TO READ IT. SHOULD ADD THE BOOK TO MY SHELF. THAT'S WHAT IT SHOULD DO. RIGHT NOW I'M NOTICING THAT IF I CHOOSE NOT READ THE BOOK, IT'S GOING TO AND IT MODIFIES THE BOOKS AND ALL THE BOOKS THEY WANT DISPLAYED ON THE PARTICULAR PAGE. WITH THE START OF MY APPLICATION, THIS HITS AFTER A REFRESH. AND NOW I WANT TO HONE IN ON IT AND THAT IS AN OBJECT LISTED IN THE WATCH WINDOW. I COULD JUST EXPAND THIS AND SCROLL DOWN TO FIND THE ITEM THAT I WANT. INSTEAD I'M GOING TO USE THE BRAND-NEW SEARCH TOOL THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR THE WATCH LOCALS AND WINDOWS AND SEARCH FOR IT INSTEAD. I GET WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR. UNTIL YOU FIND THE THAT YOU LIKE. YOU CAN SEARCH FOR IT INSTEAD BECAUSE THAT STAVES A LOT OF TIME. IN THIS CASE I AM INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT WHEN SOMETHING IS BEING ADDED TO THAT LIST AND TO TRACK THAT, I CAN USE A NEW FEATURE AVAILABLE FOR DOT NET CORE CALLED A DATA BREAK POINT. IF YOU ARE A C++ USER, YOU MIGHT BE AVAILABLE BECAUSE THIS FEATURE EXISTED FOR A WHILE. DATA BREAK POINTS ARE ESSENTIALLY BREAK POINTS THAT ALLOW YOU TO HALT YOUR CODE WHEN A PROPERTY CHANGES IN MEMORY. THEY HOPEFULLY DISCOVER WHEN THE LIST IS BEING UPDATED. I NEED TO ACCESS THE COUNT PROPERTY AND I WILL USE SEARCH TO FIND IT BECAUSE IT IS BURIED SOMEWHERE IN THE OBJECT. I WILL JUMP IT UP TO SEARCH MORE THOROUGHLY SINCE IT IS NESTED SOMEWHERE. NOW THAT I FOUND IT, I CAN RIGHT CLICK IT. I KNOW THAT A DATA POINT HAS BEEN CREATED BECAUSE I GET THAT ICON TO THE PROPERTY. I CAN CHECK ON IT IN THE BREAK POINTS WINDOW LIKE ANY OTHER. IF I CONTROL UP AT THE OBJECT CONTAINING THAT PARTICULAR PROPERTY AND OBJECT IDEAS HAVE BEEN CREATED. THIS IS HOW THE STUDIO WILL BE ABLE TO KEEP TRACK OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT OBJECT WHILE MY PROGRAM IS EXECUTING. NOW THAT I SET THE DATA BREAK POINT, I WILL CONTINUE RUNNING MY CODE AND I WILL HOPEFULLY GET MORE USEFUL INFORMATION THE NEXT TIME I PERFORM THAT ACTION. I WILL CHOOSE NOT TO READ THIS BOOK AGAIN AND THIS TIME I GET A NICE NOTIFICATION SAYING THAT MY DATA BREAK POINT IS HIT AND AS AN ADDED BONUS I KNOW WHAT THE PREVIOUS VALUE IS AND WHAT THE NEW VALUE IS. MY LIST INCREASED FROM CONTAINING ONE ITEM TO TWO. ONCE I HIT THAT DATA BREAK POINT, I WILL BE REDIRECTED TO THE EXACT LINE WHERE THAT CHANGE OCCURRED. IN THIS CASE MY SHELVED BOOKS LIST IS BEING ADDED TO UNDER MY AD REJECTED BOOK FUNCTION. LAST TIME I CHECKED, I CHOOSE TO REJECT THE BOOK OR NOT OR CHOOSE NOT READ A BOOK, THAT BOOK SHOULD BE ADD STOD MY REJECTED BOOK LIST. I MIGHT HAVE JUST FOUND MY PROBLEM. I'M GOING TO STOP DEBUGGING AND CHANGE THE SHELVED BOOKS TO REJECTED BOOKS. THAT SHOULD FIX THE ISSUE, BUT JUST TO DOUBLE CHECK, I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND RUN IT AGAIN. NOW CURRENTLY, DATA BREAK POINTS ARE ONLY AVAILABLE FOR DOT NET CORE 3.0 AND HIGHER. IF YOU ARE USING 2.1 OR 2.2 OR EARLIER VERSION, YOU ARE GOING TO NEED TO MAKE THE LEAP UP TO 3.0 IN ORDER TO TRY THIS FEATURE, WHICH IS 3.0 IS CURRENTLY UNDER PREVIEW. DEFINITELY GO GIVE IT A TRY. MIGHT TAKE A MINUTE. HOPEFULLY THIS TIME WHEN I CHOOSE NOT TO READ THE BOOK, IT WON'T BE ADDED TO MY SHELF. AND SURE ENOUGH, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS. THAT WAS DATA BREAK POINTS FOR MANAGED CODE. BRAND-NEW FROM MANAGED CODE. SUPER COOL. I USED IT IN THE INSTANCE THAT I WANTED TO FIND OUT WHEN SOMETHING WAS BEING ADDED OR REMOVED FROM THE LIST. ANOTHER WAY IS MAYBE YOU HAVE A GLOBAL VARIABLE BEING ACCESSED ACROSS MULTIPLE FILES AND MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS. IF YOU WANT TO VOTE WHERE PARTICULAR CHANGE IS HAPPENING, YOU WANT TO USE THE DATA BREAK POINT TO GET IT OUT. IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT OF ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE ACCESSING THAT PARTICULAR VARIABLE. YOU CAN ALSO USE IT IN THE PLACE OF A NORMAL BREAK POINT. SAY YOU HAVE A BREAK POINT ON PROPERTY SETTER. YOU CAN DO THAT TO KIND OF EMULATE THE IDEA OF A DATA BREAK POINT. IF YOU DO THAT, YOU MIGHT HAVE HUNDREDS OF OBJECTS THAT ARE ACCESSING THAT PROPERTY SETTER, WHICH MIGHT RESULT IN YOU HAVING TO CONTINUE WRITING YOUR POINT BECAUSE THAT BREAK POINT GETS HIT SO OFTEN. IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT SIMILAR PROBLEM BY HONING ON IN ON ONE SPECIFIC OBJECT, DATA BREAK POINTS ARE THE WAY TO GO. NOW THAT I FINISHED DEBUGGING THIS, EVERYTHING CHECKS OUT AND I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DEPLOY IT AND PUT IT IN PRODUCTION. I HAVE DRD DONE THAT AND DEPLAY PLOYED THE SAME APPLICATION. THIS TIME I'M NOTICING THAT IF I GO TO THE PAYMENT THAT IS SUPPOSED TO RECOMMEND THE LIST OF BOOKS TO ME, I GET A LOVELY TITLE WITH NO AUTHOR AND IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A GOOD GOOD READ. THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT YOU MOST LIKELY EXPERIENCED WHEN YOU WENT IN AND DEPLOYED AN APPLICATION AND STUCK IT IN PRODUCTION WHERE YOUR APP IS WORKING PERFECTLY FINE AND THE MOMENT YOU SCALE IT OR SHIIT FOR THE WORLD TO SEE, THINGS ARE GOING WRONG. THE INITIAL WAYS TO TRY TO SOLVE OR DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEMS MIGHT BE TO CREATE A READ PRO LOCALLY, BUT THAT CAN BE TRICKY DEPENDING ON THE CAULK PLEXITIES OF YOUR APPLICATION OR MAYBE GOING INTO LOGS OR DUMP FILES IN ORDER TO FIND THE ISSUE, BUT SOME OF THOSE LOGS MIGHT BE INSUFFICIENT. MAYBE THERE IS A SPECIFIC PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT THE LOGS ARE NOT GIVING YOU TO SOLVE YOUR ISSUE. THE NEXT TWO FEATURES I'M GOING TO ADDRESS TO HOPEFULLY ALLEVIATE THOSE PROBLEMS ARE VISUAL STUDIO ENTERPRISE EXCLUSIVE. IF YOU DECIDED YOU ARE ALL IN ON EVERYTHING IT HAS TO OFFER AND ARE AN ENTERPRISE USURE, TRYOUT THESE NEXT TWO FEATURES BECAUSE THEY ARE SUPER USEFUL. IN 2017, WE INTRODUCED THE FEATURE CALLED THE SNAPSHOT DEBUGGER. THIS IS A DEBUGGER THAT WHEN YOU ATTACH TO IT, IT ALLOWS YOU TO DEBUG WHILE THEY ARE RUNNING PRODUCTION ON THE END USER EXPERIENCE. I WILL TRY TO USE IT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS PROBLEM WITHOUT HAVING TO HALT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. TO DO THAT, WE WILL GO TO DEBUG IN THE TOOL BAR AND ATTACH SNAPSHOT DEBUGGER AND UNDER AZURE RESOURCE, I'M GOING TO SELECT THE V NARKS IS HOSTING MY APPLICATION. THIS IS A NEW FEATURE FOR SNAPSHOT DEBUGGER FOR 2019. IN 2017, THE DEBUGGER WAS ONLY COM PAZIBLE WITH AZURE APP SERVICES. WE EXTENDED IT OUT SO SNAPSHOT DEBUGGER IS ALSO COMPATIBLE WITH AZURE FOR THE -- CONTAINERS. I WILL BE USING THE VM AND SELECTED THE STORAGE ACCOUNT I WANT TO USE. YOU ARE GOING TO NEED TO INSTALL THE REMOTE DEBUGGER EXTENSION, OTHERWISE YOU CAN STIP THAT STEP. YOU CAN CHECK THIS FEATURE THAT SOUNDS COOL. IT HAS THAT BUZZWORD THAT I LIKE. NORMALLY THIS IS THE MOMENT WHERE I SELECT ATTACH, BUT BECAUSE IT MIGHT TAKE A MINUTE OR TWO TO INITIALLY ATTACH TO THE SNAPSHOT DEBUGGER, I HAVE ANOTHER INSTANCE OF VISUAL CEO 2019 THAT IS RUNNING THE SAME CODE. YOU WILL KNOW THEY ATTACHED SUCCESSFULLY WHEN YOU END UP ON THIS LANDING PAGE HERE. OKAY, SO LET'S GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS PROBLEM. I'M THINKING THAT A PLACE HOLDER BOOK IS BEING CREATED BECAUSE THE FILE THAT STORES THE CONTENTS OF ALL MY BOOK INFORMATION IS NOT BEING LOADED CORRECTLY. TO TEST THIS THEORY, I'M GOING TO TEST A SNAP POINT INSTEAD OF A BREAK POINT AT THE LINE THAT LOADS UP THAT FILE. YOU WILL NOTICE IT'S A HEXA GON INSTEAD OF A CIRCLE AND IT'S HOL OECHLT THAT'S BECAUSE I NEED TO UPLOAD THE INFO TO THE CLOUD WHICH I DO BY HITTING START COLLECTION. AND AS YOU CAN SEE, IT'S GONE FROM BEING A HOLLOW HEXA GON TO A SOLID ONE. I'M TELLING AZURE THAT THE NEXT TIME I INTERACT WITH MY APPLICATION IN A WAY THAT CAUSES THAT SNAP POINT TO TRIGGER, I WANT THE STUDIO TO TAKE A PICTURE OR A SNAPSHOT OF THE APPLICATION AT THAT PARTICULAR LINE. TO TRIGGER THIS ONE, ALL I NEED TO DO IS REFRESH MY APPLICATION. THIS TIME WE WILL NOTICE THE DIAGNOSTICS TOOL WINDOW, I GOT A SNAPSHOT THAT CORRESPONDS WITH THE POINT I SAID. IN ORDER TO FURTHER INSPECT THE VARIABLES AND UTILIZE THE DEBUGGER FUNCTIONALITY, I CAN SELECT THE SNAPSHOTS HERE. THIS MIGHT TAKE A MINUTE BECAUSE WE ARE REMOTE DEBUGGING. THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THE USER CAN STILL INTERACT WITH THE APPLICATION. TO SOME EXTENT, ANYWAY. THEY WILL INTERACT WITH THE NON-PROBLEMATIC PARTS OF THE APPLICATION AND BE NONE THE WISER ABOUT THE FACT THAW ARE TRYING TO DIAGNOSE PROBLEMS. ALSO WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT THE DEBUGGER IS THAT IT IS SUPPORTED FOR APPLICATIONS THAT MIGHT BE WIDELY DISTRIBUTED. SAY YOU HAVE AN APP THAT'S RUNNING ACROSS MULTIPLE SERVERS AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE THE SNAPSHOT DEBUGGER WITHOUT HAVING TO HALT ANY OF THOSE SERVERS IN THE PROCESS. ALL RIGHT. AS YOU CAN SEE, MY SNAP POINT HAS BEEN HIT AS INDICATED BY THE PINKISH EXECUTION POINTER HERE. YOU WILL ALSO NOTICE THAT I CAN UTILIZE THE LOCALS WATCH AUTOS WINDOWS OR OTHER DEBUGGING WINDOWS AS IF I WERE DEBUGGING THE SAME APPLICATION. IN THIS CASE IF I WENT IN ON THE WINDOW, I HAVE THIS PATH VARIABLE HERE. THAT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD IF IT'S WHAT I THINK IT IS. IF I CHECK OUT THE STRING THAT IS STORED HERE, IT IS A PATH THAT IS BEING USED TO MY FILE. I DON'T WANT TO BE USING THE PATH THAT IS GOING TO BE ACCESSED SINCE THEY ARE BEING HOSTED INSTEAD OF MY LOCAL ENVIRONMENT NOW. FOR FUTURE REFERENCE, I WANT TO CHANGE THAT TO A RELATIVE PATH OR STORE THAT INFO FOR LATER. WHAT PHI WANT TO GET ADDITIONAL LOG INFORMATION THAT TELLS ME THAT A PLACE HOLDER WAS BEING CREATED BECAUSE THAT FILE WAS BEING LOADED INCORRECTLY OR NOT AT ALL. TO ADDRESS THAT INSUFFICIENT LOG PROBLEM, I CAN USE A LOG POINT AND THESE ARE TRACE POINT FIST YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THOSE. THEY ALLOW YOU TO PRINT THINGS TO THE OUTPUT WINDOW OR APPLICATION LOGS IN THE EVENT WITHOUT HAVING TO MODIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CODE. TO DO THAT, I CAN SET A SNAP POINT HERE AND GO TO SETTINGS AND THEN UNDER ACTIONS AND MESSAGE, I'M GOING TO PRINT OUT A SIMPLE MESSAGE. IN THIS CASE I WILL SAY NOT FOUND. PLACE HOLDER CREATED. HIT ENTER AND X OUT OF THAT. AGAIN, I NEED TO UPDATE MY COLLECTION TO SEND THAT UP TO THE CLOUD AGAIN AND I CAN TRIGGER THAT LOG POINT BY REFRESHING MY APP. THIS TIME YOU WILL NOTICE THAT IN ADDITION TO THE TWO SNAPSHOTS THAT CORRESPOND TO THE SNAP POINTS, I GET THE DIAGNOSTICS TOOLS WINDOW THAT GIVES THE ERROR MESSAGE THAT I WANTED IT TO PRINT OUT A MINUTE AGO. PRETTY SWEET. FROM THERE THOUGH WHAT IF I WANTED TO USE STEP THROUGH MY CODE AND THERE WAS A METHOD THEY WANT TO VIEW HOW IT'S BEING EXECUTED WHILE RUNNING IN PRODUCTION? BEFORE 2019, THE ONLY WAY TO REALLY DO THIS WAS KIND OF EMULATE IT. TO DO THAT, YOU HAVE TO SET MULTIPLE SNAP POINTS AND NAVIGATE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE SNAPSHOTS THAT GET CREATED AS A RESULT. THAT'S NOT VERY INTUITIVE AND NOT NECESSARILY THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO GO ABOUT IT EITHER. WHY CAN'T WE STEP REGULARLY? FOR 2019, WE INTRODUCED THIS ADDITIONAL FEATURE CALLED THE CRIME TRAVEL DEBUGGER. THIS IS A TOOL THAT EXPANDS UPON THE SNAPSHOT DEBUGGING. SO LET'S TRY TO USE THAT ON A METHOD THAT I'M INTERESTED IN. IN THIS CASE I WANT TO HONE IN ON MY GET BOOK PLACE HOLDER FUNCTION. I'M CURIOUS TO SEE HOW A BOOK PLACE HOLDER GETS MADE. NOW THAT I GOT THAT, I CAN SET A SNAP POINT AT THE START OF THIS FUNCTION. HOVER OVER IT AND SELECT SETTINGS AGAIN. WE ARE GOING GO INTO I'LL MINIMIZE THIS A LITTLE SO YOU CAN SEE IT. ALL RIGHT. I'M GOING TO CHECK THE OPTION THAT SAYS COLLECT A TIME TRAVEL TRACE TO THE END OF THIS METHOD. WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT WHEN THIS PARTICULAR SNAP POINT GETS HIT, IT WILL RECORD THE ENTIRE EXECUTION FLOW OF THIS METHOD WHILE IN PRODUCTION. NOW THAT I UPDATED THE CL COLLECTION AGAIN, I CAN TRIGGER IT. IT MIGHT TAKE A LITTLE LONGER THIS TIME BECAUSE WE ARE RECORDING THIS ENTIRE FUNCTION THIS TIME. IT'S NOT JUST ONE LINE. ALL RIGHT. HERE'S THE SNAPSHOT THAT CORRESPONDS WITH THE SNAP POINT HERE. WE ARE GOING SELECT USE SNAPSHOT. AGAIN, THIS MIGHT TAKE A MINUTE, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, MUCH LIKE SNAPSHOT DEBUGGER, THE USER CAN PLAY AROUND WITH THE REST WHILE IT'S STILL RUNNING. ANOTHER THING TO NOTE ABOUT THE TIME TRAVEL DEBUGGER IS THAT IT'S CURRENTLY IN PREVIEW MODE. THAT MEANS YOU MIGHT EXPERIENCE SOME WEIRD QUIRKS HERE AND THERE IF YOU START TO PLAY AROUND WITH IT AS OF THIS PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME. JUST KNOW WE ARE WORKING TO FURTHER IMPROVE AND UPDATE AND EXPAND UPON IT AND LATER UPDATES FOR 2019.  LET'S TRY. YOU CAN DO IT.  IT'S ACHING A LITTLE LONGER THAN USUAL SO AT THE VERY LEAST I CAN DESCRIBE WHAT'S GOING ON WITH IT. THINK OF IT AS BEING ABLE TO ONCE YOU RECORD YOUR METHOD, IT'S LIKE BEING GIVEN ACCESS TO THE REMOTE CONTROL TO YOUR AND BEING ABLE TO FAST FORWARD OR REWIND OR STEP BY STEP CHECK OUT AND ANALYZE EACH AND EVERY LINE OF CODE THAT YOU HAVE. YOU CAN STEP FORWARD STRAIGHT AND BACKWARD THROUGH IT. IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE STEP BACK AND ALSO AN ENTERPRISE USER, STEP BACK IS ANOTHER TOOL YOU CAN USE. WHILE DEBUGGING LOCALLY, IT'S SIMILAR TO THAT. WITH A BIT MORE CONTROL.  BECAUSE I'M RUNNING LOW ON TIME UNFORTUNATELY, I MIGHT HAVE TO HALT IT HERE, BUT JUST KNOW THIS IS A PREVIEW FEATURE. IT'S REALLY COOL WHEN IT WORKS. DEFINITELY TRY GIVING IT A TRY, BUT KNOW THAT WE ARE GOING TO IMPROVE UPON IT IN THE NEAR FUTURE. FOR NOW, THAT KIND OF CONCLUDES MY TALK ON THE BRAND-NEW FEATURES AVAILABLE FOR 2019 IN THE DEBUGGING PLACE. DOWNLOAD 2019 AND GIVE IT A TRY.  FANTASTIC. DEBUGGING IS HARD. LUCKILY WHEN I WRITE CODE, I NEVER HAVE TO DEBUG BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS PERFECT.  SHE SAID I KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE. A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS WE HAVE, CAN THE DEBUG WINDOW SHOW A LIST AS A TABLE VISUAL?  GOOD QUESTION. SO CURRENTLY NO, BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE CONSIDERING IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THE CLOSEST WE HAVE IS A DATA SET VISUALIZER WHICH IS A CLASS YOU CAN USE AND USE A VISUALIZER SIMILAR TO THE ONES LISTED HERE. INSTEAD OF GETTING THE TEXT, YOU CAN VIEW THE TABLE AS IF YOU WERE IN EXCEL OR SOMETHING.  THAT'S COOL. YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN VISUALIZERS, TOO. I SHOWED SOMETHING REALLY COOL. IT WAS EXCITING FOR JUST ME. I WAS THE ONLY ONE THERE. DO WE HAVE ACCESS TO THE READING LIST DEMO APP?  NOT AT THE MOMENT, BUT I CAN PROVIDE ACCESS. I HAVE IT ON A PUBLIC GET REPO.  FROM MIKE SIMON, WATCH LOCAL SEARCH MAY BE MY FAVORITE FEATURES OF VS 2019. CAN YOU GO INTO THE CALL STACK FROM THE BREAK?  YES, YOU CAN. THERE MIGHT BE CASES WHERE YOU SET A DATA BREAK POINT AND IT WILL TAKE YOU TO JUST LIKE THE PROPERTY CENTER, BUT THAT MAY NOT BE USEFUL OFF THE BAT. YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO FIND WHO CALLED THAT PARTICULAR CENTER AND YOU GO REDIRECT YOU TO THE PLACE THAT CALLED IT.  WITH DEBUGGING, WHEN I HAVE A LIST OF OBJECTS, I WANT THE X EQUALS VALUE Y. CAN I DO THAT IN VS 2019? I WENT AWAY.  HERE WE GO. I HAVE A LIST OF OBJECTS AND FIND THE PROPERTY -- YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO FIND A SPECIFIC VALUE THAT THE PROPERTY HAS. IF YOU USE SEARCH, YOU CAN SEARCH FOR KEY WORDS ACROSS ALL THREE OF THOSE COLUMNS. THE NAME VALUE AND TYPE COLUMNS. YOU CAN'T USE LOGIC-BASED STRINGS LIKE THAT, BUT YOU CAN SEARCH FOR THE PROPERTY NAME OR THE VALUE THAT YOU EXPECT TO SEE AND FIND IT THAT WAY.  FANTASTIC. CAN YOU USE THE SNAPSHOT DEBUGGER WITH SERVICES RUNNING IN AKS?  YES, YOU CAN. WE EXPANDED IT OUT FOR THE CONTAINERS CURRENTLY. ANY OF THE TYPES MOVE ON TO THE OTHER TWO I'M BLANKING ON AT THE MOMENT. YOU GET THE IDEA. IT'S FOR LINYX.  FANTASTIC. I'M GOING THROUGH TO SEE IF THERE ARE OTHER QUESTIONS. WE WILL SNAPSHOT. DEBUGGER A PLOW C++ THE DEBUGGER?  IT'S ONLY AVAILABLE FOR ASP.NET AND CORE APPLICATIONS AT THE MOMENT.  FROM ENRIQUE, IS THIS DE DEBUGGER FOR STAND ALONE APPLICATIONS? LOOKED LIKE YOU ALREADY TALKED ABOUT IT.  IT'S EXCLUSIVE FOR APPLICATIONS THAT WERE PUSHED IN TO THE AZURE SPACE. YOU ARE UP RUNNING SOMEWHERE ELSE, IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE CURRENTLY.  THEN WE WILL FINISH UP WITH THIS QUESTION. WHAT ABOUT DATA BREAK POINTS FOR OTHER NON-DOT NET PROJECT TYPES?  CURRENTLY THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE STILL WORKING ON. I DON'T HAVE A CONCRETE ANSWER ON THAT PART, BUT THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION THAT I CAN GET BACK TO YOU ON. FOR MAIN.NET CORE APPLICATIONS AND ASP.NET T SHOULD WORK FINE.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THIS HAS BEEN AMAZING. I WANT TO CONTINUE TO SHOUT OUT PEOPLE AND THIS IS FROM PEOPLE THAT ARE WATCHING FROM GERMANY.  SETH, WE HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM FOLKS AROUND THE WORLD AND WE ARE HEARING FROM OUR FRIEND, MIKE, IN MINNEAPOLIS. HOW IS IT GOING WITH THE CROWD IN MINNEAPOLIS?  HOW IS IT GOING? YOU HAPPY WITH WHAT YOU ARE SEE SOMETHING CAN WE HEAR A LITTLE APPLAUSE AND A LITTLE NOISE? ALL RIGHT. TO THE FOLKS OF THE ROOM, WHAT ARE THE THINGS YOU ARE MOST EXCITED ABOUT FROM VISUAL STUDIO 2019?  WE ARE REALLY ENJOYING.  WE ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT ALL KINDS OF NEW SUPPLEMENTS. THE LIVE SHARE.  LIVE SHARE. ALL RIGHT.  INTEL CODE I HEARD FOLKS SAY.  YEAH.  MIKE, LOVE THE THROW BACK HOCKEY JERSEY. THAT'S SOME PREMIUM SWAG RIGHT THERE, MAN. AWESOME STUFF.  THANKS SO MUCH, MIKE. HEY, SETH. BACK TO YOU. THAT'S ANOTHER GROUP IN MINNESOTA THAT IS ENJOYING THE LAUNCH. WE HAVE MORE FOLKS WE WILL BE TALKING TO IN A LITTLE BIT IN BETWEEN SOME OF THE SESSIONS COMING UP.  I'M HAVING A FANTASTIC TIME, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I ALWAYS CALLED "SHIP IT" AND RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TAKING DEVOPS TO THE NEXT LEVEL WITH GITHUB AND AZURE DEVOPS BECAUSE CODE IS ONLY AS GOOD IF YOU SHIP T IT'S ONLY GOOD WHEN YOU PUT IT OUT THERE, IT'S NO GOOD ON VISUAL STUDIO. WE HAVE HERE WITH US STEVE AND STANLEY, THEY ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT GITHUB AND AZURE DEVOPS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MY NAME IS STEVEN BORG OIM ON THE AZURE DEVOPS TEAM. I'M STANLEY GOLDMAN ON ON THE AZURE DEVOPS TEAM. WE HAVE A COUPLE LINKS AND YOU WILL HAVE ACCESS AS WELL, BUT THERE ARE GITHUB REPOSE IF YOU WANT TO REPRODUCE THIS DEMO AT HOME, WE WANT YOU TO FOLLOW ALONG AND SEE THE BENEFITS OF THIS BETTER TOGETHER STORY. IN FACT, THAT'S WHERE WE ARE. WE HAVE THE GITHUB STORY AND THE AZURE DEVOPS STORY AND IT'S BETTER TOGETHER. LET'S START WITH GITHUB. TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT GITHUB. GITHUB IS THE POLICE WHERE EVERYBODY GOES WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT OPEN SOURCE. I'M NOT GOING TO SAY IT'S THE ONLY PLACE BUT IT'S DEFINITELY THE MOST POPULAR ONE. THERE ARE TONS OF OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS BUILT ON GITHUB EVERY DAY. PERFECT. ALSO THERE'S ANOTHER PLATFORM THERE'S SEVERAL PLATFORMS OUT THERE AND TWO OF THE BIGGEST GITHUB AND AZURE DEVOPS SUPPORT THAT TEAM DEVELOPMENT, THAT COLLABORATION BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS ON A DEVELOPMENT TEAM. WE WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT DELIVERING WITH THE AZURE DEVOPS SUITE OF TOOLS WHICH IS SEVERAL TOOLS THAT WORK WELL TOGETHER TO HELP BUILD AND DELIVER SOFTWARE. AS YOU WILL SEE THEY WORK VERY WELL WITH GITHUB. PROBABLY THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS REALLY JUST TO DIVE INTO A DEMO. SURE THING. YEAH, WHY NOT?  LET'S POP IN. I'M GOING TO START OFF ON THE DEMO AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THE WEBSITE THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE USING FOR THE DEMONSTRATION AND IT'S THE CONTOSO AIR WEBSITE. IT'S A FICTIONAL WEBSITE, FICTIONAL COMPANY THAT YOU CAN BUY AIRLINE TICKETS AND TRAVEL ALL AROUND THE WORLD FOR. ON THE SITE HERE IT'S FOR THE DEMOS THAT WE USE AND YOU WILL SEE THERE IS AN AWFUL LOT OF CODE AND A LITTLE BIT OF FORESHADOWING HERE, SOME AZURE PIPELINES ACTION GOING ON AS WELL. COOL. WE'RE KEEPING IT IN GITHUB BECAUSE WE WANT EVERYBODY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS CODE AND TO USE IT FOR THEIR OWN DEMONSTRATIONS ON THAT BETTER TOGETHER STORY. OF COURSE. THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE, HERE IS CONTOSO AIR ITSELF AND WE'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF AN APRIL FOOLS' JOKE GOING ON HERE, WE HAVE CRAWL, WALK, RUN AND DESTINATIONS YOU CAN WALK TO. IT WAS APRIL FOOLS' YESTERDAY IN AMERICA AND SO HUMOR IS HARD. YEAH, IT IS. DEFINITELY HARD TO CRAFT A GOOD APRIL FOOLS' JOKE. IT IS. WE'RE GOING TO DEFINITELY NEED TO REMOVE THIS APRIL FOOLS' JOKE RIGHT AWAY. THAT'S KIND OF WHAT WE'RE USING IS THE CONTEXT OF OUR BETTER TOGETHER STORY. IF YOU LOOK NOW YOU WILL SEE OUR AZURE DEVOPS PAGE. I WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT BOARDS, REPOSE, PIPELINES, ET CETERA, ONCE THE DEMO IS COMPLETE. TO START WITH LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. RIGHT HERE WE WANT TO REMOVE THIS APRIL FOOLS' CODE, IT JUST -- IT JUST WASN'T THAT FUNNY. IF I OPEN IT UP YOU CAN SEE CRAWL, WALK, RUN, SOME DISCUSSIONS HERE, JUST REALLY -- SOMETHING MORE PROFESSIONAL. THIS PARTICULAR BOARD IS AVAILABLE TO ANYONE ON THE PLANET, IT'S A PUBLIC -- A PUBLIC BOARD THAT ANYBODY CAN SEE. SO I'M MOVING THAT OVER INTO THIS ACTIVE COLUMN JUST IN HOPES THAT SOMEBODY, ANYBODY OUT THERE IN THAT OPPORTUNITY IS GOING TO PICK THAT UP AND WORK ON IT. I JUST HAPPEN TO BE AN OPEN SOURCE MAINTAINER. I MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN GIVING YOU A HINT. ALL RIGHT.  SO SWITCH OVER TO MY COMPUTER AND I AM GOING TO OPEN UP VISUAL STUDIO 2019. FROM VISUAL STUDIO 2019 I CAN SIMPLY HIT CLONE OR CHECK OUT CODE, HEAD OVER TO GITHUB AND I BELIEVE I'VE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPOSITORY BEFORE SO IF I START TYPING IN YOUR NAME IT SHOULD JUST COME UP. AND THERE WE GO, STEVEN BORG, CONTOSO AIR. I'M GOING TO GO OVER AND HIT CLONE. WHAT THIS IS DOINGS IS IT'S SIMPLY CLONING IT FROM GITHUB, BRINGING IT DOWN LOCAL TO YOUR MACHINE, OPENING IT UP IN VISUAL STUDIO. GIVE VISUAL STUDIO A SECOND TO CATCH UP AND HERE WE GO. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT YOUR PROJECT, LOOKING AT TEAM EXPLORER. THIS IS TEAM EXPLORER, NOW THEY SEE WE HAVE A GITHUB URL, ACTIVATES THE GITHUB PLUG IN AND SOME OF OUR FEATURES SHOW UP HERE. YOU CAN SEE RIGHT HERE THAT THIS REPO IS BEING CLEANED DIRECTLY FROM STEVEN BORG'S ACCOUNT IN GITHUB. THE FIRST THING I WANT TO DO IF I MAKE A CHANGE IS FOR THE REPO.  FORKING, CLONING, CODE REQUESTS. SURE. TIE THOSE TOGETHER FOR ME. RIGHT. IN OTHER WORDS, IN ORDER TO SEND YOU A CHANGE, I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO -- I DON'T HAVE RIGHT ACCESS TO YOUR REPO AND GITHUB BUT I CAN FORK YOUR PROJECT SO I CAN MAKE THE CHANGES IN MY ACCOUNT AND SEND YOU A PULL REQUEST WITH THOSE CHANGES FOR YOU TO REVIEW IN ACCEPTANCE OF YOUR PROJECT. EXCELLENT.  LET'S GIVE IT A SHOT. I'M GOING TO COME HERE TO THE TEAM EXPLORER AND I'M GOING TO USE THIS FORK FEATURE WE ADDED RECENTLY. I'M GOING TO FORK YOUR REPO OVER TO MY ACCOUNT. NOW, WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WE'RE FORKING THE REPO ON GITHUB, ALSO WHAT THIS PLUG IN IS DOING FOR US, THIS IS CHANGING THE REMOTE SO THE REMOTE'S ORIGIN POINTS TO MY FORK, ALSO GIVES ME UPSTREAM WHICH POINTS TO THE ORIGINAL. THAT'S SOMETHING I WOULD HAVE HAD TO DO MYSELF IN GIT IF I DIDN'T HAVE THE PLUG IN FOR VISUAL STUDIO. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE TRY TO ADDRESS IN THE GITHUB PLUG IN, WE TRY TO FIND WORK FLO HE IS THAT MAKE YOUR LIFE EASIER. A PERSON THAT'S WORKING WOULD HAVE TO GO TO GITHUB AND WELL VERSED IN THE GIT COMMANDS BUT THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO THAT THEMSELVES. ALL RIGHT.  ALL RIGHT. SO FIRST THING I'M GOING TO DO IS CHANGE TO A NEW BRANCH. SO FIX APRIL FOOLS' IS WHAT I'M GOING TO NAME THIS BRANCH. NOW IF I REMEMBER RIGHT THE LANGUAGE CHANGES WERE OVER IN LOCALES EN, RIGHT?  I BELIEVE SO. OKAY. COOL. SO HERE WE HAVE DECISIONS YOU CAN WALK TO, APRIL FOOLS'. WHAT SHOULD WE CHANGE THAT TO SAY?  SOMETHING LIKE YOUR PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATIONS. OKAY, COOL. SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE.  I'M GOING TO LEAVE A MISSPELLING THERE ON PURPOSE. SO CRAWL, WALK, RUN AND THIS SHOULD SAY FLY, FLY, FLY SHOULDN'T IT?  ABSOLUTELY. WE ARE ALL ABOUT -- ALL ABOUT FLYING. I CAN'T TYPE RIGHT NOW, OF COURSE.  ALL RIGHT. CHANGE IS MADE.  NOW, THIS IS A REALLY SIMPLE CHANGE. I MEAN, WE ARE JUST MAKING SOME CODE CHANGES BUT THE IDEA IS THAT THIS CHANGE CAN BE RELATIVELY COMPLEX, WE CAN BE CROSSING MANY CODE FILES. YEAH, OF COURSE. I MEAN, RIGHT, THIS IS JUST A SIMPLE EXAMPL WHERE THE TEXT ISN'T THAT MUCH TO CHANGE. I'M GOING TO COMMIT MY CHANGES AND PUSH THEM. OKAY.  SO CHANGING THE TEXT, I'M GOING TO CHOOSE COMMIT ALL AND P PUSH. NOW, THAT'S PUSHING OFF TO YOUR REPOSITORY. YES. DO I SEE IT YET?  YOU DON'T SEE IT YET, IT'S PUSHING TO MY FORK AND GITHUB. OKAY. NOW I'M GOING TO FROM HERE HEAD OVER TO THE GITHUB PLUG IN AND CREATE PULL REQUEST. SO I'M GOING TO NAME THIS REMOVING APRIL FOOLS'. AND YOU WERE TELLING ME ABOUT SOME WAY TO LINK A PULL REQUEST WITH AN AZURE BOARD ITEM. ABSOLUTELY. IF YOU SIMPLY SAY FIXES AB POUND SIGN AND THEN IN IDENTIFIER IN OUR CASE 443, THAT WILL LINK THOSE TWO TOGETHER. THAT'S COOL. AND THAT COMES OUT OF THE AZURE BOARDS INTEGRATION. THAT'S CORRECT. FIXES AB POUND 443 YOU SAID?  THAT'S CORRECT. ALL RIGHT. SO CREATE PULL REQUEST. SOMETIMES -- THERE WE GO. AND IT SHOWS ME RIGHT THERE THAT I CREATED THIS PULL REQUEST IN CONTOSO AIR 8 AND I CAN CLICK TO THE PULL REQUEST AND I CAN SEE IT'S ALREADY CREATED. I CAN FEEL A LITTLE VIBRATION ON MY PHONE, I GOT AN ALERT THAT SAYS, HEY, THERE'S SOMETHING NEW. SOMEONE HAS DONE SOMETHING. SO WE CAN COME BACK TO MY CODE AND I CAN TAKE A LOOK AT MY MACHINE AND TAKE A LOOK AT IT. SURE. LET'S GO AHEAD. I'M OUT ON GITHUB.COM AND I CAN SEE THAT I HAVE A PULL REQUEST. IF I OPEN UP THE PULL REQUEST I CAN SEE A FEW CORE THINGS ABOUT IT, HERE IS REMOVING APRIL FOOLS'. AS I OPEN IT UP I CAN SEE IT FIXES AB 443. I'M DIRECTLY ON GITHUB BUT IF I CLICK THAT LINK IT BRINGS ME OVER TO AZURE BOARDS. THAT'S COOL. I CAN SEE IT AND I CAN SEE WHAT IT WAS RESOLVING. I WILL ALSO POINT OUT THAT THERE IS A LINK OVER HERE TO THE RIGHT, IT'S A GITHUB LINK I CAN SEE THE GITHUB LOGO AND IT'S THAT REMOVING APRIL FOOLS' SO I CAN GET RIGHT BACK TO IT. LET ME GO BACK TO MY GITHUB PULL REQUEST AND THERE IS A COUPLE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. AND FROM RIGHT HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT PIPELINES I'VE GOT SOMETHING GOING ON, SOMETHING COOKING. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE I HAVE A BUILD THAT'S EXECUTING AND THT BUILD IS GOING TO RUN A BUNCH OF TESTS, CHECK FOR CODE COVERAGE, BASICALLY IT'S GOING TO TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ON WHETHER YOUR PULL REQUESTS IS SOMETHING I SHOULD TAKE. OKAY. IT GIVES ME THE WARM FUZEES RIGHT OFF THE GET GO. SO THAT CHECK HAS STARTED. A COUPLE THINGS THAT I CAN DO, I CAN GO IN AND LOOK AT THE FILES CHANGED BUT I WILL WANT TO DO THAT IN VISUAL STUDIO. THAT'S MY ENVIRONMENT, THAT'S WHERE I LIVE DAY TO DAY. IF I OPEN UP VISUAL STUDIO I CAN GO OVER TO MY PULL REQUESTS AND REFRESH THOSE AND I CAN SEE THIS REMOVING APRIL FOOLS' AND IT WAS SUBMITTED BY YOU A MINUTE AGO, LET ME JUMP INTO THAT AND FROM THE PULL REQUEST I CAN STAY RIGHT INSIDE OF MY VISUAL STUDIO ENVIRONMENT. LET'S SEE THE CHANGES YOU MADE, SEE IF THESE ARE ANY GOOD. SURE. I'M GOING TO OPEN UP THIS JSON FILE AND I CAN READ FLY, FLY, FLY, YEAH, THAT'S BETTER THAN CRAWL, WALK, RUN. YOUR PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATIONS. OH, A LITTLE BIT OF A MISSPELLING THERE. I MIGHT JUST JUMP IN AND OPEN THIS UP AND SAY, PLEASE CORRECT THE SPELLING OF RECOMMENDATIONS. AND IT'S REALLY NICE TO MEET YOU. IT MAY BE SOMETHING -- YOU'RE GIVEN THIS PULL REQUEST, THIS IS OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY. I DIDN'T GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO HELP ME OUT. OF COURSE. YOU JUST CAME IN AND DID IT YOURSELF AND I LOVE THAT, BUT IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU, BUT I'M STILL GOING TO WANT TO START THIS REVIEW. SO I'M GOING TO START A REVIEW AND I MIGHT MAKE A COUPLE OTHER COMMENTS HERE. THIS FLY, FLY, FLY, I MIGHT SAY, LOVE IT. HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE AND IT'S GOING TO BE OUR NEW LOGO. I'M GOING TO ADD THAT REVIEW COMMENT TO THE PLACE. I'M GOING TO COME OVER HERE TO THE RIGHT WHERE I'M VIEWIN MY PULL REQUEST AND I'M GOING TO CONTINUE MY REVIEW. THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR HELP. A COUPLE CHANGES AND I WILL SUBMIT THAT REVIEW AND I'M GOING TO REQUEST THOSE CHANGES. OKAY.  NOW, ALL OF THIS STUFF THAT I'M DOING INSIDE VISUAL STUDIO COULD ALSO BE DONE OUT ON THE GITHUB WEBSITE. YEAH. AND IT WORKS, BUT THIS -- I'M RIGHT HERE. RIGHT. I'M SEEING MY CODE. THIS IS MY CODE EDITOR. WHY LEAVE VISUAL STUDIO IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO. AGREED. SO NOW IT'S BACK IN YOUR COURT, THE BALL IS BACK IN YOUR COURT. LET'S GO OVER BACK TO MY SCREEN AND I AM GOING TO GO BACK TO VISUAL STUDIO, REFRESH THIS PULL REQUEST SCREEN, I CAN SEE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME COMMENTS HERE ALL RIGHT. I CAN SEE THAT YOU'VE REQUESTED CHANGES ALL FROM HERE. IF I OPEN UP THIS FILE IN THE DIFF I CAN SEE ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS IN THE LINE. LET ME FIX THAT. I WILL HIT ENTER, TAKES ME RIGHT TO THE FILE, DELETE THAT ONE EXTRA M, SAVE SPELLING FIX, COMMIT ALL AND PUSH. SO THAT'S BEING PUSHED UP TO GITHUB, ADDED TO MY PULL REQUEST AND BALL IS IN YOUR COURT AGAIN.  LET'S COME RIGHT BACK OVER TO MY SCREEN AGAIN. ANOTHER VIBRATION TELLING ME, HEY, I HAVE A PULL REQUEST COMING IN, A CHANGE TO THE PULL REQUEST. IF I OPEN UP THE REMOVING APRIL FOOLS' AND SCROLL DOWN I'M GOING TO SEE A FEW I THINK SO THIS. FIRST I'M GOING TO SEE THAT THIS CHANGE IS OUTDATED, I CAN SCROLL DOWN FURTHER AND I CAN SEE THAT WE HAVE SOME COMMENTS OUT FROM SOME OF THE FOLKS -- AGAIN, WE'RE WIDE OPEN, RIGHT?  YES, OF COURSE. FOR WORK. OODNESS THAT WAS SAFE-  FOR BETTER OR WORSE. ALL CHECKS HAVE PASSED, I'M LOVING IT HERE, BUT I NEED TO REVIEW THESE CHANGES. I'M GOING TO DO THIS RIGHT HERE AND GO OVER TO MY FILES CHANGED AND SEE THE DIFFERENCE NOW. I'VE GOT CRAWL, WALK, RUN THAT BECAME FLY, FLY, FLY, AND WE HAVE SOME BACK AND FORTHS THERE. WE CAN SEE YOUR PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATIONS AND, YEP, IT'S SPELLED CORRECTLY. I'M GOING TO RESOLVE THIS OVERALL CONVERSATION, CALL IT GOOD, AND FROM HERE I CAN GO AHEAD AND APPROVE THIS REVIEW. I'M DONE. I LIKE IT. COOL. IT'S GOOD. WELL DONE. THANK YOU. WELL DONE OUT THERE. THANK YOU. I WILL SUBMIT THAT REVIEW. SOMT CHECKS HAVEN'T YET COMPLETED. FRANKLY I NORMALLY WANT TO BE PATIENT. THESE THINGS RUN IN ABOUT A MINUTE TO TWO MINUTES TO RUN ALL MY TESTS, DO MY UNIT TESTS, ANALYZE MY CODE COVERAGE AND PUBLIC OUT THE DETAILS. IF I TALK LONG ENOUGH IT WILL UPDATE, BUT FOR OUR CASE WE HAVE A CODE CHANGE, I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MERGE THAT PULL REQUEST. ALSO BEFORE MORE PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET GET TO IT. RIGHT, EXACTLY, AT THIS POINT. LET ME MERGE THAT APPROXIMATELY REQUEST. MERGE PULL REQUEST AND LET'S CONFIRM IT. I WILL CONFIRM THAT PULL REQUEST AND AT THIS POINT IT'S NOW MERGED INTO MY MASTER. NOW, THIS IS A REALLY CHAPPED.ING BACK AND FORTH - YOU HAD NO AK SKES TO MY SOURCE CODE BUT THIS IS A COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT THAT'S OUT IN THE OPEN. WE CAN COLLABORATE. CLEARLY OUT IN THE OPEN. YES. TOO MUCH SOMETIMES. EXACTLY. IF I GO OVER TO MY AZURE TEAM BOARDS AND I LOOK AT MY AZURE TEAM BOARDS WHAT I'M GOING TO FIND IS THAT THAT FIX, REMOVE APRIL FOOLS' CODE WAS AUTOMATICALLY MERGED AND THEN MOVED INTO THIS REMOVE APES FOOL CODE. THAT WASN'T FUNNY. I CAN MOVE IT OVER AND I CAN SAY, YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO MOVE THAT TO CLOSED. I MAY NOT WANT TO DO THAT QUITE YET UNTIL I VERIFY IT'S OUT IN THE WEBSITE. IN THE WILD. OUT IN THE WILD. BEFORE I DO THAT I WANT TO WALK THROUGH SOME OF THE THINGS YOU GET WITH AZURE DEVOPS. YOU SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON THE REALLY WONDERFUL PULL REQUESTS AND THE WAY PEOPLE INTERACT OUT ON GITHUB. NOW I WANT TO SHOW SOME OF THE POWER OF AZURE DEVOPS AND WHY YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE THAT AS ON. ON AZURE DEVOPS IT'S MADE UP OF SEVERAL HIGHLY RELATED PRODUCTS. BOARDS IS ONE OF THOSE PRODUCTS THAT HEAVENS US CONNECT IDEAS TO RELEASES AND LET'S US DO SCRUM AND KANBAN AND GIVES US HEALTH OF OUR OVERALL HELP. UNLIMITED GIT AND TEAM FOUNDATION VERSION CONTROL HOSTING FOR PRIVATE REPOSE AS OPPOSED TO THE PUBLIC AND PUBLIC SUPPORT. WE HAVE PIPELINES AND I WILL COME BACK TO THAT IN JUST A MOMENT BECAUSE THAT'S A REAL NICE INTEGRATION TO TALK ABOUT. TEST PLANS HELP US MANAGE KIND OF OUR MANUAL TESTS AND OUR AUTOMATED -- AND OUR EXPLORATORY TESTS AND COLLECT ENOUGH DATA THAT WE CAN ROW PRODUCE THOSE BUGS. ARTIFACTS HELPS US SHARE CODE EFFECTIVELY THROUGH THINGS LIKE NEW GET. IT MANAGES A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PACKAGES FOR US. LET'S GO BACK TO PIPELINES BECAUSE I THINK PIPELINES IS IMPORTANT HERE. ON THE PIPELINES SIDE WE'RE GOING TO SEE WE HAVE A COUPLE THINGS HAPPENS MERE. FOR A BUILD, WE HAVE A BUILD THAT'S CURRENTLY EXECUTING AND THAT'S THAT BUILD OFF THAT MERGE PULL REQUEST. RIGHT. NOW, NO THE ONLY DID I WANT TO CHECK YOUR PULL REQUEST, I ALSO NOW THAT I'VE MERGED IT IN I WANT TO RUN THAT TEST AGAIN. OKAY.  SO THAT'S CURRENTLY RUNNING AT THIS MONTH IN TIME AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S RUNNING RIGHT HERE. WE CAN DRILL IN AND SEE DETAILS ABOUT IT, IT'S RUNNING ON A ONE TWO AGENT, I CAN SEE SOME OF THE CONSOLE OUTPUT. RIGHT NOW IT'S GOING THROUGH COMPONENT DETECTION AND MAKING SURE THAT ALL OF MY OPEN SOURCE COMPONENTS WILL LEGIT. NEXT THING WE CAN SEE ARE RELEASES AND I'M GOING TO POP BACK TO TAKE -- THIS RELEASE IS WAITING. YOU HAVE IT CONFIGURED TO DEPLOY AMOUNT CLOO HE. YES, ANYTIME SOMEBODY CONTRIBUTES TO MASTER WE'RE GOING TO GO ALL THE WAY THROUGHOUT AND DEPLOY IT. WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO RUN TESTS AND CHECKS ON THAT. THE RELEASES -- I'M GOING TO STEP BACK, I'M STILL EXECUTING, BUT I CAN STEP BACK EARLIER AND SEE SOME OF THE EARLIER ONES AND WE CAN SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE, WE CAN LOOK AT OUR LOGS, HOW WE DOWNLOADED THE ARTIFACTS FROM OUR REPOSITORY, PULLED THEM ALL IN, DID THE DEPLOYMENT OUT TO THE AZURE WEBSITE. COMING BACK TO RELEASES, LET'S SEE IF IT'S -- IT'S STILL CHUNKING ALONG. OF COURSE. WE ARE NOT QUITE THERE YET. RIGHT, BECAUSE WE'RE DEMONSTRATING. BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT. SOMETIMES IT TAKES A LITTLE WHILE TO GET THE RELEASE OUT TO PRODUCTION. THESE ARE ALL THE THINGS THAT TIE TOGETHER. THE LAST THING I WANT TO SHOW, TWO THINGS, I WANT TO GO BACK TO BOARDS AND I WANT TO OPEN UP THAT APRIL FOOLS' WASN'T FUNNY, WE OPEN UP THAT CODE, ONCE AGAIN, WE HAD THIS LINK OUT TO THIS REMOVING APRIL FOOLS'. WE CAN GO STRAIGHT OUT AND SEE THAT CODE. WE'VE ALSO SEEN OUT ON GITHUB THAT IT'S HIGHLIGHTED ADDS AN INTEGRATION POINT. I CAN CLICK AND COME STRAIGHT INTO IT. IF YOU WANT TO SET THIS UP, VERY QUICKLY TO SET THIS UP YOU SIMPLY GO INTO PROJECT SETTINGS AND SET UP YOUR GITHUB CONNECTIONS RIGHT WITH BOARDS. IT'S AN EASY CONNECTION, WALKS YOU RIGHT THROUGH A WIZARD OR YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE YOUR GITHUB IDENTITY AND WHERE YOU WANT TO CONNECT IN GITHUB AND THOSE WILL TIE THOSE TWO TOGETHER. THAT'S COOL. THAT LIGHTS UP THAT FEATURE. IF YOU WANT THE AUTOMATED BUILDS AND RELEASES IN THE PIPELINES PIECES, THAT'S RIGHT OUT HERE AS WELL. IF I CONTROL TO THE TOPIC GO TO THE GITHUB MARKETPLACE, I COULD ALSO DO IT FROM WITHIN AS WELL, BUT I'M GOING TO COME OUT TO THE GITHUB MARKETPLACE AND SEARCH FOR PIPELINES AND RIGHT HERE ARE AZURE PIPELINES. I CAN CONTINUOUSLY BUILD AND DEPLOY TO ANY PLATFORM. PIPELINES IS AMAZING, I BARELY COVERED IT A LITTLE BIT, BUT IT ALLOWS US TO BUILD AND DEPLOY OFF OF A SINGLE CONFIGURATION FILE TO LINUX, MAC OS AS WELL AS WINDOWS. IT'S ANY PLATFORM, ANY LANGUAGE, ANY CLOUD, IT'S NOT JUST MEANT TO PUSH TO AZURE BUT IT DOES IT REALLY WELL.  WE CAN SEE. THAT'S A MISCONCEPTION PEOPLE SOMETIMES HAVE, BUILD AND DEPLOY SYSTEM FOR PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING. AND IT'S BEST IN CLASS FOR OPEN SOURCE. SINCE WE'RE TALKING GITHUB. SURE. PROBABLY WORTH MENTIONING THAT IF YOU HAVE AN OPEN SOURCE PROJECT YOU HAVE UNLIMITED MINUTES WITH PIPELINES. YEAH, I'VE HEARD THAT. BUILD AND DEPLOY UNTIL YOUR HEART IS CONTENT. EXCELLENT. AND THAT BRINGS US RIGHT BACK TO QUESTIONS. FANTASTIC. QUESTIONS. FIRST OF ALL, I WILL TELL YOU HOW I FIRST USED SOURCE CONTROL. I LOST AN ENTIRE FOLDER OF THINGS LIKE 15 YEARS AGO AND THAT'S WHEN MY LOVE AFFAIR WITH GIT STARTED. YEAH. IT'S CONTINUED EVER SINCE WITH GITHUB. YEAH, PLEASE -- LIKE IF THE FIRST THING YOU CAN DO IS PUT STUFF IN THE SOURCE CONTROL YOU SHOULD DO THAT. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET TO SOME QUESTIONS. LET'S SEE HERE. THERE IS A LOT OF LIVE SHARE STUFF HERE GOING ON. HERE IS ONE MORE POST. SO HERE IS A QUESTION, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I STRUGGLE WITH AS A GIT USER IS I'M TERRIFIED THAT I'M GOING TO MESS SOMETHING UP. TELL ME HOW THE STUFF INSIDE OF VISUAL STUDIO IS HELPING WITH THAT A LITTLE BIT.  SURE.  THAT'S ALL YOURS. OKAY.  COOL. EXPLORER IS A BUILT IN PART OF VISUAL STUDIO AND IT HAS THE COMMIT AND BRANCHING TOOLS, ANY GUI INTERFACE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO MESS AROUND WITH THE COMMAN LINE AND POSSIBLY MAKE A MISTAKE. YEAH, BECAUSE LIKE I REAR THE FIRST TIME I DID THE THING AND -- YOU'VE ALL DONE THIS, OKAY, SO NOBODY -- WHERE YOU WERE JUST LIKE I WILL JUST DELETE IT AND CHECK IT OUT AGAIN.  UH-HUH. IS THE STUFF IN VISUAL STUDIO THERE TO HELP US? IS IT LIKE THE BUMPERS WHEN I'M BOWLING?  FOR INSTANCE, IF YOU GO TO COMMIT AND YOU HAVEN'T SAVED ALL YOUR FILES IT WILL ACTUALLY ACTIVELY REMIND YOU. MAYBE YOU WANT TO SAVE THESE FILES BECAUSE YOU'RE COMMITTED. SO THERE ARE SOME -- DEFINITELY SOME BUMPERS THAT KEEP YOU WITHIN THE LANES FROM MAKING MISTAKES. THE OTHER THING THAT'S INTERESTING TO ME AND THIS IS THE PART THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SET UP ON SOME OF MY OPEN SOURCE STUFF IS LIKE WHEN PEOPLE LIKE DO LIKE A MERGE OR A PULL REQUEST, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU HAVE STUFF CHECKING WHETHER IT CAN DO THAT. MAYBE I MISSED IT BECAUSE I GRABBED SOME CHIPS DURING THIS SHOW, I'M SORRY, BUT HOW DO YOU SET THAT UP SO THAT IT DOES THE CHECKS AS WELL? DID YOU SHOW THAT OR IS THERE LIKE A REAL EASY WAY -- A LITTLE BIT. THAT'S SET UP RIGHT THROUGH INTRODUCING A YAMMEL FILE. SO AS SOON AS YOU CONNECT THOSE UP WE PICK UP THAT YAMMEL FILE AND CAN BUILD OUT THAT BUILD SYSTEM THAT WILL CHECK EVERYTHING OUT AND MAKE SURE THAT THE CODE IS BUILT, COMPILED, UNIT TESTS ARE EXECUTED, CODE COVERAGE IS DONE. AND A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS INCLUDING ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO DEPLOYMENT IF WE NEED TO. OR YOU CAN FLIP IT AND GO INTO AZURE PIPELIES AND BUILD THE PIPELINES STRICTLY FROM WITHIN AZURE PIPELINES AND KEEP IT OUT OF SOURCE CONTROL IF YOU PREFER.  OH, WOW. MY PREFERENCE IS SOURCE CONTROL. YOU WANT TO TRACK THE CHANGES OF IT. VERSION EVERYTHING. I'VE SEEN THE YAMMEL FILE, IT'S LITERALLY DO THIS FIRST THEN DO THAT, IT'S NOT SUPER COMPLICATED. I WAS ABLE TO DO THAT MYSELF SO IF I CAN YOU CAN, TOO, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO HOOK IT UP SOMEHOW INTO AZURE PIPELINE. WHAT'S THE PROCESS FOR DOING THAT FROM GITHUB? I KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO DO. ABSOLUTELY. RUN RIGHT TO THE MARKETPLACE, SEARCH FOR PIPELINES, ONCE PIPELINES OPENS UP YOU CAN CLICK ON IT, SCROLL DOWN, THERE IS A BUY NOW BUTTON AND YOUR TOTAL COST PER MONTH SAYS ZERO DOLLARS PER MONTH. CLICK ON PURCHASE AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME AND IT WILL BRING YOU THROUGH A NICE WIZARD TO HELP YOU CONNECT UP THOSE TWO PIECES. AWESOME.  AND THAT CONNECTS YOU TO -- I ALSO WAS ABLE TO DO THAT. SO THAT MEANS ANYONE CAN, I'M PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. HERE IS A COUPLE QUESTIONS, NOW THEY'RE STARTING TO COME IN. WHAT IS THE BEST PLACE TO FIND TRAINING CONTENT ON VS 2019 SPECIFICALLY AROUND THE WHOLE INTEGRATION WITH GITHUB AND DEVOPS?  SURE. I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS ONE. GITHUB EXTENSION BECAUSE AS I PULL OPEN THE GITHUB EXTENSION FOR THE FIRST TIME, I SIMPLY INSTALLED IT AND THE FIRST THING THAT POPPED UP WAS, HEY, IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE HERE ARE SOME VIDEOS AND THE DIRECT DOCUMENTATION WITH DIRECT LINKS. WATCH SOME VIDEOS, GET FAMILIAR WITH IT AS WELL AS SEE THE DOCUMENTATION. I SHOULD MENTION IF YOU ARE IN AZURE REPOSE WE HAVE THE EQUIVALENT EXPERIENCE BAKED RIGHT INTO THE TEAM EXPLORER THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO DO THAT WHOLE PULL REQUEST FEEL RIGHT FROM INSIDE OF VISUAL STUDIO BUT DO IT TO AZURE REPOSE AS WELL. AWESOME. DID YOU WANT TO ADD SOMETHING?  NO, THERE IS A TEAM WORKING ON AN AZURE -- WELL, PROBABLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION FOR YOU SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL GO AHEAD FIRST. IS THE REVIEW EXPERIENCE WITH VS 2019 ONLY AVAILABLE FOR GITHUB REPOSE OR ALSO AVAILABLE FOR AG ROW POSE. WE MAKE THE EXTENSION FOR GITHUB REPOSE, THERE IS ALSO A TEAM AT MICROSOFT THAT WORKS ON AN AZURE DEVOPS PLUG IN. WE ARE OFTEN IN AT THAT UKS WITH THEM BECAUSE THEY PLAY OFF OF EACH OTHER, SHARE FEATURES THAT ARE IN VISUAL STUDIO CORE ITSELF. IT'S A DIFFERENT PLUG IN, I BELIEVE IT'S CALLED PULL REQUESTSER AND, YEAH, YOU CAN FIND IT ON THE MARKETPLACE AS WELL. AWESOME. THIS BRINGS UP THE NEXT TOPIC BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IN OUR AZURE -- IN OUR AZURE PIPELINES THERE'S ALSO BOARDS AND THERE'S ALSO REPOSE AS WELL, BUT I LIKE TO USE GITHUB, FOR EXAMPLE, BUT IT'S OKAY, BECAUSE WE ARE AZURE DEVOPS AS WELL. HOW DO THEY GET MARRIED TOGETHER? I KNOW THERE IS A WAY IF I SAY FIXES NUMBER TWO, RIGHT, IT DOES SOMETHING IN GITHUB, IS THERE A WAY TO DO THIS ALL TOGETHER? THIS I THINK GETS TO THE HEART OF CONRAD'S QUESTION CAN VS 2019 REVIEW PULL REQUESTS IN AZURE DEVOPS AS WELL AS PULL REQUESTS.  WE USE THE AZURE DEVOPS PULL REQUEST AS YOU MENTIONED AND IT HAS A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE. ALTERNATIVELY YOU CAN GO OUT TO AZURE DEVOPS WEBSITES. THE PULL REQUEST THAT YOU SEND IN AZURE DEVOPS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE PULL REQUEST THAT YOU SEND IN GITHUB. OF COURSE, THEY'RE DIFFERENT PLACES. HERE IS A QUESTION FROM SEAN, IF MY TEAM HAS A CORPORATE AZURE DEVOPS ACCOUNT IS GITHUB INCLUDED WITH IT?  IT DEPENDS. YOU WILL NEED TO CHECK WITH YOUR MICROSOFT ALLEYS FOX TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION. THERE ARE SEVERAL SKEWS THAT INCLUDE GITHUB WITH VISUAL STUDIO. AWESOME. NEXT QUESTION FROM AN INSECURE DEVELOPER, I THINK WE MIGHT BE RELATED, ANY PLANS OF MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO CONFIGURE AZURE DEVOPS PIPELINES INSIDE OF VS 2019?  CURRENTLY THAT'S SOMETHING ON THE ROADMAP BUT I'M NOT MAKING ANY COMMITMENTS TO THAT PARTICULAR PIECE. OH, NICE. I WISH I COULD. VISUAL STUDIO A WONDERFUL PLACE TO DO THAT AND IT MAKES TOTAL SENSE, BUT I CAN'T KMITY TO FUTURE DEVELOPMENT ON THOSE. AWESOME. NEXT QUESTION, CAN YOU CREATE A NEW BRANCH FROM WORK ITEM FOR GITHUB REPO WHEN YOU DON'T USE REPOSITORY IN AZURE DEVOPS. THAT'S A LITTLE ECONOMIC YER, THAT IS SOMETHING ON A HIGH PRIORITY FOR FUTURE FEATURES. IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE INSIDE OF A WORK ITEM INSIDE OF AZURE BOARDS, YOU CAN CLICK BRANCH RIGHT FROM THE WORK ITEM AND IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE USING AZURE REPOSE, THAT INTEGRATION ALREADY OCCURS AND THAT BRANCH IS JUST MADE FOR YOU. THAT'S COMING FOR GITHUB BUT IT'S NOT HERE YET. AWESOME. FROM ROBERT, IS GIT STASH SUPPORTED IN VS 2019?  IT IS. IT'S ONE OF THE MORE POPULAR THINGS I'VE HEARD ABOUT IS THAT THERE'S FINALLY STASH SUPPORT. I HAVEN'T USED IT YET, I SAW IT RECENTLY JUST NOW, BUT, YEAH, I HAVE YET TO USE IT. I LITERALLY JUST FIGURED THIS OUT A COUPLE MONTHS AGO AND I'M LIKE YOU CAN DO WHAT?  IT'S AMAZING.  COMMIT BUT NOT COMMIT. IT'S LIKE BEING NOT COMMITAL. YOU CAN SWITCH BETWEEN BRANCHES AT YOUR LEISURE AND STASH AND POP IT OFF WHENEVER YOU WANT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS HERE? VERY GOOD. CAN I DROP USING GITHUB AND USE ONLY THE EXTENSION IN VS 2019? YOU ACTUALLY ARE USING GITHUB IF YOU'RE USING THE GOITY HAD YOU BEEN EXTENSION. YOU'RE STILL USING GITHUB. THE EXTENSION DOESN'T HAVE EVERYTHING THAT YOU CAN DO ON GITHUB. THEY ARE ABLE TO DEVELOP ON GITHUB.COM A LOT FASTER THAN WE ARE ABLE TO CATCH UP WITH THEM IN THE EXTENSION. THINGS LIKE MERGING FINAL ACTIONS YOU WILL BE TIED TO GITHUB BUT WE TRY TO GIVE YOU BASIC FUNCTIONALITY WITHIN VISUAL STUDIO. I'M IN VISUAL STUDIO AND EVEN IF SOMETHING TAKES ME OUT THAT I HAVE TO GO OUT, YOU PROVIDE A LINK THAT TAKES ME RIGHT TO -- THERE ARE WAYS TO GET LINKS. FOR INSTANCE, YOU CAN GET HIGHLIGHTED LINKS THAT WILL TAKE YOU TO A BRANCH AND HIGHLIGHT LOANS OF CODE IN GITHUB.COM FOR YOU TO SHARE. THERE ARE A LOT OF INTEGRATION WITH GITHUB, YOU CAN'T REALLY LEAVE IT. IT'S LIKE THE BACK END TO ALL THE GLORIOUS THINGS. I DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT ANYMORE. HE HAVE A COUPLE MINUTES. FINAL TAKE AWAY, WHAT SHOULD PEOPLE GO DO TODAY?  I THINK YOU SHOULD GO OUT AND START CONTRIBUTING TO GITHUB FIRST AN OPEN SOURCE PROJECT. THE GITHUB EXTENSION, SURE. BRING IT DOWN, INSTALL IT LOCATED HE WILL A, INSTALL IT VISUAL STUDIO 2017, PUT IT IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019, RELEASE CANDIDATE 2019 THAT'S DOWNLOADED. THE EXTENSION COMES BY DEFAULT INSTALLED INTO VISUAL STUDIO, I THINK YOU JUST HAVE TO ENABLE IT. FANTASTIC. DO THAT, THEN GO FIND AN OPEN SOURCE PROJECT AND CONTRIBUTE. I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE BEST THINGS YOU CAN DO AND IT'S AN EXCELLENT MARK ON YOUR RESUM. AS A HIRING INSTRUCTOR, ANYBODY HIRING, WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GO? YOU'RE GOING TO GO LOOK AT PEOPLE'S GITHUB REPOSE. WHAT HAVE THEY DONE AND CONTRIBUTED TO AND I LIKE THAT. AWESOME. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. I BELIEVE JEFF IS HERE SOMEWHERE, I THINK HE'S RIGHT NEXT TO ME. HEY. HOW IS IT GOING, SETH?  FANTASTIC. BUD. HOW IS EVERYTHING GOING OVER THERE?  I'VE BEEN MAKING PHONE CALLS, REACHING OUT TO OTHER FOLKS AROUND THE COUNTRY AND I CONNECTED WITH THE HOST OF THE SIX FIGURE DEVELOPER PODCAST, CHECK IT OUT, HERE THEY ARE FROM ST. PETERSBURG, FLORIDA, IT'S JOHN ASH, CLAYTON HUNT AND JOHN CALLAWAY. HOW IS IT GOING, FELLAS?  GOING GREAT.  I THINK I'VE GOT A PRETTY COLORFUL BEARD HERE, BUT, JOHN ASH, DEAR LORD, YOU, MY FRIEND, HAVE THE BEARD OF THE DAY THERE. WOW.  YEAH, I THINK I'M GOING TO MAYBE GO PURPLE. IT'S A WONDERFUL LOOK.  HOW IS IT GOING THERE IN ST. PETERSBURG? A LOT OF EXCITEMENT AROUND THE LAUNCH OF VISUAL STUDIO WITH YOUR GROUP?  YEAH. WE'RE HERE WITH THE ST. PETE MEET UP.  HEY, THERE YOU GO. [ APPLAUSE ]  ALL RIGHT. THAT'S TERRIFIC. NOW, IN THE ROOM WHAT ARE SOME OF THE FEATURES THAT YOUR FOLKS ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019?  WHAT ARE YOU ALL LOOKING FORWARD TO? SOUNDS LIKE LIVE SHARE, SOMEBODY SAID THEY WERE REALLY LIKING THE DEVOPS STUFF. OKAY. OKAY. VERY COOL. WELL, THANKS SO MUCH, GUYS. I APPRECIATE YOU JOINING US AND EVERYBODY THERE IN ST. PETERSBURG, I HEARD UBER STOPPED BY WITH SOME FOOD, ENJOY AND WE HOPE YOU ENJOY THE REST OF THE EVENT HERE, BUT I'VE BEEN WANTING TO LEARN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. SO, GUYS, I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW A THING OR TWO ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. HOW IS IT GOING OVER THERE?  I SURE DO. THEY ARE GOING TO LET ME ACTUALLY DO SOME CODE. I AM PRETTY EXCITED HERE. LET ME PULL THIS OUT HERE BECAUSE I CAN HEAR TOO MANY PEOPLE RIGHT HERE. ONE OF THE COOL THINGS IS THAT NOW IT'S THE LUNCH BREAK, BUT -- OKAY, THEY'RE TELLING ME I'M GOOD NOW, BUT WE'RE GOING TO DO SOME AI STUFF BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE AI IS KIND OF THE COOL THING RIGHT NOW, BUT IF YOU'RE LIKE ALSO A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING WITH WHAT IT IS IT ACTUALLY DOES, I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU TODAY WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES AND THAT IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY SIMPLE TO GET STARTED. SO I'M JUST GOING TO OPEN VISUAL STUDIO HERE AND SHOW YOU LIKE FROM SCRATCH LIKE THAT'S REALLY FAST. AND THEN WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS OPEN THIS PROJECT AND WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. I HAVE A COUPLE SLIDES. THE VISUAL STUDIO -- I HAVE THE RELEASE CANDIDATE INSTALLED RIGHT NOW. SO NOTICE THAT IT LOADS UP PRETTY FAST, EVERYTHING IS IN THERE. LET ME SHOW YOU THE APPLICATION WE'RE GOING TO BUILD AND THEN I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW VISUAL STUDIO HELPS ME OUT WITH THAT. LET ME MAKE MY CODE A LITTLE BIT BIT BIGGER HERE. LET ME GO TO I THINK 150 SO YOU CAN SEE. VERY GOOD. THAT'S ALL SET UP. WHAT I'M GOING TO DO NOW IS I'M GOING TO RUN THIS AND I'M GOING TO GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO OLD SCHOOL. THIS IS LIKE WIN FORM STUFF, OKAY? THIS IS A WINFORMS PROJECT JUST TO SHOW YOU THAT AI DOES NOT CARE WHERE IT RUNS. OKAY? SO I'M GOING TO RUN THIS PROGRAM AND SHOW YOU LIKE WHAT IT IS THAT WE'RE BUILDING AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THE TWO FUNCTIONS THAT WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY BUILD IN ORDER TO GET THIS TO WORK AND WE'RE GOING TO BE BUILDING PYTHON. THIS IS GOING TO BE COOL. NOTICE THAT THIS HERE IS A PROGRAM AND I'M GOING TO DRAW WITH MY FINGER A NUMBER AND THEN WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE IT BUT NOTICE THAT NOTHING HAPPENS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WRITE THAT BIT YET AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. IF WE GO TO THIS, OLD SCHOOL, WINFORMS APPLICATION, YOU CAN SEE THERE IS A PREDICT AND THERE IS A LOAD MODEL. NOW, HERE IS THE THING ABOUT MACHINE LEARNING THAT'S REALLY COOL, WE BE YOU THINK OF AN AI MODEL LITERALLY ALL YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IS THINK OF IT AS A FUNCTION. I WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. WHEN WE WRITE PROGRAMS WE USUALLY THINK OF A PROBLEM AND THEN WE COME UP WITH A SERIES OF STEPS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM CALLED AN ALGORITHM. WE MARRY AN ALGORITHM AND INPUT AND OUT COMES THE ANSWERS. MACHINE LEARNING IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. BY THE WAY, I'M GOING TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS AS WELL SO MAKE SURE YOU GET THOSE IN THERE AS WELL. MACHINE LEARNING IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. WE SIMPLY SWAP TWO THINGS, NOW INSTEAD OF GETTING THE ALGORITHM AS PART OF THE THING THAT GOES FROM THE LEFT-HAND SIDE THE ALGORITHM IS THE THING THAT COMES OUT OF THE RIGHT. SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IS BASICALLY FOR MACHINE LEARNING YOU'RE GIVING A BUNCH OF ANSWERS AND THE RIGHT INPUT AND THEN IT LEARNS THE RIGHT THING TO DO ON ITS OWN. SO, BY THE WAY, IN MACHINE LEARNING PARLANCE WE CALL THE THING COMING IN DATA, I THINK EVERYONE CALLS IT THAT AND THE THING THAT COMES OUT IS A MODEL. YOU SHOULD THINK OF IT AS A FUNCTION, SOMETHING THAT YOU EXECUTE. THEN STUFF HAPPENS IN HERE. I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO TOO MUCH OF THE STUFF. I WANT YOU TO SEE THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT COMES IN AND WHAT COMES OUT TO SHOW YOU HOW TO ACTUALLY USE AI INSIDE OF A .NET PROGRAM. BASICALLY WE WANT SOMETHING LIKE THIS, WE WANT TO GET DIGIT AND PASS IN PA PICTURE AND WE WANT A NUMBER TO COME OUT. BASICALLY WHEN YOU SAW THIS, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW THIS HERE WHEN I RAN IT BECAUSE I WANTED TO SHOW YOU WHAT THE INPUT LOOKS LIKE HERE, SO I'M GOING TO DRAW THE NUMBER THREE AND HIT RECOGNIZE. IN THE OUTPUT WINDOW YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE HERE WHAT IT IS THAT THE COMPUTER ACTUALLY SEES. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GIVING THE MACHINE. THIS BIG LONG STRING. IF YOU SQUINT ENOUGH YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE INTO THE MATRIX THAT THAT IS EXACTLY THE THING THAT I DREW. DO YOU SEE THAT? IF YOU SQUINT AT IT. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GIVING THE COMPUTER. IF YOU THINK OF THE INPUT THAT'S THE PICTURE WE'RE GIVING THE ACTUAL COMPUTER. THIS BECOMES IMPORTANT WHEN YOU TRAIN THESE THINGS BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON. NOW, AS WE GO I WANT YOU TO NOTICE THAT THE TOOL IS GOING TO START TO MELT AWAY AND BECOME SUPER IMPORTANT TO WHAT I'M DOING. THIS IS -- HOPEFULLY THIS WILL BECOME APPARENT. OKAY. SO I'M GOING TO GO BACK OVER HERE, WE WANT TO GET A PICTURE IN THERE, WE WANT TO PASS OUT A DIGIT AND IN GENERAL MACHINE LEARNING IS ALL ABOUT CREATING SOME FUNCTION AND YOU HAVE TO SPECIFY THE SHAPE AND DO ALL THESE THIS OTHER COOL STUFF BEFOREHAND BUT YOU GET THIS FUNCTION, YOU PASS IN THESE NUMBERS AND OUT COMES THE ACTUAL NUMBER, RIGHT? AGAIN, THE THINGS THAT GOES IN IS THAT HUGE ARAY OF NUMBERS. OKAY. SO THAT'S IT FOR MY SIDE. SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I AM GOING TO CODE THIS THE WAY I WOULD NORMALLY CODE SOMETHING LIKE THIS, OKAY? SO I'M GOING TO DO THIS, I'M GOING TO RIGHT CLICK HERE AND I AM GOING TO ADD A NEW PROJECT AND THIS IS THE THING THAT I WANT TO SHOW YOU BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE THE TOOL STARTS TO SHOW UP AND BE REALLY COOL, RIGHT? NOTICE THAT THE FIRST THING -- THE FIRST THING IS THAT IT REMEMBERS SOME OF THE STUFF THAT I'VE ALREADY DONE AND I WANT TO DO A PYTHON APPLICATION. THE OTHER THING I CAN DO IS I CAN GO IN HERE TO THE LANGUAGE AND PICK THE LANGUAGE THAT I WANT OR I CAN GO TO SEARCH FOR WHATEVER TEMPLATES I WANT TORQUES I CAN PICK THE PLATFORM, PICK THE PROJECT TYPE AS WELL. ONE OF THE COOL THINGS THAT YOU SEE HERE IS IT ALSO HAS ONE FOR MACHINE LEARNING, THERE IS SOME DEFAULT SIDE KIT LEARN PROJECTS THAT YOU CAN BY DEFAULT START RUNNING. I LOVE HOW FAST WE CAN GET TO DOING THE THING THAT WE WANT. SO I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND SELECT A PYTHON APPLICATION BECAUSE THAT'S GENERALLY HOW I DO MY AI AND I'M GOING TO CALL THIS THE TERMINATOR FOR NO GOOD REASON AND I'M GOING TO HIT CREATE. SO NOW NOTICE THAT I'M ACTUALLY IN THE SAME SOLUTION WORKING ON BOTH PYTHON CODE AS WELL AS C# CODE. OKAY. SO NOW AS YOU KNOW IF WE WANT TO WRITE SOME MACHINE LEARNING CODE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO SOME INTERNET SLEUTHING. I'M GOING TO SAY PIE TORCH MNIST HERE, THAT'S THE EXAMPLE -- HOPEFULLY THERE IS AN EXAMPLE THAT I CAN DO, SO HERE IS ONE, THIS IS THE FIRST ONE, NOTICE IT HAS THE SAME NUMBERS THAT I HAVE AND, OKAY, SO WE HAVE SOME CODE HERE SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I AM JUST GOING TO COPY IT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT SOME OF US DO SOMETIMES AND I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PASTE IT. I AM JUST GOING TO RUN THIS CODE AS IS. OKAY? NOW, AGAIN, NOTICE THAT I'M USING VISUAL STUDIO, NEXT TO THIS -- NEXT TO -- YOU CAN SEE I HAVE THE CODE SIDE-BY-SIDE, BOTH IN PYTHON AND IN .NET AND WHAT I HAVE GOING ON HERE, LET ME PUT THIS BACK SO THAT THEY ARE ALL NEXT TO EACH OTHER, WHAT I HAVE HERE IS I HAVE THE ACTUAL CODE TO RUN LIKE DIGIT RECOGNITION. OKAY? BUT THERE IS A COUPLE THINGS, FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE PYTHON USERS, NOTICE THAT THERE IS SOME ARGUMENTS THAT I WANT TO PASS IN, HOW DO I DO THAT? THE OTHER THING IS LIKE IF YOU ARE A PYTHON DEVELOPER YOU KNOW WHAT VERSION OF PYTHON YOU'RE RUNNING, HOW DO YOU KNOW? I DID NOT HAVE VISUAL STUDIO, I REPAID MY MACHIN A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND I INSTALLED MY PYTHON ENVIRONMENTS THE WAY I LIKE THEM FIRST AND THEN I INSTALLED VISUAL STUDIO. LOOK AT THIS GOODNESS RIGHT HERE. I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS A LITTLE BIT BIGGER. LOOK AT THIS. IT KNOWS ALL OF MY ENVIRONMENTS THAT I PREVIOUSLY SET UP, HERE IS ONE FOR FLOW ACTUAL, 112, NEW JERGS 20, THIS IS USING THE PIE TORCH LATEST VERSION AND NOTICE THAT THE CONDA ENVIRONMENTS ARE NOFT THE ONES THAT VISUAL STUDIO -- I WENT IN THERE AND SAID DON'T INSTALL YOURS, USE MINE. THEY WERE LIKE WE'RE GOOD WITH THAT. NOTICE THAT WE HAVE ALL OF THAT GOODNESS IN HERE. OKAY. THE NEXT THING I NEED TO DO IS I NEED TO RUN THIS THING, RIGHT, BUT I WANT TO SAVE THIS INTO A FORMAT THAT ACTUALLY WORKS. SO I'M GOING TO GO DOWN AND SCROLL HERE. NOTICE THAT WE HAVE SOME SAVING STUFF HERE. I WANT TO SAVE THIS NOT INTO A PT FILE BUT INTO SOMETHING CALLED ONYX. AGAIN, ONYX IS JUST -- THINK OF IT AS A DLL OR AS A JAR FILE, IT'S A WAY OF ENCAPSULATING AN AI ALGORITHM. SO I WANT TO IS A I HAVE THIS TO ONYX. LIKE I SAID BEFORE WHAT WE DO WHEN WE WRITE CODE IS WE NEED TO GO AND ACTUALLY DO SOME INTERNET SLEUTHING. YOU CAN SEE HERE THAT I HAVE ALREADY DONE SOME INTERNET SAVE SOMETHING TO ONYX.AY TO - I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND I'M JUST GOING TO COPY THIS HERE REAL QUICK AND I'M GOING TO GO BACK HERE. NO ONE EVER DOES THIS KIND OF CODING, I DON'T THINK. OKAY, SO I'M -- NOTICE THE FORMAT IS A LITTLE WRONG SO I AM GOING TO DO THIS. OKAY. I THINK THIS WILL WORK SO LET'S GO TO THE SOLUTION EXPLORER AND WE NEED TO GIVE IT SOME ACTUAL -- REMEMBER WE HAD TO GIVE IT SOME THINGS TO DO. THERE IS THE WORKING DIRECTORY, LET ME ZOOM IN SO YOU CAN SEE. ALL THE STUFF YOU WOULD EXPECT TO RUN A PYTHON APPLICATION BUT TO DEBUG IT WE INTO HE HAD TO PASS IN SPECIAL SCRIPT ARGUMENTS. LET'S GO AND SEE WHAT THEY ARE. EPOX IS THE NUMBER OF LOOPS THAT IT NEEDS TO GO THROUGH. I AM JUST GOING TO DO ONE FOR NOW. BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS ALL WORKS. SO LET'S GO TO THE TERMINATOR CODE HERE. EPOX IS ONE AND THEN I'M GOING TO GO HERE AND I WANT TO ACTUALLY SAVE THE MODEL TO A FILE. I'M GOING TO HIT -- I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SAVE MODEL IS IN THERE AND NOW I'M GOING TO SAVE IT AND I AM GOING TO SET THIS AS THE STARTUP PROJECT AND I'M GOING TO RUN IT. OKAY? JUST LIKE WE WOULD ANY OTHER THING. NOTICE THAT IT STARTS TO RUN, RIGHT, EVERYTHING IS GOING IN THERE. YOU CAN SEE EVERYTHING IS STARTING TO GET IN THERE. HOPEFULLY -- LET'S SEE, LET ME GO BACK HERE. ALL RIGHT. EVERYTHING IS RUNNING. RIGHT? YOU CAN SEE EVERYTHING IS HUNKY-DORY, JUST LIKE I WOULD DO ANYTHING ELSE. RIGHT NOW IT'S LEARNING FROM A BUNCH OF DIGITS THAT IT DOWNLOADED AND IT'S GOING THROUGH THE -- AND THE REASON WHY I DO THIS, AGAIN, I JUST DOWNLOADED THIS FROM SOME RANDOM CODE AND -- UH-OH. LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A PROBLEM -- OH, ONYX IS NOT DEFINED. NOW, HERE IS THE THING, I KIND OF DID THIS ON PURPOSE BECAUSE THIS IS JUST WHAT I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED IF I WAS RUNNING IT IN C# EXCEPT FOR I WAS DUMB AND I FORGOT TO ADD SOMETHING. SO LET'S GO UP TO THE TOP BECAUSE I FORGOT TO ADD THIS IMPORT STATEMENT, GOOBER THAT I AM. WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND STOP AND GO UP TO THE TOP AND ADD THIS UP TO HERE, NUMBER ONE, AND THERE IS ANOTHER ERROR THAT I SAW HERE. LIKE I DON'T THINK THIS FILE EXISTS SO I'M GOING TO CALL IT THE CNN MODEL.ONYX HERE AND WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS ONE MORE TIME. I'M GOING TO RUN THIS ONE MORE TIME AND HOPEFULLY IT WORKS. CROSSING OUR FINGERS. CROSSING -- I'M CROSSING MY FINGERS RIGHT NOW. SO AS THIS GOES, AGAIN, NOTICE THAT SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED, A BREAK POINT STOP RIGHT WHERE I WANTED IT TO STOP AND I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON. THIS IS THE SAME THING THAT I WOULD HAVE DONE, YOU KNOW, AT OTHER TIMES WITH C# AND THIS IS COOL BECAUSE I'VE NEVER LIKE RAN PYTHON INSIDE OF -- LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING ELSE IS GOING ON. LET'S LOOK AT THIS X HERE. LET'S SEE. OH, LOOK AT THAT, I THINK I SEE IT. SO IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S EXPECTING A FOUR DIMENSIONAL TENSER AND INSTEAD I PASSED IT A ONE DIMENSIONAL TENSER. LET'S FIX T LET'S GO HERE AND SAY X AND WE WILL USE SOME PIE CHARTS HERE. WE WILL VIEW MINUS ONE AND WE'RE GOING TO DO A VIEW, MINUS ONE AND WE HAVE ONE CHANNEL, 28 BY 28 AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT. NOW, IF YOU'RE THINKING WHAT THE HECK IS HE DOING, IT TURNS OUT WHEN WE GIVE IT A LOT OF PICTURES, IF YOU THINK OF A PICTURE AS A SET OF PICTURES THAT'S THE FIRST VALUE THAT WE'RE DOING, HOW MANY ARE WE GIVING IT? I PUT A MINUS ONE IN THERE TO TELL IT JUST WHATEVER IT LEFT OVER. ONE SAYS THERE'S ONE CHANNEL, ONLY GRAY SCALE, 28 BY 28 IS THE SIZE OF THE PICTURES WE'RE GIVING IT AND I THINK THIS PART WILL WORK. CROSS MY FINGERS ONE MORE TIME AND I THINK WE GOT IT. NOW, AGAIN, THE COOL THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT I'M DEBUGGING AND I'M DOING EVERYTHING EXACTLY THE WAY I THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE DONE IT IF IT WAS C#. SO AS THIS GOES THROUGH LOOKS LIKE WE ARE AT 60, 70, 80, 90, THIS SHOULD ALL SAVE CORRECTLY. BOOM. WE SAVED IT, EVERYTHING IS LOOKING HAPPY AND LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT IT IS THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY SAVING. SO LET'S GO TO OPEN FOLDER AND FILE EXPLORER AND LET ME CLICK ON THAT THING CALLED THE CNN MODEL AND YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT AGAIN IT'S JUST A FUNCTION BUT THAT'S FORMATTED IN A VERY FUNNY WAY. THE INPUT THAT COMES IN IS THOSE 784 NUMBERS THAT YOU SAW FROM THE CODE I RAN BEFORE IN WINFORMS AND THEN A BUNCH OF STUFF HAPPENS AND OUT COMES THIS THING THAT'S 1 BY 10 WHICH MEANS THAT THE OUTPUT IS GOING TO BE TEN WIDE. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS IN THAT ARAY OF TEN THINGS THERE'S GOING TO BE A NUMBER IN EACH SLOT THAT SAYS WHICH NUMBER IT THINKS IT IS. ALL RIGHT. SO NOW THE QUESTION IS WE'VE ALREADY DONE THAT, I ACTUALLY TRAINED A SMARTER ONE, YOU CAN SEE THIS ONYX ONE IS SMARTER BECAUSE I TRAINED IT FOR A LITTLE BIT LONGER AND SO THAT'S THE ONE WE'RE GOING TO USE. SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO SWITCH OVER TO VISUAL STUDIO, I'VE JUST TRAINED THIS THING -- I'M SORRY, WE WILL SWITCH OVER TO C# AND WE'RE GOING TO START TO LOAD THE MODEL. I'VE ALREADY WRITTEN SOME OF THE HELPER CODE DOWN HERE TO -- LIKE INITIALIZE THE CANVAS AND THE SHOW RESULTS. I'M GOING TO START BY WRITING THIS THING CALLED AN INFERENCE -- INFERENCE SESSION AND WE WILL CALL IT SESSION. NOW, HERE IS THE THING, YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING WHERE DOES THIS EVEN COME FROM? THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. WHAT I DID BEFOREHAND, I WILL SET THIS AS THE STARTER PROJECT, IS I ADDED A NOUGAT PACKAGE. ANYTIME YOU DO SOMETHING IN ONYX YOU CAN RUN THIS THING IN .NET CALLED THE ONYX RUN TIME. WHAT THE ONYX RUN TIME DOES IS IT ALLOWS YOU TO LOAD UP FILES ONYX FILES AS IF IT WERE SOMETHING TO EXECUTE AND THEN IT EXECUTES THEM. SO WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT THE SAME WAY THAT ANYONE ELSE WOULD. SO I'M GOING TO DO THIS, HERE IS SESSION, EQUALS NEW INFERENCE SESSION, IT KNOWS ABOUT THAT AND IT, LOO LIKE IT NEEDS A FILE. SO WE'RE GOING TO GIVE IT THE FILE, THERE WE GO, AND THAT'S IT. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE OUTPUT, THE TEXT BOX UP HERE, LET'S SEE HERE, SO WE CAN TELL THAT IT'S LOADED, THE URL IS LOADED. SO TEXT URL.TEXT EQUALS LOADED. OKAY. SO LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WORKS AND LET'S SEE WHAT'S ACTUALLY IN THERE. I'M GOING TO RUN THIS HERE AND SET A BREAK POINT LIKE WE WOULD ANY OTHER TIME. SO LET ME LOAD UP THE MODEL HERE AND WE WANT THIS ONE RIGHT HERE AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S LOADED AND LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S ACTUALLY IN THE SESSION ITSELF. THIS IS THE COOL BIT. UNDERSTAND WE HAVE THE INPUT METADATA AND NOTICE THAT -- LET ME OPEN IT UP A LITTLE BIT MORE AND LET ME ZOOM IN HERE. IT DISAPPEARED TOO SOON. I'M GOING TO DO A QUICK WATCH. SO LET'S DO A QUICK WATCH HERE AND LET'S ZOOM INTO WHAT IT IS THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY LOADING UP. NOTICE THAT THE INPUT METADATA IS THIS THING ON THE ZERO, NOTICE THAT IT SAYS ZERO. NOW, FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT WERE PAYING ATTENTION WHEN YOU LOOKED AT THIS, YOU REMEMBER THAT IN THE PROJECT ITSELF LET'S GO BACK TO THAT -- SORRY, NOT THIS ONE, PROJECTS AND NUMBERS. YOU REMEMBER THAT IN THE ACTUAL PROJECT ITSELF WHEN I CLICK ON IT THE INITIAL NODE THAT WE HAD HERE WAS LABELED AS A ZERO. THE OUTPUT NODE YOU WILL RECALL WAS LABELED AS A 22. WHY IT NAMED IT THAT, I DON'T KNOW, I CAN'T GIVE YOU THE ANSWER TO THAT. IF YOU ASK I WILL BE LIKE I HAVE NO IDEA. NOTICE THAT IT ALSO KNOWS ABOUT THE OUTPUT METADATA IT'S LABELED AS NUMBER 22. NOW, WHAT IS IT THAT WE CAN DO WITH THE SESSION? LET'S GO OVER HERE AND LET'S -- NO, WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. LET'S HIT CLOSE AND LET'S GO ONE MORE TIME TO THE SESSION, LET'S DO A QUICK WATCH AND WE WILL SAY SESSION DOT -- NOTICE THAT THERE IS ONE THING YOU CAN DO AND THAT'S RUN. IN THE RUN NOTICE THAT IT TAKES THESE THINGS CALLED NAMED ONYX VALUES. ALL RIGHT. SO LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET THAT BIT TO WORK. SO THIS IS ALL LOADED UP, YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S LOADED BUT WE STILL NEED TO DO THE RECOGNITION WHICH WE HAVEN'T DONE. OKAY. SO THE FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE ARE GOING TO GO TO THE PREDICT AREA AND LIKE I'M FREE CODING THIS. OKAY? SO IF THERE ARE ANY MISTAKES THAT'S OKAY. THE FIRST THING WE NEEDED TO DO IS NOW THAT WE HAVE THE SESSION IS WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY RUN THIS DIGIT CODE. SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO FIRST IS I AM GOING TO GO AHEAD AND SAY SESSION.RUN AND LET'S SEE WHAT IT NEEDS BECAUSE I'M NOT -- OKAY, IT NEEDS A NAMED ONYX VALUE. LET'S SEE WHAT THAT IS, NAMED ONYX VALUE AND IT LOOKS LIKE LET'S DO DOT -- IT LOOKS LIKE YOU CAN CREATE FROM AN ACTUAL TENSER FLOAT. OKAY. AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE NEED TO GIVE IT A NAME AND THE NAME IS GOING TO BE ZERO BECAUSE THAT'S THE THING THAT NEEDS TO GO IN. NOW WE NEED TO HAVE A TENSER. ALL RIGHT. SO LET'S SEE HOW WE DO THAT. SO IN .NET THERE IS THIS NEW DATA TYPE CALLED A TENSER. SO I'M GOING TO SAY TENSER -- I'M GOING TO SAY VARVX EQUALS NEW AND THERE IS A THING CALLED A DENSE TENSER OF FLOAT. WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE ARE GOING TO SAY IT'S OF DIGIT DOT LENGTH. OKAY, AND THEN PASS THAT IN. OKAY. SO NOW WE HAVE X HERE, LOOKS LIKE WE CAN PASS THAT -- WE HAVE THIS NAMED VALUE SO THIS IS GOING TO BE THE INPUT EQUALS AND NOW WE CAN ACTUALLY RUN THE SESSION. SO LET'S DO THIS, LET'S DO -- OH, I FORGOT. I SWITCHED FROM PYTHON THERE REAL. WE'RE GOING TO SAY SESSION.COM. I ONLY HAVE TEN MINUTES. WE'RE GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS. SESSION.RUN. IT LOOKS LIKE IT NEEDS A COLLECTION OF IT SO I'M GOING TO DO THIS GOODNESS HEREIN PUT. IT MIGHT HAVE MORE THAN ONE INPUT. OKAY. IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S HAPPY AND THEN WE ARE GOING TO SAVE OUR JUT PUT EQUALS. OKAY. SO I'M GOING TO SET A BREAK POINT HERE BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S IMPORTANT IS NOTICE THAT THIS TENSER DOES NOT HAVE THIS DATA SO LET'S FIX THAT, TOO. SO I IS LESS THAN DIGIT.LENGTH AND THEN I PLUS PLUS. WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WE'RE GOING TO SAY X.I GETS DIGIT I AS WELL. HERE IS THE THING THAT'S IMPORTANT IS IT EXPECTS IT TO BE IN 255 -- IT EXPECTS IT TO BE A VALUE BETWEEN 0 AND 1 AND YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE DOING THE SQULOUT PUT WE SAW 255 SO WE WILL JUST DIVIDE BY 255 BECAUSE THAT MEANS IT'S THE DARKEST COLOR. OKAY. SO LET'S RUN IT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. OKAY. SO I SET A BREAK POINT THERE TO LOAD, SO LET'S RUN IT AND LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. I WANT TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON. FIRST WE'VE GOT TO LOAD THE MODEL BECAUSE IF IT'S NOT THERE IT WON'T WORK. THERE IT IS. NOW I'M GOING TO DRAW THE NUMBER THREE AND I'M GOING TO RECOGNIZE. OKAY. SO IT WORKED BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN HERE. SO LET ME DO A QUICK WATCH TO SHOW YOU WHAT'S GOING ON BECAUSE, AGAIN, THIS IS HOW I LIKE TO CODE. LOOKS LIKE THERE IS A ZERO ELEMENT SO LET'S GO HERE TO ZERO AND SEE WHAT -- OH, LOOKS LIKE IT DOESN'T LIKE THAT AND A THE REASON WHY IS -- ONE, TWO, THREE -- IT'S A READ ONLY COLLECTION SO WE HAVE TO DO FIRST. WE CAN DO THAT. WHAT'S IN THERE? WHEN I GO DOWN THERE IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS A VALUE IN THERE, THAT'S AWESOME, LOOKS LIKE IT HAS A NAME OF 22. SO LET'S SEE WHAT I CAN DO -- OH, LOOKS LIKE I CAN PULL IT OUT AS A TENSER. SO LET'S DO THAT AND LET'S SEE IF THAT -- NO, DOESN'T LIKE IT AND THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE I NEED TO TELL IT IT'S A FLOAT. BY THE WAY, DOES ANYONE ELSE CODE LIKE THIS? NOTICE THAT I'M NOW GETTING THE VALUE THAT I WANT AND I'M GOING TO CONVERT IT TO -- LET'S SEE IF I CAN CONVERT IT TO AN ARRAY BECAUSE THAT'S EASIEST. OKAY. SO TO ARAY. OKAY. GOOD. SO I'VE GOT ALL OF THIS CODE THAT I'VE FIGURED OUT AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M JUST GOING TO DO DOT AND JUST DO THIS AND NOW I'M GOING TO GO BACK AND SEE IF I CAN REWIND A LITTLE BIT. UH-OH, LOOKS LIKE IT CAN'T -- THE REASON WHY IT CAN'T IS BECAUSE OF THIS. SO NOW WE CAN SAVE IT AND THEN GO BACK HERE, ONE, TWO -- OKAY. LOOKS LIKE IT WENT BACK AND NOW WHEN I HIT F 10 LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. WHAT DO THEY GET? A FLOAT OF 10 AND WE GET THESE CRAZY NUMBERS. THIS IS WHAT I'M GOING TO DO, I'M GOING TO HIT -- I'M GOING TO GO BACK ONE MORE TIME AND RUN IT AGAIN, BUT NOW I AM GOING TO DO THIS OUTPUT WHICH IS SHOW -- I WANT TO SHOW THE RESULTS, SO SHOW RESULT AND THE -- WE'VE GOT TO DO A PREDICTION HERE. HOW DO WE DO A PREDICTION ON AN ARRAY? WE WANT THE MAX INDEX. HOW DO WE DO THAT? I'M GOING TO SAY VAR PREDICTION EQUALS ARAY.INDEX OF AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO PASS IN THE OUTPUT AND WE'RE GOING TO GET THE OUTPUT DOT MAX BECAUSE THIS WILL GIVE US THE INTENTION WITH THE MAX AND THAT'S THE PREDICTION. NOW WHEN I SAY SHOW RESULT, SHOW RESULT, I CAN PASS IN THE PREDICTION AND I CAN PASS IN THE SCORES WHICH IS THE OUTPUT. I'M GOING TO PUT IN ZERO JUST BECAUSE THAT'S HOW LONG IT TAKES AND WE'RE GOING TO RUN THIS AGAIN AND SEE WHAT WE'VE GOT. F 10, F 10, F 10, F 5 AND HOPEFULLY -- THERE YOU GO. LOOKS LIKE IT PREDICTED THE NUMBER THREE. THAT'S AWESOME. YOU'RE PROBABLY LOOKING AT THESE NUMBERS THINKING WHAT IN THE HECK IS THIS DOING? LET'S DO SOME SIDE-BY-SIDE EXPLORATION HERE TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHAT IS ACTUALLY GOING ON. SO I'M GOING TO DO A NEW VERTICAL GROUP AND I AM GOING TO HIDE THESE THINGS SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT IS GOING ON. SO IT LOOKS LIKE, HERE, I'M GOING TO MOVE THIS ONE OVER HERE SO WE CAN DO I HAD BY SIDE THE OTHER WAY AND THIS ONE OVER HERE. VERY GOOD. SO NOTICE ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS THAT WHEN WE'RE LOADING THIS DATA UP THEY'RE DOING A FUNNY THING HERE. NUMBER ONE, THEY'RE NORMALIZING THE DATA WHICH I DID NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT SO WE NEED TO FIX THAT. LET'S SEE IF I CAN FIGURE WHAT THIS IS. LET'S GO TO PIE TORCH. BOOM. TRANSFORM.NORMALIZE. SO LOOKS LIKE IT FIGURED IT OUT. SO WE WILL GO HERE AND THEN I WILL NORMALIZE -- OH, THERE WE GO. LOOKS LIKE WHAT THIS DOES IS THIS SUBTRACTS THE FIRST VALUE, DIVIDES BY THE SECOND. LET'S DO THAT TO MAKE SURE OUR JUT PUT IS REAL GOOD. OKAY. SO IT SUBTRACTS THE FIRST NUMBER WHICH IS THIS NUMBER RIGHT HERE, MINUS THIS AND THEN DIVIDED BY THIS. OKAY. OKAY. SO LOOKS LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING RIGHT HERE SO THAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT A LOT SMARTER, NUMBER ONE, AND THEN, NUMBER TWO, THE OTHER THING THAT'S INTERESTING IS LIKE THOSE NUMBERS ARE REALLY I'D RATR IT GIVE ME A PROBABILITY OF HOW CONFIDENT IT IS. WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO GO UP HERE TO THIS CODE AND I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THIS HERE AND SEE WHAT THIS IS ACTUALLY DOING. BY THE WAY, AGAIN, HOPEFULLY YOU NOTICE THAT I'M DOING THINGS IN VISUAL STUDIO THAT YOU WOULD NEVER THINK ABOUT DOING IN PYTHON. I JUST HOVERED OVER IT AND IT'S TELLING ME. THIS IS THE SAME AS THE LOG OF THE SOFT MAX AND SO I'M GOING TO SAY E TO THAT POWER AND IT SHOULD GIVE ME SOMETHING. REMEMBER THE OPPOSITE OF LOG IS E AND YOU CAN FLIP THEM AROUND. LET'S FIX THAT. SO I AM GOING TO DO THIS BECAUSE I WAS VERY CLEVER AHEAD OF TIME, I PUT THAT IN THERE, A CONVERSION. I'M GOING TO SAY V GOES TO SYSTEM.MATH.EXP OF V, BUT THEN I'M GOING TO BE EVEN MORE CLEVER. WE LIKE FOR CLEVER HERE. LET ME HIT SAVE AND MOVE THIS OVER TO THE MIDDLE OF THE WINDOW HERE. YOU CAN DO SOMETHING REALLY COOL CALLED USING STATIC, SO USING STATIC SYSTEM DOT MATT. BOOM. NOW I CAN GET RID OF THIS THING RIGHT HERE. AND NOTICE BECAUSE OF THE WAY -- WORK I CAN ALSO JUST GET RID OF ALL OF THIS. ALL RIGHT. LET'S RUN IT. BOOM. WITH THREE MINUTES TO SPARE. IN C#, LET ME LOAD THE MODEL HERE THAT I JUST CREATED AND NOW I'M GOING TO START TO DRAW SOME NUMBERS AND THEN HIT RECOGNIZE AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO -- OH, THERE IS A BREAK POINT. F 5. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THAT IT'S GUESSING THE RIGHT THING AND NOW WITH PROBABILITIES, HEY, NOW, 99%. 99%. LET'S DO SOME OTHER NUMBERS. LET'S DO THE NUMBER ONE RECOGNIZE YES IT GOT THAT, THE NUMBER TWO, RECOGNIZE, YES, IT DOES THAT. THE NUMBER THREE WE ALREADY DID. THE NUMBER FOUR, LET'S SEE WHAT WE'VE GOT. THE NUMBER FIVE. WHAT? IT'S A GENIUS. RECOGNIZED THE NUMBER ZERO. YES. SO NOTICE THAT WHAT I WAS ABLE TO DO IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019 IS I WAS ABLE TO CREATE A SOLUTION THAT DEPICTS WHAT I'M TRYING TO SOLVE WITH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGES AT THE SAME TIME. HOPEFULLY YOU ENJOYED THAT. I WILL OBVIOUSLY RELEASE THE SOURCE CODE SO YOU CAN PLAY WITH IT. I'M GOING TO GET UP AND GO OVER HERE TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS BECAUSE MY TIME IS ABOUT UP BUT I WANT TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. OKAY. 13 NEW POSTS. THERE'S NO QUESTIONS. I KNOW THAT THESE -- YES. MACHINE LEARNING -- THAT WAS TOTALLY PERFECT GERMAN, I FEEL BAD. BY THE WAY, FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT, OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TONS OF CONTENT TO HELP YOU WITH THAT, BUT THE KEY TAKE AWAY WAS IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019 I WAS ABLE TO SEAMLESSLY CREATE A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL AND USE THAT TO ACTUALLY MAKE PREDICTIONS INSIDE OF A .NET APPLICATION. IT WAS PRETTY AMAZING FOR ME. ALL RIGHT. BEFORE WE GO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO MORE QUESTIONS. OH, LOOK AT THIS. GREAT, GREAT, GREAT. YES, THANKS. THANK YOU. MY FRIENDSHIP DUES WILL BE SENT VIA CHECK IN THE MAIL. AGAIN, MACHINE LEARNING -- THE KEY TAKE AWAY IS WE ONLY HAVE ABOUT A MINUTE LEFT AND WE WILL GO TO THE NEXT SESSION, THE KEY TAKE AWAY IS THAT IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT WAY OF WRITING AN ALGORITHM. INSTEAD OF YOU COMING UP WITH THE STEPS, YOU GIVE IT THE DATA AND VISUAL STUDIO 2019 IS AN AMAZING TOOL FOR YOU TO ACTUALLY DO THAT, BOTH IN PYTHON, IN C# AND WHATEVER LANGUAGE YOU CHOOSE. OKAY. COMING UP NEXT, ACCELERATE YOUR C++ ENVIRONMENT WITH ERIKA AND MARION, HOW ARE YOU DOING MY FRIENDS?  HELLO. FANTASTIC. TAKE IT AWAY.  ALL RIGHT. WELL, I'M MARY. AND I'M ERIKA SUITE. WE ARE PROGRAM MANAGERS IN THIS PLUS PLUS TEAM AND FOR THE NEXT HALF HOUR WE WILL TAKE YOU THROUGH A TOUR OF EVERYTHING THAT'S NEW AND EXCITING WITH VISUAL STUDIO 2019 IF YOU ARE A PLUS PLUS DEVELOPER. THROUGHOUT THE SESSION IF YOU ARE WANT TO DELVE DEEPER INTO SOME OF THE SPECIFIC TOPICS WE HAVE AK.MS LINKS THAT YOU CAN FOLLOW AND IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS #VS2019 ON TWITTER AND WE WILL TRY TO GET TO THE QUESTIONS SOME IN THE SESSION LATER ON. THE FIRST THING YOU WILL SEE WHEN YOU OPEN VISUAL STUDIO 2019 WILL BE THE START WINDOW WHICH BASICALLY BRINGS TOGETHER ALL OF THE ENTRY POINTS THAT YOU COMMONLY USE WHEN YOU USE VISUAL STUDIO, SO WHETHER YOU ARE A GIT FIRST USER OR YOU LIKE BROWSER ON DISC FOR YOUR SOLUTIONS OR OFTEN OPEN THE SAME ONES, START WINDOW BRINGS THEM ALL TOGETHER AND STREAM LINES THAT EXPERIENCE. REST ASSURED THAT AFTER YOU MAKE THE SELECTION BEHIND THIS WINDOW YOU WILL GET THE VISUAL STUDIO YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH. BEFORE I CONTINUE I WANT TO WARN YOU THAT IF YOU ARE HAPPY VISUAL STUDIO 2017 USER OR '15 USER THROUGHOUT THE SESSION AND REALLY THROUGHOUT THE DAY THE THOUGHT OF UPGRADING TO 2019 MIGHT CROSS YOUR MIND. YOU KNOW, CHANGE SOMETIMES CAN BE -- CAN ADD SOME STRESS SO BEFORE WE JUMP IN AND TALK ABOUT ALL THE NEW THINGS WE'RE DOING, I WANT TO TAKE A BIT OF TIME TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE WORK WE'VE BEEN DOING INSIDE THE PRODUCT TO MAKE SURE THAT VISUAL STUDIO 2019 UPGRADE IS STRESS FREE AND PAIN FREE FOR YOU. SO I'LL START THE FIRST THING IS THAT YOU CAN INSTALL IT SIDE BY SIDE WITHIN ANY OTHER VERSION OF VISUAL STUDIO. AND YOU CAN SWITCH BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE TWO I.D.s AT ANY TIME WHILE YOU EXPLORE THE LATEST I.D. AND WHEN YOU ARE READY TO MAKE THE SWITCH, YOU CAN INSTALL VISUAL STUDIO 2019 I.D. AND BRING ALL OF YOUR SOURCE CODE INTO THE I.D. WITHOUT HAVING TO ALSO UPGRADE THE TOOL SET. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IN LARGE TEAMS UPGRADING TO FULL SETS SOMETIMES REQUIRES SOME COORDINATION. SO IF YOU'RE USING 2015 OR 2017 I.D. COMPILERS, WITH THE 2019 I.D. YOU CAN INSTALL THOSE ON THE MACHINE AND CONTINUE BUILDING YOUR PROJECT IN THE SAME WAY YOU USED TO WITH OLDER I.D.s AND, ONCE THE WHOLE TEAM IS READY TO COME, YOU CAN CONSIDER UPGRADING THE TOOL SET AS WELL. AND ONCE YOU DO CONSIDER UPGRADING THE TOOL SET, WITH 2019 IT HAS NEVER BEEN EASIER TO UPGRADE YOUR TOOL SET BECAUSE OF BINARY COMPATIBILITY. IF YOU HAVE SPECIFICALLY THIRD-PARTY LIBRARIES BUILT WITH 2015 OR 2017, YOU CAN TAKE YOUR SOURCE CODE, BUILD IT WITH 2019 AND THEN BRING ALL THESE BINARIES TOGETHER AND YOUR APPLICATION WILL CONTINUE TO RUN AS EXPECTED. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST, IF YOU OF YOUR THIRD-PARTY LIBRARIES ARE OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS, THE BEST WAY TO ACQUIRE THESE LIBRARIES IS THROUGH VC PACKAGE, IT'S A POPULAR C++ PACKAGE MANAGER AND IT BRINGS FULL SUPPORT FOR THE VISUAL STUDIO 2019 TOOL SET. IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH VC PACKAGE, THESE ARE THE THREE COMMANDS YOU HAVE TO RUN TO GET STARTED AND HAVE YOUR -- ONE OF THE OPEN SOURCE LIBRARIES FULLY SET UP ON YOUR DEV BOX READY FOR CONSUMPTION. I HOPE THESE REASONS GIVE YOU THE PEACE OF MIND AND THE COMFORT THAT UPGRADING TO 2019 IS PAIN FREE AND NOW WE CAN DELVE DEEPER INTO SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS WE'RE MAKING. AND WE'LL START WITH THE MSBC TOOL SET. SO WE HAVE A NEW VERSION OF THE TOOL SET IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019. WHICH BRINGS IMPROVEMENTS IN FOUR IMPORTANT AREAS. PERFORMANCE, BUILD THROUGH PUT, RUN TIME ANALYSIS. WE'LL START WITH CONFORMANCE, WHERE THE NEW COMPILER TOOL SET BUILDS ON THE SUCCESS OF THE PREVIOUS VERSION AND COMES WITH A FULL C++ '17 CONFORMANCE IN THE COMPILER AS WELL AS THE MOST COMPLETE C++ '17 LIBRARIES STANDARD IMPLEMENTATION TO DATE. BUT WE DIDN'T STOP THERE. AND WE'RE CURRENTLY -- THE TEAM IS ACTIVELY WORKING ON ADDING SURP C++ '20. IT WILL BE LIKELY APPROVED LATER ON NEXT YEAR. THE TEAM IS ALREADY WORKING ON ADDING SUPPORT IN THE COMPILER LIBRARY'S I.D. AND WE ALREADY HAVE SOME FUNCTIONALITY IN THE UPDATE THAT YOU'RE GETTING TODAY AND WE CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS AND FUTURISTIC UPDATES OF VISUAL STUDIO WILL ADD EVEN MORE C++ '20 FEATURES, SO STAY TUNED. WHEN IT COMES TO BUILD SPEEDS, THIS IS AN ONGOING AREA WHERE WE MAKES LOTS OF EFFORTS TO IMPROVE, AND IN 2019 THE FOCUS IS THE LINKER. WE RETHOUGHT THE WAY WE MANAGED DEBUGGING INFORMATION AND WITH THE WORK YOU'RE GOING TO GET IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019, WHETHER YOU'RE USING THE DEBUG FULL OR DEBUG FAST LINK SWITCHES, YOU CAN GET UP TO 2.4 X PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS IN LINK TIME. IN ADDITION TO THAT, IF YOU WANT TO SPEED UP YOUR BUILD EVEN FURTER, YOU CAN INSTALL INCREDI DUINC INCRINC INCREDI-BUILD. IMPROVEMENTS IN EXISTING OPTIMIZATIONS. IN OUR INTERNAL BENCHMARKINGS, WE'VE SEEN IMPROVEMENTS OF UP TO 2.8% BY JUST RECOMPILING YOUR SOURCE CODE. AND THESE ARE JUST THE THINGS THAT YOU GET BY DEFAULT. THERE ARE ADDITIONAL KNOBS INSIDE VISUAL STUDIO 2019 THAT ALLOWS YOU TO GET EVEN MORE PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, OPEN MP, MORE AGGRESSIVE INLINING AND THE REDUCTION IN SIZE FOR EXCEPTION HANDLING. THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT YOU CAN TURN ON BY SPECIFYING SPECIFIC SWITCHES. FOR MORE DETAILS YOU CAN GO TO THE AK.MS LINK BELOW. CODE ANALYSIS ALSO COMES WITH FRESH CHECKS, AND IN ADDITION TO THE CONCURRENCY CHECKS FOR WHICH I HAVE AN EXAMPLE ON THE SLIDE OVER HERE, CODE ANALYSIS ASSISTS YOU WITH WRITING CORE ROUTINE CODE AS WELL AS AIDING IN FINDING LIFETIME ISSUE WITH DANGLING POINTERS OR REFERENCES OR USE AFTER MOVE CHECKS. IN SUMMARY, THESE ARE THE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE TOOL SET, IN CONFORMANCE, BUILD THROUGHPUT ANA ANALYSIS, CODE ANALYSIS AND RUN TIME PERFORMANCE. WHAT YOU'RE GETTING IS THE BEST C++ COMPILER TOOL SET AVAILABLE FOR TARGETING WINDOWS. OVERALL, VISUAL STUDIO GIVES YOU THE BEST TOOLS FOR DEVELOPING WINDOWS APPLICATIONS. BUT VISUAL STUDIO DOES NOT STOP THERE. MANY OF YOU ALSO TARGET ADDITIONAL PLATFORMS AND WHEN YOU DO SO YOU MOVE TO A DIFFERENT OPERATING SYSTEM SOMETIMES OR A DIFFERENT DEVELOPER ENVIRONMENT, AND, REALLY, WITH VISUAL STUDIO 2019 YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT. INSIDE OF VISUAL STUDIO 2019 YOU CAN TARGET ALL OF THESE PLATFORMS FROM THE COMFORT OF A SINGLE I.D. IT'S VERY EASY TO GET STARTED. AND IF YOU ARE USING C++ TOOLS THAT YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO STOP USING THEM. FOR EXAMPLE, CLIENT FORMAT, IF YOU'RE USING IT TODAY YOU CAN CONTINUE USING IT BECAUSE VISUAL STUDIO HAS BUILT IN COMPATIBILITY FOR CLIENT FORMAT. AND ONCE YOU'RE INSIDE THE A.D. YOU GET A FAMILIAR AND RICH EXPERIENCE, THE TOP REFACTORING OPERATIONS. BUILD INTEGRATION AS WELL AS STATE OF THE ART DEBUGGING. BUT, REALLY, THERE IS NO BETTER WAY TO SHOW YOU THIS THAN THROUGH A DEMO. SO, ERIKA, DO YOU WANT TO TAKE IT AWAY?  YEAH. WE CAN SWITCH ON OVER TO SHOW MY SCREEN NOW. SO AS MARIAN MENTIONED, WITH VISUAL STUDIO 2019, WE HAVE SIMPLIFIED THE START WINDOW EXPERIENCE. TO THE LEFT YOU CAN STILL VIEW YOUR RECENTLY OPENED FOLDERS AND PROJECTS. AND TO THE RIGHT YOU HAVE FOUR ENTRY POINTS TO GETTING TO YOUR CODE. YOU CAN CLONE OR CHECK OUT CODE FROM AN ONLINE CODE REPOSITORY. OPEN AN EXISTIG VISUAL STUDIO OR SOLUTION PROJECT FILE. OPEN A LOCAL FOLDER, WHICH SUPPORTS ANY FOLDER CONTAINING C++ CODE WITHOUT EVER GENERATING VIDEO STUDIO PROJECT AND SOLUTION FILES OR CREATE A NEW PROJECT. THE NEW PROJECT DIALOGUE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SIMPLIFIED SO IT IS EASIER THAN EVER TO FILTER TEMPLATES BY LANGUAGE, TARGET PLATFORM OR PROJECT TYPE. IN THIS DEMO, I'M GOING TO BE WORKING WITH A CROSS-PLATFORM APPLICATION THAT RUNS ON BOTH WINDOWS AND LENUX. I ALREADY HAVE A COMPANIY OF THE PROJECT SAVED ON MY MACHINE. SO I'M GOING TO OPEN IT USING THE OPEN FOLDER EXPERIENCE. VISUAL STUDIO HAS NATIVE SUPPORT FOR C MAKE, WHICH MEANS YOU CAN OPEN ANY FOLD WITH A .TEXT FILE AND HAVE A FULL EXPERIENCE WITHOUT EVER GENERATING PROJECT AND SOLUTION FILES. IN THE RIGHT TO MY SOLUTION EXPLORER, YOU CAN SEE THAT MY FILE STRUCTURE MIRRORS THE LAYOUT OF FILES ON DISK. VISUAL STUDIO ALSO SUPPORTS SOMETHING CALLED C MAKE TARGETS VIEW, A MORE C MAKE CENTRIC WAY OF ORGANIZING YOUR CODE AND ALLOWS YOU TO BUILD A SINGLE TARGET AT A TIME, RUN CODE ANALYSIS ON A TARGET OR RUN CODE ANALYSIS ON A SINGLE FILE. TO NAME A FEW OPTIONS. IN VISUAL STUDIO ALL OF THE C MAKE CONFIGURATION THAT IS NORMALLY DONE VIA THE COMMAND LINE IS MOVED INTO A C MAKE SETTINGS.JSON FILE. WE HAVE INTRODUCED AN ALTERNATIVE TO EDIT THAT FILE DIRECTLY. SO HERE YOU CAN SEE I AM PROMPTED WITH A FEW PROPERTIES FOR ME TO EDIT THAT WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU TO GET STARTED WITH C MAKE. THERE ARE GENERAL ONES LIKE CONFIGURATION NAME AND TYPE. SOME COMMAND ARGUMENTS THAT ARE PASSED CORRECTLY TO C MAKE AND A NEW SECTION CALLED C MAKE VARIABLES AND CACHE. I'VE ALREADY GENERATED MY CACHE. BUT IF I WERE TO CLICK HERE, I WOULD BE PROMPTED WITH ALL THE C MAKE PROMPT VARIABLES FOR ME TO EDIT. YOU CAN USE THIS FUNCTIONALITY TO HELP DIAGNOSE ISSUES WITH YOUR C MAKE LIST. I CAN CLICK HERE TO SEE THE FULL LIST AND I CAN ALSO FILTER VARIABLES BY NAME. YOU CAN ALSO USE THIS FUNCTIONALITY TO MODIFY THE VALUE OF ANY VARIABLE YOU SEE HERE BY SIMPLE CLICKING THE VALUE COLUMN AND MODIFYING IT. MODIFIED VARIABLES ARE AUTOMATICALLY SAVED TO THE C MAKE SETTINGS FILE AND AUTOMATICALLY PASSED VIA THE COMMAND LINE. SO THE ONLY THE PIECE OF CONFIGURATION I NEED TO DO TO GET THIS WORKING FOR WIN DOES WAS TO PASS C MAKE THE PATH TO MY TOOL CHAIN FILE, BUT IF YOU'RE USING VC PACKAGE, VC PACKAGE NOW AUTOMATICALLY WITH VISUAL STUDIO SO YOU CAN - BYPASS THIS STEP COMPLETELY. IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF IT, VC PACKAGE IS A COMMAND LINE PACKAGE MANAGEMENT TOOL FOR C AND C++ LIBRARIES THAT RUNS ON WINNOWS, LENUX AND MAC OS. I WAS ABLE TO INSTALL ALL THE DEPENDENCIES USING VC PACKAGE. SO QUICKLY, ALL OF THE DEPENDENCIES YOU SEE HERE COULD BE INSTALLED WITH A SIMPLE COMMAND, VC PACKAGE, INSTALL, LIBRARY NAME. TO THE LEFT WE HAVE A CONFIGURATION MANAGER WHERE YOU CAN EASILY TOGGLE BETWEEN EXISTING CONFIGURATIONS OR ADD A NEW ONE. WE HAVE TEMPLATE SUPPORT FOR TARGETING IOT DEVICES, REMOTE LENUX MACHINES, WINDOWS MACHINES AND NOW IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019 YOU CAN TARGET AN EXISTING CACHE. SO FOR A NORMAL C MAKE PROJECT IN VISUAL STUDIO, VISUAL STUDIO WILL GENERATE AND MANAGE ALL OF THE DETAILS OF YOUR CACHE FOR YOU. BUT NOW YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO POINT VISUAL STUDIO TO AN EXISTING CACHE THAT WAS GENERATED OUTSIDE OF THE IDE. SO THAT YOU OR YOUR PREFERRED TOOLS HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OVER YOUR CACHE AND YOUR BIUILD TREE. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAVE A SCRIPT THAT AUTOMATES THE WAY C MAKE IS INVOKED, YOU CAN CONTINUE TO USE THAT ALONGSIDE VISUAL STUDIO. I HAVE ALREADIEDY SET UP A CONFIGURATION. SELECT THE START-UP ITEM. WOW, THIS IS RUNNING QUICKLY IN THE BACKGROUND. YOU CAN SEE THAT THE C MAKE SETTINGS EDITOR FOR A REMOTE CONFIGURATION IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THE ONE FOR A LOCAL WINDOWS CONFIGURATION WITH A FEW ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES EXPOSED THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO A REMOTE BUILD. FOR EXAMPLE, REMOTE MACHINE NAME. C MAKE WILL AUTOMATICALLY PICK UP ON ANY REMOTE MACHINES YOU'VE CONFIGURED IN VISUAL STUDIO. IF YOU NEED TO ADD A NEW ONE, YOU CAN EASILY DO THIS IN THE CONNECTION MANAGER AND CLICK ADD. WE DON'T HAVE MANY RESTRICTIONS ON THE DISK SHARE YOU'RE CONNECTING TO. ALL WE REQUIRE IS SSH, WORKING C++ TOOL CHAIN ON THE REMOTE MACHINE. GM G DB AND A RELATIVELY NEW VERSION OF C MAKE. VISUAL STUDIO WILL NOW AUTOMATICALLY DETECT IF THE MACHINE YOU'RE CONNECTED TO DOESN'T HAVE C MAKE INSTALLED AND CAN AUTOMATICALLY INSTALL THOSE BINARIES FOR YOU TO THE REMOTE MACHINE. IT LOOKS LIKE THIS IS DONE. SO NOW IF II TOGGLE OVER TO MY VM, I WILL SEE SUPERTEXT. THIS IS NOW A GRAPH ICAL APPLICATION HERE. I ONLY HAVE 15 MINUTES WITH YOU SO I'M GOING TO SWITCH RIGHT BACK TO MY WINDOWS CONFIGURATION. AGAIN, THE START-UP ITEM. SO YOU CAN SEE THAT VISUAL STUDIO ALLOWS YOU TO TARGET MULTIPLE PLATFORMS EASILY FROM THE COMFORT OF A SINGLE IDE. THE SUPERTEXT GAME THAT I'M USING IS AN OPEN SOURCE PROJECT. YOU CAN FIND IT ON GETHUB. TO INSTALL ALL THE DEPENDENCIES I NEEDED ON BOTH WINDOWS AND LINUX. HOPE YOU CAN HEAR IT, TOO. SO STORY MODE. I'LL PLAY IT A LITTLE BIT. STILL IN DEBUG MODE, SO IT'S A LITTLE SLOW SOMETIMES, BUT ONCE THE GAME STARTS IT'S USUALLY GO .  ALL RIGHT. THIS IS SUPERTUX. SIMILAR TO GAMES YOU HAVE PLAYED BEFORE. I THINK I'M GOING TO GO INTO THE OPTIONS MENU AND TURN THE SOUND UP A LITTLE BIT. SO, OPTIONS. GO DOWN TO SOUND VOLUME. AS I'M TARGETING HERE WITH THE ARROW KEY, IT LOOKS LIKE THESE ARE NOT IN ORDER AT ALL LIKE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE. IN CONTRAST, YOU CAN SEE THAT THESE MUSIC VOLUMES ARE INCREASING IN ORDER. SO I THINK I'M GOING TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON THERE. . ALL.ONTROL "T" BRINGS UP GO TO - SO I'M GOING TO USE "F" TO LIMIT MY SEARCH TO FILES AND NAVIGATE OVER TO THE OPTIONS FILE.CPP FILE WHICH IS WHERE MOST OF THE LOGICS MENU TAKES PLACE. IT LOOKS LIKE A HAVE A TO-DO I HAVE NOT YET DONE TO SORT THE SOURCE VOLUMES. I HAVE A VECTOR OF STRINGS CALLED SOUND VOLUMES AND I'M JUST GOING TO SORT IT. SOUND, VOLUMES. SO, NORMALLY MEMBERLESS SUGGESTIONS ARE SORTED ALPHABETICALLY, BUT WITH VISUAL STUDIO 2019 WE HAVE AN ENTIRELY NEW EXPERIENCE FOR C++ USERS. IT WILL USE THE CONTEXT OF YOUR CODE TO SUGGEST THE MOST RELEVANT SUGGESTIONS, PUT THEM AT THE TOP OF YOUR LIST AND INDICATE THEM WITH A STAR AS YOU CAN SEE HERE. HERE I'M BEING PROMPTED WITH BEGIN. AS I CONTINUE CODING, I'M PROMPTED WITH END, WHICH SHOWS THAT MY INTELLICODE SUGGESTIONS ARE CHANGING BASED ON THE CONTEXT OF MY CODE. INTELLICODE TRAINS OVER NUMEROUS REAL WORLD PROJECTS INCLUDING OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS ON GET HUB WITH OVER 100 STARS AND FOR THIS REASON CAN GIVE GREAT SUGGESTIONS FOR COMMONY USED LIBRARIES. I'M ALSO GOING TO PASS IN THIS LESS THAN VOLUME FUNCTION, WHICH IS ALSO PART OF THIS CODE BASE. I CAN QUICKLY PREVIEW WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE FOR YOU, AS MY COMPARISON FUNCTION TO SORT. IT'S ALSO A PART OF THIS OPTIONSMENU.CPP FILE. I'LL GO AHEAD AND SET A BREAK POINT HERE WHICH SHOULD BE HIT WHEN I GO THE INTO THE OPTIONS MENU AND MAKE SURE THIS IS WORKING. ALL RIGHT. SO OPTIONS. AND, ALL RIGHT, GOOD. I HIT MY BREAK POINT. SO NOW I CAN LEVERAGE SOMETHING CALLED JUST MY CODE DEBUGGING. IT AUTOMATICALLY STEPS OVER CALLS TO SYSTEM, FRAMEWORK OR OTHER NONUSER CODE. SO WHEN I PRESS F11 HERE TO STEP INTO, I'M AUTOMATICALLY GOING TO STEP INTO THE LESS THAN VOLUME FUNCTION INSTEAD OF STEPPING INTO VECTOR OR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SORT. SO I'LL PRESS F11 AND I'M BROUGHT STRAIGHT TO A LESS THAN VOLUME OR USER CODE. I'LL STEP OUT OF THAT. PRESS F5 TO CONTINUE. AND, OOPS -- IT LOOKS LIKE MY SOUNDS ARE NOW IN ORDER. ALL RIGHT. SO THE NEXT PRODUCTIVITY FEATURE THAT I WANT TO SHOW YOU GUYS TODAY IS CALLED TEMPLATE INTELLISENSE. IT CAN LEVERAGE ITS FULL POWER WITHIN THEIR TEMPLATE BODIES. YOU CAN SEE HERE I'M NOT GETTING MEMBERLESS INTELLISENSE, BUT IF I GO UP HERE -- I'M GETTING MEMBER LIST SUGGESTIONS LIKE GET LEVEL OR GET TYPE. I CAN ALSO HOVER OVER "R" AND SEE THAT "R" IS A ROADBLOCK. IF I WANTED TO GO BACK AND SPECIFY A DIFFERENT SAMPLE ARGUMENT. SO NOW I'LL SAY SNOWMAN. THEN I CAN LEVERAGE THIS DROP DOWN MENU, WHICH SHOWS ME MY MOST RECENTLY USED SAMPLE ARGUMENTS AND MAKES IT EASY FOR ME TO TOGGLE BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM VISUAL STUDIO 2019 HAS QUICK INFILL AND CLOSING BRACES. IF I HOVER OVER ANY CLOSING BRACE, YOU CAN SEE I'M GETTING INFORMATION ON THE FIRST LINE OF THE IF STATEMENT OF THE FOUR LOOP AND THE FUNCTION ITSELF. THE LAST THING THAT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU GUYS TODAY IS SOME IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR CODE ANALYSIS. SO CODE ANALYSIS WILL NOW RUN AUTOMATICALLY IN THE BACKGROUND ON FILE SAVE OR WHENEVER YOU OPEN UP A NEW FILE. SO YOU CAN SEE HERE IF I SCROLL DOWN THAT I'M GETTING A CODE ANALYSIS WARNING INDICATED WITH THE GREEN SQUIGGLES, THAT IS WARNING IN TO USE KNOLL POINTER. IF I CLICK SHOW POTENTIAL FIXES, VISUAL STUDIO WILL SHOW ME WHAT THIS CHANGE WOULD LOOK LIKE TO MY CODE AND THEN IF I APPLY THE CHANGE, IT WILL MAKE THE CHANGE TO MY CODE IN THIS INSTANCE. THIS PARTICULAR CODE ANALYSIS RULE IS ACTUALLY NOT ON BY DEFAULT, SO I CAN SHOW YOU HAW TO MANAGE YOUR CODE ANALYSIS RULES FOR A CMAKE PROJECT IN PARTICULAR. YOU CAN MANAGE IT USING THIS RULE SET FILE. AND HERE YOU CAN INHERIT FROM DIFFERENT RULE SETS ARE MANUALLY SPECIFY EXACTLY WHICH RULES YOU WANT TO BE TURNED ON TO GIVE YOU EITHER WARNINGS OR ERRORS. SO YOU CAN SEE HERE THE ONLY ONE I'VE TURNED ON RIGHT NOW IS USE THIS KNOLL POINTER INSTEAD OF KNOLL WARNING. HERE I CAN EASILY CUSTOMIZE THAT FOR MY PROJECT. FOR CMAKE YOU HAVE TO PASS THIS RULE MAKE FILE AS A CODE ANALYSIS RULE SET IN ORDER FOR CMAKE TO PICK UP ON IT. THAT'S ABOUT ALL I HAVE FOR THE DEMO PORTION TODAY. WE CAN SWITCH BACK TO THE SLIDES NOW AND SHOW A FULL LIST OF WHAT'S NEW. SO, YES, THIS IS THE FULL LIST OF EVERYTHING THAT'S NEW WITH VISUAL STUDIO 2019. I ONLY HAD A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF IT TODAY. SO IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T COVER OR SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID COVER, YOU CAN REACH OUT TO OUR TEAM VIA TWITTER OR TO EITHER OF US OR CHECK OUT BLOG POSTS. A LOT OF THESE NEW FEATURES HAVE BLOG POSTS ACCOMPANYING THEM SHOWING YOU WHAT'S NEW AND HOW TO USE THEM. THERE'S TWO FEATURES IN PARTICULAR THAT I DO WANT TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO SHOW TODAY. ONE OF THOSE IS LIVE SHARE FOR C++ DEVELOPERS AND ANOTHER IS THE 64 BIT OUT OF PROC. DEBUGGER PROCESS. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU GO CHECK OUT THOSE TWO SESSIONS AS WELL. AND THAT'S ABOUT ALL THAT WE HAVE FOR THE SESSION NOW. I THINK WE CAN TRANSITION TO Q & A?  Q & A. THANK YOU, GREAT DEMO. FANTASTIC. NOW, THE LAST TIME I WROTE C++ WAS A VERY LONG TIME AGO. LIKE, I FEEL LIKE I'M THE -- THE FIRST TIME I LEARNED TO DRIVE STICK SHIFT, I FEEL LIKE THAT'S C++. AND ONLY EXPERIENCED LIKE GOOD PROGRAMMERS CAN DO THAT. SO I'M GOING TO ASK QUESTIONS THAT COME ON, AND THEN I'M GOING TO TRY TO ASK QUESTIONS FROM MY OWN SMALL BRAIN WHEN IT COMES TO C++. FOR CROSS-PLATFORM C++ BUILD, WILL VS 2019 MAIN DUPLICATE COPIES, ONE REMOTE AND ONE -- YEAH. SO IF YOU'RE TARGETING A REMOTE LINUX MACHINE YOU CAN COPY OVER YOUR SOURCES. IT'S USUALLY ON IN DEFAULT UNLESS YOU'RE USING AN EXISTING CACHE. THAT'S ALSO PART OF THE EDITOR. LET'S GET YOUR SCENE ON THERE SO PEOPLE CAN SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING. I'M BACK IN THE CMAKE SETTINGS. MY LINUX CONFIGURATION IS ACTIVE RIGHT NOW AND THERE IS A CHECK BOX HERE THAT SAYS COPY YOUR REMOTE SOURCES TO THE REMOTE MACHINE AND ALSO THE COPY SOURCES METHOD THAT DEFAULTS TO R-SYNC.  FANTASTIC. SO HERE'S THE THING. I SAW THIS AWHILE BACK, YOU'RE ACTUALLY ABLE TO WRITE C++ CODE IN VISUAL STUDIO AND DEBUG IT IN A LINUX ENVIRONMENT.  AND NOT JUST DEBUGGING. I THINK ONE IMPORTANT THING TO CALL IS THAT WHILE WE'RE MOVING THE SOURCES, THE BUILD ACTUALLY HAPPENS ON THE REMOTE MACHINE AS WELL. YEAH. SO IT'S NOT A CROSS-COMPILATION EXPERIENCE WHERE YOU HAVE TO MOVE THE WHOLE LINUX ON TO THE WINDOWS MACHINE TO GET THE BINARIES CREATED. EVERYTHING BUILDS ON THE MACHINE AS IF YOU'RE BUILDING THE COMMAND LINE. BUILDING ON THE LINUX MACHINE, VISUAL STUDIO CAN AUTOMATE THAT FOR YOU. I FEEL LIKE YOU WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING. NO, I WAS JUST IN AGREEMENT WITH WHAT MARIAN WAS SAYING.  FANTASTIC. SHE'S IN AGREEMENT. ALL RIGHT. HERE'S ANOTHER COHEN. FOR VS 2019 CAN WE HAVE ONE SOLUTION CONTAINING BOTH CMAKE AND C# PROJECTS? THAT WAS NOT POSSIBLE IN 2017. SO THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION. SO CMAKE AS A TOOL DOES HAVE SOME SUPPORT FOR C# PROJECTS. YOU CAN INTEROPERATE BETWEEN C++ AND C#. NOW, WHEN YOU BRING THESE PROJECTS INSIDE VISUAL STUDIO, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE ASSISTANCE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH FOR C# PROJECTS. SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE CONSIDERING AS ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS THAT WE CAN IMPROVE THE VISUAL STUDIO EXPERIENCE RIGHT NOW. FOR NOW YOU WILL HAVE TO SWITCH BETWEEN SOLUTIONS AND THE NATIVE CMAKE EXPERIENCE TO GET ALSO C#, LIKE, NICE INTELLISENSE CAPABILITIES. CONSIDER I'M BUILDING AN APP FROM LINUX TO WINDOWS. DO I NEED TO INSTALL C++ FOR REMOTE MACHINES. AS MARIAN WAS SAYING WERE WE'RE REALLY DRIVING THE BUILD ON YOUR REMOTE MACHINES. WE HAVE A COUPLE OF DEPENDENCIES. GDB, R SYNC AND SSH ARE THE DEPENDENCIES YOU WILL NEED. THESE ARE REALLY GOOD QUESTIONS. I'M SO GLAD. I WOULD ASK DUMB THINGS, HEY, YOU KNOW, HOW DO YOU MANAGE POINTERS? IS THAT STILL A THING. THEY'RE LAUGHING AT ME. THEY SHOULD BE LAUGHING AT ME. DOES CROSS-PLATFORM COME WITH VS 2019 INSTALLATION?  THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. WE DO HAVE ONE GCC CROSS COMPILATION TOOL SET THAT SHIPS WITH THE LINUX WORKLOAD, BUT THAT'S SPECIFICALLY TARGETED FOR ARM, AND JOHNBEYOND THAT YOU CAD ANY CROSS-COMPILATION TOOLS THAT YOU HAVE AND CONFIGURE THEM IN GCC, SO WE DON'T LIMIT THAT.  AWESOME. DO YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING?  SORRY, I ASSUMED THE QUESTION WAS FOR LINUX. FOR WINDOWS WE DO SHIP CROSS COMPILERS FOR ARGUMENTS ARM 64. AND WE HAVE THE FULL METRICS OF ARCHITECTURES THAT WE SUPPORT FOR VISUAL STUDIO.  LIKE, THEY'RE INSPIRING ME NOW TO, LIKE, GO AND DO SOMETHING IN C++. YOU SHOULD. YOU SHOULD. PROBABLY CATCH MY MACHINE ON FIRE IS WHAT I WOULD DO. CLAIMS C++ '14 FULL SUPPORT BUT LACKS AN '11 AND LATER FEATURE PRAGMA. I WAS GOING TO SAY THE SAME THING. WHAT'S UP WITH THE UNDERSCORE PRAGMA, CAPITAL "P"?  THAT DOESN'T COME UP OFTEN ENOUGH. WE SHOULD TALK MORE ABOUT IT. SO WE DO HAVE SUPPORT FOR MANY OF THE C++ '17 FEATURES IN THE PRODUCT. WE DO CONSIDER THAT WE ARE IN THE COMPILER WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED ALL THE FEATURES FROM C++ '17 AND BEYOND. WE SHOULD FOLLOW UP ON THAT PARTICULAR FEATURE. MAYBE THEY RAN INTO A BUG THAT -- I SEE.  -- THAT THEY ASSUME DOESN'T WORK OR MAYBE SOMETHING ON THE BACKLOG THAT WE SHOULD CLARIFY. I'LL FOLLOW UP ON TWITTER.  ABSOLUTELY. WE WANT TO KNOW. I REMEMBER PRAGMA BUT WITH HASHTAGS. WE DIDN'T CALL THEM HASHTAGS BACK THEN. POUND. FROM KEITH, WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO TO GET OUR V TEST TO SHOW UP IN EXPLORER?  ALL YOU SHOULD HAVE TO DO IS GET THE BUILD, AND ONCE THE BUILD ENDS, IT WILL POPULATE EXPLORER WITH THOSE TESTS. THAT SHOULD BE TRUE FOR WHETHER YOU'RE USING MS BUILD PROJECTS OR CMAKE PROJECTS. FANTASTIC. 00 IF I'M GOING TO GO TO THINGS IN THE C++ VISUAL STUDIO. I LOVE THE DEBUGGING THAT YOU SHOWED. CLARIFYING WHAT THE "T" WAS. THAT WAS AMAZING. WHAT SHOULD I GO START WITH? I HAVEN'T DONE C++ IN A VERY LONG TIME. I HAD A VERY BAD EXPERIENCE IN COLLEGE WITH C++. MY PROFESSOR, I DID THE ALGORITHM AI OLD SCHOOL AND HE WAS MEASURING MEMORY LEAKS AND I FAILED IT. I GOT A "C." IT'S BURDENED ME EVER SINCE. HOW CAN I GO BACK IF I'M A NEWBIE?  I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT TIME TO GO BACK. WITH THE NEW STANDARDS, THE LANGUAGE HAS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY. SO, LIKE, DEALING WITH LEAKS IS A LOT EASIER NOW IF YOU USE WRAPPERS AND, YOU KNOW, LIKE, SMART POINTERS. WE DO HAVE TUTORIALS ON VISUALSTUDIO.COM. I RECOMMEND ANYONE TO GO AND TRY THE HELLO WORD AND THE CALCULATOR THAT WE HAVE ON THE VISUAL STUDIO DOCS. HEY, IF YOU EVER GET STUCK, ASK US QUESTIONS. WE'RE HERE TO HELP. WE ALWAYS TRY TO IMPROVE VISUAL STUDIO TO MAKE IT, YOU KNOW, AS ACCESSIBLE AND AS APPROACHABLE TO PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST GETTING STARTED TO LEARN. DEFINITELY. FINAL WORD?  YEAH, NO, WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON OUR GETTING STARTED EXPERIENCE. SO HOPEFULLY THERE ARE SOME TUTORIALS OUT THERE IF YOU ARE NEW TO C++ AND WITH SOME OF THESE CHANGES IN 2019 THINGS ARE EASIER FOR SOMEONE NEW TO VISUAL STUDIO, NEW TO C++, NEW TO CMAKE, WHATEVER IT MAY BE, TO NAVIGATE AND MAKE SENSE OF AND BE MORE PRODUCTIVE WITH VISUAL STUDIO. WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH. I FEEL A LOT MORE CONFIDENT. I MIGHT GO REIMPLEMENT THAT ALGORITHM. I MIGHT. I REALLY AM. I'M PRETTY EXCITED. WE HAVE MY GOOD FRIEND HERE COMING UP NEXT, CROSS-PLATFORM MOBILE APPS MADE EASY WITH THE FABULOUS AND AMAZING JAMES MONTEMAGNO. TAKE IT AWAY, BUDDY.  THANKS, SETH. THE PROBLEM IS IF YOU WOULD HAVE COME AT 2:00, I'LL BUZZ YOU IN. 3:00, THAT'S TOO LATE FOR ME. THANKS, EVERYONE. I'M REALLY EXCITED TO ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT TODAY ALL THE REALLY EXCITING ENHANCEMENT THAT WE HAVE FOR DOTNET DEVELOPMENT. FOR MOBILE APPLICATIONS WITH XAMARIN AND VISUAL STUDIO 2019. YOU MAY HAVE SEEN ME A FEW TIMES BEFORE ON CHANNEL 9 AND ON YOUTUBE DOING THE XAMARIN SHOW, WHICH WE RECORD EVERY SINGLE WEEK AND PUT OUT FOR ALL OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO. SO I WANT TO KIND OF WALK THROUGH A FEW THINGS TODAY, SHOW OFF APPS, WHAT WE'RE BUILDING IN VS 2019, BOTH ON WINDOWS AND ON THE MAC AND SHOW YOU SOME OF THE NEW FEATURES, BUT ALSO ANYONE BRAND-NEW TO THE MOBILE DEVELOPMENT WITH DOTNET AND XAMARIN, I WANT TO WALK YOU THROUGH THE BASICS. SO LET'S GET STARTED. WHAT I THINK ABOUT MOBILE DEVELOPMENT OR JUST DEVELOPMENT IN GENERAL HERE AT MICROSOFT, WE WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO BUILD FOR ANY PLATFORM HUMANLY POSSIBLE AND THAT'S WHERE DOTNET COMES IN. WHETHER YOU WANT TO BUILD A DESKTOP APP WITH WF OR XAMARIN FOR, IT FITS RIGHT IN SIDE OF HERE. SO BUILDING IOS ANDROID APPS, MAC APPLICATIONS, WATCH APPLICATIONS. SO XAMARIN IS PART OF DOTNET AND ALL INSIDE A VISUAL STUDIO FOR YOU. I THINK TO DESIGN REALLY QUICK, WHAT IS XAMARIN, I LIKE IT DEFINE IT AS AN OPEN SOURCE APP PLATFORM FROM MICROSOFT FOR BUILDING MODERN IOS, ANDROID, MAC OS, WATCH OS AND TV OS ALL WITH C# AND DOTNET. THAT MEANS YOU CAN USE YOUR EXISTING C# AND DOTNET SKILLS TO WRITE FOR ALL PLATFORM HUMANLY POSSIBLE. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT APP DEVELOPMENT. YOU KNOW, WITH XAMARI IN H, WE WANT TO GIVE YOU A PRODUCTIVE ENVIRONMENT. REUSE ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU LOVE IN VISUAL STUDIO AND VISUAL STUDIO FOR MAC. REUSE ALL YOUR CODE ACROSS DIFFERENT PLATFORMS AND WE WANT THESE APPLICATIONS OF GREAT INNOVATIONS AND NATIVE PERFORMANCE AND INTEGRATE INTO THAT EXPANSIVE SYSTEM OF DOTNET. WHEN I THINK OF THE APP ARCHITECTURE, I THINK OF IT LIKE THIS, IOS PROJECTS, ANDROID PROJECTS AND NOW WITH XAMARIN AND ANY OTHER DOTNET PROJECT. IT COULD BE A WPF APPLICATION, YOUR WEB APPLICATIONS. WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS SHARE A BULK OF OUR C# BUSINESS LOGIC, PLATFORM APIs AND USER INTERFACE DEPENDING HOW MUCH LITTLE OR MUCH YOU WANT TO SHARE BETWEEN ALL OF THEM. THE UNIQUE PART IS XAMARIN DELIVERS THE ANALYST TO BUILD CO-ED FOR EACH. THOSE NATIVE APRs ARE WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT WHEN YOU USE YOUR PHONE. SO THINGS LIKE FINGERPRINT PERMISSIONS, YOU KNOW, AUGMENTED REALITY, MACHINE LEARNING, MUSIC APIs, GOOGLE PLAY SERVICES, CAMERA, ALL THOSE GREAT NATIVE APIs. AND FOR XAMARIN, WE GIVE YOU ALL OF THOSE APIs FOR ALL THE OTHER PLATFORMS ALL IN C#. ALL INSIDE OF VISUAL STUDIO. NOW, EACH PLATFORM'S PRETTY UNIQUE AND HAVE DIFFERENT APIs, BUT THERE ARE SOME SIMILARITIES BETWEEN ALL OF THEM, SO WE TRY TO SIMPLIFY THAT ASPECT OF THE DEVELOPMENT WITH XAMARIN AND DOTNET. THAT'S WHY WE CREATED XAMARIN ESSENTIALS, WHICH IS A SINGLE LIBRARY THAT ALLOWS YOU TO ACCESS NATIVE APIs FROM A SHARED CROSS-PLATFORM LIBRARY. SECURED SETTINGS AND PREFERENCES AND GEO LOCATION, CONNECTIVITY, ALL FROM A SINGLE API. SO NOW WE CAN SEE BUSINESS LOGIC, DOTNET LOGIC, RIGHT? MODELS, VIEW MODELS, XAMARIN ESSENTIALS LIFTS IT UP HERE. SO WHAT WE CAN DO IS TAKE THE MODEL OF THE ARCHITECTURE AND EXPAND IT. STILL A BLUE BOX BECAUSE IT'S STILL SHARED ACROSS THE DIFFERENT PLATFORMS. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE USER INTERFACE BITS AND PIECES OF IT? YOU CAN BUILD OUT NATIVE UIs ON EACH PLATFORM, BUT WE ALSO THOUGHT ABOUT DEVELOPERS WANTING TO SHARE EVEN MORE CODE. THAT'S WHERE XAMARIN FORMS COMES IN, WHICH IS A LIBRARY THAT ENABLES YOU TO SHARE CROSS-PLATFORM USER INTERFACE ON DIFFERENT PLATFORMS LIKE IOS, ANDROID AND UWP. I LIKE TO DEFINE IT AS AN OPEN SOURCE FRAMEWORK FROM A SINGLE SHARED C# CODE BASE. WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT THIS IS THAT YOU TAKE THAT EXACT SAME MODEL, RIGHT, WHERE WE HAD C# BUSINESS LOGIC, MODELS, VIEW MODELS, XAMARIN ESSENTIALS, AND NOW XAMARIN FORMS FOR YOUR USER INTERFACE. YOU CAN MIX AND MATCH AS MUCH OR AS LITTLE OF THIS AS YOU WANT. IT CAN BE SOME OF YOUR APP, ALL OF YOUR APP OR NONE OF YOUR APP. BUT MOST OF OUR DEVELOPERS ON AVERAGE SHARE OVER 80% OF CODE ACROSS ALL THESE DIFFERENT PLATFORMS. LET'S JUST GET INTO AND BUILD AN APP. SO I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND JUST PULL UP VISUAL STUDIO 2019, OUR GET TO CODE EXPERIENCE, AND WHEN YOU SAY CREATE A NEW PROJECT, WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND IN HERE IS ALL THE PROJECT TEMPLATES THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT, AND OVER HERE WE CAN GO AHEAD AND DROP DOWN AND TAP ON MOBILE. AND WHEN YOU SAY PROJECT TYPE MOBILE, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE ALL OF THE DIDN'T XAMARIN PROJECTS AND DOTNET PROJECTS IN HERE. YOU CAN SAY I WANT ANDROID OR IOS OR TVOS OR WINDOWS PLATFORMS SPECIFICALLY. WHAT YOU NOTE IS THAT WE HAVE ANDROID PROJECTS, IOS PROJECT, ANDROID, WATCH OS, DOWN HERE WE HAVE THESE BINDING LIBRARIES WHICH ENABLE YOU TO BRING OVER NATIVE LIBRARIES FROM IOS INTO YOUR ANDROID APPS AND EVEN TVOS APPLICATIONS. IF YOU SELECT MOBILE APP. IT SAYS XAMARIN FORMS RIGHT THERE. WHEN YOU SELECT NEXT, CREATE YOUR PROJECT AND YOU GET A FEW MORE OPTIONS HERE. WE HAVE REDONE SOME OF THESE. HERE WE CAN GO AHEAD AND TAP ON MASTER DETAIL FOR A FLY OUT NAVIGATION, TABBED, A BLANK APPLICATION AND WE HAVE A NEW PREVIEW OF SHELL WHICH HANDLES ALL OF YOUR APP NAVIGATION. ON ANY OF THESE, YOU CAN SELECT YOUR PLATFORMS, ADD ADDITIONAL PLATFORMS LIKE UWP OR OTHER ONES IN THERE. YOU CAN ADD AN ASP.NET CORE BACK END. I'VE ALREADY DONE THAT AND CONFIGURED IT LIKE THIS. WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS OPEN THAT PROJECT AND WALK THROUGH IT. HERE I AM INSIDE OF IT. LET'S ZOOM IN A LITTLE BIT. I LOVE TO ZOOM. WHAT WE'LL NOTICE HERE IS THAT I HAVE ANDROID PROJECT, AN IOS PROJECT AND A DOTNET CORE WEB API BACK END. SO THIS -- A BACK END HERE IS JUST A STANDARD, YOU KNOW API CONTROLLER. I ACTUALLY HAVE IT RUNNING HERE INSIDE OF OUR COST PLATFORM WEB SERVER BACK END THAT WILL ENABLE ME TO DEBUG LOCALLY ON MY ANDROID DEVICE. THESE HEAD PROJECTS ARE KIND OF WHAT I DESCRIBED THERE. I HAVE A DOTNET STANDARD LIBRARY, WHICH IS JUST MY FIRST MOBILE APP. IT HAS MY MODELS. I HAVE SERVICES IN HERE. VIEW MODELS. AND I HAVE SHARED USER INTERFACE ACROSS ALL OF THESE PLATFORMS. FOR IOS, ANDROID HERE. NOW, I ALSO HAVE SOME PACKAGES, LIKE JSON.NET. YOU CAN PULL DOWN ANYTHING. THEN I HAVE XAMARIN ESSENTIALS AND FORMS. I'M ALSO BRINGING IN A NEW LIBRARY THAT WE JUST RELEASED CALLED XAMARIN FORMS VISUAL MATERIAL, THAT WILL ENABLE ME TO DO MATERIAL DESIGN ACROSS EACH OF THE PLATFORMS THAT WE SUPPORT, WHICH IS REALLY NICE FOR IOS AND ANDROID. SO THIS IS JUST LIKE A DOTNET STANDARD LIBRARY. HERE'S EVERYTHING WE SEE. WHAT I WANT TO SHOW YOU IS WHAT SORT OF THE USER INTERFACE LOOKS LIKE AT A HIGH LEVEL. SO WE HAVE THAT ITEM CONTROLLER. WE NEED TO QUERY IT. SO IN MY CODE BEHIND, I HAVE AN ITEM'S VIEW MODEL. HERE I'M JUST GOING TO USE ALL C#.NET. I HAVE A COLLECTION OF ITEMS. WHEN I WANT TO LOAD THEM, I WILL SIMPLY CALL EXECUTE, LOAD ITEMS. IT'S GOING TO GO OFF TO MY DATA STORE, WHICH I'LL SHOW YOU IN A FEW SECONDS HERE AND THEN ADD THOSE ITEMS TO THE LIST. NOW, IN MY USER INTERFACE HERE FOR MY ITEMS PAGE, WE HAVE CROSS-PLATFORM XAMIL WITH XAMARIN FORMS. INSIDE OF HERE IT'S ANMENT XML REPRESENTATION OF MY USER INTERFACE. OVER HERE I CAN PULL OUT A TOOLBOX, DRAG AND DROP CONTROLS. I GET MY PROPERTY GEAR ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT THAT YOU'D EXPECT. HERE I HAVE A LIST VIEW. I CAN SEE MY ITEM SOURCE SAYS ITEMS. I'VE PULLED THE REFRESH ENABLED. INSIDE OF THIS DATA CELL, I'M GOING TO GIVE IT A REPRESENTATION TO DISPLAY AN ICON AND ALSO A LABEL HERE OF THE TEXT AND DESCRIPTION. NOW, IT'S JUST C#.NET LOGIC, NOTHING CRAZY. WHEN I MAKE THAT WEB BACK END CALL, IT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE THIS. I HAVE MY AZURE DATA SORT. AN HTTP CLIENT THAT UNIVERSITY USED FOR YEARS. A URI THAT I SPECIFY WITH A BACK END. NOTICE WHEN I SAY GET ITEMS ASYNC, IT WILL GO AND GET A STRING TO -- IT WILL ALSO CHECK FOR INTERNET CONNECTIVITY USING X XAMARIN ESSENTIALS ON IOS AND ANDROID. A SINGLE WAY TO ACCESS INTERNET THERE. I'VE CONFIGURED THIS APP FOR A SPECIFIC URL BECAUSE I'M RUNNING LOCAL. HERE I'VE SET MY BACK END JUST TO BE LOCAL HOST, BUT NOTICE ON ANDROID, SINCE IT'S GOING TO BE AN EMULATOR, WE'RE JUST GOING TO DO THE ANDROID IP ADDRESS FOR LOCAL HOST. AGAIN, I'M GOING TO USE XAMARIN ESSENTIALS TO SAY AM I ANDROID. ELSE USE LOCAL COHOST 5,000 FOR IOS OR UWP. HERE I CAN PULL UP MY ANDROID EMULATOR. I'M RUNNING MY ANDROID EMULATORS HERE. WE'VE EXTENDED HYPER-V TO SUPPORT RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX. YOU CAN RUN GOOGLE PLAY SERVICES IF YOU WANT ON IT. ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT. AND HERE THE APPLICATION IS LOADING. HERE WE HAVE SOME TABS ON THE BOTTOM AND IT'S GOING TO GO AND MAKE A WEB REQUEST AND GET SOME ITEMS. IF I COME IN, ADD A NEW ITEM AND I SAY, HELLO WORLD. WE'LL GO AHEAD AND DROP THAT DOWN AND HIT SAVE UP HERE. WELL, NOTICE THAT THIS IS RUNNING IN THE BACK END AND IN FACT, I HAVE SWAGGER RUNNING OVER HERE, AND IF I TRY OUT MY WEB API, HIT EXECUTE OVER HERE, WE CAN SEE THAT THIS HELLO WORLD RIGHT HERE IS COMING FROM MY APP. WHICH IS REALLY COOL. SO AS WE START TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO DEVELOP THE USER INTERFACE, WE HAVE A FEW TOOLS IN MIND AND NOT JUST ONLY FOR EDITING THE XAMIL. PERHAPS WE WANT TO UPDATE THIS NEW ITEM PAGE. I DON'T REALLY LIKE THAT THE CANCEL AND SAVE ARE HERE. SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS COME OVER TO THIS NEW ITEM PAGE. WE HAVE OUR XAMARIN FORMS PREVIEW TO GET A SIDE BY SIDE OF MY XAMIL HERE. WHAT I'M GOING TO NOTE HERE IS THAT I DON'T REALLY LIKE THIS TOOL BAR ITEM. SO WE'RE GOING TO GET RID OF THAT. AND WHAT WE CAN DO DOWN HERE IS MAYBE ADD A BUTTON AND NOTICE GIVES ME RECOMMENDATIONS. AND - I TYPE "B," "B" IS IN LABEL AND BUTTON AND INTELLICODE SAYS BUTTON. IT WILL ALSO RECOMMEND THAT I SET TEXT OR THE BACKGROUND COLOR OR THE COMMAND HERE. SO I'LL GO AHEAD AND SET THE TEXT OF SAVE. LET'S DO THE CLICKED EVENT TO THE SAVED CLICKED EVENT HERE, AND LET'S JUST GO AHEAD AND SET THE BACKGROUND COLOR OVER TO LET'S SAY A STATIC RESOURCE THAT I'VE DEFINED CALLED NAVIGATION PRIMARY. AND THEN WE CAN GO AHEAD AND CLSE THAT OUT. THERE'S MY BUTTON. IT SHOWS UP. NOW, THIS -- THIS LITTLE PROPERTY THAT I JUST SHOWED ACTUALLY CAME FROM SHARED RESOURCES IN ALL MY APPS. SO THAT'S WHERE THIS NAVIGATION PRIMARY IS COMING FROM. SO NOW THAT WE HAVE THIS HERE, WE CAN DO A FEW THINGS. IT SHOULDN'T BE RIGHT UNDERNEATH IT. MAYBE I'LL GO AHEAD AND MODIFY LET'S SAY THE VERTICAL OPTIONS AND MAYBE DO LET'S SAY END AND EXPAND. AND IT UPDATES IT OVER HERE FOR ME INSIDE MY XAMIL, SO YOU CAN SEE IT RIGHT HERE. ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS THAT WE JUST ADDED IS DESIGN TIME DATA SUPPORT. SO HERE FOR INSTANCE I HAVE SOME ATTRIBUTES TO SAY D COLON ON ANYTHING. AND WHAT I CAN DO IN THAT IS I CAN SAY D:BACKGROUND COLOR EQUALS RED. I CAN SEE HOW MUCH SPACE IT'S ACTUALLY FILLING UP INSIDE OF IT. WHEREAS AS SOON AS I GET RID OF THAT, IT'S GOING TO GO BACK INTO MY BLUE. MAYBE HERE WE WANT TO SEE TEXT COLOR EQUALS WHITE HERE. NOW WE'LL SEE IT UPDATE TO WHITE. NOW, I REALLY DIDN'T LIKE SORT OF THAT I HAD TO HAVE SOME LABELS TO ENTER THESE ITEMS. I'D REALLY LOVE THAT MATERIAL DESIGN LOOK WHERE THE PLACEHOLDER MOVES UP AND DOWN. SO WHAT WE CAN DO IS ENABLE A BRAND-NEW FEATURE OF XAMARIN FORMS THAT WE CALL VISUAL. WE'RE GOING TO SET THIS TO MATERIAL VISUAL. WE'RE GOING TO SEE A FEW THINGS CHANGE. LOOK AT THIS INSIDE MY PREVIEW. IT CHANGES TO BE A GENERIC DEFAULT BUTTON. IF I CHANGE TO MATERIAL, WE NOW GET UPDATES INSIDE OF OUR USER INTERFACE. SO HERE WHAT I CAN DO ON LABEL IS ACTUALLY JUST GET RID OF IT. I CAN JUST SAY GET OUT OF HERE. THEN OVER HERE MAYBE I'LL SET MY PLACEHOLDER EQUAL TO TEXT, WHICH WILL MOVE UP ONCE I ENTER IT. THE SAME THING HERE ON EDITOR, I'LL SAY PLACEHOLDER EQUALS DESCRIPTION, AND WE'LL GO AHEAD AND SET IT HERE. NOW, WHAT I DO LIKE IS THAT WITH MATERIAL BUTTONS I CAN SET, LIKE, A CORNER RADIUS ON THIS BUTTON AND START TO MAKE IT LOOK REAL GOOD. MAYBE I'LL SET IT TO 18. I CAN SEE IT RESPOND THERE, WHICH IS NICE. SO LET'S GO AHEAD WITH THESE CHANGES AND SEE WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE AS I REV THIS APPLICATION. SO I'M GOING TO NOW GO IN, HIT RECOMPILE, REDEPLOY. IT'S GOING TO RECOMPILE MY ANDROID APPLICATION WITH THE CHANGES THAT I MADE AND THEN DEPLOY IT TO MY ANDROID EMULATOR THAT IS SITTING OVER HERE. SO LET'S GIVE IT A SECOND TO BUILD UP ON MY MACHINE. THERE WE GO. AND SEE WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO HERE. I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND CLOSE THIS OUT. THERE WE GO. AND THOSE DESIGN ATTRIBUTES THAT I SHOWED WORK ON ANY PROPERTY. I'LL SHOW YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. WE'VE WORKED A LOT ON OPTIMIZING THE BUILD TIMES. YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF IMPROVEMENTS IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019 FOR BOTH IOS AND ANDROID. SO HERE I HAVE SOME -- MY APPLICATION. SINCE I'M STILL RUNNING AGAINST THAT WEB SERVER, I GET THAT HELLO WORLD. NOW I CAN HIT ADD AGAIN. NOW WE'RE GOING TO GET REALLY NICE MATERIAL DESIGN HERE ON BOTH OF THESE WITH LITERALLY ZERO WORK AT ALL. I'LL SAY HELLO OVER HERE AND I'LL SAY FROM MATERIAL DESIGN. THERE WE GO. AND THEN ON THIS BUTTON, I GET THIS REALLY NICE EFFECT AND I CAN SAVE THAT BACK OUT AND GO AHEAD AND IT UPDATES AND I'M GOOD TO GO. NOW, WHAT I WANT TO SHOW, THOUGH, IS THAT INSIDE THIS APPLICATION I CAN ALSO DEBUG IT RIGHT HERE ON IOS WITH THOSE SAME CHANGES. I HAVE IT CONNECTED HERE TO MY MAC, RIGHT HERE ON THE LOCAL GUEST NETWORK, AND I CAN JUST SEE ALL OF MY IOS SIMULATORS RIGHT HERE OR PLUG IN A PHYSICAL DEVICE TO MY MAC AND HAVE IT DEBUG OVER ON TO MY IOS DEVICE OR SIMULATOR. NOW YOU MAY BE SAYING, OKAY, WELL, THERE IS A SIMULATOR NOW. THIS IS OUR REMOTED IOS SIMULATOR THAT WE HAVE WHEN I HIT DEBUG. WHERE IS THAT RUNNING? HOW CAN IT TALK TO THE WEB API BACK END? WELL, THE SIMULATOR IS RUNNING ON MY MAC AND WE'RE SORT OF PORTING IT OVER TO THE WINDOWS MACHINE, SO I TOOK THE SAME PROJECT AND RAN THE WEB SERVER OVER ON MY MAC SINCE THIS IS LITERALLY RUNNING ON LOCAL HOST ON MY MAC, WHICH IS PRETTY NICE. SO NOW I'M IN A FULL DEBUG SESSION FROM MY WINDOWS MACHINE RIGHT HERE ON TO MY IOS SIMULATOR. WHEN I HIT ADD, I HAVE THE SAME EXACT MATERIAL DESIGN THAT I WOULD EXPECT TO HAVE JUST LIKE I HAD ON MY ANDROID DEVICE. I CAN HIT DONE HERE THEN WE CAN HIT SAVE. SO, BOOM, NOW WE HAVE THE SAME EXACT APPLICATION, TALKING TO WEB API BACK END FROM MY WINDOWS MACHINE. BUT I WANT TO KIND OF TAKE THIS A LITTLE BIT FURTHER AND TELL YOU SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING HERE. ESPECIALLY WITH THE DESIGN TIME DATA. SO REMEMBER I HAD THIS BIG LIST OF DATA HERE, AND I WANT TO KIND OF REV ON IT A LITTLE BIT. AND IF I PULL UP THE PREVIEWER AT THIS POINT, WE'RE GOING TO SEE BASICALLY NOTHING. INSIDE OF IT. SO IT WILL INITIALIZE UP HERE AND WE'LL SEE A BIG BLANK PAGE. WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S, YOU KNOW, A LIST OF ITEMS AND LITERALLY NOTHING IN IT. BUT I CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR GOOD FRIEND DESIGN TIME DATA. SO HERE WE HAVE AN ITEMS SOURCE, AND WHAT I CAN DO IS KIND OF BRING IN A LITTLE TEMPLATED CODE, GIVE IT A DESIGN ITEM SOURCE. SO HERE I'LL GO AHEAD AND COPY IN THIS ITEM SOURCE, AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS SIMPLY SAY EMPTY STRINGS AT THIS POINT. AND I CAN SAY, HELLO FROM VISUAL STUDIO. NOW, WE SEE THE FRAME BECAUSE THERE ARE THREE ITEMS INSIDE OF HERE. IF I WANTED TO, I COULD COME DOWN AND SIMPLY SAY D:TEXT AND SET THIS EQUAL TO HELLO, FOR INSTANCE, WHICH MAKES ALL OF THEM HELLO OR I CAN SAY BINDING.WHICH IS REALLY NICE. NOW LET'S TAKE IT TO ANOTHER LEVEL, THOUGH, BECAUSE WHAT I CAN DO IS NOT ONLY JUST GIVE IT STRINGS, BUT GIVE IT FULL ITEMS INSIDE OF HERE. SO LET'S GO AHEAD AND REPLACE THIS ITEM SOURCE OF STRINGS WITH THE ACTUAL MODEL. SO WHAT I'VE DONE HERE IS I'VE ADDED TWO ITEMS. ONE THAT SAYS SCOTT LOVES TACOS AND A PICTURE OF HIS FACE WHICH IS INSIDE MY IOS AND ANDROID PROJECT AND THAT VISUAL STUDIO 2019 IS AN AMAZING IDE. WE HAVE AN ICON AND ALSO A FIRST NAME. SO IF I REMOVE THIS ICON, WE'LL SEE IT UPDATE WITH "T" THERE. IF I COME IN AND PUT THE ICON BCK, WHICH I EVEN GET INTELLISENSE FOR THERE, WE'LL SEE SCOTT SHOW UP. NOW, THIS IS NICE BECAUSE I'VE BOUND THIS ICON AND THE TEXT FIRST, AND IF I SIMPLY REMOVE THIS DESIGN, I'M GOING TO BE USING THE REAL BINDINGS BUT USING DESIGN TIME DATA WITH VERY, VERY LITTLE ENERGY OR EFFORT AT ALL. AND I CAN COME IN AND JUST SEE SCOTT'S BEAUTIFUL FACE STARING BACK AT ME OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. WHICH IS EXACTLY HOW I WANT TO DEVELOP ALL OF MY APPLICATIONS, WHICH IS WHY I DEVELOPED A SCOTT APPLICATION THAT I HAVE ON MY DEVICE 24/7. THOSE ARE SOME OF THE NEW FEATURES WE HAVE. I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE WHEN I TAKE THIS EXACT SAME PROJECT AND OPEN IT UP IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019 FOR MAC. SO I'M GOING TO SWAP OVER MY HDMI RIHT NOW OVER TO MY MAC. HERE WE GO. AND WHAT WE'LL GO AHEAD AND SEE ONCE IT'S ON THE SCREEN IS THE SAME EXACT PROJECT. OVER HERE I HAVE MY IOS ANDROID PROJECT AND ASP DOTNET CORE BACK EPI. WHAT I'VE DONE INSTEAD OF HITTING MY BACK END OF LOCAL HOSTS, I'VE ADDED IN AN AZURE BACK END AND PUBLISHED IT. YOU CAN RIGHT CLICK, SAY PUBLISH, PUBLISH TO AZURE, THIS WILL QUERY YOUR SUBSCRIPTIONS. YOU CAN SEND IT RIGHT TO AZURE. WITH THE SAME EXACT PROJECT I CAN DO WHAT -- I CAN GO TO MY ABOUT PAGE. WE'RE GOING TO SEE ALL THE SAME XAMIL LOADING UP. IT SHOULD GO AHEAD AND LOAD UP MY IOS PREVIEWER RIGHT HERE ON MY MAC. OVER ON VISUAL STUDIO FOR WINDOWS, I COULD SEE THAT AS WELL. I JUST NEED TO CLICK ON THE IOS TAB. I CAN SEE EVERYTHING HERE, MAKE CHANGES AND SEE IT UPDATE. NOW, IF I GO AHEAD AND DEBUG THIS APPLICATION, WHAT I'M GOING TO SHOW IS THAT I'M RUNNING THIS OVER HERE INSIDE OF AZURE. RIGHT HERE. SO IF I GO IN AND I SAY, TRY IT OUT AND HIT EBXECUTE, WE'RE GOIG TO GO AHEAD AND SEE MY ITEMS, ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, THAT ARE SHOWING UP. NOW WE'RE GOING TO BUILD OUR APPLICATION. IT'S GOING TO GO INTO A FULL DEBUG JUST LIKE I DID ON MY WINDOWS MACHINE. THERE WE GO. AND I'M GOING TO BE RUNNING THIS OVER ON APPARENTLY MY iPHONE XS MAX DEVICE. WHICH IS ACTUALLY KIND OF COOL BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO HAVE THE FORTUNATE INSIDE OF THERE, AND I'LL SHOW YOU ONE OTHER THING ABOUT THE ITEMS PAGE -- NEW ITEM PAGE ON TOP OF HERE, WHICH IS THAT INSIDE OF THE XAMIL WE HAVE SPECIAL ATTRIBUTES FOR IOS AND ANDROID SO HERE WE'RE GOING TO USE THE SAFE AREA. IN FACT ON MY MAIN PAGE I WAS SPECIFYINGSING BOTTOM TABS ON ANDROID, SOME BRAND-NEW PROPERTIES THERE. HERE IS OUR NEW APPLICATION LOADING. GETTING INTO DEBUG MODE. THERE WE GO. ALL OF OUR PROPERTIES ARE THERE. I CAN GO AHEAD AND ADD A BRAND-NEW ONE WITH ALL OF OUR MATERIAL DESIGN. GO AHEAD AND HIT SAVE ON HER AND NOW WE'RE HITTING AN AZURE BACK END TO SAVE EVERYTHING. SO LET ME WRAP UP BEFORE WE GO INTO Q & A WITH SOME RESOURCES BECAUSE YOU CAN GRAB ALL THE SOURCE CODE FROM HERE AND KIND OF SUMMARIZE UP HERE. SO YOU'VE KIND OF SEEN END-TO-END BUILDING AND APPLICATION, WHAT YOU GET OUT OF THE BOX, BUT A LOT MORE. THE BRAND-NEW TOOLS WE HAVE BUILT INTO VISUAL STUDIO 2019 LIKE INTELLICODE SUPPORT FOR ALL OF YOUR XA INMENT IL AND C# AND HYPER V EMULATOR AND WE'VE SPED UP OUR SIMULATOR BY 300%. WHICH IS AWESOME. HERE I'M ON A GUEST NETWORK AT MICROSOFT AND IT WORKS PERFECT. YOU CAN JOIN TONS OF DEVELOPERS AND COMPANIES THAT ARE BUILDING APPLICATIONS WITH DOTNET. WE LOVE ALL OF THEM. YOU'LL SEE A CUSTOMER SHOWCASE PAGE HIGHLIGHTING AMAZING DEVELOPERS AROUND THE GLOBE BUILDING APPLICATIONS WITH DOTNET AND XAMARIN. SO TO RECAP, BEAUTIFUL APPLICATIONS FOR JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU CAN POSSIBLY THINK ABOUT WITH XAMARIN WHILE SHARING ALL OF YOUR C# AND DOTNET LOGIC WITH EXISTING DOTNET APPLICATIONS FOR ANY PLATFORM THAT YOU POSSIBLY WANT. USE ALL YOUR FAVORITE LIBRARIES, JSON.NET, POLY, IT ENABLES ALL OF IT ACROSS ALL OF THESE PLATFORMS. YOU CAN SHARE NATIVE APIs WITH XAMARIN ESSENTIALS, NATIVE UI WITH XAMARIN CODES. INTELLICODE, PREVIEWERS AND THE IOS REMOTELIED SIMULATOR. YOU CAN GET EVERYTHING BY GOING TO VISUALSTUDIO.COM AND INSTALLING. YOU CAN SNAPSHOT THIS RIGHT NOW WHEN WHICH IS GOING TO GIVE YOU A LINK TO XAMARIN, PROJECTS AND LINKS TO MY SHOW HERE ON CHANNEL 9. FIVE MINUTES, 29 MINUTES. I DID IT, SETH. I'M SO EXCITED.  WHAT? YOU ARE LIKE ON THE BUTTON.  PRETTY GOOD. FANTASTIC. LET'S GO THROUGH SOME QUESTIONS, SHALL WE?  I'M READY.  ALL RIGHT. NUMBER ONE, ARE THERE ANY NEW FEATURES IN VS RELATED TO XAMARIN SUCH AS STABILITY OF CONNECTION TO THE MAC, PROJECT BUILD, PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS AND OTHER STUFF LIKE THAT.  A FEW THINGS. SO THE FIRST THING IS THAT WE REDUCED OUR INSTALLATION SIZE OF THE PRODUCT FROM 23 GIGS TO 7 GIGS, WHICH IS HUGE. WE HAVE SPENT A TON OF TIME HELPING ANDROID BUILD AND DEPLOY TIMES. SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS EVERY SINGLE RELEASE AND ESPECIALLY WITH VISUAL STUDIO 2019 YOU'RE GOING TO SEE DRASTIC, DRASTIC, DRASTIC IMPROVEMENTS. THE FIRST BUILD MAY TAKE, YOU KNOW, A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING A FULL COMPILATION, BUT BUILDS ARE SECONDS NOT MINUTES ANYMORE BETWEEN PROJECTS. IF YOU HAD A NEW PACKAGE OR THINGS LIKE THAT, BUT IF YOU MAKE A CHANGE TO XAMIL, BOOM, IT KEEPS GOING RIGHT AWAY. WE SPENT A TON OF TIME ON UPDATES SO THIS SHOULD BE A THING OF THE PAST, HOPEFULLY. AND OF COURSE THINGS LIKE GETTING THE ANDROID EMULATORS RUNNING, SPEEDING UP THE IOS CONNECTION TO A MAC SHOULD BE - SUPER ROCK SOLID. I DO IT RIGHT HERE ON THE GUEST NETWORK AT MICROSOFT AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ON THAT NETWORK RIGHT NOW. RIGHT NOW. THEY'RE EVERYWHERE. THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.  NEXT QUESTION. WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO RUN ON A REMOTE IOS SIMULATOR USING A MAC WITH A VIRTUAL INSTANCE OF WINDOWS RUNNING?  WELL, I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY ABOUT THAT AND HOW THAT MAY BREAK APPLE'S -- THERE ARE GREAT PARTNERS SUCH AS MAC STADIUM AND MAC IN CLOUD WHICH HAVE VISUAL STUDIO FOR MAC UP THERE. ALL YOU NEED IS AN IP ADDRESS TO POINT AT YOUR MAC MACHINE FROM YOUR WINDOWS AND, BOOM, YOU'RE GOOD TO GO. IT TALKS OVER SSH. DO THE RIGHT THING. OF COURSE IT INTEGRATES IN AZURE DEV OPS SO YOU CAN DO BUILDS AND GET IT ON YOUR PHONE.  FANTASTIC. TRUTH IS SINGULAR, WHICH IS THE PICTURE OF A PUPPY DOG -- I LOVE DOGS. I FEEL LIKE THIS IS TRUTH. YEP.  SINCE THE ANDROID EMULATOR RUNS ON HYPER -- THE SAME RESTRICTIONS FOR DOCKER CAN'T RUN AT THE SAME TIME. CAN YOU RUN NOT IN HYPER V?  OH, ABSOLUTELY. SO THE THING IS BEFORE THIS BRAND-NEW SUPPORT FOR THE ANDROID EMULATORS RUNNING ON HYPER V YOU HAD TO INSTALL INTEL X 86 EMULATION AND TURN OFF HYPER V. YOU CAN RUN YOUR ANDROID EMULATORS WITH THAT OR HYPER V, IT'S UP TO YOU. SOME MACHINES DON'T HAVE A HYPER V OR PERHAPS THEY'RE AMD PROCESSORS. WE NOW SUPPORT THAT. WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH TEAMS WHEN WE RELEASE UPDATES TO WINDOWS TO MAKE THAT BETTER AND BETTER AND BETTER, ESPECIALLY AROUND SECURITY AND THE LOWER LEVEL STUFF THAT HYPER V RUNS ON, EVERY LITTLE PATCH. FANTASTIC. I LOVE THE DO WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY ANSWER. YEAH, YOU DO YOU. YOU DO YOU. NEXT QUESTION FROM DAN. WHAT'S THE LIMITATIONS OF THE NEW XAMARIN PREVIEWER.  I SHOWED ANDROID ON WINDOWS BECAUSE TO DO IOS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE IT CONNECTED TO A MAC. WE'VE DONE A LOT OF OPTIMIZATIONS THERE. SO OUT OF THE BOX, YOU NO LONGER HAVE TO COMPILE YOUR CODE. IT WON'T TRY TO RUN YOUR CODE BEHIND. WON'T TRY TO RUN YOUR CUSTOM CONTROLS. WEAPON TALKED TO DEVELOPERS, A LOT OF DEVELOPERS, AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THEY JUST WANTED A QUICK AND EASY PREVIEW OF JUST ABOUT WHAT MAY APPLICATION WOULD LOOK LIKE. IT DIDN'T NEED TO BE PIXEL PERFECT BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT DEVICES. YOU CAN SELECT DIFFERENT FORM FACTORS, PIXELS AND DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF IOS AND NEXUS DEVICES AND THINGS LIKE THAT. YOU MAY STILL RUN INTO SOME RUN, YOU CAN OPT IN TO RUN YOUR CUSTOM CODE, BUT IF YOU TRY TO MAKE WEB REQUESTS OR DO CRAZY LOW-LEVEL THINGS ON YOU YOUR MACHINE, THAT'S GOING TO BREAK. OUT OF THAT, WHICH IS THE DEFAULT. YOU CAN KIND OF FLIP THE BITS BACK AND FORTH. WE HAVE UPDATED DOCUMENTATION ON DOCS.MICROSOFT.COM. TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. AWESOME. RAPID FIRED.  ABSOLUTELY. YES. IOS, ANDROID AND UWP. IT'S INCLUDED IN EVERY SINGLE TEMPLATE INSIDE OF VISUAL STUDIO 2019. IT'S COMPLETELY OPEN SOURCE AND AVAILABLE TODAY.  IS MATERIAL VISUAL AVAILABLE FOR XAMARIN IOS WITHOUT FORMS. ABSOLUTELY. YOU CAN GRAB THE PACKAGE CALLED MATERIAL IOS AND TWEET AT ME AFTERWARDS. HOW DO I ADD A UWP PROJECT WITH XAMARIN FORM SOLUTION. JUST ADD I UWP PROJECT, CONFIGURE TWO THINGS AND GET IT DONE.  IS IT 9,000 NOW? I DON'T KNOW.  8 BILLION. IS HOT RELOADING ON THE FOR XAMARIN. GREAT QUESTION. WE HAVE MORE EVENTS COMING SOON.  AWESOME. SO WE'RE GOING TO FINISH WITH THAT. THANKS SO MUCH, JAMES, FOR BEING SO GRACIOUS AND COMING IN. THANKS FOR HAVING ME. NOW WE HAVE A COUPLE -- LET ME GRAB MY PAPER HERE.  WE HAVE ANDREW AND PAUL. WHY DON'T YOU GET US STARTED, MY FRIENDS. THANKS, SETH. SO MY NAME IS ANDREW HALL. I'M A PROGRAM MANAGER WHO WORKS ON .NET AZURE AND TOOLING. AND I'M PAUL YUKNEWICZ WORKING WITH MY TWIN BROTHER, LITTLE KNOWN FACT. AS SETH INTRODUCED WE'RE WITH TO THE CLOUD WITH VISUAL STUDIO AND AZURE AND WE'LL SPEND MOST OF THE DAY LOOKING AT THE PRODUCTS, AND THE FIRST THING WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS MAKING IT REALLY EASY TO GET STARTED WITH AZURE. WE OFFER MULTIPLE TEMP PLATES FOR CREATING PROJECTS, SO NO MATTER WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IN AZURE AND THE CLOUD, WE GENERALLY HAVE A NICE TEMPLATE TO GET YOU STARTED TO BUILD THAT TYPE OF APPLICATION WHETHER IT'S WORKING WITH OUR FIRST PARTY PROPRIETARY STUFF SUCH AS AZURE FUNCTIONS SUCH AS CORE AM OPERATIONS THAT ARE REALLY THE WORKHORSE OF ANY CLOUD APPLICATION THAT YOU WANT TO DO OR WORKING WITH THIRD-PARTY TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS WANTING TO DOCERIZE IT AND PUTTIN IN DOCORS DOCORS AND. IF YOU'RE NOT READY TO ONE AND LEAP IN ASSURE, A LOT OF GOOD APPLICATIONS ON YOUR UP LOCAL MACHINE THAT WE OFFER FOR ASSURE AND SOME OF THE OTHER SERVICES SO YOU WANT TO DEVELOP ON AN AIRPLANE, A COFFEE SHOT AND DON'T REALLY TRUST PUBLIC WI-FI WE CAN HELP YOU THERE AS WELL. IT'S A LITTLE IRONIC. A LOT OF CUSTOMERS ARE SAYING, HEY, THERE'S TIMES I WANT TO WORK LOCALLY, IT'S FAST. I HAVE EVERYTHING SET UP IN MY MACHINE. THERE'S OTHER THINGS I WANT PRODUCTION REALIZE SO I'LL RUN IN THE CLOUD AND WE'LL SEE THAT CONTINUUM WHERE YOU WANT TO GO BACK AND FORTH. EXACTLY. SO WITH THAT LETS JUMP IN AND LOOK AT SOME OF BRAND-NEW PRODUCT WE JUST SHIPPED TODAY. SWEET. ALL RIGHT. SO WE'RE GOING TO START OFF IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019, AND AZURE STARTED TO LAUNCH INTO THE GREAT NEW PROJECT EXPERIENCE THAT WE SHIPPED IN VISUAL STUDIOS SO I HAVE FILTERS UP HERE SO IF I'M INTERESTED IN PROJECT TYPE I COULD CHOOSE CLOUD AND I'LL SEE PROJECT TYPES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CLOUD, FOR EXAMPLE. I CAN CLEAR THAT FILTER. ONCE I GO INTO -- I MENTIONED SOME. OTHER TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE MENTIONED, I WON'T TO DO AN ASP CORONET APPLICATION HYPOTHETICALLY. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS I CAN CHOOSE CREATE, AND I'M GOING TO SEE, YOU KNOW, OPTIONS RIGHT HERE AT THE NEW PROJECT CREATION EXPERIENCE TO ENABLE DOCOR SUPPORT IF I WANT TO DO THAT, AND, OF COURSE, I CAN ALWAYS ADD THAT TO AN EXISTING PROJECT AFTER THE FACT AS WELL. A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO DO THAT AS PART OF THE DEVOPS PIPELINE. EXACTLY. I'M GOING TO GO BACK OUT AND OPEN UP THIS FOR OUR TALK TODAY, AND WE'LL MAKE THIS AVAILABLE AT THE END IN OUR SLIDES. SO WHAT I'M GOING TO HAVE HERE, PAUL, YOU AND I ARE AN BEGINNING TO GET RICH WITH OUR NEWEST STARTUP. IT'S TAKEN US AN AWFULLY LONG TIME. PEN MISS AT A TIME. PENNIES TIME. A PENNY SAVED IS A PENNY EARNED. SO WHAT THIS APPLICATION IS GOING TO ULTIMATELY BE, IT WILL BE A PHOTO GALLERY APPLICATION, WE'LL HAVE AN ASD NET CORE APPLICATION AND RUN IMAGES AND THEN WE WANT TO INTRODUCE AN AZURE FUNCTION INTO THE PROJECT. FOR THOSE NOT FULL THEY ARE SERVERLESS. THAT DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T HAVE SERVERS EXECUTING MY CODE. WE'RE NOT MAGIC YET, AS MUCH AS WE WOULD LIKE, TO BUT IT MEANS AS A IRIS I DON'T HAVE TO CARE ABOUT RESERVING RESOURCES FOR MY APPLICATION. SERVERLESS MEANS THAT THE CLOUD IS GOING TO TAKE CARE OF SCALING UP AS MANY INSTANCES AS IT NEEDS TO HANDLE INCOMING REQUESTS THAT'S GOING TO SPIN IT DOWN AND FROM A COST PERSPECTIVE I'M ONLY GOING TO PAY FOR THE CPU CYCLES AND MEMORIES THAT I'M GOING TO USE TO EXECUTE MY FUNCTIONS. NO INCOMING REQUESTS OR EVENTS CAUSING THOSE FUNCTIONS TO TRIGGER, AND I'M NOT GOING TO --  IT'S THE MOST MANNED SERVICE POSSIBLE. COMPLETELY MANAGED BY US. EXACTLY. WE HAD A GREAT BLOG POST BY JEREMY LIKNES WHO TALKED ABOUT HIS OWN SERVICE AND I THINK IT WAS COSTING HIM 20 CENTS A MONTH FOR THOUSAND AND THOUSANDS OF WORK REQUESTS A MONTH. SWEET. SO WITH THAT LETS TALK ABOUT FUNCTIONS BECAUSE I THINK THEY ARE ONE OF THE COOL NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN THE CLOUD SPACE. IF I WANTED TO CREATE FUNCTION PROJECT, WE TALKED ABOUT HOW WE WOULD CREATE ONE, BUT I MENTIONED THEY ARE EVENT-DRIVEN SO LET'S GO AHEAD AND START MY FUNCTIONS, GO AHEAD AND START DEBUG, AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO HERE, IF I FIND THE -- SET THE STARTUP. HIT F5. THIS WILL SPIN UP THE AZURE FUNCTION'S RUN TIME LOCALLY. I HAVE NO ACTUAL CLOUD CONNECTION CURRENTLY. I'M GOING TO BE WORKING WITH THE AZURE STORAGE EMULATOR SO I'LL BE BUILDING AN EVENT-DRIVEN MODERN CLOUD APPLICATION ENTIRELY IN MY LOCAL MACHINE WITHOUT EVEN AT THIS POINT THE NEED FOR AN AZURE SUBSCRIPTION. YOU SAY IT'S EVENT DRIVEN WHAT, EVENTS DO WE CARE ABOUT HERE?  PHOTO GALLERY IS OUT. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE NOBODY STEALS OUR GREAT IDEA, NOBODY STEALS OUR IMAGES. NEVER BEEN DONE. NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE AT ALL. WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WRITTEN A LITTLE CODE THAT STAMPS A WATER MARK IN SO PEOPLE KNOW THAT THIS IMAGE CAME FROM OUR PHOTO GALLERY. A USER SHOULD UPLOAD AN IMAGE TO OUR SITE. YEAH. AND THEN IT SHOULD STAMP -- THE FUNCTION SHOULD PICK UP THAT IMAGE, STAMP A WATER MARK IN IT AND PUT IT THE BACK IN A PLACE WHERE THE SITE CAN SERVE THE IMAGE UP. I'LL GO TO MY AZURE WORKER FUNCTIONS.  YOU WANT THE THIN END DO AS THIN AS POSSIBLE AND LET THE BACK END DO THE HEAVY LIFTING.  CORRECT. WE HAVE OUR FUNCTION UP AND RUNNING. WE HAVE A LOCAL DEVELOPMENT EXPERIENCE LIKE I WOULD EXPECT IN VISUAL STUDIO SO I HAVE BREAK POINTS AND I'M ABLE TO HIT F5. IT'S LAUNCHING. ALL THE CODES ARE RUNNING HERE. NO CLOUD CONNECTION REQUIRED, AND SO LET'S GO AHEAD AND FIRE UP OUR -- ANOTHER APPLICATION HERE WHICH WOULD BE OUR CORE IMAGE GALLERY, AND DEBUG. WE'LL SAY START NEW INSTANCE, AND WHEN THIS LAUNCHES YOU'LL SEE MY PHOTO GALLERY COME UP, WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN IS WHEN I UPLOAD AN IMAGE INTO MY BLOG STORAGE I'M GOING TO EXPECT THAT THIS IMAGE UPLOAD FUNCTION IS GOING TO GET TRIGGERED. EVEN THOUGH I HAVEN'T THINK THE FUNCTIONS UP HERE AND RUNNING IN VISUAL STUDIO, SO AS SOON AS MY BROWSER -- EVEN WITH COOL ASCII ART. EACH WITH COOL ASCII ART, THAT'S CORRECT. ALL RIGHT. WE CAN LAUNCH TWO OF THEM AT A TIME. YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH MSN. YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH MSN. THAT IS VERY TRUE. IT'S A FUN WEBSITE. YEAH. LET'S GO AHEAD AND LOG MYSELF IN HERE. ANYBODY HAS ANY COMMENTS, QUESTIONS OR COMPLAINTS, THERE'S MY EMAIL ADDRESS. FORGOT TO CHECK THE REMEMBER ME CHEK BOX AGAIN. NOW I CAN UPLOAD AN IMAGE. I'M GOING TO PICK UP AN IMAGE OFF OF HERE, HAVE THESE NICE W WALLPAPER IMAGES. AND THAT BASICALLY CUED UP THE DOING.  THAT'S CORRECT. AND IF I PUT IT IN THE RIGHT PLAY,VERYTHING WOULD WORK AS I WOULD EXPECT. SO JUST TO ILLUSTRATE THIS WORKING LIKE I WOULD EXPECT HERE, WHEN I HAVE MOY Y LOCAL EMULATOR, WHAT I WANT TO SHOW IS PUTTING UP AFTERNOON IMAGE LIKE THE APPLICATION WOULD WORK. HERE BACK ON MY GALLERY PAGE WE HAVE AN IMAGE AND IF I ZOOM IN HERE AND GO DOWN VERY TINY WE HAVE OUR LITTLE WATER MARK. LAST TIME WE DID THIS PEOPLE DIDN'T BELIEVE US SO WE HAVE TO WORK ON THAT EVENT. WE'RE IN THE TECH COUNTY FOR SCALE CORRECTLY. NOW LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS IF I UPLOAD AN IMAGE HERE, UPLOAD, UPLOAD FILES. LET'S PICK ANOTHER IMAGE AS WE LOOK AT IMAGE EXPLORER. TEST THE IMAGE HERE, BEAUTIFUL, BOO. I CLICK UPLOAD, AND IT'S GOING TO UPLOAD REAL QUICK AND THEN FOR SOME REASON, LET ME MAKE SURE I HAVE MY CONNECTION STRINGS CORRECTLY -- OH, I STOPPED DEBUGGING. I SOMEHOW STOPPED DEBUGGING THAT. HELICIT HELPS IF THE FUNCTIO RUNNING.  IT DOES HELP. I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT HAPPENED. HAVE TO LEARN A LIFETIME OF MASTERING. THAT'S RIGHT. NOW I'LL EXPECT MY FUNCTION IS ACTUALLY RUNNING AS MY BREAK POINT HITS HAND CAN I STEP THROUGH. I CAN SEE THAT I HAVE FUNCTIONS THAT HAVE AUTOMATICALLY PASSED IN MY INFORMATION. I CAN SEE THE NAME OF FILE. A BEAUTIFUL STREAM OF WALLPAPER SO A FULL COMPLETE DEBUGGING EXPERIENCE AND I HAVE A SECOND FUNCTION THAT WILL DELETE THE WATER MARKED COPY SO I CAN EXPECT THIS AS A IRIS. HIT F5, F5, BOOM, IT'S UPLOADED, AND I COME INTO MY PROGRAM TO DELETE UNWATER MARKED COPY. F5, THERE'S TWO OF THEM SINCE WE ACCIDENTALLY STOPPED THE FUNCTION FROM RUNNING, PERFECT SO A GREAT OFFLINE EXPERIENCE WITH OUR MODERN CLOUD TOOLS IN VISUAL STUDIO. YEAH. ONCE I'VE DONE THAT, I HAVE MY APPLICATION THROUGH MULTI-STARTUP PROJECT HERE. LAUNCH BOTH OF THEM. JUST MAKE SURE THAT IT STARTS LIKE I WANT SO WE CAN START BOTH OF THEM -- THAT'S A GOOD TRICK FOR ANY DISTRIBUTED APP. GOOD TRICK FOR ANY DISTRIBUTED APP. OR EVEN CONTAINERIZED WORKLOADS SO CAN I START MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS LIKE THIS. OH, I PICKED THE WRONG PROJECT. THAT HELPS. AND WE WERE JUST TESTING VISUAL STUDIOS. I WAS TESTING VISUAL STUDIOS, THAT'S CORRECT.  START, START. OKAY. BOOM. BOOM. SO THOSE ARE JUST SEPARATE DISCONNECTED PROCESS EDS BUT THEY KNOW HOW TO CONNECT THROUGH THE CONNECTION STRING. THAT IS CORRECT, YES. THE ONLY THING THAT TIES THESE TWO PARTICULAR APPLICATIONS TOGETHER IS THE STORAGE ACCOUNT AT THE MOMENT. THE STORAGE ACCOUNT. AND I CAN SEE I HAVE THE TWO IMAGES I'VE UPLOADED ARE CURRENTLY PRESENT IN MY SITE. LET'S SAY I'M READY TO RUN THIS UP ON THE CLOUD NOW, PAUL, AND I HAVE AN OPERATIONS TEAM THAT'S GOING TO TAKE CARE OF A LOT OF STUFF FOR ME, BUT I'M A DEVELOPER -- AKA ME. AKA YOU. I LIKE TO TAKE CARE OF MY STUFF FIRST. TO TAKE CARE OF IT IN AZURE I RIGHT CLICK PUBLISH HERE IN VISUAL STUDIO AND I HAVE AN ABILITY TO CREATE A NEW SERVICE. NEW AZURE APP SERVICE. AN EASY THING FOR ME TO DO IF I WANTED. THIS ISN'T THE OFFICIAL DEPLOYMENT PROCESS. THIS IS LIKE THE QUICK WAY TO TRY IT OUT. EXACTLY. OKAY. NOW IT SO HAPPENS AS YOU MENTIONED BECAUSE YOU'RE ON MY OPS TEAM, I WOULD CLICK CREATE AND BE UP AND RUNNING, HAVE IT UP AND RUNNING IN THE CLOUD BUT YOU'RE MY OPERATIONS TEAM, ALREADY CREATED SOMETHING FOR ME IN AZURE, SO I CAN CHOOSE THE EXISTING APP SERVICE THAT YOU PROVISIONED SO IF YOU WORK IN AN ORGANIZATION WHERE SOMEBODY CREATES THE RESOURCE FOR THE TEAM WHETHER IT'S OPERATIONS OR A PARTICULAR MEMBER OF THE TEAM, WE'VE REALLY OPTIMIZED TO MAKE SURE THAT WORK WAS SELECTING AN EXISTING RESOURCES WORKS JUST AS GOOD. I'M GLAD YOU'RE DOING IT. WE'VE HAD THIS FEEDBACK A LOT. THERE ARE PREEXISTING RESOURCES AND YOU NEED TO BIND THEM RIGHT DOWN TO THE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES, RIGHT. YEAH. LEVERAGE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DONE. NOW THIS PARTICULAR APPLICATION USES A SEQUEL SERVER TO LET ME LOG IN TO KEEP THE USER ACCOUNT INFORMATION AND ALSO USES A STORAGE ACCOUNT. YEAH. AND IF I DIDN'T HAVE THOSE I HAVE THE ABILITY NOW AFTER I PUBLISHED THE APPLICATION OR ONCE I'VE SELECTED AN EXISTING ONE TO GO THEN GO ADD AZURE STORAGE AND AZURE DATA SEQUEL TO IT DIRECTLY FROM THE VISUAL STUDIO. WE TRY TO TAKE ALL THE COMMON SERVICES THAT YOU WOULD NEED AND MAKE IT REALLY EASY FOR YOU TO DO THAT DIRECTLY FROM VISUAL STUDIO. TO YOUR LAST POINT YOU COMBINE EXISTING ONES, TOO. EXACTLY. THAT'S GOING TO BE A THEME THROUGHOUT EVERYTHING THAT WE SHOW. EXACTLY. EITHER CREATE OR SELECT EXISTING. BOTH SERVICES COMPLETELY SUPPORT, THAT SO IN FACT THIS PARTICULAR CASE, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU'VE CREATED A DATABASE FOR US. I'VE DECIDED YOU'VE FEVER SON REELS. PAUL DOESN'T ACTUALLY TRUST ME. HIS PERSONAL EXISTENCE. TURNS OUT HE LIKES PAYING HIS MORTGAGE. THERE WAS THE VM INCIDENT THAT I'M STILL RECOVERING FROM, SO, YES. GREAT. SO KIND OF TO BRIEFLY REVIEW WHERE WE ENDED THAT. YEAH. WE'VE ALSO NOT ONLY MADE IT REALLY EASY TO GET STARTED BY HAVING PROJECT TEMPLATES AND ALL THE TOOLS YOU WANT FOR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT, WE'VE MADE IT REALLY EASY TO TEST YOUR APPLICATIONS IN AZURE BEFORE YOU HAND THAT OVER TO OPERATIONS TEAM OR PUSH THAT INTO PRODUCTION, AND WE SHOWED A COUPLE OF THE PUBLISHED AND PROVISION CAPABILITIES THAT WE'VE ADDED AT VISUAL STUDIOS AND WE'VE HAD SOME REALLY GREAT DIAGNOSTICS INTEGRATION THAT YOU CAN SHOW HERE IN ONE MINUTE. AND THE LAST THING THAT I DIDN'T SHOW THAT'S WORTH MENTIONING IS WE HAVE REALLY GREAT INTERACT WITH AZURE DEVOPS SO IF YOU WANT TO SET UP A PIPELINE, USE AZURE DEVOPS TO ACTUALLY DEPLOY AND BUILD AS PART OF A CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION WORK FLOW. THAT'S ALL NATIVE INDIVIDUAL STUDIOS AS WELL.  WITH THAT, WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME HOW I FIXED THINGS ONCE I ACTUALLY BREAK THEM IN THE CLOUD.  WELL SAID. OKAY. SO THE FIRST THING WHERE I PICKED OFF -- WHERE I PICKED UP WHERE ANDREW LEFT OFF IS I'VE DEFINED ACTUALLY ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED FOR THIS APPLICATION, BUT I'VE DEFINED IT USING WHAT WE CALL AN ARMED TEMPLATE. ARM MEANING AZURE RESOURCE MANAGER SO THAT'S UP ON OUR WEBSITES AND YOU CAN GRAB IT, AND ONCE WE DEPLOY THAT WITH THE ONE-LINE, YOU CAN SEE THAT ALL OF OUR RESOURCES ARE CREATED UP IN A RESOURCE GROUP. THIS IS KIND OF LIKE OUR NAME SPACE TO WORK ON, AND -- AND AT THAT POINT THIS GIVES ME A GOOD SEPARATION REALLY BETWEEN OPS CONCERNS AND THE DeV CONCERNS. I CAN WORK ON THIS AND SECURE IT IT AND MAKE IT WORK THE WAY I WANT AND YOU CAN FREELY USE THESE RESOURCES. A FEW THINGS THAT I WANT TO DRILL IN ON. I HAVE A WEB APP AND I HAVE THE FUNCTIONS TO HANDLE THE BACK END, AND THE WEB APP, YOU KNOW, AT THIS POINT YOU CAN COMPLETELY CONFIGURE FOR SCALE, RIGHT. I CAN SCALE IT UP TO USE BETTER HARD WARE, OR WHAT I RECOMMEND MORE IS YOU WOULD SCALE IT OUT, HAVE MORE VIRTUAL INSTANCES THAT YOU CAN USE, AND THEN, YOU KNOW, MOST PEOPLE WANT TO THE DO THINGS LIKE SET UP SSL AND SET UP BETTER NETWORKING, BUT WITH THAT SAID, WHAT I REALLY WANT TO DO AT THIS POINT IS I WANT TO LOOK AT THE HEALTH OF MY APPLICATION, AND THE REALLY COOL THING IS APPS THAT WE MADE THE VISUAL STUDIO BY DEFAULT AND THEN APPS USE THE PATTERN THAT I SHOW IN THIS ARMED TEMPLATE, THEY ARE GOING TO BE IMMEDIATELY MONITORABLE AND DIAGNOSABLE SO WE BASICALLY SET UP AZURE MONITORING, OBSERVABILITY AND SET UP THE DEEP DIAGNOSTICS. LET'S CHECK THAT OUT. SO I CAN SEE IN MY WEB APP I AM GETTING METRIX, AND WHAT WE REALLY SEE IS THAT METRIX AND LOGS ARE AT THE HEART OF, YOU KNOW, ALL DIAGNOSTICS, ALL MONITORING IN THE CLOUD, SO WE'VE REALLY, YOU KNOW, KIND OF EMB EMBRACED THAT WITH OUR TOOLING AND WITH OUR SERVICES AND TAKE A DEEPER LOOK AT OUR APPLICATION MONITORING SO I HAVE MY FAILURES, MY HEALTHY REQUESTS, MY RESPONSE TIMES FOR PERFORMANCE AND MY 100% UP TIME WHICH I'M VERY HAPPY ABOUT. I WRITE ROCK SOLID CODE. YEAH, YOU DO. LET'S PUT THAT TO THE TEST, SIR. SO ONE THING THAT I ALWAYS RECOMMEND DOING IS JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THIS APPLICATION MAP IN MONITORING BECAUSE WHAT WE CAN DO IS INSPECT REALLY A RUN TIME WHAT THE TOPOLOJY OF YOUR APPLICATION IS AND ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF REQUESTS. WE CAN TRACE THOSE TRANSACTIONS ACROSS TIERS. AND TONIGHT YOU KNOW IT'S A BUSY DAY PROBABLY ON THIS LOCAL NETWORK. THAT'S OKAY. YEAH, YEAH. WE HAVE ONE OR TWO THINGS GOING ON TODAY AROUND HERE. YEAH, WE DO. ON CAMPUS. OKAY.  WELL. ESPECIALLY IN THIS BUILDING.  SOME OTHER THINGS WHILE WE'RE DOING THAT, I MENTIONED, THAT YOU KNOW, REALLY YOUR TRACE AND YOUR LOGS ARE OUT THE HEART OF TINGS. ALL OF THE TRACE AND ALL OF THE LOGS ARE COMING IN, AND WE CAN DO SOME EXTRA SPECIAL THINGS BECAUSE, AGAIN, WE SET UP MONITORING AND .NET APPS WORK BETTER ON ASSURE BECAUSE WE AUTOMATICALLY EMIT A LOT OF TRACE AND MONITORING EVENTS. YOU'RE SEEING DEPENDENCIES, REQUESTS AND AVAILABILITIES BEING DEVELOPED AS PART OF THE TRACE AND WHEN I GO TO FAILURES, THIS GIVES ME BOTH THE ACTUAL LIST OF FAILURES, BUT IT'S ACTUALLY DOING AGGREGATE ANALYSIS. WHAT ARE MY TYPE EXCEPTION TYPES AND WHAT ARE THE TOP RESPONSE CODES OVER TIME, IS AND SO WE DO, IN FACT -- I MEAN, IT'S PART OF LIFE. WE'RE SEEING EXCEPTIONS, AND WE'RE SEEING RESPONSES. THE ONE THAT IS A LITTLE BIT MORE OPAQUE TO ME WOULD BE THIS NULL REFERENCE EXCEPTION. THAT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE CRINGE AT WHEN THOSE COME IN. YEAH. SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE. SO WE'RE SEEING HERE -- WE CALL THIS AN END-TO-END VIEW TRANSACTION IN AZURE AND WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL THE HDP VIEWERS AND TRACING ALL THE SUCCESSFUL CALLS TOWN TO THE POINT WHERE THERE'S A FAILURE. HERE WE'RE SAYING THAT THE 500 IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A LOWER LEVEL EXCEPTION, AND AS YOU EXPECT IT'S A NULL REFERENCE EXCEPTION, AND CAN I TELL FROM A CALL STACK THAT THIS HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH YOUR UPLOADING CODE, BUT THAT'S REALLY NOT A WHOLE LOT TO GO ON, LIKE ANY WORKING THEORIES ON WHAT THAT COULD BE. UPLOAD. I MEAN, WE DO TRY TO COLLECT SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE FILE TO RECORD A RECORD IN OUR DATABASE. OKAY. MAYBE SOME RECORDS BEING LEFT NULL IN SOME CASES.  THAT'S A GOOD ONE. WE'LL TAKE A COUPLE OF HOURS AND GO SEE IF YOU CAN FIND THAT.  CLEARLY IT WORKED ON MY MACHINE. SO, YOU KNOW, TO CUT TO THE CHASE, THE COOL THING IS YOU'VE SEEN EARLIER TODAY WE HAVE A SNAPCHAT TO BUGGER AND VISUAL STUDIO AND ALSO BROUGHT THAT TO THE CLOUD SO YOU CAN CLICK ON -- FOR ANY, YOU KNOW, EXCEPTION THAT'S BEING MONITORED WE CREATE THESE DEBUGGED SNAPSHOTS AND THE REALLY UNIQUE THING IS I'LL GET LOCAL VARIABLES AND IF I GO TO THE USER NAME THE MOST SUSPICIOUS THING THAT I'M SAYING, WE'RE GETTING EXCEPTIONS ON THE UPLOADS WHICH IS REALLY WACKY. YOU SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO UPLOAD A FILE IF YOU'RE NOT LOGGED IN AS AN USER. LET'S TEST THAT. IF WE UPLOAD AN IMAGE ON OUR SITE -- I REALLY LIKE ENGINES, BY THE WAY, IN CASE YOU DIDN'T NOTICE, SO COOL. THAT LOOKS GOOD, AND -- AND -- I THINK --  THAT'S A NO REPRO. BEWE WERE USING NO USER INFORMATION. WHAT IF YOU TRY LOGGING OUT. AS YOU DID SEE NOBODY IS LOGGED IN. LET'S GIVE THAT A SHOT, AND -- AND LET'S UPLOAD SOME FISH THIS TIME. I LIKE FISH, TOO. THERE WITH GO. SOME OF OUR USERS ARE GETTING THIS ERROR, AND IT'S ONE OF THE CASES THAT WE PROBABLY HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF. WE SEE THIS A LOT IN THE CLOUD, YOU KNOW. THINGS WORK IN YOUR LAB IN YOUR TESTING AND ONCE YOU GET REAL CUSTOMER INPUT EVERYTHING CHANGES. I JUST CHECKED THE REMEMBER ME CHECK BOX WHEN I SIGNED IN. WE REAL SHOULDN'T BE LETTING PEOPLE UPLOAD IMAGES IF THEY HAVEN'T REGISTERED FOR AN ACCOUNT. THAT'S PRETTY WEAK. AND THERE'S OTHER PLACES YOU CAN TALK BEYOND HERE. WE TALKED ABOUT FAILURES AND HELP, AND WHAT I ALSO WANT TO THE DO IS GET TO THE POINT WHERE I'M PROACTIVELY LOOKING AT THE PERFORMANCE OF MY APPLICATION. THE THING I LIKE TO DO IS I GO TO THIS PERFORMANCE BLADE AND I SORT BY ALL OF MY CONTROLLERS OR ALL OF MY OPERATIONS IN THE CLOUDS, YOU KNOW, FROM FREQUENT TO LEAST FREQUENT THAT. GIVES ME OF AN IDEA OF WHAT MY CUSTOMERS ARE DOING AND I TAKE A LOOK AT THE DURATION AND SEE THE EXPERIENCES PEOPLE ARE HAVING, AND IF I GO TO THE 95th PERCENTILE, HEY, 5% OF MY CUSTOMERS ARE STARTING TO HAVE PRETTY DODGY EXPERIENCES LIKE OVER EIGHT SECONDS FOR A REQUEST, SO THAT'S DEFINITELY WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO, AND THE COOL THING IS WE CAN JUST GET SOME PROFILE TRACES THAT OPEN RIGHT UP IN VISUAL STUDIOS PROFILERS. I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS FOR YOU REAL QUICK ON THE DIAGNOSTIC STUFF. YEAH.  BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE CHEATED AHEAD OF TIME AND SAID WE HAD REALLY NICE INTEGRATION WITH VISUAL STUDIOS AS WELL AS FROM THIS. FIRST OF ALL, IS THE EXCEPTION THAT YOU'VE HAD, THE SUPER COOL, SUPER KIND OF INTERESTING, NEEDED IN A LOT OF CASES. WE SAW THERE WAS AN ISSUE THAT POPPED UP IN THE CLOUD THAT WE WERE ABLE TO DEBUG THAT I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT OR TESTED IN MY LOCAL MACHINE AND NO MATTER HOW THOROUGH WE ARE ABOUT TESTING STUFF THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. IS THERE ANY WAY FROM MY OWN DEV TEST ENVIRONMENT AS A DEVELOPER THAT I CAN BRING THAT EXCEPTION INFORMATION BACK INTO VISUAL STUDIO WITHOUT THE NEEDING TO GO MONITOR THE PORTAL REGULARLY?  THERE'S INTEGRATION OF AZURE MONITORING IN THE APPLICATION FAILURES, FROM APPLICATION INSIGHTS RIGHT INSIDE OF THE IDE SO NAVIGATE TO NAVIGATE INSIGHTS IN YOUR PROJECT. IT WILL BE LINKED UP. SWEET. SECOND QUESTION, YOU SHOWED ME THE GREAT DEBUGGING EXPERIENCE IN THE CLOUD WITH SNAPSHOT DEBAUNGD WE KNOW VISUAL STUDIOS HAVE SNAPSHOT DEBUG AND IF I DECIDED I WASN'T GETTING ENOUGH INFORMATION OUT OF THE VARIABLE VIEW OUT OF THE CLOUD I CAN BRING THAT BACK AND DEBUG IT LIKE A DUMP IN VISUAL STUDIO. WE GLOSSED OVER IT. THERE WAS A BLUE BUTTON THAT SAYS OPEN IN VISUAL STUDIO AND YOU DO THAT AND IT CREATES THE KIND OF DUMP FILE AND META DATA THAT WE UNDERSTAND IN VISUAL STUDIOS. LOADS YOUR SYMBOLS AND GETS YOU GOING. YOU'LL ALWAYS GET A BETTER EXPERIENCE INSIDE VISUAL STUDIO AND WE LINK TO THAT. IT'S PRETTY COOL WHETHER YOU'RE AN OPERATOR, DEVOPS TO HAVE SOMETHING IN THE PORTAL. THE PORTAL IS WHERE IT STARTS BUT AS A DEVELOPER IT'S NICE TO GET THAT VIEW ON MY SOURCE CODE FROM EXCEPTIONS AND, YOU KNOW, IF I NEEDED TO DIG IN DEEPER TO THE FILE. THE LAST QUESTION, THE APPLICATION MAP LOADED BECAUSE I LOVE THE APPLICATION MAT. NOT GOING TO WORK FOR US.  OH, THERE WE GO. IT IS PRETTY SWEET. THIS IS AN AGGREGATE VIEW SHOWING THE TOPOLOGY OF OUR SERVICES SO WE HAVE THE WEB APP AND THE FUNCTIONS. THIS IS A LITTLE DISTRIBUTED APP SO WE HAVE THE STORAGE SERVICES LIKE BLOB AND SEQUEL AND I'M ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THE HEALTH H.CAN I DRILL IN, WHEN I HAVE A FAILURE RATE OR A SLOW, "I CAN NAVIGATE RIGHT FROM HERE SO IT'S JUST A HELPFUL NAVIGATION VISUALIZATION TOUR. THE REALLY AWESOME THING ABOUT THAT YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO BUILD THAT. THE DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS, AZURE MONITOR AUTOMATICALLY BUILT THAT MAP BY TRACING DATA FLOW TO THE APPLICATION IN THE CLOUD. IT WON'T LIKE YOU HAD TO UPLOAD AN ADJACENT FILE. A TEENY BIT MORE TO THE STORY IF YOU WANT TO GEEK UP. .NET HELPS AUTOTRACE, EXCEPTIONS IN AUTOTRACE REQUESTS IN CONJUNCTION WITH AZURE MONITORING SO THERE'S THINGS LIKE CORRELATION I.D.s AND WE UNDERSTAND THE TRANSACTION THROUGH ALL THESE COMPONENTS SO IT'S THE COMBINATION OF .NET AND AZURE MONITORING THAT MAKE IT WORK. THAT IS REALLY COOL. JUST REAL QUICK REFRESHERS, WE TALKED -- PAUL BRIEFLY SHOWED AZURE MONITOR WHICH IS OUR SOLUTION BUILT INTO AZURE FOR DIAGNOSING PROBLEMS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE, WHETHER IT WOULD BE DEV TESTS, PRODUCTION PONT MATTER AND PRODUCTION DOESN'T RUN IN AZURE AND IT HAS SOME DEEP HOOKS TO INDIVIDUAL STUDIOS TO MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO BRING THE INFORMATION BACK TO YOUR WORK FLOW AS A DEVELOPER. REAL QUICK, AS I PROMISED, WE HAVE A COUPLE OF RESOURCES, SO YOU CAN GET THE SAMPLE APP THAT WE WERE PLAYING WITH, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT TO STEAL PAUL AND I'S IDEA AND SEE IF YOU CAN OUTCOMPETE US IN THE IF CENT APPLICATION. ENCOURAGE TO YOU DO BETTER. AKA LINK IS UP THERE, SO JUST TYPE IN THAT URL AND IT WILL TAKE YOU TO THE GITHUB REPOSITORY AND A LOT OF PRE-RECORDED SESSIONS THAT WE GO INTO A LOT OF DEBT ON VISUAL TOOLING 2019. DEBUGGING.  AND PAUL GIVES A GREAT OVERVIEW OF CONTAINER TOOLS THAT HE MENTIONED AND DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO MENTION ON HERE. WITH THAT, SETH, WHAT QUESTIONS DO WE HAVE HERE?  WHAT DO WE HAVE GOING ON HERE?  THAT WAS AWESOME. ONE OF THE COOLEST THINGS ABOUT WORKING IN THE CLOUD, SPECIFICALLY AT VISUAL STUDIO IT FEELS LIKE THE EXPERIENCE I USED TO HAVE WHEN I KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON LOCALLY. I CAN NOW ALSO HAVE WITH THE CLOUD. IS THAT WHAT WE'RE GOING FOR?  THAT IS WHAT WE'RE GOING FOR, YEAH. AND IT'S GOING TO BE NOT POSSIBLE IN EVERY CASE. THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE HARD TO SIMULATE LOCALLY BUT FOR THE REALLY COMMON SCENARIOS WE DEFINITELY WANT TO TRY TO MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO DO IT LOCALLY. THERE ARE SOME THINGS WE'VE BEEN WISHING FOR FOR A LONG TIME WE CAN ACTUALLY DO NOW BECAUSE THERE'S ENOUGH POWER AND UPDATE IN THE CLOUD. LIKE WE CAN PREDICT WHAT YOUR TOP ERRORS ARE AND WE CAN HELP YOU DEBUG IT, YOU KNOW, WITHOUT BREAKING PRODUCTION. THAT'S COOL. LET'S GET INTO THE REAL QUESTIONS. FOR THOSE OUT THERE WATCHING, WE WANT YOUR QUESTIONS, HAVE THEM COME IN AND I'LL GET THEM ON THE BOARD OF. THE SOONER I GET THEM ON. FROM MICK, WILL THE ABILITY TO RUN AZURE FUNCTIONS BE AVAILABLE WITH THE MAC EDITION?  EASY ANSWER IS YES. IT'S ALREADY AVAILABLE FOR THE MAC EDITION. I THINK THEY SHIPPED THAT LAST SUMMER.  SO ALSO FROM MICK, AMEND HE'S -- HE'S USED SOME STRONG WORDS. I'M JUST GOING TO BLOCK THIS PART. ANY ANEW TOOLING FOR THE BEAUTIFUL A.R.M.TEMPLATES?  YES. I'LL TAKE THAT. WE HAVE FAR BETTER INTELISENSE THAT WE USED IN THIS VERSION. WE WORKED ON THE PERFORMANCE TO MAKE IT BINDABLE A LOT FASTER AND ALSO SO THAT WE CAN SCHEME SCHEMERS THAT ARE PROVIDED BY AZURE FOR THE MANY MANY HUNDREDS OF RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE SO THAT WILL MAKE INTELISENSE DEFINITELY A LOT BETTER AND WE KNOW THERE'S SO MUCH TO DO WITH A.R.M. IT'S A TARGET-RICH ENVIRONMENT. TARGET-RICH ENVIRONMENT. LIKE MY GARAGE. A TARGET-RICH ENVIRONMENT OF THINGS THAT I CAN DO THAT. ADDING TO WHAT PAUL SAID. A LOT OF THAT WORK IS STILL IN FLIGHT. YOU'LL SEE A SOMEWHAT BETTER PERFORMANCE IF YOU START WITH 2019 TODAY, BUT WE ACTUALLY HAVE A TEAM OF PEOPLE WITH, I DON'T KNOW, SIX ENGINEERS OR SO ACTIVELY WORKING ON BETTER A.R.M. TOOLING AS WE SPEAK SO IT WILL CONTINUE TO GET BETTER.  YEAH, YOU KNOW, LIKE THE FIRST TIME I ACTUALLY USED A.R.M. TEMPLATES, ONCE I UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS GOING ON, IT WAS PRETTY POWERFUL FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO STAND UP AN ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THINGS WITH THE SINGLE CALL. ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN, EVERYONE -- LOOK, WHENEVER I BUILD SOFT WEAR AND SOMEONE IS LIKE, HEY, YOU KNOW, CAN IT ALSO DO THIS, OR CAN YOU FIX THIS PART? IT MEANS THAT I'VE GOT THE RIGHT CORE AND NOW WE'VE JUST GOT SOME DETAILS TO WORK OUT. HERE'S A QUESTION FOR YOU, AND THIS IS FROM ME. HOW DO YOU PRIORITIZE THE FEATURES THAT YOU PUT IN TO THE SOFTWARE? LIKE WHAT IS IT LIKE -- FOR THOSE THAT ARE WATCHING, I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE WE HAVE A DART BOARD AND IT'S LIKE, OH, WE DIDN'T HIT A.R.M. TEMPLATES SO WE'RE NOT DOING THAT ONE. WHAT IS IT LIKE FOR YOU?  TAKE THAT. I'LL TAKE IT FIRST AND PAUL CAN CORRECT ME WHERE I MESS UP. I MEAN, THE SHORT ANSWER IS FEEDBACK FROM OUR CUSTOMERS IS THE NUMBER ONE AREA WE USE TO PRIORITIZE, SO, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE THE DEVELOPER COMMUNITY BUILT RIGHT INTO THE STUDIO WHERE YOU CAN FILE SUGGESTION TICKETS AND ISSUES. REALLY THAT'S THE TOP THING THAT GOES IN WHAT DO WE HEAR FROM PEOPLE THAT THEY NEED AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED, AND THEN THE OTHER THING THAT COMES INTO PLAY IS TRYING TO TALK TO THE AZURE TEAM QUITE REGULARLY AND UNDERSTAND WHAT'S NEW, WHAT'S COMING, WHAT IS NEEDS TOOLING. OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T WANT NEW EXPERIENCES AND NEW APPLICATION TYPES TO BE IN AZURE THAT YOU CAN'T TOOL OR BUILD IN VISUAL STUDIO WITH .NET. IT'S LIKE THOSE TWO ARE REAL THE TOP TWO THINGS THAT FEED INTO IT IS WHAT OUR CUSTOMERS ARE ASKING FOR AND WHERE THE PLATFORM THAT IS GOING TO NEED RETOOLING?  I AGREE. WE WANT TO MAKE CUSTOMERS STILL AT THE END OF THE DAY AND WE GET A GOOD SIGNAL FROM CUSTOMER FEEDBACK AND WE GET A TELEMETRY ON USAGE AND THAT'S TO HELP US UNDERSTAND AREAS WITH A LOT OF USAGE THAT DON'T HAVE THE GOOD FEEDBACK TO GO WITH IT AND THAT'S HUMAN AND IN GENERAL WE TRY TO MAKE THE BIGGEST IMPACT THAT WE CAN WITH THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE WHICH IS I THINK LIKE MANY COMPANIES. SOMEONE IS USING VISUAL STUDIO AND THEY ARE GOING TO USE AZURE, WHAT WOULD BE THE FIRST THING YOU WOULD POINT THEM TO? LIKE DAY ONE, YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE USING AZURE AND VISUAL STUDIO, YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY LOOK AT THIS THING. WHAT WOULD IT BE?  I WOULD SAY BASICALLY THE APP THAT I DEMOED MINUS THE FUNCTIONS. START WITH AN ASP CORONET APPLICATION AND PUBLISH IT TO AZURE APP SERVICES. THAT'S REALLY THE BEST WAY TO GET STARTED WITH AZURE. YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO TURN ON ALL THE DIAGNOSTIC TOOLING THAT PAUL TALKED ABOUT. WE DIDN'T SHOW IT. YOU CAN REMOTE DEBUG FOR YOUR APP SERVICES FROM VISUAL STUDIO SEWS IT'S A COMFORTABLE PLACE TO GET FAMILIAR WITH SOME OF THE CONCEPTS AND TRYING TO RUN SOMETHING IN AZURE THE WEB APP AND APP SERVICE WORKS VERY, VERY WELL FOR ANY KIND OF STATELESS APPLICATION, STATELESS RUN WEB APP AND STATELESS WEB API. FOR THAT KIND OF CORE SERVICE IT'S GREAT AND SO MANY THINGS ARE BUILT IN, YOU KNOW, FROM SSL TO SLOTS, SO DEFINITELY START THERE. AWESOME. ONE MORE QUESTION, AND THEN FROM KENDALL., IF THAT'S OKAY, - LOGIC APP SUPPORT IN 2019, AZURE SEQUEL OR AZURE STORAGE WHEN PUBLISHING, IS THIS SOMETHING WE'LL BE TABLE DO SOON?  I'LL ANSWER THE QUESTION IN TWO PARTS THERE. IS AN EXTENSION FOR BUILDING APPS IN THE STUDIO TODAY. THOSE ARE WORK. HAVE YOU TO GET THEM FROM THE VISUAL STUDIO EXTENSION GALLERY AND THE COSMOS DB ON OUR RADAR, AAIN, GIVE US THAT FEEDBACK AND LET PEOPLE VOTE ON IT. IT'S SIMPLY A QUESTION OF WE LIKE TO DO IT BUT WE HAVE TO PRIORITIZE IT DID AGAINST OTHER ASKS AND WORK ON OUR PLATE. WE DID DO SOME COOL TOOLING, FIRST CLASS TOOLS FOR COSMOS AND THAT'S AWESOME. THANK YOU SO MUCH, ANDREW AND PAUL, THAT'S BEEN AMERENGUES, BUT UP NEXT WE HAVE DAN ROTH BUILDING AMAZING DEVOPS WITH .NET CORE. HOW ARE YOU DOING, BUD?  TAKE IT AWAY. MY NAME IS DANIELLE ROTH AND I'M A PROGRAM MANAGER ON THE TEAM AND I'M THRILLED TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT BUILDING AMAZING WEB YAPS WITH .NET CORE AND VISUAL STUDIO 2019. VISUAL STUDIO 2019 COMES WITH THE LATEST VERSION OF .NET CORE IN THE BOX. .NET CORE 2 BEEN THE 2 WHICH IS LOADED WITH A LOT OF GREAT NEW FEATURES. WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK ON THE TEMPLATES TO SIMPLIFY THEM AND CLEAN THEM UP. WE'VE UPDATED THEM TO USE BOOT STRAPPED FOUR AND UPDATED THE ANGULAR TEMPLATE TO USE ANGULAR SIX. ANGULAR SEVEN WILL BE COMING IN THE NEXT RELEASE. DID A LOT OF IMPROVEMENTS ON WEB API. WE'VE HAD ANALYZERS AND CONVENTIONS THAT MAKE IT EASY TO GENERATE COMPLETE SWAGGER DOCUMENTS OR OWN API SPECIFICATIONS FOR YOUR APIs. WE ADDED HB2 SUPPORT, OUR CROSS-PLATFORM WEB SERVER, AND WE ALSO ENAGED IN-PROCESS HOSTING SUPPORT FOR IAS. ADDED A NEW HEALTH CHECKS FRAME WORK AND NEW ROUTING FRAMEWORK CALLED END POINT ROUTING ARE. LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO DO WELL DEVELOPMENT WITH VISUAL STUDIO 2019. LET'S GO OVER HERE TO VISUAL STUDIO. I'M GOING TO CREATE A NEW ASD .NET CORE WE APPLICATION. WEB APPLICATION SOUNDS GREAT. I'M GOING TO PUT IT THE IN MY DEMO FOLDER. IN A LOOKS GOOD. LET'S CREATE THAT. OKAY. NOW YOU'LL NOTICE AT THE TOP THAT ASP .NET CORE 2.2 AND I ALREADY INSTALLED THAT. WHEN I INSTALLED THE DOC NETWORK LOAD. LET'S GREET A WEB APP AND THAT WILL GO AHEAD AND CREATE MY PROJECT FOR IT. WE'LL WAIT FOR THE PACKAGE RESTORE TO COMPLETE AND THEN WE'LL GO AHEAD AND BILL AND RUN THIS AND SEE WHAT THE TEMPLATE LOOKS LIKE. LET'S BUILD AND RUN T.HIGHLY WE'RE WAITING FOR IT TO BUILD AND RUN, IF WE LOOK AT THIS TEMPLATE, HOPEFULLY YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S A LOT MORE LIGHTWEIGHT. A LOT MORE FEWER FILES IN THIS FEM PLATE. WE'VE DONE SOME WORK TO TRY TO SLIM IT DOWN, GET RID OF THE STUFF THAT YOU END UP HAVING TO DELETE WHEN YOU WANT TO START A NEW PROJECT SO YOU CAN GET FASTER GOING FOR NEW APPLICATIONS. THE APPLICATIONS ARE UP AND RUNNING NOW AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO RENDER WHAT IT IS, A AND NOW THE NEW TEMPLATES ASP .NET 2.IT A LOT CLEANER AND SIMPLER AND FRESHER LOOKING AND THIS IS ALL BASED ON BOOTSTOP FOUR. GO LOOKING AT THE LAYOUT FOR THE APPLICATION WE SHOULD SEE BOOTSTOP FOUR AND THAT'S WIRED UP BY DEFAULT THIS. APPLICATION IS USING I.S. EXPRESS TO HOST APPLICATION. LET'S DO SOMETHING REAL QUICK. LET'S GO INTO THE HOME PAGE OF THE APP, AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO INSIDE THE HEADER HERE, AND LET'S PRINT OUT THE NAME OF THE CURRENT PROCESS THAT THE APP IS RUNNING IN, SO DIAGNOSTICS PROCESS, GET CURRENT PROCESS, AND THEN THE PROCESS NAME. THERE WE GO. SO LET'S JUST SAVE, THAT AND THEN I'LL RESEARCH THE HOME PAGE OF THE APPLICATION. WE SHOULD NOW SEE THE PROCESS THAT THE APP IS RUNNING IN, AND IT'S RUNNING IN THE IAS EXPRESSION PROCESS. THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN EARLIER VERSIONS OF .NET CORE AND' SD .NET CORE N.EARLIER VERSIONS IT WOULD FLIGHT 261 AN X E PROCESS AND IT HAD A NUMBER OF ISSUES. HAD A PERFORMANCE HIT, AND IF ANYTHING WENT WRONG YOUR .NET XE PROCESS IT WAS HARD TO DIAGNOSE IT. STARTING IN .NET 2.2 YOU CAN DOWNLOAD YOUR APPS DIRECTLY INTO THE IAS PROCESS. MUCH BETTER PERFORMANCE AND MUCH EASIER TO DEBUNK AND DEBUG ISSUES. THAT'S GREAT. INSTEAD OF RUNNING THIS APP IN I.S. EXPRESS, LET'S FLIP IT TO BE A STAND-ALONE APPLICATION, A CONSOLE APP HOSTING ON AN ASP .NET CORE APPLICATION. AND THE PROCESS SHOULD CHANGE BECAUSE WE'RE NO LONGER USING I.S. AT ALL SO WE WOULD BE EXPECTED TO BE BACK TO RUNNING A .NET XE PROCESS. THAT'S GREAT. LET'S BRING UP THE BROWSER DEV TOOLS AND LOOK AT THE NETWORK TRAYS AS WE RESEARCH THE APPLICATION. ALL THE FILES THAT ARE BEING DOWNLOADED. NOTICE ALL THE FILES BY DEFAULT ARE BEING DOWNLOADED OVER HDP 1.1 BUT IN .NET 2.2 WE'VE ADDED SUPPORT. IT'S NOT ON BY DEFAULT. YOU HAVE TONE ABLE IT, BUT IT'S REAL EASY TO DO. LET'S GO AHEAD AND DO IT. CODE SNIPPET HERE. I'M GOING TO COPY THAT OUT AND GRAB THAT AND GO BACK TO THE APPLICATION. WE'LL STOP IT AND THEN UPDATE OUR -- OUR -- WHERE WE'RE BUILDING UP THE WEB HOST, SO LET'S GO AHEAD AND ADD A LITTLE BIT OF CODE HERE TO ENABLE KESTREL AND WE NEED HAD A NAME SPACE. WE'RE ENABLING HP1 AND HP2 PROTOCOLS AND SETTING UP HPS SO WE CAN DO NEGOTIATION WITH THE BROWSER TO SET UP HP2. LET'S NOW RUN THE APPLICATION. RUNNING ON KESTREL AND SEE IF WE SEE ANY DIFFERENCE. BACK IN THE BROIRZ, STILL RUNNING ON .NET. LOOK AT THE BROWSER DEPTH TOOLS AND REFRESH THE APPLICATION, VOILA, INSTEAD OF HP 1.1 YOU SEE THE PROTOCOL IS H2 WHICH IS SHORT FOR HP2 AND THAT'S GREAT FOR FEATURES LIKE CONNECTION REUSE AND COMPRESSED HEADERS AND ALL THE OPTIMIZATIONS THAT COME WITH USING THE HB2 PROTOCOL. COOL. WHAT ABOUT WEB API DEVELOPMENT WITH .NET CORE 2.2, LET'S CLOSE THE BROWSER AND CLOSE THIS APP AND OPEN UP A DIFFERENT PROJECT. I WAS WORKING EARLIER ON API. MY PET'S API, ONE OF MY FAVORITE APIs TO WORK ON, ONE INTENDED TO MANAGE A LIST OF PETS THAT YOU CAN ADD PETS AND GET THE FULL LIVES PETS AND SO FORTH. SIMPLE CRUD OPERATIONS. LET'S -- I ALREADY STARTED A LITTLE BIT HERE. I DEFINED MY MODEL TYPE. HERE'S MY PET CLASS AND IT HAS AN ID AND A NAME. OKAY. NOW I WANT TO CREATE AN API CONTROLLER BASED OFF OF THIS MODEL, SO I'M GOING TO USE VISUAL STUDIO TO HELP ME DO THAT. LET'S ADD A NEW CONTROLLER. ALL RIGHT. I'M GOING TO CREATE AN API CONTROLLER WITH ACTIONS USING FRAME WORK SO THE FRAMEWORK WILL BE USED TO STORE THE PET DATA. LET'S STORE THAT. FOR THE MODEL DATA LET'S USE PET. VIAL A CLASS THAT I'LL RETRUCE AND FOR THE CONTROLLER NAME, BETS CONTROLLER SOUNDS GREAT. WE'LL GO AHEAD AND GENERATE THAT. NOW VISUAL STUDIO WILL GENERATE FOR ME AN ENTIRE CLASS WITH ACTION METHODS THAT HAVE ALL THE CRUD OPTIONS LIKE GET, POST AND DELETE AND ALL THE CODE FOR THE FRAMER CORE IS ALREADY DONE FOR MEAL SO I'VE GOT MY API SET TO GO HERE. HIVE ALSO ALREADY GONE INTO THIS PROJECT AND ENABLED SWAGGER GENERATION OR OPEN API SPEC GENERATION WHICH IS SORT OF THE NEWER NAME. TOLL DO THAT I USE A GREAT OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY PROJECT CALLED SWASHBUCKLE AND I'VE HAD THAT ADDED TO THE PROJECT ALREADY, AND IF YOU GO INTO STARTUP YOU CAN SEE THAT I'VE ALREADY WIRED IT UP, ADDED THE SWAGGER GENERATION SORRY VICES AND THEN DOWNBORO IN MY CONFIGURE METHOD ADDED THE END POINTS FOR GENERATING THE SWAGGER DOCUMENT AND EXPOSING THE SWAGGER UI, SO I SHOULD BE ABLE TO NOW RUN THIS APPLICATION AND SEE THE DEFAULT SWAGGER UI SHOWING ME THE -- MY NEW API RESOURCE. LET'S SEE IF THAT WORKS. GREAT. WE'RE AT THE SWAGGER U I, AND THERE'S MY API. THE DEFAULT VALUE API THAT COMES WITH THE TEMPLATE. IF WE LOOK AT THIS WE SEE THE THINGS WE EXPECT. GET THE LIST OF PETS CAN, POST NEW PETS AND GET INDIVIDUAL PETS AND DELETE THEM AND SO FORTH. OKAY. SOMETHING DOESN'T LOOK QUITE SATISFACTORY, QUITE COMPLETE. LIKE IF WE LOOK AT THE POST ACTION, IN THE RESPONSES SECTION IT SAYS THAT THIS THING BASICALLY ALWAYS RETURNS TO AN OKAY. PRETTY SURE THAT'S NOT THE CASE. I'M PRETTY SURE THERE MIGHT BE ERRORS, VALIDATION ERRORS OR -- I'M PRETTY SURE -- NORMALLY IN RESPONSE TO A POST YOU WOULD SAY, WELL, A RESOURCE HAS BEEN CREATED. YOU'VE POSTED A NEW RESOURCE, 201 CREATED. HERE IS THE URL TO THE NEW RESOURCE BUT THAT'S NOT HERE. THAT'S NOT MISSION. IS IT THE IN THE CODE? LET'S GO LOOK AT OUR PETS CONTROLLER AGAIN AND LOOK FOR THE POST ACTION. WHERE IS IT. THERE'S PUT. HERE'S POST. YEAH. THE RETURNED VALUE IS A CREATED AT ACTION -- ACTION RESULT, YEAH, RETURNS TO 201. THAT'S NOT DOCUMENTED IN THE SWAGGER DOCUMENT. WHY IS THAT? WELL, THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH THAT LIBRARIES LIKE SWASHBUCKLE CAN DO BY JUST STATISTICALLY ANALYZING YOUR APIs TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE SWAGGER DOCUMENT SHOULD BE, WHAT THE OPEN API SPEC SHOULD SAY. SOME THINGS HAVE YOU TO TELL SWASHBUCKLE ABOUT USING AT BUTTS AND ADDITIONAL META DATA. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE CASES. FORTUNATELY IN .NET CORE 2.2 WE GIVE YOU AN ANALYZER, API ANALYZER THAT WE CAN SEE IN THE ANALYZER SECTION, THERE IT IS, ALREADY ADDED TO THIS PROJECT. THAT WILL LOOK AT YOUR API CONTROLLER AND TELL YOU ABOUT ALL THE PLACES WHERE YOU PROBABLY SHOULD ADD SOME ADDITIONAL META DATA. IN FACT, YOU CAN SEE I'M ALREADY GETTING A QUEEN SQUIGGLE HERE FROM MY POST ACTION WITHOUT A POTENTIAL MIXUP. IF I GO AHEAD AND DO THE MIXUP I GET THE ATTRIBUTES THAT I CAN SAY SAYING THIS ACTION, BY THE WAY, RETURNS A 201 CREATED SO IF WE RERUN THIS APPLICATION, HOPEFULLY OUR POST ACTION IN THE SWAGGER DOCUMENT SHOULD LOOK A LITTLE BIT MORE DESCRIPTIVE. LET'S SEE IF THAT'S THE CASE. POST, AND -- AND, YES. ALL RIGHT. SO NOW IT SAYS THAT IT RETURNS AT 201 WHICH IS AWESOME. ALSO IT HAS LIKE A DEFAULT RESPONSE WHICH WOULD BE LIKE IN RESPONSE TO ERRORS, AND -- AND THE NICE THING IS THAT IN ASP .NET CORE 2 BEEN THE 11 WE ADDED SUPPORT FOR PROBLEM DETAILS WHICH IS A STANDARDIZED RFC. I THINK IT'S RFC 7807 THERE IT IS. FOR GENERATING MACHINE READABLE ERROR RESPONSES, SO THAT'S ALREADY CONFIGURED FOR YOU AND SET UP FOR YOUR API CONTROL. AWESOME. ALL RIGHT. SO THAT LOOKS GOOD. BUT IT WOULD BE KIND OF TEDIOUS TO GO THROUGH AND ADD ALL THESE ATTRIBUTES TO ALL OF MY ACTIONS. IS THERE A BETTER WAY, AND, OF COURSE, THE ANSWER IS YES. YOU CAN INSTEAD APPLY AN API CONVENTION WHICH LOOKS AT THE PATTERNS THAT YOUR METHODS MATCH AND APPLIES META DATA ACCORDINGLY AND WE GIVE YOU A SET OF APP PI CONVENTIONS OUT OF THE BOX THAT MATCH THE API CONVENTIONS THAT WE GENERATE IN OUR SCAFFOLDING CODE, AND UNTIL YOU APPLY THOSE YOU USE THE API ATTRIBUTE CODE, THERE IT IS, AND THEN THE DEFAULT API CONVENTIONS THAT WE FAULT ARE THE DEFAULT API CONVENTIONS TYPE, COOL. SAVE THAT. ACTUALLY, LET ME COPY -- COMMENT THAT OUT, AND THEN DOWN BELOW IF WE LOOK IN THE ERRORS LIST, SEE, THE -- THE API ANALYZER IS TELLING ME ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT ACTION METHODS THAT ARE MISSION, YOU KNOW, META DATA ABOUT THE RESPONSE TYPES. IF I NOW UNCOMMENT THE CONVENTION AND AGAIN LOOK AT THE ERROR LIST, THEY HAVE ALL GONE AWAY AND EVERYTHING HAS BEEN FIXED UP FOR ME. IF I NOW RUN THE APPLICATION ONE MORE TIME HOPEFULLY OUR SWAGGER -- SWAGGER DOCUMENT IS MUCH MORE DESCRIPTIVE. LET'S SEE, SO LIKE THE GET THAT TAKES AN ID. THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT TO RETURN 200 OKAY, IF IT SUCCEEDED 40. 4 IF THE ID IS NOT FOUND, AND THEN THE DEFAULT FOR ERRORS AND SO FORTH SO GREAT. NOW WE HAVE A REALLY COMPLETE OPEN API SPECIFICATION. ALL RIGHT. COAT. SO THAT'S -- THAT'S SOME. NEW FUTURES THAT ARE IN .NET CORE 2.2. USED WITHIN VISUAL STUDIOS 2019. THERE'S ALSO A BUNCH OF GREAT RAZOR IMPROVING TOOLS IN 2019. RAZOR IS THE FORMAT WE USED TO USE HDML DYNAMICALLY USE THE HDML AND C-SHARP. WE HAVE SUPPORT FOR MODERN REFERENCES, MODERN COMPLETIONS AND, OF COURSE, LIVE SHARE SO LET'S GO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. ALL RIGHT. BACK TO VISUAL STUDIO 2019. LET'S OPEN UP A DIFFERENT PROJECT. THIS IS JUST AN ASP .NET CORE APP. HERE I WANTED TO GENERATE SOME PAGES FOR MANAGING PRODUCTS, SO I'VE DEFINED A PRODUCT MODEL TYPE. IT HAS AN ID, A NAME AND A PRICE, AND THEN I WENT AND SCAFFOLDED A BUNCH OF RAZOR PAGES THIS TIME, SOME UI. NOT AN A PYE CONTROL BUT SOME RAZOR PAGES, AND THE WAY I DID THAT, I'VE ALREADY DONE IT, BUT YOU CAN DO IT YOURSELF, TOO. ADD RAZOR PAGE AND THEN RAZOR PAGES USING FRAME WORK, ADD THAT AND I SPECIFIED MY PRODUCT TYPE FOR THE BOTTLE AND USED MY DATA CLASS AND SELECTED ALL THE DEFAULTS AND CLICKED ADD AND AFTER I DID THAT IT GENERATED ALL THESE NICE RAZOR PAGES FOR ME WHICH IS GREAT. OKAY. SO LET'S GO AHEAD AND RUN THIS APP. LET'S SEE WHAT IT'S GOT. SO LET'S SEE. WE SHOULD SEE OUR NORMAL DEFAULT TEMPLATE THAT WE SAW BEFORE WITH THE NICE BOOTSTRAP 4 BASICALLY IN THE UI AND HOPEFULLY PAGES FOR LOOKING AT THE PRODUCT. WE'VE GOOD PRODUCT TAP UP HERE THAT I'VE ADDED AND LET'S SEE. YEAH. WE'VE GOT AT LIST OF PRODUCT. WE'VE GOT A RAZOR. WE'VE GOT A BLAZER, BLAIRS, OF COURSE, IS FREE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T COST ANY CODE TO RIGHT C SHARP AND THEN ASP NET. I ASSUME THAT'S SOME SORT OF NET FOR CATCHING POISONOUS SNAKES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I CAN ALMOST HEAR THE GROANS COMING THROUGH THE CAMERA. WE CAN EDIT THING IF WE WANT IT NEIGHBORING AS NET CORE AND MAKE THAT FREE AS WELL THAT. LOOKS GOOD. YOU KED IT, LIST AND DELETE THE PRODUCTS. AWESOME. LET'S LOOK AT THE RAZOR FILES AND SEE WHAT VISUAL STUDIO 2019 CAN DO FOR US. LET'S FIRST LOOK AT FIND ALL REFERENCES. OKAY. SO I'M LOOKING AT THE PRODUCT TYPE, AND -- AND YOU CAN SEE THROUGH CODE HELPS THAT IT'S TELLING ME ALL THE PLACES WHERE THE PRODUCT TYPE IS BEING USED. IF I JUST LOOK AT THE TYPE, IT SHOWS UP IN ALL THE C SHARP FILES, ALL THE CODE FOR THE RAZOR PAGES. THAT'S THE WAY FINAL REFERENCES ARE ALWAYS SUPPORTED. THAT'S NORMAL AND EXPECTED AND WHAT'S REAL COOL NOW IS IF I LOOK AT WITH YOU. MEMBERS FOR MY PRODUCT TYPE, AND LET'S EXPAND THAT A LITTLE BIT SO WE CAN SEE IT BETTER, NOW WE CAN SEE ALL THE PLACES WHERE THAT MEMBER IS BEING USED IN RAZOR FILES, LIKE HERE'S THE EXACT LINE WHERE THAT -- THAT PROPERTY IS BEING USED, SO FIND REFERENCELES NOW WORKS WITH RAZOR WHICH IS GREAT. WHAT ELSE? LET'S GO INTO THE INDEX PAGE FOR THIS APPLICATION. LET'S SAY WE WANTED TO ADD A DIRECTIVE LIKE LET'S ADD AN INJECT DIRECTIVE LIKE INJECTING A SERVICE INTO THIS PAGE. I START TYPING AT IN. I, OF COURSE, GET COMPLETIONS OVER RAZOR DIRECTIVES AND ALL THE C SHARP STUFF, BUT THE NICE THING IS BECAUSE WE'RE IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019 -- SORRY, LET ME START THAT AGAIN. BECAUSE WE HERE IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019 WE'RE USING THE MODERN COMPLETIONS INFRASTRUCTURE. YOU CAN SEE, THAT RAZOR DIRECTIVES ON THAT BUTTON SO I GET JUST RAZOR DIRECTIVES WHEN I TYPE THAT. OKAY. LET'S GO BACK TO THE ADD AN FILTER THE RAZOR DIRECTIVES AND THEN WE CAN COMPLETE, IT AWESOME AND YOU CAN TYPE YOUR TYPE HERE AND SO FORTH. THAT'S MODERN COMPLETIONS WITH RAZOR. LASTLY, WHAT IF YOU NEED SOME HELP WITH YOUR ASP .NET CORE PROJECT AND YOU'RE WORKING WITH RAZOR PAGES OR VIEWS AND YOU WANTED SOME HELP FROM YOUR BUDDY WELL, YOU CAN DO THAT USING LIVE SHARE NOW. I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND SET UP A LIVE SHARE SESSION FOR THIS VISUAL STUDIO INSTANCE, OKAY. LET'S GO AHEAD AND DO THAT. AND THIS SHOULD THEN COPY THE URL TO THE CLIPBOARD. THERE IT DID, I CAN NOW SHARE THAT WITH MY BUDDY WHO CAN HELP ME OUT. TO EMULATE MY BUDDY, I'M GOING TO OPEN UP ANOTHER VISUAL STUDIO 2019 INSTANCE, AND LET'S JOIN THAT LIVE SHARE SESSION, ALL RIGHT. SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO DO FILE, JOIN, LIVE SHARE SESSION, AND PASTE THAT URL IN THERE AND JOIN IT. OKAY. WHILE IT'S JOINING, I'M GOING TO PUT THESE TWO VISUAL STUDIO INSTANCES SIDE BY SIDE, ALL RIGHT. SO WE'VE GOT NOTHING YET. OH, IT SAYS THAT I JOINED THE LIVE SHARE SESSION REMOTELY FROM, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER PART OF THE WORLD, OKAY. I CAN SEE SOME OF THE SOLUTION NOW SHOWING UP, AND THERE'S THE RAZOR FILE. IN FACT, IT EVEN SHOWS WHERE MY CURSE ZOR AT. NOW I CAN GO AHEAD AND START WRITING NORMAL RAZOR CODE, LIKE LET ME HELP YOU OUT THERE, DAN. YOU WANTED TO DISPLAY THE CURRENT TIME HERE, NO PROBLEM. TE CURRENT DATE IS AT DATE, AND I GET C SHARP COMPLETIONS IN RAZOR, RUNNING IN LIVE SHARE, .NOW, MORE C SHARP COMPLETIONS, WORKS AWESOME, OKAY, NOW IF I LOOK AT WHAT'S ACTUALLY ON DISC IN THIS GUEST VISUAL STUDIO INSTANCE AND THAT'S JOINED THE LIVE SHARE SESSION, LET'S OPEN THE CONTAINING FOLDER, YOU'LL SEE, THAT YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT LIKE NOTHING HERE. ALL I'VE GOT IS THIS, YOU KNOW, PRETTY MUCH EMPTY PROJECT AND THE FILES THAT I HAVE -- THAT HAVE BEEN SHARED WITH ME SO FAR THAT I'VE BEEN EDITING, SO I CAN WRITE RAZOR CODE, GET C SHARP COMPLETIONS FOR A REMOTE ASP .NET CORE PROJECT THAT'S USING A RAZOR. THAT'S PRETTY COOL. THAT'S LIVE SHARE. LET'S GO AHEAD AND LEAVE THE SESSION AND SHUT THAT DOWN. THERE WE GO. OKAY. THERE'S SOME OF YOUR NEW RAZOR TOOLING FEATURES IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019. ALL RIGHT. LET'S LOOK TO THE FUTURE NOW. WHEN WE CAN WRITE CLIENT SIDE WEB APPLICATIONS USING .NET INSTEAD OF JAVA SCRIPT. WE'VE BEEN WORKING TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO REWRITE REUSABLE WEB UI COMPONENTS USING C SHARP AND RAZOR THAT CAN RUN DIRECTLY IN THE BROWSER. AND THIS IS GREAT, BECAUSE IT ENABLES YOU TO SHARE .NET CODE BOTH ON THE SERVER AND ON THE CLIENT. CAN YOU HAVE SHARED COMMON LOGIC. IF YOU STILL WANT TO CALL IN JAVA SCRIPT, YOU CAN DO THAT, CALL INTO EXISTING JAVA SCRIPT LIBRARIES, BROWSERS, APIs USING JAVA SCRIPT INTEROP AND INITIALLY WE'LL SUPPORT TWO HOSTING MODELS FOR THESE TYPES OF APPLICATIONS. WE'LL SUPPORT HOSTING THESE APPS ON A SERVER WHERE ALL OF THE UI INTERACTIONS WITH THE PROWSER GET HANDLED OVER A SIGNAL CONNECTION AND WE'LL ALSO SUPPORT HOSTING THESE APPLICATIONS CLIENT SIDE IN THE BROWSER ON TOP OF WEB ASSEMBLY. NOW WHAT IS WEB ASSEMBLY? WELL, WEB ASSEMBLY IS A RELATIVELY NEW OPEN WEB STANDARD THAT DEFINES A BYTE CODE FOR THE WEB, AND WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT AS LONG -- IF YOU HAVE SOME CODE, AS LONG AS YOU CAN COMPILE IT TO WEB ASSEMBLY, IT CAN NOW RUN IN ANY BROWSER AT NEAR NATIVE SPEED. THIS IS AWESOME BECAUSE IT MEANS WHEN YOU WANT TO WRITE CLIENT SIDE WEB LOGIC YOU CAN DO IT IN ANY LANGUAGE OR FRAMEWORK YOU WOULDN'T AND, OF COURSE, WE WANT .NET TO RUN GREAT ON WEB ASSEMBLY. WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THAT FOR A WHILE IN A PROJECT THAT WE CALL BLAZER. WHAT IS BLAZER? BLAZER YOU CAN EITHER RUN A BLAZER APP DIRECTLY IN THE BROWSER ON WEB ASSEMBLY WRITING COMPONENTS, GETTING RICH INTERACTIVE UI, OR ALTERNATIVELY CAN YOU WRITE A BLAZER APP, SAME COMPONENTS AND HOST IT SERVER SIDE IN ASP NET.CORE AND HALLE IT OVER A SINGLE CONNECTION. LATER IN THE FUTURE AS SOON AS THE WEB ASSEMBLY .NET RUN TIME IS READY WE'LL SHIP SUPPORT FOR CLIENT SIDE BLAZER FOR FUTURE SUPPORT. LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT IT'S LIKE TO DO BLAZER DEVELOPMENT WITH VISUAL STUDIO 2019. OKAY. THESE ARE ACTUALLY BRAND-NEW BYTES HOT OFF THE PRESS. I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO SHIFT OVER TO DEVELOPER BUILD WITH VISUAL STUDIO WITH UPDATES AND I'M USING .NET CORE 3.0 ON THIS MACHINE. INITIALLY WHAT I'VE GOT HERE IS A SERVER SIDE BLAZER APPLICATION. IT HAS A NUMBER OF COMPONENTS THAT ARE IMPLEMENTED USING THE .RAISER FILES. LET ME RUN THE APP SO THAT WE CAN SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. ALL RIGHT. SO COMPILE AND GET IT RETURNING. AND THIS APP ACTUALLY STARTS UP PRETTY FAST, AND IT HAS SOME NICE FUNCTIONALITY. YOU CAN CLICK THE COUNTER AND THE COUNTER GOES UP. YOU HAVE THE FETCH DATA PAGE THAT'S RETRIEVING SOME DATA AND THEN RENDERING A TABLE, AND THEN WE HAVE A BLANK TO DOS PAGE. NOW NORMALLY TO GET THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR WHERE WE WOULD HAVE INTERACTIVITY AND THE UI UPDATES WITHOUT A PAGE REFRESH, NORMALLY YOU WOULD HAVE TO DO THAT BY USING JAVA SCRIPT BUT I DIDN'T USE JAVA SCRIPT TO WRITE THIS APPLICATION. IT WAS ALL IMPLEMENTED IN C SHARP AND RAZOR. AND HERE'S THE COUNTER COMPONENT. THE MARKUP AND WE USED RAYS SYTTAX AND NORMALLY THIS WOULD BE JAVA EQUIPMENT BUT WE'RE USING RAZOR TO SAY, NO, I WANT TO RUN SOME C SHARP CODE HERE. HERE'S THE MEDAL THAT WE'LL CALL EVERY SINGLE TIME THAT THAT BUTTON IS CLICKED. LET'S RUN THIS IN THE BUGGER. GET THE APP UP AND RUNNING AGAIN AND WE'LL GO AHEAD AND SET A BREAK POINT ON THE COUNTER METHOD. COUNTER AND CLICK THE BUTTON AND, BOOM, WE'RE HITTING C SHARP CODE. LET'S GO AHEAD. IF WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS BROWSER DEVELOPER TOOLS AND REFRESH THIS. THIS APP IS LIGHTWEIGHT. HAS A FEW HUNDRED KYL BYTES OF DOWNLOADED PAYLOAD AND THERE'S A WEB SOCKET SERVER. EVERY TIME I HIT THE BUTTON WE GET THAT AGAIN AND LET'S CHECK THAT. YOU CAN SEE BYTES ARE FLYING ALONG THE WEB SOCKET CONNECTION, TALKING TO THE SERVER AND RUNNING YOUR COMPONENTS AND THE R THE UI UPDATES GET SEND BACK. THAT'S THE SERVER SIDE BLAZER MODEL. IN THE FUTURE WE ALSO WANT TO SUPPORT RUNNING THE SAME COMPONENTS CLIENT SIDE IN THE WEB ASSEMBLY. LET ME SHOW YOU THAT. THIS IS BLAZER ON WEB ASSEMBLY. LET'S GO AHEAD AND GET THIS GUY UP AND RUNNING. EXACTLY THE SAME. A KWURNT COMPONENT WITH THE SAME CODE AS BEFORE. SAME COMPONENT MODEL AND HOSTED IN A DIFFERENT WAY. ALL RIGHT. SO HERE WITH THE BEHAVIOR LOOKS SAME. WE HAVE A COUNTER, HAVE A FETCH DATA PAGE. THIS CASE IT'S ACTUALLY FACING US SOME DATA FROM THE SERVER. DESERIALIZING IT IN THE BROWSER AND RENDERING THIS TABLE. IF WE LOOK AT THE NETWORK TRACE FOR THIS APPLICATION, IT'S PULLING DOWN A LITTLE BIT MORE STUFF AND REALLY COOL STUFF. IF WE LOOKED IN HERE, YEAH, THIS GUY. MONO DOESN'T WAZAM, A PULL .NET WEB TIME IMPLEMENTED IN WEB ASSEMBLY AND YOU HAVE DRLS BEING DOWNLOADED DIRECTLY INTO THE BROWSER. TO REALLY PROVE TO YOU THAT IS .NET CODE RUNNING IN THE BROWSER, LET'S DO THIS. I'M GOING TO DO SOME DEBUG. THIS DEBUGGING WILL HAPPEN DIRECTLY IN THE BROWSER WITH THE BROWSER DEV TOOLS, TO DO THAT I NEED TO ENABLE BROWSER DEBUGGING. COPY THAT. COPY THAT AND CLOSE ALL THE BROWSER TABS REAL QUICK AND THEN WE'LL START WITH THE DEBUGGING ENABLED, AND WE'LL FIRE UP THE DEBUG AGAIN AND SEE IF WE CAN DEBUG OUR C SHARP CODE. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE EXECUTING CLIENT SIDE. OKAY. THERE'S THE BROWSER DEV TOOLS. LET ME PUT THIS SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE BROWSER, ALL RIGHT. NOW YOU NOTICE THAT I CAN SEE THE DLLs IN THE SOURCES FOR THIS APPLICATION. YOU CAN EXPAND THE CLIENT DLL AND SEE THE COUNTERCOMPONENT. SEE IT ON THE COUNTER AND CLICK THE BUTTON AND WE JUST HIT A BREAK POINT IN C SHARP CODE RUNNING ON A RUN ASSEMBLY-BASED RUN TIME EXECUTING IN THE BROWSER. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE EXPECT TO SHIP IN THE FUTURE. ALL RIGHT. SO THAT IS BLAZER IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019. COOL. I HOPE YOU ENJOYED LEARNING ABOUT WEB DEVELOPMENT WITH THE LATEST DEVELOPMENT OF VISUAL STUDIO AND PLEASE DOWNLOAD THE BYTE AND CHECK IT OUT. ARE WE WEDDING FOR THE QUESTIONS?  YES. BY THE WAY, YOUR QUESTIONS ARE SUPER IMPORTANT. GET THEM USE, USE THE #V2019 AND WE'LL MAKE SURE TO ASK THEM. IF YOUR QUESTION GETS ASKED DURING THE SHOWERS, YOU WILL WIN AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION.  HOPEFULLY. WELL, HOPE ITFULLY, YEAH, RIGHT. WE'LL DO OUR BEST. ALL RIGHT. HERE IS -- I THINK I GOT THE ANSWER RIGHT. TALK ABOUT NOW A KV PROJ FILE. THERE'S A NEW FILE WE USE IN .NET APPLICATIONS. NOT MUCH GOING ON IN TE CS PROJ FILES IN THE APPLICATIONS I CREATED. YOU DON'T HAVE IT TO LIST EVERY SINGLE FILE IN THE PROJECT. YOU GET TO USE APPLICATIONS IN THE CS PROJ. WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK TO MAKE IT CLEANER, LIGHTER WEIGHT AND EASIER TO WORK. FROM CAL. WHEN DO YOU RECOMMEND USING RAZER PAGES VERSUS MBC?  THEY ARE BOTH GREAT. THEY ARE BOTH AWESOME TECHNOLOGIES. RAZER PAGES WAS INTRODUCED EARLIER AND BUILD ON TOP OF MBC. IT'S A NON-QUESTION BECAUSE IF YOU'RE USING RAZER PAGE YOU ARE RUNNING ON MBC BECAUSE IT'S RUNNING ON TOP OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT'S A PAGE--BASED MODEL. IF YOU WANT A PAGE YOU JUST CREATE A PAGE AND THEN THE ROUTE FOR THAT PAGE IS JUST THE PLACE OF THAT PAGE ON THE -- ON THE -- ON THE DIRECTLY, ON THE FOLDER STRUCTURE. MBC GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE I WOULD SAY DECOUPLING IN TERMS OF HOW YOUR PROJECT IS STRUCTURED WHERE YOUR VIEWS ARE OVER HERE AND YOUR CONTROLLERS ARE OVER THERE. A LOT OF PEOPLE REALLY LIKE THAT MODEL, BUT BOTH ARE GREAT. BOTH ARE TESTABLE AND BOTH CAN SCALE TO LARGE APPLICATIONS. I THINK RAZER PAGES ARE AN EASIER PLACE TO START. IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANY DEVELOP WITH MBC OR .NET CORE START OUT WITH RAZER PAGES. DO WHATEVER MAKES YOU HAPPY.  YOU'LL BE HAPPY WITH EITHER ONE OF THEM. IS THERE A WAY TO AUTOMATICALLY CREATE MODEL CLASSES BASED ON SWAGGER END POINT LIKE THE OLD ONE AD SERVICES REFERENCES? IS IT POSSIBLE IN VS 2019?  THERE IS SOME SUPPORT FOR CODE GENERATION IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019 FOR DOING CLIENT CODE GENERATION BASED ON AN OPEN API SPEC OR SWAGGER DOCUMENT. WE'RE WORKING ON A MAJOR TURN OF THE CRANK ON THAT INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE .NET CORE 3.0 WAVE WHERE WE'LL HAVE REALLY GREAT SUPPORT FOR DOING, YOU KNOW, MS BUILD-BASED CO-GENERATION FROM YOUR API SO IT WILL BE REALLY EASY -- EVERY BUILD WILL GENERATE THE CODE. IT WILL ALWAYS BE UP TO DATE. WE'RE ACTUALLY WORKING WITH A BUNCH OF GOOD COMMUNITY PROJECTS ON THAT, END SWAG, HAS SOME FUNCTIONALITY THAT WE'VE LEVERAGING FOR THIS FUTURE. YEAH, THE STUFF THAT'S COMING. AWESOME. NEXT QUESTION IS BLAZER NOW OFFICIALLY IN MORE THAN JUST THE NICE TO HAVE MAYBE IN A PRE-ALPHA MODE, I AIR QUOTED THAT FOR YOU, AND FULLY SUPPORTED IN THE NEW VS VERSION?  SO BLAZER STARTED OUT AS AN EXPERIMENTAL PROJECT, RIGHT. WE WERE PLAYING AROUND WITH WEB ASSEMBLY. COULD WE GET DOT-NET TO WORK ON WEB ASSEMBLY? IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE? WE WEREN'T EVEN SURE IF PEOPLE WANTED IT. WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT EXPERIMENT NOW FOR A LITTLE OVER A YEAR. WE'RE PRETTY MUCH AT THE TAIL END OF THAT EXPERIMENT WHERE WE'RE PRETTY SURE THAT, A, YES, ABSOLUTELY WE CAN DO THIS AND, B, A LOT OF PEOPLE TELL US THEY WOULD REALLY LIKE IT. IT'S STILL TECHNICALLY EXPERIMENTAL RIGHT NOW BUT I CAN SORT OF SEE THE END IN SIGHT SOON FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL PHASED OF BLAZER. THE MODEL OF TAKING THE SAME COMPONENTS AND RUNNING THEM SERVER SIDE WHERE YOU -- WHERE YOU MANAGE ALL THE UI INTERACTIONS OVER A SINGLE CONNECTIN WE CALL THAT SERVER SIDE BLAZER. THAT IS SHIPPING IN .NET CORE 3.0, ABSOLUTELY. WHEN .NET CORE 3.0 SHIPS YOU CAN USE THAT IN PRODUCTION. THAT WILL COME FIRST AND AS SOON AS THE ASSEMBLY-BASED WEB TIME IS READY, WE'LL HAVE PRODUCTION SUPPORT READY FOR THE CLIENT BROWSER. I WAS THERE IN OSLO WHEN SARNDSSON WAS LYRICS HEY, DO YOU WANT TO SEE SOME CODE I WROTE?  JUST A DEMO. JAUFLT LITTLE DEMO I DID. HE WAS IN THE JAVA EQUIPMENT FILES BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD DO WITH BLAZER. I WAS LIKE -- OH, MY GOODNESS, YES, THAT'S WHAT IT WOULD BE, AND ALL I KNOW IT WAS A FOWLER AND EDWARDS, ALL SITTING THERE JUST LIKE THIS. WHAT -- WHAT IS THIS? IT'S PRETTY COOL AND IT'S ADVANCED ALL THE WAY TO WHERE PEOPLE ARE TAKING THIS. PRETTY EXCITING. WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT IT. SPEAKING OF THAT, HAVING SPOKEN -- MY ENGLISH IS TERRIBLE TODAY. WHAT IS THE EXPECTED ARRIVAL DATE FOR BLAZER ON THE CLIENT?  WELL, WE DON'T HAVE OFFICIALLY CLICKICALLY ANNOUNCED RELEASE DATE. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE CLIENT BLAZER SUPPORT WON'T BE AVAILABLE WITH .NET CORE 3.0. WE'LL SHIP .NET CORE 3.0 FIRST AND THEN BLAZER WILL COME SOMETIME LATER. HOW SOON LATER IS WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY REALLY ACTIVELY WORKING ON RIGHT NOW. LIKE IT, REALLY DEPENDS ON HOW FAST CAN WE STABILIZE AND MATURE THE WEB ASSEMBLY STORY FOR .NET ALL APP. STAY TUNED FOR THAT. LIKE HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE ANSWERED TO THAT QUESTION THAT ARE MORE CONCRETE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. FANTASTIC. JUST TWO MORE QUESTIONS. WILL THERE BE INTEROP BETWEEN WEB ASSEMBLY AND JAVA SCRIPT TO ALLOW FOR CONTINUOUS DELIVERY AND REPLACEMENT OF APPLICATION FUNCTIONALITY?  YOU CAN, OF COURSE, CALL INTO JAVA SCRIPT FROM WEB ASSEMBLY. THAT WORKS. CALL FROM .NET CODE INTO ANY JAVA SCRIPT LIBRARY OR ANY API. IN FACT, EVEN TAKE THE LIBRARIES WRITTEN IN JAVA SCRIPT AND HA THEY WANTED TO DYNAMICALLY UPDATE PARTS OF THE APP. THAT IS KIND OF A HOT MODULE REMAKE. THAT IS SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT.  AWESOME. WE'LL FINISH WITH THAT. WE HAVE OVER HERE. MICHAELA, HOW ARE YOU, MY FRIEND.  CONTINUING FROM MATT FROM .NET DEVELOPMENT. TAKE IT AWAY.  MY NAME IS MICHAELA. I'M A VISUAL ENGINEERING BASED OUT OF CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS. TODAY, I'M GOING TO START OFF BY GIVING YOU A QUICK INTRODUCTION INTO WHAT THIS IS. SOME ARE YOU ARE USING IT. MAKING SURE WE ARE ON THE SAME PAGE. A QUICK RETROSPECTIVE OF HOW WE GOT THERE. THEN I'LL SHOW IT IN ACTION SO WE CAN SEE ALL THE FEATURES B AND A PEEK OF WHAT IS COMING IN THE FUTURE. THIS IS A .NET I.D. FOR THE MAC. IT AIMS TO PROVIDE A NATIVE EXPERIENCE. IF YOU ARE A MAC USER, YOU EXPECT YOUR MAC APPS TO FEEL LIKE MAC APPS. THAT'S OUR GOAL. IT ALLOWS YOU TO DEVELOP APPS AND GAMES FOR IOS AND WEB. IT IS BUILT ON THE SAME FOUNDATIONS IS AS VISUAL STUDIO FOR WINDOWS. IT GETS THE CODE ANALYZES AND FIXES THE VARIOUS OTHER PIECES ALL BUILT ON .NET ON TOP OF THAT, IT PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR THE MOBIL. THAT IS A .NET CODE. YOU CAN DO IT FROM THERE. YOU CAN CONTAIN THE DOCKER AND ALSO DO SERVERLESS WITH AZURE FUNCTIONS IF YOU ARE DOING GAMES, YOU CAN DO THAT SORT OF THING. I'M NOT GOING TO BE TALKING SO MUCH ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL SCENARIOS TODAY. I KNOW YOU HEARD ABOUT THOSE EARLIER. IF YOU MISSED THOSE. THOSE ARE RECORDED, YOU CAN GO BACK AND SEE THEM. ALMOST TWO YEARS AGO IN JUNE 2017, THAT INITIAL RELEASE HAD SUPPORT FOR ALL OF THE SCORE SCENARIOS I DESCRIBED INCLUDING C SHARP AND THE DEBUGGING YOU WOULD EXPECT FOR THOSE. A COUPLE OF MONTHS LATER, WE ADDED .NET SUPPORT. . WE ADDED THE DOCA SUPPORT. WE ADDED SO YOU NO LONGER HAD TO MANUALLY USE FOR DEVICES. ADDING FOR C SHARP 7.1 AND MADE THE IOS DEPLOYMENT EXPERIENCE MUCH EASIER BECAUSE YOU COULD DO THAT WIRELESSLY OVER WI-FI. IF YOU WANTED TO HAVE A HEAD SET OR ACCESSORY PLUGGED IN, YOU COULD DO THAT WHILE YOU WERE DEBUGGING. YOU COULD ADD YOUR SETTINGS ACROSS YOUR TEAM, MAC AND WINDOWS. WE PUT IN THE LASER IN TYPE SCRIPT AND JAVA SCRIPT IN THE ENTIRE EXPERIENCE FROM WINDOWS AND THAT SAME CODE. IN 7.6, WE ADDED PUBLISHING FOR AZURE PUBLISHING. IN 7.7, WE MADE IT EASIER TO DISCOVER THE AVAILABILITY OF QUICK FIXES VIA THE LIGHT BULB. THAT BRINGS US TO 7.8, THE LAST OF THE SEVEN SERIES, WHICH WAS FOCUSED ON PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY. THE LIFE CYCLE WE HAVE MADE MAJOR PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY IMPROVEMENTS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THOSE ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO EVERYONE. THAT BRINGS US TO TODAY. WE ARE RELEASING VERSION 8.0 WHICH IS VISION STUDIO FOR MAC. I'M GOING TO GO STRAIGHT INTO A DEMO. SO HERE I HAVE THE SMART HOTEL SAMPLE THAT SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN. IF WE GO OVER TO THIS PART. THAT PART OF THE APP IS ALL WRITTEN IN .NET AND C SHARP. IF WE GO INTO THE CLIENT APP, WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE DOWN HERE IN THE SOURCE FILES. YOU CAN SEE, WE HAVE JAVA SCRIPT FOLDERS AND THOSE THINGS YOU WOULD EXPECT THERE. AGAIN, THERE'S THE SECTION FOR - THOSE TWO. IT IS GOING TO OPEN UP THE WEBSITE AND OPEN IN THE BROWSER HERE. IT TAKES A SECOND TO LOAD. ONCE IT IS LOADED, YOU CAN SEE THE WEBSITE HERE. THIS LITTLE AREA HERE IS PULLING THESE TESTIMONIAL TWEETS FROM A BACK END SERVICE WRITTEN IN C SHARP. I'M GOING TO GO AND TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. AND SO I OPEN THE GLOBAL SEARCH WITH COMMAND. THAT IS THE QUICKEST WAY TO GET TO ANY FILE. YOU HAVE TO TYPE A PART OF THE CLASS NAME OR FILE. SO I'M GOING TO WORK THE POSITIVE TWEET SERVICE. THIS IS WHERE THAT TWEET COMES FROM. I PLACE THE BREAK POINT IN HERE AND GO BACK TO THE BROWSER AND REFRESH IT. YOU'LL SEE IT HITS A BREAK POINT AS EXPECTED. THIS CURRENTLY HAS ONE SINGLE HARD CODED TWEAK IN THERE. WHAT I WANT TO DO IS TO HAVE A LITTLE MORE VARIETY SO IT IS NOT ALWAYS FROM THE SAME THING. FIRST, I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU THE COMPLEX SUPPORT. THIS IS SUPER NEAT, IT HELPS YOU KEEP YOUR CODE CONSISTENT. THIS IS ASSIGNED. SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THIS. THEY THINK IT MAKES IT HARDER TO READ. I DISAGREE. IF THEY HAVE SEVEN ON THE TEAM. THEY MIGHT GO IN TO THE CONFIG, THEY CAN SEE IT HAS A SETTING TO USE FOR BUILDING TYPES. ELSEWHERE, THIS IS SET THAT IT SHOULD BE USED IN ALL THOSE CASES. I WILL CHANGE THIS SO INSTEAD, IT IS SAYS THAT VOSS SHOULD NOT BE USED AND THIS IS GOING TO BE A WARNING. WHEN I SAY THIS AND GO BACK TO THE FILE, YOU CAN SEE HERE THERE IS NOW A SQWUIGGLE ON THIS. YOU CAN SEE THE VOSS. THE LIGHT BULB HERE THAT MAKES IT EASY TO SEE WHEN THINGS ARE AVAILABLE. OR YOU CAN ACCESS THAT BY ALT-ENTER. THAT IS MY FAVORITE KEYBOARD SHORT CUT. HIT ENTER AND IT CHANGES THAT. THERE IS A WHOLE LOAD OF THESE ANALYZERS AND FIXERS AND YOU CAN FIND THEM VERY EASILY THROUGH THIS LIGHT BULB. I'M GOING TO GO AND CHANGE THAT BACK BECAUSE I THINK VAR IS GREAT. I WANT PEOPLE TO USE IT EVERYWHERE. WE GO BACK HERE. TOUCH THE FILE AGAIN. IT IS SUGGESTING THE NAME CAN BE SIMPLIFIED. WE HAVE THE REVERSE TRANSFORMATION. AS YOU CAN SEE, THERE IS A HUGE NUMBER OF SETTINGS THAT GO ACROSS WINDOWS AND MAC. YES. SO I'M GOING TO RANDOMIZE OUR TWEETS A LITTLE MORE. HERE IS A SNIPIT I CREATED EARLIER. ALSO GOING TO ADD SOME SAMPLE TWEETS. I ASKED OUR TEAM TO GIVE ME SOME TWEETS. THESE ARE THEIR TWITTER HANDLES. YOU CAN FOLLOW THEM ALL AND TELL THEM HOW MUCH YOU LIKE OR THINGS YOU'D WANT THEM TO AD. CZECH OUT THEIR TWITTERS. HERE WE HAVE OUR TWEETS. WE ARE GOING TO RETURN. WE'LL RETURN TO GET RANDOM. OKAY. ALSO, THIS IS A LOCAL FUNCTION HERE OKAY. SO THE TESTIMONIAL. WE'LL DECONSTRUCT THAT. YOU CAN SEE THAT THESE AREN'T ACTUALLY BEING USED YET. NOW I'M GOING TO RETURN THE NEW CUSTOMER TESTIMONIAL. THE CUSTOMER NAME IS HANDLE AND TEXT. TEXT IS THE TWEET. THERE WE GO. I USE A LOCAL FUNCTION THERE. YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE ONE OF THE NEW FIXES TO CONVERT THAT TO A METHOD. WE CAN ALSO SAY CONVERT THAT TO A BODY IF YOU PREFER THAT. OKAY. SO WE HAVE THIS HERE. WE'LL GO AND BUILD THAT WITH COMMAND K AND RUN IT. THERE WE GO. AND IT IS RUNNING. AND HERE WE CAN SEE, WE DON'T HAVE ANY TWEETS AT ALL. SOMETHING MUST HAVE GONE WRONG. WE HAVE A LITTLE ANIMATION THERE. LET'S GO BACK AND SEE WHAT HAPPENED. I'M GOING TO SET A BREAK POINT IN THERE. HERE WE GO. WHEN I STEP OVER IT DOESN'T GO ANYWHERE. LET ME ADD A CATCH POINT BREAK ON THERE. THERE WE GO. IT IS AN ARGUMENT OUT OF RANGE EXCEPTION ON GET ITEM. I DIDN'T LIMIT THE RANGE OF MY RON DOCUMENT NUMBERS. SO LET'S GO IN HERE AND I'M GOING TO JUST STOP THIS AND GET RANDOM. ACTUALLY GOING TO LIMIT THAT TO THE LENGTH OF THE LIST. LET'S JUST MAKE THIS NOT STATIC. WE ARE GETTING SOME HINTS THAT WE CAN MAKE THIS READ ONLY. SO WE DON'T ACTUALLY REMOVE IT OR SOMETHING. THROUGH THE BREAK POINT SO WE DON'T HIT THAT AGAIN. RELOAD THIS. I HAD MY CATCH POINT STILL IN PLACE. DELETE THAT AND CONTINUE. AND IT IS LOADING. JUST TAKES A SECOND WHILE IT STARTS UP THE SERVER. THERE WE GO. SO NOW WE HAVE A RANDOM TWEET HERE. IF WE REFRESH IT, WE'LL GET A DIFFERENT ONE. UNLESS A RANDOM GENERATOR RETURNS THE SAME VALUE. NOW WE'VE GOT SOMETHING MORE BELIEVABLE. IT IS NOT JUST THE SAME TWEET OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THAT'S THE EXAMPLE OF EDITING AND DEBUGGING THE .NET CORE APP WITH JAVA SCRIPT AND CSS FRONT END. THIS IS LARGELY STUFF YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO FOR A WHILE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE VERSION 3.0 FIXES. WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON RELIABILITY. THERE IS ONE EXCITING FEATURE I WANT TO SHOW YOU. ACTUALLY, THERE IS A FEW OF THEM. ONE OF THEM HERE, THERE IS A RIGHT CLICK ON THE APP. THIS IS ONE THING I'VE HEARD PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR QUITE A WHILE. THEY WANT TO OPEN MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS AT ONCE. NOW YOU CAN SEE THE NEW WELCOME WINDOW. YOU HAVE YOUR RECENT SOLUTIONS. THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE EXPENSE ON WINDOWS NOW. I'M GOING TO OPEN THIS CLIENT'S APP WHICH IS PART OF THE WHOLE SMART HOTEL APP THING AND PART OF THE FRONT END FOR THE HOTEL SAMPLE. YOU CAN SEE HERE WE HAVE THE ANDROID AND IOS PROJECTS. THESE ARE ALL OF THE PEACES YOU'D EXPECT THE PLATFORMS SPECIFIC RENDERS. THE THING I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU IS THE NEW C SHARP EDITING EXPERIENCE, WHICH I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT. THIS IS CURRENTLY IN PREVIEW. IF YOU WANT TO USE IT. YOU'LL HAVE TO GO INTO THE PREFERENCES. CAN YOU FIND IT HERE IN PREFERENCES. TEXT EDITOR GENERAL. OPEN THE NEW C SHARP FILES IN EDITOR. YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE WORD WRAP NOW. I'M GOING TO GO AND OPEN A FILE, SO I CAN SHOW YOU A FEW THINGS. JUST A REMINDER OF THE PREVIEW. IT LOOKS VERY SIMILAR. THERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT ARE NEW IN THIS. . YOU CAN SEE IT LOOKS A BIT DIFFERENT. BECAUSE IT IS THE NATIVE MAC OS. IT BEHAVES MORE NATIVELY. IT HAS THE PINK COLOR I USE IN THE MAC OS. SO IT IS A MORE CONSISTENT PART. YOU CAN SEE THE TULIPS HERE THAT HAVE THE SOFT, SEMITRANSPARENT BACKGROUND, YOU SEE ON MAC A LOT. THIS ALSO MEANS OUR PERFORMANCE IS MUCH IMPROVED BECAUSE WE ARE NOT GOING THROUGH THOSE LAYERS. ANOTHER FAVORITE FEATURE HERE IS THE SUPPORT FOR THE MAC OS INPUT METHODS. SO I CAN DO CONTROL COMMAND PERIOD. TO OPEN THE MAC OS EMOJI. I CAN ENTER THAT. SO FULL SUPPORT FOR EMOJIS. A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL BE EXCITED FOR THIS. WE NOW HAVE SUPPORT FOR RIGHT TO LEFT TEXT AND FOR BI DIRECTIONAL SO YOU CAN COMBINE TEXT WITH DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. I'M NOT PERSONALLY FAMILIAR WITH THE INPUT METHODS, SO I'M GOING TO COPY THE NAME OF A POET HERE. THIS BEHAVES AS RIGHT TO LEFT TEXT WOULD BEHAVE THIS ALLOWS FOR THE STUDIO EDITOR. A LOT OF THE LITTLE NUANCES WILL BE THE SAME BEHAVIOR RATHER THAN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT. THIS WILL ENABLE US TO BRING MORE FEATURES TO MAC MORE QUICKLY. THERE WAS SUPPORT FOR THE CONTROL OPTION CLICK. YOU CAN SEE YOU CAN TYPE INTO A BUNCH OF PLACES AT THE SAME TIME, WHICH IS REALLY USEFUL IN A LOT OF SCENARIOS. YOU CAN SEE HERE OUR WRAPPING. SO AS I BRING THIS IN, YOU'LL SEE THESE LINES BEGIN TO WRAP AROUND. THERE IS A LITTLE HINT HERE THAT IT WRAPPED. THIS IS JUST A TASTE OF THE THINGS YOU'LL SEE WITH THE NEW EDITOR. IT IS NOT COMPLETE YET. WE WOULD LOVE TO HEAR YOUR FEEDBACK. BUT YOU CAN ALWAYS REVERT TO THE OLD EDITOR IF YOU WANT THE MORE POLISHED EXPERIENCE RIGHT NOW. THE NEW EDITOR IS ALSO GOING TO BE MORE ACCESSIBLE. IF I OPEN SEARCH HERE, THIS IS NOW ALL NATIVE WIGITS. TO SUMMARIZE, VISUAL STUDIO FOR MAC IS A CAPABLE TOOL FOR YOUR WEB AND MOBIL .NET DEVELOPMENT. YOU HAVE TELE SENSE, C SHARP, CSS, FACTORINGS AND CODE FIXES FOR C SHARP TO HELP YOU WRITE CODE FASTER AND HELP FIND PROBLEMS. A RICH DEBUGGER ACROSS ALL THOSE SCENARIOS. I DIDN'T COVER IT BUT WE HAVE X UNIT AND INUNIT SUPPORT. IN 2019, WE HAVE ADDED A NEW BACK END FOR THAT SO IT WILL BE MORE RELIABLE. WE HAVE THE STREAM LINE START YOUR CODE MUCH MORE QUICKLY. - WE HAVE MORE ANALYZES AND FIXES. THEY HAVE A POSSIBILITY OF IMPROVEMENTS. I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT ASIDE TO TALK ABOUT PERFORMANCE RELIABILITY A LITTLE MORE. THIS HAS BEEN A LOT AND A FOCUS FOR THE TEAM AFTER THE RELEASE IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE A FOCUS GOING FORWARD. WE BUILT-IN FA STRUCTURE TO HELP TRACK AND IDENTIFY PIECES AUTOMATICALLY. WE'VE MADE ACCESSIBILITY IMPROVEMENTS ACROSS THE LIFE CYCLE OF 7 X INTO 8.0 AND AIM TO BE WITH THE MICROSOFT STANDARDS BY THE END OF THE YEAR. WE'VE CREATED SUPPORT THROUGH DEVELOPER COMMUNITY. I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL OF YOU WHO'VE REPORTED ISSUES TO TELL US WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT TO YOU AND WHAT YOU'D LIKE US TO FIX OR AED FIRST. YOUR FEEDBACK HELPS US TO IDENTIFY WHAT THINGS ARE MOST IMPORTANT FIRST. THIS IS AVAILABLE TO DOWNLOAD RIGHT NOW. YOU CAN ADD VIA UPDATER. OPEN UP THE UPDATER AND HIT INSTALL. IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT YET, YOU CAN INSTALL IT FROM AK FORWARD/VS MAC. BE AWARE, IT IS IN PREVIEW. YOU CAN SWITCH BACK TO THE OLD ONE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING YOUR FEEDBACK THROUGH DEVELOPER COMMUNITY. THAT BRINGS US TO THE END OF MY TALK. SO, TIME FOR QUESTIONS.  THIS HAS BEEN AMAZING. THANK YOU SO MUCH.  THERE IS FOUR QUESTIONS. WE ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH THEM IN RAPID FIRE.  WHAT IS YOUR STUDIO FOR LIVE SHARE?  WE DO NOT HAVE A TIME FRAME FOR THAT. DEFINITELY FEEDBACK WE HAVE HAD. IF YOU COULD UP LOAD THAT ON THE DEVELOPER COMMUNITY, THAT WOULD HELP US TO PRIORITIES THAT.  NEXT QUESTION, WHERE CAN I GET THE CODE SAMPLES FROM THE EVENT? ARE THE SMART HOTEL 360 SAMPLES YOU CAN GET FROM THE MICROSOFT ORG ON GET HUB.  DOES IT HAVE SUPPORT FOR DARK MODE?  IT DOES.  ARE YOU A DARK MODE CODER?  DEPENDS ON THE TIME OF DAY. I USE DARK AT NIGHT AND LIGHT DURING THE DAY.  THAT IS SMART. FOR JAMIE, WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE NEW FEATURE?  DEFINITELY THE NEW EDITOR. IT BRINGS SO MANY THINGS TO THE TABLE. EMOJI SUPPORT. I KNOW IT IS IN PREVIEW BUT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT. I'VE BEEN USING IT A LOT, MYSELF. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT IN UPCOMING RELEASES.  FANTASTIC. THIS HAS BEEN AMAZING. NOW WE ARE GOING TO MR. FRITZ. ARE YOU THERE, MY FRIEND?  I AM. IT SEEMS LIKE IT HAS BEEN A COUPLE OF HOURS.  I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE SOME AMAZING PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE DOING?  MY GOSH, YES. I'VE INVITED A COUPLE OF MICROSOFT MVP's TO JOIN US TO TALK ABOUT A COUPLE OF FEATURES AND HOW THEY HELP THEIR PROCESS.  AWESOME, WE ARE GOING TO TURN THE TIME OVER TO YOU, MY FRIEND.  MY AUDIO CUT OUT FOR ME THERE.  THAT'S OKAY. I SAID, WE ARE GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO YOU.  THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'M GOING TO BRING ON LAUREN AND GINNY.  IT FEELS LIKE JUST A WEEK OR TWO AGO, WE WERE ALL HERE FOR MVP SUMMIT.  I'LL START WITH JENNY.  I'M JENNY, I BUILT GARBAGE SOFTWARE. WE DO THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY. A LOT OF IT.  AND LAUREN.  BUILDING MY OWN SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND HELPING COMPANIES TRANSFORM 0 TO MODERNIZE THEIR APPS.  YOU HAVE ANOTHER TITLE NOW?  DIRECTOR AT MICROSOFT. CERTAINLY PROVIDE A LOT OF FEEDBACK.  ONE MORE TITLE THAT YOU JUST -- COME ON.  I FEEL LIKE I'M DRAWING AT STRAWS HERE.  WITH THE .NET FOUNDATION.  YES. GOING TO BE A PART OF THE .NET FOUNDATION GOING AFTER THE RECENT SET OF ELECTIONS HERE.  CONGRATULATIONS. WE WANTED TO BRING YOU A COUPLE OF FOLKS THAT AREN'T MICROSOFT PEOPLE. WE WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE COOL THINGS YOU'VE SEEN IN 2019. THAT PREVIEW AND RELEASE SOME OF THE THINGS HAPPENING BEFORE IT HITS PRODUCTION. WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN IN THE PREVIEW?  WHAT THE COOLEST THING IS. IF I CHANGED MY MIND, I WOULDN'T HAVE TO BUY A NEW COMPUTER. IT UNINSTALLS CLEANLY. ON THIS PARTICULAR COMPUTER, WHICH IS A SURFACE BOOK. I'VE GOT TLHREE INSTANCES INSTALLED. PREVIEW FOR 2019 AND 2017. AND ONE I INSTALLED TODAY. THAT IS MY FAVORITE THING.  I FOUND IT WAS CONSULTANTS AND CONTRACTORS WERE THE FOLKS THAT HAD MULTIPLE VERSIONS OF VISUAL STUDIO GOING BACK TO 2012, 2010. IT'S NICE TO HAVE THEM SIDE BY SIDE BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO THROW AWAY THE MACHINE.  REALLY TRUE. I KEEP MY 2015 ON A TOTALLY SEPARATE PC FOR THAT REASON. VERY, VERY RARELY TAKE THIS. THIS HERE AT 2019 IS SO MUCH EASIER TO WORK WITH. THE LARGE AMOUNT OF CODE I HAD BEEN MAINTAINING FOR MANY YEARS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE WHAT ONE OF MY SOLUTIONS LOOKS LIKE? PEOPLE I'M DEALING WITH I THINK I'M SHARING MY SCREEN. THIS IS A PRODUCTION SOLUTION. IT HAS GOT RATHER A LOT OF PROJECTS IN THERE.  YOU PURPOSELY ZOOMED OUT.  RIGHT. THERE IS LOTS AND LOTS OF PROJECTS. IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019, I CAN UNLOAD SOME OF THE PROJECTS I'M NOT CURRENTLY WORKING WITH. IF I WANT TO, I CAN EASILY HIDE THEM. NOW I'M DOWN TO A MORE REASONABLE LIST OF PROJECTS I'M WORKING ON. YOU CAN SEE I CAN MOVE THEM ALL. I CAN SHARE THE ONES CURRENTLY UNLOADED. RIGHT NOW, I LIKE THE CLEAN, SIMPLE LOOK OF NOT HAVING SO MANY OF THEM TO LOOK AT.  SURE.  THE SAMPLE I'M SHOWING HERE IS PART OF A WPS FORM THAT DOES A VARIED CONFIGURATION OF A RE-LIFE ORIENTED CONFIGURATION FORM AND IT JUST GOES ON AND ON AND WRITING THE CODE TO THIS. A LOT OF THIS GETS REALLY REPETITIVE AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE. I'VE ALWAYS LIKED INTELLIGENCE. WHEN C SHARP SUPPORTED. SOME OF THIS CRAZY CODE. TO TARGET WAS NOT NEARLY AS TEDIOUS BECAUSE IT WAS JUST TAB ENTER, TAB ENTER. IT COULD FIGURE OUT WHAT I WANTED TO DO NEXT. NOT THIS THIS CODE IS BRILLIANT. I JUST LOVE THE WAY INTELICENSE AND INTELICODE. STUFF YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE. THAT'S ONE OF MY TOP FAVORITE THINGS. ANOTHER IS THAT I CAN WORK IN CODE AND SEE WHAT I'M WORKING WITH. I LIKE LIGHTENING. SOME PEOPLE HATE LIGHTENING. I AM USING MY CONTRACT HERE. I NEED THAT TO BE ABLE TO SEE. MAYBE YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THAT PROBLEM BUT I LIKE THAT VISUAL STUDIO IS GETTING MORE AND MORE ACCESSIBLE. IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE. THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS I'M DOING. PRETTY COOL HERE. THERE IS A FAIR AMOUNT OF CODE IN IT. I WOULDN'T WANT TO HAVE TO REWRITE IT. I WANT TO MAKE IT FUTURE PROVE AND TICK IT DOWN TO .NET COURSE THREE -- WHAT HAPPENED? THE VISUAL DESIGNER WAS CLOSE TO CODE. IT IS REALLY PRETTY EASY. THERE IS A NEW WIZARD BECAUSE IF YOU DO ONE OF THE NEW PROJECT TYPES. IN THE FORM APPLICATION. I ADDED THAT AS A SISTER PROJECT TO MY PRODUCTION PROJECT. WITH A LITTLE BIT OF MAGIC HERE, I CAN USE THE SAME WIN FORM DESIGNER IN THE PRODUCTION APPLICATION AND KEEP THESE IN SYNC. UNTIL .NET 3 IS RELEASED. ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS. I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT IS NEW AND WHAT'S NOT IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019. I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE PREVIEW PRIMARILY THAT I'M USED TO IT. HAVING IT SIDE BY SIDE. IT MAKES IT EASY. I HAVE HAD TO DO THAT ON OCCASION. WHAT DO YOU SEE IN VISUAL STUDIO.  I REALLY LIKE THE NEW PACKAGING BECAUSE IT HELPS ME GET MY APPLICATION TO THE END USERS. I CAN BUILD ANYTHING I WANT BUT I STILL HAVE TO GET IT DISTRIBUTED. CAN I SHARE MY SCREEN?  ABSOLUTELY.  LET ME PRESS THE SHARE BUTTON.  THERE IT IS. GO AHEAD.  I WANT TO SHARE -- ONE THING HERE .NET CORE THREE WORKS ON ALL VERSIONS OF WINDOWS. IMPACTING AND REFERENCING, THIS IS JUST SOMETHING I WILL WORK ON. THERE IS NOTHING WINDOWS 10 ABOUT THAT. IF I COME BACK NOW AND I AM GOING TO GO USE THE AD PROJECT DIALOGUE IN VISUAL STUDIO. THE APPLICATION PROJECT IS RIGHT HERE. IT IS REMEMBERING THE PROJECT TEMPLATES. IF I DIDN'T REMEMBER I COULD SEARCH FOR OUR PACKAGE. . EVERYTHING TO DO WITH PACKAGING. IN THE PACKAGING PROJECT. LET'S JUST SAY I WANTED TO WORK ON VERSIONS OF WINDOWS. THIS CREATES A PROJECT. THIS HAS BEEN ENHANCED IN 2019. SO I CAN COME AND ADD A REFERENCE. THIS IS A .NET CORE APPLICTION NOW IN THE START UP PROJECT. AND DEMO GODS NOTWITHSTANDING. THIS WAS BUILT THIS WAS SUBMITTED TO THE STORE IF YOU SO CHOOSE.  AND .NET CORE THREE IS STILL IN PREVIEW.  IN PREVIEW.  BUT IF THIS IS SOMETHING YOU WANT TO TRY, ALL THESE FEATURES ARE THERE. YOU YOU ARE PROVIDING VALUE TO YOUR CUSTOMERS.  ONE OF THE THING IZ LOVE, IT MIGHT BE IN PREVIEW BUT THAT GOES TO THE OTHER FEATURE. IT IS SIDE BY SIDE AND SELF-CONTAINED. I HAD A PACKAGE IN THE STORE. MAYBE YOU GET PACKAGE EXPLORER. IT IS ALREADY RUNNING AND USING THESE TECHNIQUES. I DON'T HAVE TO TELL ANYONE TO INSTALL ANYTHING. IT IS JUST PART OF MY APPLICATION.  DO YOU HAVE THE PACKAGE EXPLORER THERE?  I GET THE WINDOWS 10 NOTIFICATION. ANOTHER THING 2019 MAKES IT EASIER TO DO.  SO IMPORTANT TO TAKE VARNTAGE OF ALL OF THOSE FEATURES AND BEE ABLE TO SUPPORT THOSE MOMENTS AS WELL.  OKAY. WHAT'S IT DOING? THANK YOU WINDOWS. LET'S DO IT THIS WAY.  IT IS SELF-CONTAINED .NET VERSION THREE.  IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW I PUT THIS TOGETHER WITH THE FULL PIPELINE. IT IS ALL THERE TO CHECK OUT ON WHAT IS PART THAT I ENJOY AND LEARNING FROM OTHERS.  SO COMING BACK TO THE THREE OF US. I'M ASSUMING ALL OF THOSE CAPABILITIES ARE READ ONLY FOR THE PUBLIC. BUT FOR YOUR TEAM. READ/WRITE OF COURSE. ABSOLUTELY. IT IS READ ONLY FOR THE PUBLIC.  SO COOL.WE GET ON.- YOU ARE BOTH WORKING A LITTLE IN THE PREVIEW CHANNEL. WE'VE GOT ABOUT 15 MINUTES LEFT. WHAT DO YOU SEE? I KNOW THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS THEY'VE ALREADY STARTED. WHAT ARE YOU ARE SEEING IN THE NEXT VERSION WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT?  I CAN TELL YOU THE NUMBER ONE FEATURE I'VE BEEN ASKING ABOUT SO, SO LONG. IT IS TAGGED AS 16.1. FINGERS CROSSED THAT IT DOESN'T FLIP. THEY ARE ADDING ENHANCED SUPPORT THROUGH TYPES THAT ARE NOT YET IN SCOPE.  ENHANCED INTELISENCE SUPPORT. OKAY.  WHAT I SAW, I CAN PUT A TYPE IN THERE. IF I PITCHED IN SOMETHING, CAN YOU GO CONTROL DOT OR SHIFT DOT, IT WILL COMPLETE THE USER STATEMENTS FOR YOU. HOWEVER, I'M LAZY. I DON'T REMEMBER ALL OF THE TYPES. I WANT TO GET THAT COMPLETION AS YOU START TYPING. HOWEVER THE FILTERING ALREADY WORKS, I WANTED TO GIVE YOU THE OPTION. I DON'T REMEMBER THE EXACT NAME.  WHEN I TAB COMPLETE THAT, IT WILL PUT THE USING STATEMENT IN THERE.  IT IS PUTTING NEW STUFF INTO INTELISENCE.  THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID ABOUT MAKING US MORE PRODUCTIVE AND NOT ALL THE LITTLE THINGS YOU NEED TO DO.  JENNY IS THERE ANYTHING COMING UP YOU ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO?  THE WINDOWS FORUM AND THE DESIGN TIME EXPERIENCE IN 2019 FOR CORE THREE. IT IS NOT QUITE THERE YET IN THE RELEASED VERSION. THAT'S COMING DOWN. THAT WILL MAKE EVERYTHING A WHOLE LOT EASIER TO ME. MY PLAN IS TO MOVE EVERYTHING TO .NET CORE THREE.  I HAVE MAINTAINED THE PACKAGE WITH .NET CORE THREE WITHOUT GOING THROUGH OTHER WORK AROUNDS YOU HAVE TO TOUCH ON.  WE'VE SEEN THAT LITTLE BIT OF YOU CAN SHARE THE PROJECT BACK AND FORTH THAT IS .NET FRAMEWORK AND PULL OUT SOME OF THE FILES SO YOU CAN USE THE CAPABILITY OF THE FORMS AND THEN EXPORT THAT CONTENT AND CONTINUE WORKING. THAT IS A WORK AROUND BUT WE WANT THAT FINAL PREMIUM EXPERIENCE THAT IS COMING WITH VISUAL STUDIO AS .NET CORE THREE IS. IT IS A TREMENDOUS UPDATE FOR FOLKS THAT ARE READY TO GO. WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE STUFF YOU ARE WORKING ON. YOU ARE BOTH WORKING TOWARDS THAT FRAME FORK RIGHT NOW. OTHER THAN THE DESIGNERS. IS THERE SOMETHING SIGNIFICANTLY HOLDING YOU BACK?  YOU ARE ALREADY IN? JENNY, IS IT JUST THE DESIGNERS HOLDING YOU BACK OR ARE YOU ALREADY STARTING TO STEP IN WITH VISUAL STUDIO 2019?  I FOUND A FEW BUGS. ONE OTHER THING I SHOULD PROBABLY MENTION. THERE ARE SO MANY PREVIEW VERSIONS BUT ALSO IN 2017. I GET ALL OF THIS IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TO SUBMIT TO. I'VE SUBMITTED SOME THINGS, PROVIDED WORD PROBES OR PROBLEMS I FIND. FORTUNATELY, I DID ALL OF THAT TO SAY 2017 TO DO SOME LITTLE THINGS THAT WERE ISSUES FOR ME. THESE DIDN'T FINISH THINGS. THEY ARE COMING.  2017 A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AS SOME OF THE RELEASE CANDIDATES WERE COMING OUT THAT SAID, YOU KNOW, I HAVE A GO LIVE LICENSE NOW. I DON'T NEED 2017 ANYMORE. BUH-BYE.  YOU HAD A POINT. THAT REPORT A PROBLEM FLAG, IT DOESN'T JUST GO INTO A BUCKET. IF YOU'VE GOT A GOOD ISSUE AND YOU ARE DESKRIP TIFF OF IT, YOU MAY GET CONTACTED BACK BY THE TEAM.  IF NOT, YOU'LL GET A RESPONSE FROM THE BOT. IF NOT, YOU'LL GET A RESPONSE SAYING, I DON'T UNDERSTAND. CAN YOU GIVE US MORE DETAILS.  THAT TOOL HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL. WAY BETTER THAN USER VOICE. WHEN THEY MOVED THE SYSTEM OVER TO THIS, IT HAS BEEN MUCH BETTER IN TERMS OF RESPONSES. IF I CAN SHARE A LITTLE SECRET HERE. EVEN AMONG THE MVPs AND THEY COMPLAIN ABOUT SOMETHING, THE THING THEY ALWAYS WANT US TO DO IS REPORT THE PROBLEM. IT IS THE SAME CHANNEL EVERYBODY HAS. IT IS NOT JUST, HEY, WE CAN POKE THE PM. WE NEED TO REPORT THE PROBLEM. IT ALL GETS TRIAGED AND MANAGED.  THEY CAN FIND OUT THAT, YES, I AM RUNNING ON SKIP AHEAD WINDOWS VERSIONS. YES, I AM. MAYBE THAT IS A SCENARIO NOT WIDELY AS TESTED. THEY HAVE THAT INFORMATION IN YOUR ADDRESS.  YES. THERE IS A LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR MACHINE THAT COMES BACK WE ARE ABLE TO SEE WITH THOSE VISUAL THINGS. IT'S IMPORTANT WE GET THE ENTIRE PICTURE. A COUPLE OF PEOPLE SAYING THOSE ARE IMPORTANT. PEOPLE ARE COMMENTING THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT IS TREMENDOUS. AS WE WRAP UP HERE, DO YOU HAVE ANY FINAL WORDS FOR FOLKS THAT MAYBE ARE TRYING TO MAKE THE DECISION TO ROLL IT OUT TO THE BUSINESS OR DEVELOPERS. DOES THIS MAKE SENSE AS SOMETHING TO WAIT ON OR MOVE FORWARD WITH OR CAN WE PUT IT DOWN SIDE BY SIDE.  JUST DO IT.  DID YOU TAKE THAT FROM A SNEAKER COMPANY?  YOU CAN RUN IT SIDE BY SIDE. IF YOU HAVE OTHER REASONS YOU NEED TO USE SPECIFIC VERSION FOR PRODUCTION BUILD, THE PROJECTS AND SOLUTIONS ARE COMPATIBLE. YOU CAN WORK IN 2019 PREVIEW RELEASE CHANNEL. GO BACK TO 2017 ORGANIZATION. VISUAL STUDIO HAS GOTTEN A LOT BETTER ABOUT NOT CHANGING THE PROJECT FILE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO ALWAYS DO A WHOLE TEAM UPGRADE ALL AT ONCE. I JUST WANT A BETTER CODE EDITOR. FOR THE REST OF MY TEAM OR IN THE PREVIOUS VERSION.  RIGHT. IF I COMMIT THAT CODE BACK IN, CAN I SHARE IT WITH FOLKS WHO ARE USING 2017 AND 2019 WITHOUT ANY PENALTY. IT IS NICE. IT IS A GOOD COMPATIBILITY. I'M SEEING PEOPLE COMING IN. LOOKING AT MY DIRECTOR TO SEE IF WE ARE TRANSITIONING OUT. NOW I'M GETTING THE CUES. THERE WE GO. YOU ARE BOTH INSTALLING. HAVE YOU STARTED USING THE PREVIEW CHANNEL? DO YOU HAVE BOTH VERSIONS SIDE BY SIDE?  I DON'T HAVE THE RELEASE CHANNEL INSTALLED ON ANY OF MY MACHINES.  THAT IS AMAZING. I DO. I NEED THE RELEASE CHANNEL FOR THE LICENSE. NOW JUST AS A SANITY CHECK, IF I ENCOUNTER AN ISSUE, I'LL GO BACK TO THE RELEASE CHANNEL AND SEE IF I HAVE THE SAME ISSUE.  AZURE PIPELINES HAS THE BUILD. ALL MY BUILDS ARE BEING BUILT ON CONSECUTIVE LESS VERSIONS.  SO PROBLEM SOLVED.  THANK YOU SO MUCH. HERE IN THE TWITCH CHAT ROOM IS SAYING, ORIN, YOU DAREDEVIL. THAT DOES CREATE A LOT OF PRODUCT FEEDBACK THAT ACTUALLY HELPS EVERYBODY. SO THANK YOU.  IF I CAN FIND THOSE BUMPS AND REPORT THEM BACK AND HELP THEM GET POLISHES. I'VE DONE MY JOB.  ABSOLUTELY.  THANK YOU BOTH FOR JOINING US AS PART OF THE VISUAL STUDIO LAUNCH. WE ARE GOING TO THROW IT BACK OVER TO SETH. IT WAS GREAT HAVING YOU HERE. WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT TIME.  TAKE CARE. THAT WAS GREAT, I AM SO GLAD THEY WERE ABLE TO JOIN US AND TALK THROUGH SOME OF THOSE THINGS GOING ON FOR VISUAL STUDIO FOR FOLKS THAT ARE JUST TESTING. THE THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO THEM.  I THINK SETH IS OUT THERE IN THE OTHER ROOM.  I AM HERE. CAN YOU HEAR ME, MY FRIEND. HASN'T THIS BEEN AMAZING?  IT HAS BEEN AN AMAZING DAY. WE SAW SOME FOLKS FROM MUMBAI AND FOLKS FROM THE STATES.  YOU WERE ALL THE WAY IN THE OTHER ROOM.  THIS WAY.  PRETTY AMAZING.  JUST AROUND THE CORNER, TEN PACES AWAY. I THINK WE RAN INTO EACH OTHER AT THE POTATO CHIPS.  I TRIED TO AVOID YOU, IF I'M BEING HONEST.  I'M OKAY.  MAYBE I'M NOT OKAY. THIS HAS BEEN SUPER FUN. WE HAD LINED UP A LOT OF THINGS. THIS IS THE WAY WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN WATCHING IT, I FEEL LIKE. RIGHT? THE ACTUAL VISUALS FOR THAT, MY FRIEND. WE HAVE HERE JUST TO CLARIFY, THEY DO LET US HAVE FREE SODAS, IT IS NOT ME BUT I HAVE SEEN EMPLOYEES BRING IN THEIR BUFFET PURSE FOR THE SODAS. NOT GOING TO SAY WHO. WE HAVE ANOTHER ONE. WE DID THIS BEFORE BUT LOOK HOW FANCY THEY ARE IN GERMANY. LET'S GO TO A COUPLE MORE HERE. TECH SYSTEMS GAVE SOME GOOD FOOD TO THE ST. PETE.MEET UP, SO THANK YOU. I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DIDN'T SEND ANY HERE. LET'S SEE OVER HERE. LOOK AT THIS. GOING TO THE NEXT LEVEL. I LOVE SEEING PEOPLE ENJOY THESE. I STARTED WITH VISUAL STUDIO WITH DB 6, IT HAS BEEN PART OF MY CAREER ALMOST 20 YEARS. I'M PRETTY YOUNG. I'M 15 YEARS OLD. EVEN BEFORE I WAS BORN, I WAS USING VB 6. IF YOU LAUNCH VISUAL STUDIO.COM, ALL THE SESSIONS WILL BE UP THERE. IF YOU GO TO ADVISE YOU'LL STUDIO YOUTUBE, YOU'LL SEE SOME OF THOSE SESSIONS UP THERE RIGHT NOW. GO TO ADVISUAL STUDIO.COM/DOWNLOAD.  YOU CAN DOWNLOAD RIGHT NOW AND I DID. WE HAVE COMING UP, THIS IS GOING TO BE TURNED ALL OVER TO TWITCH. GO TO TWITCH.TV/VISUAL STUDIO.
