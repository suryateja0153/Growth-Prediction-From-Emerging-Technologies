 creativity is a phenomenon whereby something new and somehow valuable is formed the created item may be intangible such as an idea a scientific theory a musical composition or a joke or a physical object such as an invention a literary work or a painting scholarly interest in creativity is found in a number of disciplines primarily psychology business studies and cognitive science but also education technology engineering philosophy particularly philosophy of science theology sociology linguistics and economics covering the relations between creativity and general intelligence personality type mental and neurological processes mental health or artificial intelligence the potential for fostering creativity through education and training the fostering of creativity for national economic benefit and the application of creative resources to improve the effectiveness of teaching and learning you topic etymology the lexeme in the English word creativity comes from the latin term creo to create make its derivational suffixes also come from latin the word create appeared in english as early as the 14th century notably in Chaucer to indicate divine creation in the Parsons tale however its modern meaning as an act of human creation did not emerge until after the Enlightenment topic definition in a summary of scientific research into creativity Michael Mumford suggested over the course of the last decade however we seem to have reached a general agreement that creativity involves the production of novel useful products mumford 2003 P 110 or in Robert Sternberg's words the production of something original and worthwhile authors have diverged dramatically in their precise definitions beyond these general commonalities Peter Muse burger reckons that over a hundred different analyses can be found in the literature as an illustration one definition given by dr. Paul Torrance described it as a process of becoming sensitive to problems deficiencies gaps in knowledge missing elements dis harmonies and so on identifying the difficulty searching for solutions making guesses or formulating hypotheses about the deficiencies testing and retesting these hypotheses and possibly modifying and retesting them and finally communicating the results creativity in general is usually distinguished from innovation in particular where the stress is on implementation for example Teresa amiable and prat 2016 defines creativity as production of novel and useful ideas and innovation as implementation of creative ideas while the OECD and Eurostat state that innovation as more than a new idea or an invention an innovation requires implementation either by being put into active use or by being made available for use by other parties firms individuals or or nations topic aspects theories of creativity particularly investigation of why some people are more creative than others have focused on a variety of aspects the dominant factors are usually identified as the four peda seconds process product person and place according to mel rhodes a focus on process as shown in cognitive approaches that try to describe thought mechanisms and techniques for creative thinking theories invoking divergent rather than convergent thinking such as Guilford are those describing the staging of the creative process such as Wallis are primarily theories of creative process a focus on creative product usually appears in attempts to measure creativity psychometrics see below and in creative ideas framed as successful memes the psychometric approach to creativity reveals that it also involves the ability to produce more a focus on the nature of the creative person considers more general intellectual habits such as openness levels of ideation autonomy expertise exploratory behavior and so on a focus on place considers the circumstances in which creativity flourishes such as degrees of autonomy access to resources and the nature of gatekeepers creative lifestyles are characterized by non-conforming attitudes and behaviors as well as flexibility you topic history of the concept you topic ancient views most ancient cultures including thinkers of ancient Greece ancient China and ancient India lacked the concept of creativity seeing art as a form of discovery and not creation the ancient Greeks had no terms corresponding to to create or creator except for the expression poi in to make which only applied to poiesis poetry and to the poet's poet or maker who made it Plato did not believe in art as a form of creation asked in the Republic will we say of a painter that he makes something he answers certainly not he merely imitates it is commonly argued that the notion of creativity originated in Western culture through Christianity as a matter of divine inspiration according to the historian Daniel J Burstyn the early Western conception of creativity was the biblical story of creation given in the genesis however this is not creativity in the modern sense which did not arise until the Renaissance in the judeo-christian tradition creativity was the sole province of God humans were not considered to have the ability to create something new except as an expression of God's work a concept similar to that of Christianity existed in Greek culture for instance muses were seen as mediating inspiration from the gods Romans and Greeks invoked the concept of an external creative demon Greek or genius Latin linked to the sacred or the divine however none of these views are similar to the modern concept of creativity and the individual was not seen as the cause of creation until the Renaissance it was during the Renaissance that creativity was first seen not as a conduit for the divine but from the abilities of great men topic the enlightenment and after the rejection of creativity in favor of discovery and the belief that individual creation was a conduit of the divine would dominate the West probably until the Renaissance and even later the development of the modern concept of creativity begins in the Renaissance when creation began to be perceived as having originated from the abilities of the individual and not God this could be attributed to the leading intellectual movement of the time aptly named humanism which developed an intensely human centric outlook on the world valuing the intellect and achievement of the individual from this philosophy arose the Renaissance man or polymath an individual who embodies the principles of humanism in their ceaseless courtship with knowledge and creation one of the most well known and immensely accomplished examples as Leonardo da Vinci however this shift was gradual and would not become immediately apparent until the Enlightenment by the 18th century and the Age of Enlightenment mention of creativity notably in aesthetics linked with the concept of imagination became more frequent in the writing of Thomas Hobbes imagination became a key element of human cognition William Duff was one of the first to identify imagination as a quality of genius typifying the separation being made between talent productive but breaking no new ground and genius as a direct and independent topic of study creativity effectively received no attention until the 19th century Ronco and Albert argue that creativity as the subject of proper study began seriously to emerge in the late 19th century with the increased interest in individual differences inspired by the arrival of Darwinism in particular they refer to the work of Francis Galton who through his eugenicist outlook took a keen interest in the heritability of intelligence with creativity taken as an aspect of genius in the late 19th and early 20th centuries leading mathematicians and scientists such as hermann von helmholtz 1896 and honoré Poincare a 1908 began to reflect on and publicly discuss their creative processes topic 20th century to the present day the insights of Poincare a and von helmholtz were built on in early accounts of the creative process by pioneering theorists such as Graham Wallace and max Wertheimer in his work art of thought published in 1926 Wallace presented one of the first models of the creative process in the Wallace stage model creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of five stages I preparation preparatory work on a problem that focuses the individuals mind on the problem and explores the problems dimensions II incubation where the problem is internalized into the unconscious mind and nothing appears externally to be happening II intimation the creative person gets a feeling that a solution is on its way IV illumination or insight where the creative idea bursts forth from its preconscious processing into conscious awareness the verification where the idea is consciously verified elaborated and then applied Wallas model as often treated as four stages with intimation seen as a sub stage Wallis considered creativity to be a legacy of the evolutionary process which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments Simonton provides an updated perspective on this view in his book origins of genius Darwinian perspectives on creativity in 1927 Alfred North Whitehead gave the Gifford lectures at the University of Edinburgh later published as process and reality he is credited with having coined the term creativity to serve as the ultimate category of his metaphysical scheme Whitehead actually coined the term our term still the preferred currency of exchange among literature science and the arts a term that quickly became so popular so omnipresent that it's invention within living memory and by Alfred North Whitehead of all people quickly became occluded the formal psychometric measurement of creativity from the standpoint of Orthodox psychological literature is usually considered to have begun with JP Guilford's 1950 address to the American Psychological Association which helped popularize the topic and focus attention on a scientific approach to conceptualizing creativity it should be noted that the London School of Psychology had instigated psychometric studies of creativity as a as 1927 with the work of HL Hargreaves into the Faculty of imagination but it did not have the same impact statistical analysis led to the recognition of creativity as measured as a separate aspect of human cognition to IQ type intelligence into which it had previously been subsumed Guilford's work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down topic for C model James C Kaufman and baguette Oh introduced uh 4c model of creativity mini C transformative learning involving personally meaningful interpretations of experiences actions and insights little C everyday problem solving and creative expression Pro C exhibited by people who are professionally or vocationally creative though not necessarily eminent and Big C creativity considered great in the given field this model was intended to help accommodate models and theories of creativity that stressed competence as an essential component and the historical transformation of a creative domain as the highest mark of creativity it also the authors argued made a useful framework for analyzing creative processes in individuals the contrast of terms Big C and little C has been widely used cause belt beget oh and Ronco use a little C Big C model to review major theories of creativity Margaret Bowden distinguishes between H creativity historical and P creativity personal Robinson and Anna Kraft have focused on creativity in a general population particularly with respect to education craft makes a similar distinction between high and little C creativity and cites Ken Robinson as referring to high and democratic creativity Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi has defined creativity in terms of those individuals judged to have made significant creative perhaps domain changing contributions Simonton has analyzed the career trajectories of eminent creative people in order to map patterns and predictors of creative productivity topic theories of creative processes there has been much empirical study in psychology and cognitive science of the processes through which creativity occurs interpretation of the results of these studies has led to several possible explanations of the sources and methods of creativity topic incubation incubation is a temporary break from creative problem-solving that can result in insight there has been some empirical research looking at whether as the concept of incubation in walas model implies a period of interruption or rest from a problem made creative problem-solving Ward lists various hypotheses that have been advanced to explain why incubation made creative problem-solving and notes how some empirical evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that incubation aids creative problem in that it enables forgetting of misleading Clues absence of incubation may lead the problem solver to become fixated on inappropriate strategies of solving the problem this work disputes the earlier hypothesis that creative solutions to problems arise mysteriously from the unconscious mind while the conscious mind is occupied on other tasks this earlier hypothesis is discussed in csikszentmihalyi's five-phase model of the creative process which describes incubation as a time that your unconscious takes over this allows for unique connections to be made without our consciousness trying to make logical order out of the problem you topic convergent and divergent thinking Jaypee Guilford drew a distinction between convergent and divergent production commonly renamed convergent and divergent thinking convergent thinking involves aiming for a single correct solution to a problem whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym for creativity in psychology literature other researchers have occasionally used the terms flexible thinking or fluid intelligence which are roughly similar to but not synonymous with creativity topic creative cognition approach in 1992 think at all proposed the Jena ploor model in which creativity takes place in two phases a generative phase where an individual constructs mental representations called pre inventive structures and an exploratory phase where those structures are used to come up with creative ideas some evidence shows that when people use their imagination to develop new ideas those ideas are heavily structured in predictable ways by the properties of existing categories and concepts Weisberg argued by contrast that creativity only involves ordinary cognitive processes yielding extraordinary results you topic the explicit implicit interaction III theory Alley and Sun recently proposed a unified framework for understanding creativity in problem-solving namely the explicit implicit interaction III theory of creativity this new theory constitutes an attempt at providing a more unified explanation of relevant phenomena in part by reinterpreting integrating various fragmentary existing theories of incubation and insight the EEI Theory relies mainly on five basic principles namely the coexistence of and the difference between explicit and implicit knowledge the simultaneous involvement of implicit and explicit processes in most tasks the redundant representation of explicit and implicit knowledge the integration of the results of explicit and implicit processing the iterative and possibly bi-directional processing a computational implementation of the theory was developed based on the Clarion cognitive architecture and used to simulate relevant human data this work represents an initial step in the development of processed based theories of creativity encompassing incubation insight and various other related phenomena topic conceptual blending in the act of creation Arthur Koestler introduced the concept of by association that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference this idea was later developed into conceptual blending in the 1990s various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with metaphor analogy and structure mapping have been converging and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science art and humor has emerged under the label conceptual blending topic hoening theory honing theory developed principally by psychologist LeeAnn Gabor a-- posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing self mending nature of a worldview the creative process as a way in which the individual hones Andrey hones an integrated worldview honing theory places emphasis not only on the externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process when faced with a creatively demanding task there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview the conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview and the world view changes through interaction with the task this interaction is reiterated until the task is complete at which point not only as the task conceived of differently but the world view as subtly are drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components whether they be ideas attitudes or bits of knowledge a central feature of honing theory as the notion of a potentiality state honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly mutating predefined possibilities but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences but not yet disambiguated which as of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task thus the creative idea may feel half-baked it is at that point that it can be said to be in a potentiality state because how it will actual eyes depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with honing theory is held to explain certain phenomena not dealt with by other theories of creativity for example how different works by the same creator are observed in studies to exhibit a recognizable style or voice even though in different creative outlets this is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise but it is predicted by honing theory according to which personal style reflects the creators uniquely structured worldview another example as in the environmental stimulus for creativity creativity is commonly considered to be fostered by a supportive nurturing trustworthy environment conducive to self-actualization however research shows that creativity is also associated with childhood adversity which would stimulate honing topic everyday imaginative thought in everyday thought people often spontaneously imagine alternatives to reality when they think if only their counterfactual thinking is viewed as an example of everyday creative processes it has been proposed that the creation of counterfactual alternatives to reality depends on similar cognitive processes to rational thought you topic assessing individual creative ability you topic creativity quotient there was a creativity quotient developed similar to the intelligence quotient IQ it makes use of the results of divergent thinking tests see below by processing them further it gives more weight to ideas that are radically different from other ideas in the response you topic psychrometric approach Jaypee Guilford's group which pioneered the modern psychometric study of creativity constructed several tests to measure creativity in 1967 plot titles where participants are given the plot of a story and asked to write original titles quick responses as a word association test scored for uncommon as' figure concepts where participants were given simple drawings of objects and individuals and asked to find qualities or features that are common by two or more drawings these were scored for uncommon as' unusual uses as finding unusual uses for common everyday objects such as bricks remote associations where participants are asked to find a word between two given words eg hand blank call remote consequences where participants are asked to generate a list of consequences of unexpected events eg loss of gravity building on Guilford's work torrents developed the torrents tests of creative thinking in 1966 they involve simple tests of divergent thinking and other problem-solving skills which were scored on fluency the total number of interpretable meaningful and relevant ideas generated in response to the stimulus originality the statistical rarity of the responses among the test subjects elaboration the amount of detail in the responses such tests sometimes called divergent thinking DT tests have been both supported and criticized considerable progress has been made in automated scoring of divergent thinking tests using semantic approach when compared to human raters NLP techniques were shown to be reliable and valid in scoring the originality the reported computer programs were able to achieve a correlation of 0.60 and 0.72 respectively to human graders semantic networks were also used to devise originality scores that yielded significant correlations with socio personal measures most recently an nsf-funded team of researchers led by James C Kaufman and Mark a Ronco combined expertise in creativity research natural language processing computational linguistics and statistical data analysis to devise a scalable system for computerized automated testing spark 8 creativity index testing system this system enabled automated scoring of DT tests that is reliable objective and scalable thus addressing most of the issues of DT tests that had been found and reported the resultant computer system was able to achieve a correlation of 0.73 to human graders topic social personality approach you some researchers have taken a social personality approach to the measurement of creativity in these studies personality traits such as independence of judgment self-confidence attraction to complexity aesthetic orientation and risk-taking are used as measures of the creativity of individuals a meta-analysis by Gregory Feist showed that creative people tend to be more open to new experiences less conventional and less conscientious more self-confident self accepting driven ambitious dominant hostile and impulsive openness conscientiousness self-acceptance hostility and impulsivity had the strongest effects of the traits listed within the framework of the Big Five model of personality some consistent traits have emerged openness to experience has been shown to be consistently related to a whole host of different assessments of creativity among the other big five traits research has demonstrated subtle differences between different domains of creativity compared to non artists artists tend to have higher levels of openness to experience and lower levels of conscientiousness while scientists are more open to experience conscientious and higher in the confidence dominant facets of extraversion compared to non scientists topic self-report questionnaires an alternative our biographical methods these methods use quantitative characteristics such as the number of publications patents or performances of a work while this method was originally developed for highly creative personalities today it is also available as self-report questionnaires supplemented with frequent less outstanding creative behaviors such as writing a short story or creating your own recipes for example the creative achievement questionnaire a self-report test that measures creative achievement across 10 domains was described in 2005 and shown to be reliable and valid when compared to other measures of creativity and to independent evaluation of creative output besides the English original it was also used in a Chinese French and German speaking version it is the self-report questionnaire most frequently used in research topic creativity and intelligence the potential relationship between creativity and intelligence has been of interest since the late 1900s when a multitude of influential studies from get souls and Jackson Baron Wallach & Cogan and Guilford focused not only on creativity but also on intelligence this joint focus highlights both the theoretical and practical importance of the relationship researchers are interested not only if the constructs are related but also how and why there are multiple theories accounting for their relationship with the three main theories as follows threshold theory intelligence is a necessary but not sufficient condition for creativity there is a moderate positive relationship between creativity and intelligence until IQ approximately 120 certification Theory creativity is not intrinsically related to intelligence instead individuals are required to meet the requisites elegance in order to gain a certain level of education work which then in turn offers the opportunity to be creative displays of creativity are moderated by intelligence interference Theory extremely high intelligence might interfere with creative ability Sternberg and O'Hara proposed a framework of five possible relationships between creativity and intelligence creativity as a subset of intelligence intelligence as a subset of creativity creativity and intelligence are overlapping constructs creativity and intelligence are part of the same construct coincident sets creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs disjoint sets topic creativity as a subset of intelligence a number of researchers include creativity either explicitly or implicitly as a key component of intelligence examples of theories that include creativity as a subset of intelligence Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences MIT implicitly includes creativity as a subset of MIT to demonstrate this Gardner cited examples of different famous creators each of whom differed in their types of intelligences eg Picasso spatial intelligence Freud interpersonal Einstein logical mathematical and Gandhi interpersonal Sternberg's theory of successful intelligence see try ARCIC theory of intelligence includes creativity as a main component and comprises three sub theories confidential analytic contextual practical and experiential creative experiential sub theory the ability to use pre-existing knowledge and skills to solve new and novel problems is directly related to creativity the cattell horn Karel theory includes creativity as a subset of intelligence specifically it is associated with the broad group factor of long-term storage and retrieval glr GL are narrow abilities relating to creativity include ideational fluency associational fluency and originality creativity Silvia at all conducted a study to look at the relationship between divergent thinking and verbal fluency tests and reported that both fluency and originality in divergent thinking were significantly affected by the broad level glr factor Martindale extended the CHC theory in the sense that it was proposed that those individuals who are creative are also selective in their processing speed Martindale argues that in the creative process larger amounts of information are processed more slowly in the early stages and as the individual begins to understand the problem the processing speed is increased the dual process theory of intelligence posits a two factor type model of intelligence type one as a conscious process and concerns goal-directed thoughts which are explained by G type 2 as an unconscious process and concerned spontaneous cognition which encompasses daydreaming and implicit learning ability Kaufmann argues that creativity occurs as a result of type 1 and type 2 processes working together in combination the use of each type in the creative process can be used to varying degrees topic intelligence as a subset of creativity in this relationship model intelligence is a key component in the development of creativity theories of creativity that include intelligence as a subset of creativity Sternberg and lewbert's investment theory using the metaphor of a stock market they demonstrate that creative thinkers are like good investors they buy low and sell high in their ideas like under low valued stock creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people the creative individual has to persevere and convince the others of the ideas value after convincing the others and thus increasing the ideas value the creative individual sells high by leaving the idea with the other people and moves on to generating another idea according to this theory six distinct but related elements contribute to successful creativity intelligence knowledge thinking Styles personality motivation and environment intelligence is just one of the six factors that can either solely or in conjunction with the other five factors generate creative thoughts amables confidential model of creativity in this model there are three within individual components needed for creativity domain relevant skills creativity relevant processes and task motivation and one component external to the individual their surrounding social environment creativity requires a confluence of all components high creativity will result when an individual is intrinsically motivated possesses both a high level of domain relevant skills and has high skills in creative thinking and is working in a highly creative environment amusement park theoretical model in this four-step theory both domain-specific and generalist views are integrated into a model of creativity the researchers make use of the metaphor of the amusement park to demonstrate that within each of these creative levels intelligence plays a key role to get into the amusement park there are initial requirements eg time transport to go to the park initial requirements like intelligence are necessary but not sufficient for creativity they are more like prerequisites for creativity and if an individual does not possess the basic level of the initial requirement intelligence then they will not be able to generate creative thoughts behavior secondly are the sub components general thematic areas that increase in specificity like choosing which type of amusement park to visit eg a zoo or a water park these areas relate to the areas in which someone could be creative eg poetry thirdly there are specific domains after choosing the type of park to visit eg water park you then have to choose which specific park to go to within the poetry domain there are many different types eg free-verse riddles sonnet etc that have to be selected from lastly there are micro domains these are the specific tasks that reside within each domain eg individual lines in a free verse poem individual rides at the water park you topic creativity and intelligence as overlapping yet distinct constructs this possible relationship concerns creativity and intelligence as distinct but intersecting constructs theories that include creativity and intelligence as overlapping yet distinct constructs Renzulli x' three-ring conception of giftedness in this conceptualization giftedness occurs as a result from the overlap of above average intellectual ability creativity and task commitment under this view creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs but they do overlap under the correct conditions past theory of intelligence in this theory the planning component relating to the ability to solve problems make decisions and take action strongly overlaps with the concept of creativity threshold Theory tt a number of previous research findings have suggested that a threshold exists in the relationship between creativity and intelligence both constructs are moderately positively correlated up to an IQ of approximately 120 above this threshold of an IQ of 120 if there is a relationship at all it is small and weak tt posits that a moderate level of intelligence as necessary for creativity in support of the tt Barron reported finding a non significant correlation between creativity and intelligence in a gifted sample and a significant correlation in a non gifted sample Yamamoto in a sample of secondary school children reported a significant correlation between creativity and intelligence of our topic 0.3 and reported no significant correlation when the sample consisted of gifted children Fuchs Beauchamp at all in a sample of preschoolers found that creativity and intelligence correlated from our you 19 to our topic point four nine in the group of children who had an IQ below the threshold and in the group above the threshold the correlations were are much modern-day research reports findings against TT y at all in a study using data from the longitudinal study of mathematically precocious youth a cohort of elite students from early adolescence into adulthood found that differences in SAT scores at age 13 were predictive of creative real life outcomes twenty years later Kim's meta-analysis of 21 studies did not find any supporting evidence for TT and instead negligible correlations were reported between intelligence creativity and divergent thinking both below and above IQs of 120 prickle at all investigating fluid intelligence and creativity reported small correlations of our topic 0.32 our point four across all levels of cognitive ability topic creativity and intelligence as coincident sets under this view researchers posit that there are no differences in the mechanisms underlying creativity in those used in normal problem-solving and in normal problem-solving there is no need for creativity thus creativity and intelligence problem-solving are the same thing Perkins referred to this is that nothing special view Weisberg and Alba examined problem solving by having participants complete the nine dot problem see thinking outside the box hashtag nine dots puzzle where the participants are asked to connect all nine dots in the free rows of free dots using four straight lines or less without lifting their pen or tracing the same line twice the problem can only be solved if the lines go outside the boundaries of the square of dots results demonstrated that even when participants were given this insight they still found it difficult to solve the problem thus showing that to successfully complete the task it is not just in sight our creativity that is required topic creativity and intelligence as disjoint sets in this view creativity and intelligence are completely different unrelated constructs get souls and Jackson administered five creativity measures to a group of 449 children from grades 6 to 12 and compared these test findings to results from previously administered by the school IQ tests they found that the correlation between the creativity measures and IQ was R equals 0.26 the high creativity group scored in the top 20% of the overall creativity measures but were not included in the top 20% of IQ scores the high intelligence group scored the opposite they scored in the top 20% for IQ but were outside the top 20% scores for creativity thus showing that creativity and intelligence are distinct and unrelated however this work has been heavily criticized Wallach & Cogan highlighted that the creativity measures were not only weakly related to one another to the extent that they were no more related to one another than they were with IQ but they seemed to also draw upon non creative skills McNamara noted that there were major measurement issues in that the IQ scores were a mixture from three different IQ tests wallach and Cogan administered five measures of creativity each of which resulted in a score for originality and fluency and ten measures of general intelligence to 151 fifth tests were untimed and given in a game like manner aiming to facilitate creativity inter correlations between creativity tests were on average our topic 0.41 inter correlations between intelligence measures were on average our point five one each other creativity tests and intelligence measures correlated are equals point zero nine equals topic neuroscience equals the neuroscience of creativity looks at the operation of the brain during creative behavior it has been addressed in the article creative innovation possible brain mechanisms the authors write that creative innovation might require Co activation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected highly creative people who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways they have a high level of specialized knowledge they are capable of divergent thinking mediated by the frontal lobe and they are able to modulate neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine in their frontal lobe thus the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the cortex that is most important for creativity this article also explored the links between creativity and sleep mood and addiction disorders and depression in 2005 Alice Flaherty presented a three factor model of the creative drive drawing from evidence in brain imaging drug studies and lesion analysis she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes the temporal lobes and dopamine from the limbic system the frontal lobes can be seen as responsible for idea generation and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation abnormalities in the frontal lobe such as depression or anxiety generally decrease creativity while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity high activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe and vice versa high dopamine levels increased general arousal and goal directed behaviors and reduce latent inhibition and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas a 2015 study on creativity found that it involves the interaction of multiple neural networks including those that support associative thinking along with other default mode Network functions you topic working memory and the cerebellum van der Vaart described how the brains frontal lobes and the cognitive functions of the cerebellum collaborate to produce creativity and innovation van der verts explanation rests on considerable evidence that all processes of working memory responsible for processing all thought are adaptively modelled for increased efficiency by the cerebellum the cerebellum consisting of 100 billion neurons which is more than the entirety of the rest of the brain is also widely known to adaptively model all bodily movement for efficiency the cerebellums adaptive models of working memory processing are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes where creative and innovative thoughts arise apparently creative insight or the AHA experience as then triggered in the temporal lobe according to Vander vert the details of creative adaptation begin in forward cerebellar models which are anticipatory exploratory controls for movement and thought these cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed hierarchical modular selection and identification for control HMO SAIC new hierarchically arranged levels of the cerebellar control architecture HMO SAIC develop as mental mulling in working memory as extended over time these new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal lobes since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of thought and emotion Vander verts approach helps explain creativity and innovation in sports art music the design of video games technology mathematics the child prodigy and thought in general essentially van der Vaart has argued that when a person is confronted with a challenging new situation visual spatial working memory and speech related working memory are decomposed and recomposed fractionated by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation with repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations the cerebral cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how working memory deals with the situation or problem most recently he has argued that this is the same process only involving visual spatial working memory and pre language vocalization that led to the evolution of language in humans van der Vaart and van der Vaart weathers have pointed out that this blending process because it continuously optimized efficiencies constantly improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas music art or technology prototyping they argue not only produces new products it trains the cerebral cerebellar pathways involved to become more efficient at prototyping itself further Vander vert and van der Vaart Weathers believe that this repetitive mental prototyping or mental rehearsal involving the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex explains the success of the self-driven individualized patterning of repetitions initiated by the teaching methods of the Khan Academy the model proposed by van der Vaart has however received incisive critique from several authors topic REM sleep creativity involves the forming of associative elements into new combinations that are useful or meet some requirement sleep aids this process REM rather than an REM sleep appears to be responsible this has been suggested to be due to changes in cholinergic and noradrenergic neuromodulation that occurs during REM sleep during this period of sleep high levels of acetylcholine in the hippocampus suppress feedback from the hippocampus to the neocortex and lower levels of acetylcholine and norepinephrine in the neocortex encourage the spread of associational activity within Nia cortical areas without control from the hippocampus this is in contrast to waking consciousness where higher levels of norepinephrine and acetylcholine inhibit recurrent connections in the neocortex it is proposed that REM sleep adds creativity by allowing Nia cortical structures to reorganize associative hierarchies in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes you topic effect some theories suggest that creativity may be particularly susceptible to effective influence as noted in voting behavior the term effect in this context can refer to liking or disliking key aspects of the subject in question this work largely follows from findings in psychology regarding the ways in which affective states are involved in human judgment and decision making topic positive effect relations according to Alice Isen positive effect has three primary effects on cognitive activity positive effect makes additional cognitive material available for processing increasing the number of cognitive elements available for Association positive effect leads to D focused attention and a more complex cognitive context increasing the breath of those elements that are treated is relevant to the problem positive effect increases cognitive flexibility increasing the probability that diverse cognitive elements will in fact become associated together these processes lead positive effect to have a positive influence on creativity Barbara Frederickson in her broaden and build model suggests that positive emotions such as joy and love brought in a person's available repertoire of cognitions and actions thus enhancing creativity according to these researchers positive emotions increase the number of cognitive elements available for Association attention scope and the number of elements that are relevant to the problem cognitive scope various meta analyses such as boss at all 2008 of 66 studies about creativity in effect support the link between creativity and positive effect topic creativity and artificial intelligence you jurgen schmidhuber x' formal theory of creativity postulates that creativity curiosity and interestingness are byproducts of a simple computational principle for measuring and optimizing learning progress consider an agent able to manipulate its environment and thus its own sensory inputs the agent can use a blackbox optimization method such as reinforcement learning to learn through informed trial and error sequences of actions that maximize the expected sum of its future reward signals there are extrinsic reward signals for achieving externally given goals such as finding food when hungry but schmidhuber subjective function to be maximized also includes an additional intrinsic term to model well effects this non-standard term motivates purely creative behavior of the agent even when there are no external goals a well effect is formally defined as follows as the agent is creating and predicting and encoding the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs it keeps improving the predictor or encoder which can be implemented as an artificial neural network or some other machine learning device that can exploit regularities in the data to improve its performance over time the improvements can be measured precisely by computing the difference in computational costs storage size number of required synapses errors time needed to encode new observations before and after learning this difference depends on the encoders present subjective knowledge which changes over time but the theory formally takes this into account the cost difference measures the strength of the present effect due to sudden improvements in data compression or computational speed it becomes an intrinsic reward signal for the action selector the objective function thus motivates the action optimizer to create action sequences causing more well effects a regular random data or noise do not permit any wow effects or learning progress and thus are boring by nature providing no reward already known and predictable regularities also are boring temporarily interesting are only the initially unknown novel regular patterns in both actions and observations this motivates the agent to perform continual open-ended active creative exploration according to schmidhuber his objective function explains the activities of scientists artists and comedians for example physicists are motivated to create experiments leading to observations obeying previously unpublished physical laws permitting better data compression likewise composers receive intrinsic reward for creating non arbitrary melodies with unexpected but regular harmonies that permit Wow effects through data compression improvements similarly a comedian gets intrinsic reward for inventing a novel joke with an unexpected punchline related to the beginning of the story in an initially unexpected but quickly learn about also allows for better compression of the perceived data Sh'ma doober argues that ongoing computer hardware advances will greatly scale up rudimentary artificial scientists and artists based on simple implementations of the basic principle since 1990 he used the theory to create low complexity art and an attractive human face topic mental health a study by psychologist Jay Philippe Rushton found creativity to correlate with intelligence and psychoticism another study found creativity to be greater in schizotypal than in either normal or schizophrenic individuals while divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the prefrontal cortex schizotypal individuals were found to have much greater activation of their right prefrontal cortex this study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate in agreement with this hypothesis and the dexterity is also associated with schizotypal and schizophrenic individuals three recent studies by Mark Beatty and Adrian Burnham have demonstrated the relationships between schizotypal and hypomanic personality and several different measures of creativity particularly strong links have been identified between creativity and mood disorders particularly manic depressive disorder aka bipolar disorder and depressive disorder aka unipolar disorder in touched with fire manic depressive illness and the artistic temperament Kay Redfield Jamison summarizes studies of mood disorder rates in writers poets and artists she also explores research that identifies mood disorders in such famous writers and artists as Ernest Hemingway who shot himself after electroconvulsive treatment Virginia Woolf who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on composer Robert Schumann who died in a mental and even the famed visual artist Michelangelo a different case study suggested for Schumann a difference between bipolar disorder and creative bipolarity a study looking at 300,000 persons with schizophrenia bipolar disorder or unipolar depression and their relatives found overrepresentation in creative professions for those with bipolar disorder as well as for undiagnosed siblings of those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder there was no overall overrepresentation but over representation for artistic occupations among those diagnosed with schizophrenia there was no association for those with unipolar depression or their relatives another case study suggested a difference between severe mood disorders and creative melancholy pointing out mild and moderate depression may inspire creative achievements while severe depression inhibits and may even destroy creative activity another study involving more than 1 million people conducted by Swedish researchers that the Karolinska Institute reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses riders had a higher risk of anxiety and bipolar disorders schizophrenia unipolar depression and substance abuse and were almost twice as likely as the general population to kill themselves dancers and photographers were also more likely to have bipolar disorder however as a group those in the creative professions were no more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders than other people although they were more likely to have a close relative with a disorder including anorexia and to some extent autism the Journal of psychiatric race search reports according to psychologist Robert Epstein PhD creativity can be obstructed through stress topic creativity and personality creativity can be expressed in a number of different forms depending on unique people and environments a number of different theorists have suggested models of the creative person one model suggests that there are four creativity profiles that can help produce growth innovation speed etc I incubate long-term development II imagine breakthrough ideas II improve incremental adjustments IV invest short-term goals research by dr. mark Beatty of the psychometrics at work research group at Manchester Business School has suggested that the creative profile can be explained by four primary creativity traits with narrow facets within each I idea generation fluency originality incubation and illumination II personality curiosity and tolerance for ambiguity II moe evasion intrinsic extrinsic and achievement IV confidence producing sharing and implementing this model was developed in a sample of 1,000 working adults using the statistical techniques of exploratory factor analysis followed by confirmatory factor analysis by structural equation modeling an important aspect of the creativity profiling approach as to account for the tension between predicting the creative profile of an individual as characterized by the psychometric approach and the evidence that team creativity is founded on diversity and difference one characteristic of creative people as measured by some psychologists is what is called divergent production divergent production as the ability of a person to generate a diverse assortment yet an appropriate amount of responses to a given situation one way of measuring divergent production as by administering the torrance tests of creative thinking the torrance tests of creative thinking assesses the diversity quantity and appropriateness of participants responses to a variety of open-ended questions other researchers of creativity see the difference in creative people as a cognitive process of dedication to problem-solving and developing expertise in the field of their creative expression hard-working people study the work of people before them and within their current area become experts in their fields and then have the ability to add to and build upon previous information in innovative and creative ways in a study of projects by design students students who had more knowledge on their subject on average had greater creativity within their projects the aspect of motivation within a person's personality may predict creativity levels in the person motivation stems from two different sources intrinsic and extrinsic motivation intrinsic motivation as an internal drive within a person to participate or invest as a result of personal interest desires hopes goals etc extrinsic motivation as a drive from outside of a person and might take the form of payment rewards fame approval from others etc although extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people from a personality traits perspective there are a number of traits that are associated with creativity in people creative people tend to be more open to new experiences are more self-confident are more ambitious self accepting impulsive driven dominant and hostile compared to people with less creativity from an evolutionary perspective creativity may be a result of the outcome of years of generating ideas as ideas are continuously generated the need to evolve produces a need for new ideas and developments as a result people have been creating and developing new innovative and creative ideas to build our progress as a society in studying exceptionally creative people in history some common traits in lifestyle and environment are often found creative people in history usually had supportive parents but rigid and non nurturing most had an interest in their field at an early age and most had a highly supportive and skilled mentor in their field of interest often the field they chose was relatively uncharted allowing for their creativity to be expressed more in a field with less previous information most exceptionally creative people devoted almost all of their time and energy into their craft and after about a decade had a creative breakthrough of Fame their lives were marked with extreme dedication and a cycle of hard work and breakthroughs as a result of their determination another theory of creative people as the investment theory of creativity this approach suggests that there are many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity in the investment sense a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into something that has been overlooked by others the creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognized idea to the point that it is established as a new and creative idea just like in the financial world some investments are worth the buy in while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected this investment theory of creativity views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way Topic malevolent creativity malevolent creativity MC focuses on the darker side of creativity this type of creativity is not typically accepted within society and as defined by the intention to cause harm to others through original and innovative means MC should be distinguished from negative creativity in that negative creativity may unintentionally cause harm to others whereas MC as explicitly malevolently motivated MC is often a key contributor to crime and in its most destructive form can even manifest as terrorism however MC can also be observed in ordinary day-to-day life as lying cheating and betrayal although everyone shows some levels of MC under certain conditions those that have a higher propensity towards malevolent creativity have increased tendencies to deceive and manipulate others to their own gain although levels of MC appear to dramatically increase when an individual is placed under unfair conditions personality is also a key predictor in anticipating levels of malevolent thinking Research's harris and ryder Palamon investigated the role of aggression in levels of MC in particular levels of implicit aggression and the tendency to employ aggressive actions in response to problem solving the personality traits of physical aggression conscientiousness emotional intelligence and implicit aggression all seem to be related with MC harris and writer pallemans research showed that when subjects were presented with a problem that triggered malevolent creativity participants high in implicit aggression and low in premeditation expressed the largest number of malevolently themed solutions when presented with the more benign problem that triggered pro-social motives of helping others and cooperating those high in implicit aggression even if they were high in impulsiveness were far less destructive in their imagined solutions they concluded premeditation more than implicit aggression controlled an individual's expression of malevolent creativity the current measure for malevolent creativity as the thirteen item tests malevolent creativity behavior scale MC BS Topic malevolent creativity and crime malevolent creativity has strong links with crime as creativity requires deviating from the conventional there is a permanent tension between being creative and producing products that go too far and in some cases to the point of breaking the law aggression is a key predictor of malevolent creativity and studies have also shown that increased levels of aggression also correlates to a higher likelihood of committing crime you topic creativity across cultures creativity is viewed differently in different countries for example cross-cultural research centred on Hong Kong found that Westerners view creativity more in terms of the individual attributes of a creative person such as their aesthetic taste while Chinese people view creativity more in terms of the social influence of creative people eg what they can contribute to society MPO fu at all surveyed 28 African languages and found that 27 had no word which directly translated to creativity the exception being Arabic the principle of linguistic relativity ie that language can affect thought suggests that the lack of an equivalent word for creativity may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages however more research would be needed to establish this and there is certainly no suggestion that this linguistic difference makes people any less or more creative Africa has a rich heritage of creative pursuits such as music art and storytelling nevertheless it is true that there has been very little research on creativity in Africa and there has also been very little research on creativity in Latin America creativity has been more thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere but here again there are cultural differences even between countries or groups of countries in close proximity for example in Scandinavian countries creativity is seen as an individual attitude which helps in coping with life's challenges while in Germany creativity is seen more as a that can be applied to help solve problems topic in organizations it has been the topic of various research studies to establish that organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent for any given organization measures of effectiveness vary depending upon its mission environmental context nature of work the product or service it produces and customer demands thus the first step in evaluating organizational effectiveness as to understand the organization itself how it functions how it is structured and what it emphasizes amiable argued that to enhance creativity in business three components were needed expertise technical procedural and intellectual knowledge creative thinking skills how flexibly and imaginatively people approach problems and motivation especially intrinsic motivation there are two types of motivation extrinsic motivation external factors for example threats of being fired or money as a reward intrinsic motivation comes from inside an individual satisfaction enjoyment of work etc six managerial practices to encourage motivation are Challenge matching people with the right assignments freedom giving people autonomy choosing means to achieve goals resources such as time money space etc there must be balance fit among resources and people work group features diverse supportive teams where members share the excitement willingness to help and recognize each other's talents supervisory encouragement recognitions cheering praising organizational support value emphasis information sharing collaboration Nonaka who examined several successful Japanese companies similarly saw creativity and knowledge creation as being important to the success of organizations in particular he emphasized the role that tacit knowledge has to play in the creative process in business originality is not enough the idea must also be appropriate useful and actionable creative competitive intelligence as a new solution to solve this problem according to Ray hosel Tala it links creativity to innovation process and competitive intelligence to creative workers creativity can be encouraged in people and professionals and in the workplace it is essential for innovation and as a factor affecting economic growth and businesses in 2013 the sociologist Silvia Leal martine using the anova 3dx method suggested measuring the various parameters that encourage creativity and innovation corporate culture work environment leadership and management creativity self-esteem and optimism locus of control and learning orientation motivation and fear similarly social psychologists organizational scientists and management scientists who conduct extensive research on the factors that influence creativity and innovation in teams and organizations have developed integrative theoretical models that emphasize the roles of team composition team processes and organizational culture as well as the mutually reinforcing relationships between them in promoting innovation the investigation by Lu 2017 on creative working in the knowledge economy brings together studies of creativity as delineated in this webpage it offers connections with the sections on the 4c model theories of creative processes creativity as a subset of intelligence creativity and personality and in organizations it is the last section that the investigation addresses research studies of the knowledge economy may be classified into three levels macro meso and micro macro studies refer to investigations at a societal or transnational dimension meso studies focus on organizations micro investigations Center on the manushya workings of workers there is also an interdisciplinary dimension such as research from businesses eg Burton Jones 1999 Drucker 1999 economics eg cortada 1998 Reich 2001 Florida 2003 education eg feral and fenwick 2007 Brown Lauder and Ashton 2011 human resource management eg Davenport 2005 knowledge and organizational management aalverson 2004 de filippi Arthur and Lindsay 2006 or Nutley Russell Bain hacking and Moran 2016 sociology psychology and knowledge economy related sectors especially information technology its software eg Orion 2004 neural and 2008 and advertising eg grabber 2004 Lurie 2004 Lou 2017 Lu 2017 studies how individual workers in the knowledge economy used their creativity and know-how in the advertising and IT software sectors it examines this phenomenon across three developed countries of England Japan and Singapore to observe global perspectives specifically the study uses qualitative data from semi-structured interviews of the related professionals in the roles of creative directing and copywriting in advertising and systems software developing and software program managing the study offers a conceptual framework Liu 2017 P 49 of a two-dimensional matrix of individual and collaborative working styles and single and multi contexts the investigation draws on literature sources from the four disciplines of economics eg Reich 2001 qua 2002 management eg Drucker 1994 Nonaka and Takeuchi 1995 von Hippel 2006 sociology eg Zubov 1988 Bell 1973 lash and early 1994 Castells 2000 norsu tina 2005 and psychology eg Gardner 1984 Csikszentmihalyi 1988 Sternberg Kaufmann and preps 2004 the themes arising from the analysis of knowledge work and creativity literature served to create a distinct theoretical framework of creative knowledge work these workers apply their cognitive abilities creative personalities and skillsets in the areas of science technology or culture industries to invent or discover new possibilities eg a medium product or service these work activities may be done individually or collectively education training and in cultured environments are necessary for the performance of these creative activities acts of creativity are viewed as asking new questions over and above those questions asked by an intelligent person seeking novelty when reviewing a situation Gardner 1993 and creating something that is different and novel ie variation on the idea of existing ideas in a domain Csikszentmihalyi 1988 this framework is evidenced by the empirical chapters on the micro workings of creative workers in the to knowledge economy sectors from global perspectives this investigation identifies a definition of creative work three types of work and the necessary conditions for it to occur these workers use a combination of creative applications including anticipatory imagination problem solving problem seeking and generating ideas and aesthetic sensibilities taking aesthetic sensibilities as an example for a creative director in the advertising industry it is a visual imagery whether still are moving via a camera lens and for a software programmer it is the innovative technical expertise in which the software is written there are specific creative applications for each of the sectors such as emotional connection in the advertising sector and the power of expression and sensitivity in the IT software sector in addition to the creative applications creative workers require abilities and aptitudes to carry out their roles passion for one's job as generic for copywriters this passion as identified with fun enjoyment and happiness alongside attributes such as honesty regarding the product confidence and patience in finding the appropriate copy knowledge is also required in the disciplines of the humanities eg literature the creative arts eg painting and music and technical related know-how eg Mathematics Computer Sciences and physical sciences in the IT software technical knowledge of computer languages eg C++ is especially significant for programmers whereas the degree of technical expertise may be less for a program manager as only knowledge of the relevant language as necessary to understand the issues for communicating with the team of developers and testers there are three types of work one is intra sectoral eg general sponge and in tune with the zeitgeist advertising and power of expression and sensitivity IT software the second as inter-sectoral eg integration of advertising activities advertising and autonomous decentralized systems adds IT software the third relates to changes in culture practices in the sectors eg three-dimensional trust and green credentials advertising and collaboration with highs and industry and AD system in the Tokyo train operator IT software the necessary conditions for creative work to exist are a supportive environment such as supportive information communications and electronic technologies ICT infrastructure training work environment education this investigation has implications for lifelong learning of these workers informally and formally teaching institutions need to offer multidisciplinary knowledge of humanities Arts and Sciences and it has impacts on the program structure delivery approaches and assessments at a macro level governments need to offer a rich diet of cultural activities outdoor activities and sports fixtures that inform potential creative workers in the areas of video gaming and advertising this study has implications for work organizations that support and encourage collaborative working alongside individual working offer opportunities to engage in continuous professional development formally and informally and foster an environment which promotes experiential functioning and supports experimentation topic team composition diversity between team members backgrounds and knowledge can increase team creativity by expanding the total collection of unique information that is available to the team and introducing different perspectives that can integrate in novel ways however under some conditions diversity can also decrease team creativity by making it more difficult for team members to communicate about ideas and causing interpersonal conflicts between those with different perspectives thus the potential advantages of diversity must be supported by appropriate team processes and organizational cultures in order to enhance creativity topic team processes team communication norms such as respecting others expertise paying attention to others ideas expecting information sharing tolerating disagreements negotiating remaining open to others ideas learning from others and building on each other's ideas increased team creativity by facilitating the social processes involved with brainstorming and problem solving through these processes team members are able to access their collective pool of knowledge reach shared understandings identify new ways of understanding problems or tasks and make new connections between ideas engaging in these social processes also promotes positive team effect which facilitates collective creativity topic organizational culture supportive and motivational environments that create psychological safety by encouraging risk-taking and tolerating mistakes increased team creativity as well organizations in which help seeking help giving and collaboration are rewarded promote innovation by providing opportunities and contexts in which team processes that lead to collective creativity can occur additionally leadership styles that downplay status hierarchies are power differences within an organization and empower people to speak up about their ideas or opinions also helped to create cultures that are conducive to creativity topic constraints and creativity there is a long-standing debate on how material constraints eg lack of money materials or equipment affect creativity in psychological and managerial research two competing views in this regard prevail in one view many scholars propose a negative effect of material constraints on innovation and claim that material constraints starve creativity the proponents of this view argue that adequate material resources are needed to engage in creative activities like experimenting with new solutions and idea exploration in an opposing view scholars assert that people tend to stick to established routines or solutions as long as they are not forced to deviate from them by constraints in this sense Narron posits that scarcity as an important driver of creativity consistently Jib Bert and Scranton demonstrated how material constraints facilitated the development of jet engines in world war ii to reconcile these competing views contingency models were proposed the rationale behind these models as that certain contingency factors eg creativity climate or creativity relevant skills influence the relationship between constraints and creativity these contingency factors reflect the need for higher levels of motivation and skills when working on creative tasks under constraints depending on these contingency factors there is either a positive or negative relationship between constraints and creativity topic economic views of creativity economic approaches to creativity have focused on three aspects the impact of creativity on economic growth methods of modeling markets for creativity and the maximization of economic creativity innovation in the early 20th century Joseph Schumpeter introduced the economic theory of creative destruction to describe the way in which old ways of doing things are endogenously destroyed and replaced by the new some economists such as Paul Romer view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and consequently economic growth creativity leads to capital and creative products are protected by intellectual property laws mark a Ronco and Daniel Rubinstein have tried to describe a psycho economic model of creativity in such a model creativity as the product of endowments and active investments in creativity the costs and benefits of bringing creative activity to market determine the supply of creativity such an approach has been criticized for its view of creativity consumption as always having positive utility and for the way it analyzes the value of future innovations the creative class as seen by some to be an important driver of modern economies in his 2002 book the rise of the creative class economist Richard Florida popularized the notion that regions with three T's of economic development technology talent and tolerance also have high concentrations of creative professionals and tend to have a higher level of economic development you topic fostering creativity several different researchers have proposed methods of increasing the creativity of an individual such ideas range from the psychological cognitive such as Osborn Parnes creative problem-solving process synaptics science-based creative thinking / do creative thinking program and Edward de Bono's lateral thinking to the highly structured such as TRIZ the theory of inventive problem-solving and its variant algorithm of inventive problem-solving developed by the russian scientist gunnar ik Altschuler and computer aided morphological analysis Daniel pink in his 2005 book a whole new mind repeating arguments posed throughout the 20th century argues that we are entering a new age where creativity is becoming increasingly important in this conceptual age we will need to foster and encourage right directed thinking representing creativity and emotion over left directed thinking representing logical analytical thought however this simplification of right versus left brain thinking is not supported by the research data Nickerson provides a summary of the various creativity techniques that have been proposed these include approaches that have been developed by both academia and industry establishing purpose and intention building basic skills encouraging acquisitions of domain-specific knowledge stimulating in rewarding curiosity and exploration building motivation especially internal motivation encouraging confidence and a willingness to take risks focusing on mastery and self competition promoting supportable beliefs about creativity providing opportunities for choice and discovery developing self-management metacognitive skills teaching techniques and strategies for facilitating creative performance providing balanced you topic creativity and edge ocation policies some see the conventional system of schooling as stifling of creativity and attempt particularly in the preschool kindergarten and early school years to provide a creativity friendly rich imagination fostering environment for young children researchers have seen this as important because technology is advancing our society at an unprecedented rate and creative problem-solving will be needed to cope with these challenges as they arise in addition to helping with problem solving creativity also help students identify problems where others have failed to do so see the Waldorf School as an example of an education program that promotes creative thought promoting intrinsic motivation and problem-solving are two areas where educators can foster creativity in students students are more creative when they see a task as intrinsically motivating valued for its own sake to promote creative thinking educators need to identify what motivates their students and structure teaching around it providing students with a choice of activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks teaching students to solve problems that do not have well-defined answers as another way to foster their creativity this is accomplished by allowing students to explore problems and redefine them possibly drawing on knowledge that at first may seem unrelated to the problem in order to solve it in adults mentoring individuals as another way to foster their creative II however the benefits of mentoring creativity apply only to creative contributions considered great in a given field not too every day creative expression topic Scotland in the Scottish education system creativity as identified as a core skill set for learning life and work and as defined as a process which generates ideas that have value to the individual it involves looking at familiar things with a fresh eye examining problems with an open mind making connections learning from mistakes and using imagination to explore new possibilities one the need to develop a shared language and understanding of creativity and its role across every aspect of learning teaching and continuous improvement was identified as a necessary aim - and a set of four skills is used to allow educators to discuss and develop creativity skills across all subjects and sectors of education curiosity open-mindedness imagination and problem-solving three distinctions are made between creative learning when learners are using their creativity skills creative teaching when educators are using their creativity skills and creative change when creativity skills are applied to planning and improvement for Scotland's national creative learning plan five supports the development of creativity skills in all learners and of educators expertise in developing creativity skills a range of resources have been created to support and assess this six including a national review of creativity across learning by Her Majesty's Inspectorate for education seven topic United States creativity has also been identified as one of the key 21st century skills and as one of the four C's of 21st century learning by educational leaders and theorists in the United States topic list of academic journals addressing creativity you topic C also equals equals notes
