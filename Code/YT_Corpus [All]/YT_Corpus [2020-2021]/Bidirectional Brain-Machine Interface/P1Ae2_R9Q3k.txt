 artificial neural networks and/or connectionist systems are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains the neural network itself is not an algorithm but rather a framework for many different machine learning algorithms to work together and process complex data inputs such systems learn to perform tasks by considering examples generally without being programmed with any tasks specific rules for example in image recognition they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as cat or no cat and using the results to identify cats and other images they do this without any prior knowledge about cats for example that they have fur tails whiskers and cat-like faces instead they automatically generate identifying characteristics from the learning material that they process an an is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain each connection like the synapses in a biological brain can transmit a signal from one artificial neuron to another an artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it in common and implementations the signal at a connection between artificial neurons as a real number and the output of each artificial neuron as computed by some nonlinear function of the sum of its inputs the connections between artificial neurons are called edges artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that as learning proceeds the weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold typically artificial neurons are aggregated into layers different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs signals travel from the first layer the input layer to the last layer the output layer possibly after traversing the layers multiple times the original goal of the an approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would however over time attention moved to performing specific tasks leading to deviations from biology artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks including computer vision speech recognition machine translation social network filtering playing board and video games and medical diagnosis topic history Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts 1943 created a computational model for neural networks based on mathematics and algorithms called threshold logic this model paved the way for neural network research to split into two approaches one approach focused on biological processes in the brain while the other focused on the application of neural networks to artificial intelligence this work led to work on nerve networks and their link to finite automata topic hebbian learning [Music] in the late 1940s do Hebb created a learning hypothesis based on the mechanism of neural plasticity that became known as hebbian learning hebbian learning is unsupervised learning this evolved into models for long-term potentiation researchers started applying these ideas to computational models in 1948 with Turing's B type machines Farley and Clarke 1954 first used computational machines then called calculators to simulate a heavy and networked other neural network computational machines were created by Rochester Holland habit and Duda 1956 Rosenblatt 1958 created the perceptron an algorithm for pattern recognition with mathematical notation Rosenblatt described circuitry not in the basic perceptron such as the exclusive-or circuit that could not be processed by neural networks at the time in 1959 a biological model proposed by Nobel laureates Hubel and Wiesel was based on their discovery of two types of cells in the primary visual cortex simple cells and complex cells the first functional networks with many layers were published by Eva Namco and lapa in 1965 becoming the group method of data handling neural network research stagnated after machine learning research by Minsky and Papert 1969 who discovered two key issues with the computational machines that processed neural networks the first was that basic precept ron's were incapable of processing the exclusive-or circuit the second was that computers didn't have enough processing power to effectively handle the work required by large neural networks neural network research slowed until computers achieved far greater processing power much of artificial intelligence had focused on high-level symbolic models that are processed by using algorithms characterized for example by expert systems with knowledge embodied in if-then rules until in the late 1980s research expanded to low-level sub symbolic machine learning characterized by knowledge embodied in the parameters of a cognitive model topic backpropagation a key trigger for renewed interest in neural networks and learning was were BOCES 1975 back propagation algorithm that effectively solved the exclusive-or problem by making the training of multi-layer networks feasible and efficient back propagation distributed the error term back up through the layers by modifying the weights at each node in the mid-1980s parallel distributed processing became popular under the name connectionism rummel heart and McClelland 1986 described the use of connectionism to simulate neural processes support vector machines and other much simpler methods such as linear classifiers gradually overtook neural networks in machine learning popularity however using neural networks transformed some domains such as the prediction of protein structures in 1992 max pooling was introduced to help with least shift invariance and tolerance to deformation to aid in 3d object recognition in 2010 back propagation training through max pooling was accelerated by GPUs and shown to perform better than other pooling variants the vanishing gradient problem affects many layered feed-forward networks that used back propagation and also recurrent neural networks RN ends as errors propagate from layer to layer they shrink exponentially with the number of layers impeding the tuning of neuron weights that is based on those errors particularly affecting deep networks to overcome this problem Sh'ma doober adopted a multi-level hierarchy of networks 1992 pre-trained one level at a time by unsupervised learning and fine-tuned by back propagation Behnke 2003 relied only on the sign the gradient rprop on problems such as image reconstruction and face localization hinten at all 2006 proposed learning a high-level representation using successive layers of binary or real valued latent variables with a restricted Boltzmann machine to model each layer once sufficiently many layers have been learned the deep architecture may be used as a generative model by reproducing the data when sampling down the model an ancestral past from the top-level feature activations in 2012 egg and Dean created a network that learned to recognize higher-level concepts such as cats only from watching and labeled images taken from YouTube videos earlier challenges in training deep neural networks were successfully addressed with methods such as unsupervised pre-training while available computing power increased through the use of GPUs and distributed computing neural networks were deployed on a large scale particularly in image and visual recognition problems this became known as deep learning topic hardware-based designs [Music] computational devices were created in CMOS for both biophysical simulation and neuromorphic computing nano devices for very large-scale principal components analysis and convolution may create a new class of neural computing because they are fundamentally analog rather than digital even though the first implementations may use digital devices saracen and colleagues 2010 in schmidhuber x' group showed that despite the vanishing gradient problem GPUs make backpropagation feasible for many layered feed-forward neural networks topic contests between 2009 and 2012 recurrent neural networks and deep feed-forward neural networks developed in schmidhuber 'z research group won eight international competitions in pattern recognition and machine learning for example the bi-directional and multi-dimensional long short-term memory LS TM of graves at all won three competitions in connected handwriting recognition at the 2009 international conference on document analysis and recognition ICD AR without any prior knowledge about the three languages to be learned Saracen and colleagues won pattern recognition contests including the IJ c and n 2011 traffic sign recognition competition the is bi 2012 segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopy stacks challenge and others their neural networks were the first pattern recognizers to achieve human competitive or even superhuman performance on benchmarks such as traffic sign recognition IJ c and n 2012 or the m missed handwritten digits problem researchers demonstrated 2010 that deep neural networks interfaced to a hidden Markov model with context dependent states that define the neural network output layer can drastically reduce errors in large vocabulary speech recognition tasks such as voice search GPU based implementations of this approach one many pattern recognition contests including the IJ c and n 2011 traffic sign recognition competition the is bi 2012 segmentation of neuronal structures in em stacks challenge the imagenet competition and others deep highly nonlinear neural architectures similar to the neocon Natron and the standard architecture of vision inspired by simple and complex cells were pre trained by unsupervised methods by Hinton a team from his lab won a 2012 contest sponsored by Merck to design software to help find molecules that might identify new drugs topic convolutional networks as of 2011 the state of the art in deep learning feed-forward networks alternated between convolutional layers and max pooling layers topped by several fully are sparsely connected layers followed by a final classification layer learning is usually done without unsupervised pre training in the convolutional layer there are filters that are convolve dwith the input each filter is equivalent to a weights vector that has to be trained such supervised deep learning methods were the first to achieve human competitive performance on certain tasks artificial neural networks were able to guarantee shift invariance to deal with small and large natural objects in large cluttered scenes only when invariants extended beyond shift to all and learned concepts such as location type object class label scale lighting and others this was realized in developmental networks d-ends whose embodiments are aware what networks WWN 1 2008 through WWN 7 2013 topic models an artificial neural net network of simple elements called artificial neurons which receive input change their internal state activation according to that input and produce output depending on the input and activation an artificial neuron mimics the working of a biophysical neuron with inputs and outputs but is not a biological neuron model the network forms by connecting the output of certain neurons to the input of other neurons forming a directed weighted graph the weights as well as the functions that compute the activation can be modified by a process called learning which is governed by a learning rule topic components of an artificial neural network topic neurons a neuron with label J display style J receiving an input P j t display style p underscore JT from predecessor neurons consists of the following components an activation 8j t display style underscore JT the neurons state depending on a discrete time parameter possibly a threshold theta J display style theta underscore J which stays fixed and less changed by a learning function an activation function

underscore je T equals F underscore out underscore je t often the output function as simply the identity function an input neuron has no predecessor but serves as input interface for the whole network similarly an output neuron has no successor and thus serves as output interface of the whole network topic connections weights and biases the network consists of connections each connection transferring the output of a neuron I display style I to the input of a neuron J display style J in this sense I display style I is the predecessor of J display style J and J display style J is the successor of I display style I each connection is assigned a weight W i J display style W underscore I J sometimes a bias term is added to the total weighted sum of inputs to serve as a threshold to shift the activation function topic propagation function the propagation function computes the input P tea display style P underscore jt2 the neuron J display style J from the outputs Oh tea displaced ILO underscore i T of predecessor neurons and typically has the form P J tea equals Oh I tea w I J display style P underscore J T equals sum underscore IO underscore I T W underscore IJ when a bias value is added with the function the above form changes to the following P J tea equals I tea w J Plus w0 J display style P underscore J T equals sum underscore IO underscore I T W underscore IJ plus W underscore zero J where w0 J display style W underscore zero J is a bias topic learning rule the learning rule is a rule or an algorithm which modifies the parameters of the neural network in order for a given input to the network to produce a favorite output this learning process typically amounts to modifying the weights and thresholds of the variables within the network topic neural networks as functions neural network models can be viewed as simple mathematical models defining a function f X display style text style F X right arrow why or a distribution over X display style texts dialects or both X display style texts dialects and why display style text style why sometimes models are intimately associated with a particular learning rule a common use of the phrase and model is really the definition of a class of such functions where members of the class are obtained by varying parameters connection weights or specifics of the architecture such as the number of neurons are their connectivity mathematically a neurons network function f X display style text style F X is defined as a composition of other functions G I X display style text style G underscore I X that can further be decomposed into other functions this can be conveniently represented as a network structure with arrows depicting the dependencies between functions a widely used type of composition as the nonlinear weighted sum where F X equals K I W i g AI X display style text style F X equals K left some underscore I W underscore I G underscore I X right where k display style text style k commonly referred to is the activation function is some predefined function such as the hyperbolic tangent or sigmoid function or softmax function or rectifier function the important characteristic of the activation function is that it provides a smooth transition as input values change ie a small change in input produces a small change in output the following refers to a collection of functions G I display style text style G underscore I as a vector G equals G 1 G 2 G n display style text style G equals G underscore 1 G underscore 2 L dots G underscore n this figure depicts such a decomposition of f display style text style F with dependencies between variables indicated by arrows these can be interpreted in two ways the first view as the functional view the input X display style texts dialects is transformed into a three-dimensional vector eh display style text style age which is then transformed into a two-dimensional vector gee display style text style G which is finally transformed into f display style text style F this view is most commonly encountered in the context of optimization the second view as the probabilistic view the random variable f equals f gee display style text style F equals F G depends upon the random variable gee equals gee Aitch display style text style G equals G H which depends upon H equals X display style text style H equals H X which depends upon the random variable X display style text style X this view is most commonly encountered in the context of graphical models the two views are largely equivalent in either case for this particular architecture the components of individual layers are independent of each other eg the components of gee display style text style gee are independent of each other given their input H display style text style H this naturally enables a degree of parallelism in the implementation networks such as the previous one are commonly called feed-forward because they're graph as a directed acyclic graph networks with cycles are commonly called recurrent such networks are commonly depicted in the manner shown at the top of the figure where F display style text style F is shown as being dependent upon itself however an implied temporal dependence has not shown topic learning [Music] the possibility of learning has attracted the most interest in neural networks given a specific task to solve and a class of functions f display style text style F learning means using a set of observations to find f element of f display style text style F carat asterisk in F which solves the task in some optimal sense this entails defining a cost function C f display style text style see F right arrow math B are such that for the optimal solution f display style text style F carat asterisk see see f display style text style C F carat asterisk l-e QC f f meant of display style text style for all F in F ie no solution has a cost less than the cost of the optimal solution see mathematical optimization the cost function see display style text Styles see is an important concept in learning as it is a measure of how far away a particular solution is from an optimal solution to the problem to be solved learning algorithms searched through the solution space to find a function that has the smallest possible cost for applications where the solution is data dependent the cost must necessarily be a function of the observations otherwise the model would not relate to the data it is frequently defined as a statistic to which only approximations can be made as a simple example consider the problem of finding the model F display style text style laugh which minimizes C equals e f x - y - display style text style C equals e left F X Y carrot - right for data pairs X Y display style text style X Y drawn from some distribution D display style text styled math call D in practical situations we would only have and display style text style n samples from D display style text styled math call D and thus for the above example we would only minimize C caret equals 1 n I equals 1 and F X I minus y i to display style text style pad C equals frac 1 and some underscore I equals 1 carat and F X underscore I Y underscore I care it to thus the cost is minimized over a sample of the data rather than the entire distribution when an infinity display style text style and right arrow in 8th t some form of online machine learning must be used where the cost is reduced as each new example is seen while online machine learning is often used when D display style text styled math call D is fixed it is most useful in the case where the distribution changes slowly over time in neural network methods some form of online machine learning is frequently used for finite data sets topic choosing a cost function while it is possible to define an ad-hoc cost function frequently a particular cost function is used either because it has desirable properties such as convexity or because it arises naturally from a particular formulation of the problem eg in a probabilistic formulation the posterior probability of the model can be used as an inverse cost ultimately the cost function depends on the task topic backpropagation a DNN can be discriminative Lee trained with the standard back propagation algorithm back propagation as a method to calculate the gradient of the loss function produces the cost associated with a given state with respect to the weights in an an the basics of continuous back propagation were derived in the context of control theory by Kelley in 1960 and by Bryson in 1961 using principles of dynamic programming in 1962 Dreyfuss published a simpler derivation based only on the chain rule Bryson and ho described it as a multi-stage dynamic system optimization method in 1969 in 1970 Linna and ma finally published the general method for automatic differentiation ad of discrete connected networks of nested differentiable functions this corresponds to the modern version of back propagation which is efficient even when the networks are sparse in 1973 Dreyfuss used back propagation to adapt parameters of controllers in proportion to error gradients in 1974 were bose mentioned the possibility of applying this principle to artificial neural networks and in 1982 he applied Linna and maze ad method to neural networks in the way that is widely used today in 1986 Rummel Hart Hinton and Williams noted that this method can generate useful internal representations of incoming data in hidden layers of neural networks in 1993 one was the first to win an international pattern recognition contest through back propagation the weight updates of back propagation can be done via stochastic gradient descent using the following equation w I J tea plus one equals w I J tea - ada see w I J plus she tea display style W underscore IJ t plus one equals W underscore IJ T ADA frac partial C partial W underscore IJ plus XI T where ADA display style ADA is the learning rate see display style see is the cost loss function and she tea display style she tea a stochastic term the choice of the cost function depends on factors such as the learning type supervised unsupervised reinforcement etc and the activation function for example when performing supervised learning on a multi-class classification problem common choices for the activation function and cost function are the softmax function and cross-entropy function respectively the softmax function is defined as P J equals exp x j k exp x k display style p underscore J equals frac exp X underscore J some underscore K exp X underscore K where P J display style P underscore J represents the class probability output of the unit J display style J and X J display style X underscore J and x:k display style X underscore K represent the total input to units J display style J and K display style K of the same level respectively cross entropy is defined as C equals - J d J P J display style C equals sum underscore JD underscore J log P underscore J where d J display style D underscore J represents the target probability for output unit J display style je P display style P underscore J is the probability output for J display style Jay after applying the activation function these can be used to output object bounding boxes in the form of a binary mask they are also used for multi scale regression to increase localization precision DNN based regression can learn features that capture geometric information in addition to serving as a good classifier they remove the requirement to explicitly model parts and their relations this helps to broaden the variety of objects that can be learned the model consists of multiple layers each of which has a rectified linear unit as its activation function for nonlinear transformation some layers are convolutional while others are fully connected every convolutional layer has an additional max pooling the network is trained to minimize l2 error for predicting the mask ranging over the entire training set containing bounding boxes represented as masks alternatives to back propagation include extreme learning machines no prop networks training without backtracking weightless networks and non connectionist neural networks topic learning paradigms the three major learning paradigms each correspond to a particular learning task these are supervised learning unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning topic supervised learning supervised learning uses a set of example pairs X why X element of X why element of why display style XY X in X Y in Y and the aim is to find a function f X display style F X right arrow why in the allowed class of functions that matches the examples in other words we wish to infer the mapping implied by the data the cost function as related to the mismatch between our mapping and the data and it implicitly contains prior knowledge about the problem domain a commonly used cost as the mean squared error which tries to minimize the average squared error between the network's output f X display style FX and the target value why display style why the example pairs minimizing this cost using gradient descent for the class of neural networks called multi-layer perceptrons MLP produces the back propagation algorithm for training neural networks tasks that fall within the paradigm of supervised learning our pattern recognition also known as classification and regression also known as function approximation the supervised learning paradigm is also applicable to sequential data eg for handwriting speech and gesture recognition this can be thought of as learning with a teacher in the form of the function that provides continuous feedback on the quality of solutions obtained thus far topic unsupervised learning in unsupervised learning some data X display style texts dialects is given and the cost function to be minimized that can be any function of the data X display style texts dialects and the network's output f display style text style F the cost function as dependent on the task the model domain and any ax priori assumptions the implicit properties of the model its parameters and the observed variables as a trivial example consider the model f X calls display style text style FX equals ax where Oh display style text style a is a constant and the cost C equals e X - f X to display style text style C equals e xf x carrot 2 minimizing this cost produces a value of ah display style text style that is equal to the mean of the data the cost function can be much more complicated its form depends on the application for example in compression it could be related to the mutual information between X display style texts dialects X display style text style FX whereas in statistical modeling it could be related to the posterior probability of the model given the data note that in both of those examples those quantities would be maximized rather than minimized tasks that fall within the paradigm of unsupervised learning are in general estimation problems the applications include clustering the estimation of statistical distributions compression and filtering topic reinforcement learning in reinforcement learning data X display style text style ax are usually not given but generated by an agent's interactions with the environment at each point in time T display style text style T the agent performs an action Y T display style text style y underscore t and the environment generates an observation X T display style text style X underscore T and an instantaneous cost see t display style text style see underscore t according to some usually unknown dynamics the aim is to discover a policy for selecting actions that minimizes some measure of a long-term cost eg the expected cumulative cost the environment dynamics and the long-term cost for each policy are usually unknown but can be estimated more formally the environment is modeled as a Markov decision process MDP with state s 1 s and element of s display style text style s underscore one s underscore and in s and actions of one a M element of display style text style underscore one [Music] underscore m in a with the following probability distributions the instantaneous cost distribution p c t s t display style text style p c underscore t s

s underscore t a underscore t while a policy is defined as the conditional distribution over actions given the observations taken together the two then define a Markov chain MC the aim is to discover the policy ie the MC that minimizes the cost artificial neural networks are frequently used in reinforcement learning as part of the overall algorithm dynamic programming was coupled with artificial neural networks giving neuro dynamic programming by bertsekas and CC class and applied to multi-dimensional nonlinear problems such as those involved in vehicle routing Natural Resources Management or medicine because of the ability of artificial neural networks to mitigate losses of accuracy even when reducing the discretization grid density for numerically approximating the solution of the original control problems tasks that fall within the paradigm of reinforcement learning are control problems games and other sequential decision-making tasks you topic learning algorithms training and neural network model essentially means selecting one model from the set of allowed models or in a Bayesian framework determining a distribution over the set of allowed models that minimizes the cost numerous algorithms are available for training neural network models most of them can be viewed as a straightforward application of optimization theory and statistical estimation most employ some form of gradient descent using back propagation to compute the actual gradients this is done by simply taking the derivative of the cost function with respect to the network parameters and then changing those parameters in a gradient related direction back propagation training algorithms fall into three categories steepest descent with variable learning rate and momentum resilient back propagation quasi Newton Freud and Fletcher Goldfarb Shawano one-step secant Levin burg Marquardt and conjugate gradient Fletcher Reeves update Pollock rib ear update Pao Beale restart scaled conjugate gradient evolutionary methods gene expression programming simulated annealing expectation maximization nonparametric methods and particle swarm optimization are other methods for training neural networks you topic convergent recursive learning algorithm this is a learning method specially designed for cerebellar model articulation controller CMAC neural networks in 2004 a recursive least squares algorithm was introduced to train CMAC neural network online this algorithm can converge in one step and update all weights in one step with any new input data initially this algorithm had computational complexity of on3 based on QR decomposition this recursive learning algorithm was simplified to be oxygen mono nitride topic optimization you the optimization algorithm repeats a two-phase cycle propagation and weight update when an input vector is presented to the network it is propagated forward through the network layer by layer until it reaches the output layer the output of the network is then compared to the desired output using a loss function the resulting error value is calculated for each of the neurons in the output layer the error values are then propagated from the output back through the network until each neuron has an Associated error value that reflects its contribution to the original output back propagation uses these error values to calculate the gradient of the loss function in the second phase this gradient is fed to the optimization method which in turn uses it to update the weights in an attempt to minimize the loss function topic algorithm let display

above explicit formulas are required for the gradient of the function w/e f ehn w X why display style W map stoie f underscore n WX y where the function is e I equals - why to display style II why y equals YY carrot to the learning algorithm can be divided into two phases propagation and wait update topic phase 1 propagation each propagation involves the following steps propagation forward through the network to generate the output values calculation of the cost error term propagation of the output activations back through the network using the training pattern target to generate the deltas the difference between the targeted and actual output values of all output and hidden neurons topic phase two wait update for each wait the following steps must be followed the weights output Delta and input activation are multiplied to find the gradient of the weight a ratio percentage of the weights gradient is subtracted from the weight this ratio percentage influences the speed and quality of learning it is called the learning rate the greater the ratio the faster the neuron trains but the lower the ratio the more accurate the training is the sign of the gradient of a weight indicates whether the error varies directly with or inversely to the weight therefore the weight must be updated in the opposite direction descending the gradient learning is repeated on new batches until the network performs adequately topic pseudocode the following is pseudocode for a stochastic gradient descent algorithm for training a three layer network only one hidden layer initialize network weights often small random values do for each training example named X prediction equals neural net output network X forward pass actual equals teacher output X compute error prediction actual

satisfied return the network labeled backward pass can be implemented using the backpropagation algorithm which calculates the gradient of the error of the network regarding the networks modifiable weights topic extension you the choice of learning rate ADA text style Aitor is important since a high value can cause too strong a change causing the minimum to be missed while a too low learning rate slows the training unnecessarily optimizations such as quick prop are primarily aimed at speeding up error minimization other improvements mainly try to increase reliability topic adaptive learning rate in order to avoid oscillation inside the network such as alternating connection weights and to improve the rate of convergence refinements of this algorithm use an adaptive learning rate topic inertia by using a variable inertia term momentum alpha text style alpha the gradient and the last change can be weighted such that the weight adjustment additionally depends on the previous change if the momentum author text style alpha is equal to zero the change depends solely on the gradient while a value of one will only depend on the last change similar to a ball rolling down a mountain whose current speed is determined not only by the current slope of the mountain but also by its own inertia inertia can be added where Delta W IJ T plus one text style Delta W underscore IJ T

slope of the mountain first summoned as well as on the weight change from the previous point in time inertia second summoned with inertia the problems of getting stuck in steep ravines and flat plateaus are avoided since for example the gradient of the error function becomes very small in flat plateaus a plateau would immediately lead to a deceleration of the gradient descent this deceleration is delayed by the addition of the inertia term so that a flat plateau can be escaped more quickly topic modes of learning two modes of learning are available stochastic and batch in stochastic learning each input creates a weight adjustment in batch learning weights are adjusted based on a batch of inputs accumulating errors over the batch stochastic learning introduces noise into the gradient descent process using the local gradient calculated from one data point this reduces the chance of the network getting stuck in local minima however batch learning typically yields a faster more stable descent to a local minimum since each update is performed in the direction of the average error of the batch a common compromise choice as to use mini batches meaning small batches and with samples in each batch selected stochastically from the entire data set topic variants you topic group method of data handling the group method of data handling GmbH features fully automatic structural and parametric model optimization the note activation functions are koma Gaurav Gabor polynomials that permit additions and multiplications it used a deep feed-forward multi-layer perceptron with eight layers it is a supervised learning network that grows layer by layer where each layer is trained by regression analysis useless items are detected using a validation set and pruned through regularization the size and depth of the resulting network depends on the task topic convolutional neural networks a convolutional neural network CNN is a class of deep feed-forward networks composed of one or more convolutional layers with fully connected layers matching those in typical artificial neural networks on top it uses tied weights and pooling layers in particular max pooling is often structured via Fukushima's convolutional architecture this architecture allows cnn's to take advantage of the 2d structure of input data CN NS are suitable for processing visual and other two-dimensional data they have shown superior results in both image and speech applications they can be trained with standard back propagation CN NS are easier to train than other regular deep feed-forward neural networks and have many fewer parameters to estimate examples of applications in computer vision include deep dream and robot navigation a recent development has been that of capsule neural network caps net the idea behind which as to add structures called capsules to a C and N and to reuse output from several of those capsules to form more stable with respect to various perturbations representations for higher-order capsules topic long short-term memory long short-term memory LS TM networks rrn ends that avoid the vanishing gradient problem LS TM is normally augmented by recurrent gates called forget gates LS TM networks prevent back propagated errors from vanishing or exploding instead errors can flow backwards through unlimited numbers of virtual layers

hidden units it can be considered a composition of simple learning modules that make up each layer a dbn can be used to generative leap retrain a DNN by using the learned DBM weights as the initial DNN weights that propagation are other discriminative algorithms can then tune these weights this is particularly helpful when training data are limited because poorly initialized weights can significantly hinder model performance these pre trained weights are in a region of the weight space that is closer to the optimal weights than were they randomly chosen this allows for both improved modeling and faster convergence of the fine-tuning phase you topic large memory storage and retrieval neural networks large memory storage and retrieval neural networks L AM STAAR are fast deep learning neural networks of many layers that can use many filters simultaneously these filters may be nonlinear stochastic logic non stationary or even non analytical they are biologically motivated and learned continuously L AM STAAR neural network may serve as a dynamic neural network in spatial or time domains are both its speed is provided by hebbian link weights that integrate the various and usually different filters pre-processing functions into its many layers and to dynamically rank the significance of the various layers and functions relative to a given learning task this grossly imitates biological learning which integrates various pre-processors cochlea retina etc and Cortex's auditory visual etc and their various regions it's deep learning capability as further enhanced by using inhibition correlation and its ability to cope with incomplete data or lost neurons or layers even amidst a task it is fully transparent due to its link weights the link weights allow dynamic determination of innovation and redundancy and facilitate the ranking of layers of filters or of individual neurons relative to a task l am st AR has been applied to many domains including medical and financial predictions adaptive filtering of noisy speech in unknown noise still image recognition video image recognition software security and adaptive control of nonlinear systems L AM st AR had a much faster learning speed and somewhat lower error rate than a CNN based on real uu function filters and max pooling in 20 comparative studies these applications demonstrate delving into aspects of the data that are hidden from shallow learning networks and the human senses such as in the cases of predicting onset of sleep apnea events of an electrocardiogram of a foetus is recorded from skin surface electrodes placed on the mothers abdomen early in pregnancy of financial prediction or in blind filtering of noisy speech la MST AR was proposed in 1996 a US patent five million nine hundred twenty thousand eight hundred fifty two a and was further developed drop-in chordal F ski from 1997 to 2002 modified version known as L AM sta r2 was developed by Schneider and grop in 2008 you topic stacked de noising auto-encoders the auto-encoder idea is motivated by the concept of a good representation for example for a classifier a good representation can be defined as one that yields a better performing classifier an encoder as a deterministic mapping f Veda display style F underscore theta that transforms an input vector X into hidden representation y where theta equals w be display style theta equals bold symbol W be w display style bold symbol w is the weight matrix and B as an offset vector bias a decoder maps back the hidden representation Y to the reconstructed input Z via G theta display style G underscore theta the whole process of Auto encoding is to compare this reconstructed input to the original and try to minimize the error to make the reconstructed value as close as possible to the original in stacked denoising auto-encoders the partially corrupted output as cleaned de noised this idea was introduced in 2010 by Vincent a tall with a specific approach to good representation a good representation as one that can be obtained robustly from a corrupted input than that will be useful for recovering the corresponding clean input implicit in this definition are the following ideas the higher-level representations are relatively stable and robust to input corruption it is necessary to extract features that are useful for representation of the input distribution the algorithm starts by a stochastic mapping of X display style bold symbol X - X tilde display style tilde bold symbol X through Q D X tilde X display style Q underscore D tilde

theta of the first denoising auto-encoder is learned and used on corrupt the input corrupted input the second level can be trained once the stack dot o encoder is trained its output can be used as the input to a supervised learning algorithm such as support vector machine classifier or a multi-class logistic regression you topic deep stacking networks a deep stacking network DSN deep convex network is based on a hierarchy of blocks of simplified neural network modules it was introduced in 2011 by Danny and dong it formulates the learning is a convex optimization problem with a closed form solution emphasizing the mechanism similarity to stacked generalization each DSN block is a simple module that is easy to train by itself in a supervised fashion without back propagation for the entire blocks each block consists of a simplified multi-layer perceptron MLP with a single hidden layer the hidden layer age has logistic sigmoid units and the output layer has linear units connections between these layers are represented by weight matrix u input to hidden layer connections have weight matrix W target vectors T form the columns of matrix T and the input data vectors X form the columns of matrix X the matrix of hidden units is H equals Sigma W T X display style bold symbol H equals Sigma bold symbol W carat T bold symbol ax modules are trained in order so lower layer weights w are known at each stage the function performs the element-wise logistic sigmoid operation each block estimates the same final label class Y and its estimate is concatenated with original input X to form the expanded input for the next block thus the input to the first block contains the original data only while downstream blocks input adds the output of preceding blocks then learning the upper layer weight matrix you given other weights in the network can be formulated as a convex optimization problem min u t f u t-h - t f2 display style min underscore u carrot TF equals

feature representation the structure of the hierarchy of this kind of architecture makes parallel learning straightforward as a batch mode optimization problem in purely discriminative tasks DSM's perform better than conventional DB ends you topic 10 sir deep stacking networks this architecture is a dsm extension it offers two important improvements it uses higher order information from covariant statistics and it transforms the non convex problem of a lower layer to a convex sub problem of an upper layer tds ends use covariant statistics in a bilinear mapping from each of two distinct sets of hidden units in the same layer to predictions via third order tensor while parallelization and scalability are not considered seriously in conventional DNS all learning for D s NS and TD s ends is done in batch mode to allow parallelization parallelization allows scaling the design to larger deeper architectures and datasets the basic architecture is suitable for diverse tasks such as classification and regression you topic spike and slab our BMS the need for deep learning with real valued inputs as in Gaussian restricted Boltzmann machines led to the spike and slab RBM SSR BM which models continuous valued inputs with strictly binary latent variables similar to basic are BMS and its variants a spike and slab RB m as a bipartite graph while like gr BMS the visible units input are real valued the difference as in the hidden layer where each hidden unit has a binary spike variable and a real valued slab variable a spike is a discrete probability mass at 0 while a slab as a density over continuous domain their mixture forms a prior an extension of SS RBM called micro SS RB m provides extra modelling capacity using additional terms in the energy function one of these terms enables the model to form a conditional distribution of the spike variables by marginalizing out the slab variables given an observation topic compound hierarchical deep models compound hierarchical deep models composed deep networks with nonparametric Bayesian models features can be learned using deep architectures such as DBMS DBMS deep autoencoders convolutional variants SSR BMS deep coding networks DB ends with sparse feature learning RM ends conditional DB ends de noising autoencoders this provides a better representation allowing faster learning and more accurate classification with high dimensional data however these architectures are poor at learning novel classes with few examples because all network units are involved in representing the input a distributed representation and must be adjusted together high degree of freedom limiting the degree of freedom reduces the number of parameters to learn facilitating learning of new classes from few examples hierarchical Bayesian HB models allow learning from few examples for example for computer vision statistics and cognitive science compound HD architectures aim to integrate characteristics of both HB and deep networks the compound HDB DBM architecture as a hierarchical dear ashley process HDPE as a hierarchical model incorporated with DBM architecture it is a full generative model

topic deep predictive coding networks a deep predictive coding Network DPC n is a predictive coding scheme that uses top-down information to empirically adjust the priors needed for a bottom-up inference procedure by means of a deep locally connected generative model this works by extracting sparse features from time varying observations using a linear dynamical model then a pooling strategy is used to learn invariant feature representations these units composed to form a deep architecture and are trained by greedy layer wise unsupervised learning the layers constitute a kind of Markov chain such that the states at any layer depend only on the preceding and succeeding layers DPC NS predict the representation of the layer by using a top-down approach using the information in upper layer and temporal dependencies from previous States DPC NS can be extended to form a convolutional Network topic networks with separate memory structures integrating external memory with artificial neural networks dates to early research in distributed representations and kohonen self organizing Maps for example in sparse distributed memory or hierarchical temporal memory the patterns encoded by neural networks are used as addresses for content addressable memory with neurons essentially serving as address encoders and decoders however the early controllers of such memories were not differentiable topic LS TM related differentiable memory structures apart from long short-term memory LS TM other approaches also added differentiable memory to recurrent functions for example differentiable push and pop actions for alternative memory networks called neural stack machines memory networks where the control networks external differentiable storage is in the fast waits of another Network LST em forget gates self-referential RN ends with special output units for addressing and rapidly manipulating the RN end zone weights in differentiable fashion internal storage learning to transduce with unbounded memory topic neural Turing machines neural turing machines couple LS TM networks to external memory resources with which they can interact by attentional processes the combined system is analogous to a Turing machine but is differentiable and dent allowing it to be efficiently trained by gradient descent preliminary results demonstrate that neural Turing machines can infer simple algorithms such as copying sorting and associative recall from input and output examples differentiable neural computers DN C are an n TM extension they outperformed neural Turing machines long short-term memory systems and memory networks on sequence processing tasks you topic semantic hashing approaches that represent previous experiences directly and use a similar experience to form a local model are often called nearest neighbor or K nearest neighbors methods deep learning is useful in semantic hashing where a deep graphical model the word-count vectors obtained from a large set of documents documents are mapped to memory addresses in such a way that semantically similar documents are located at nearby addresses documents similar to a query document can then be found by accessing all the addresses that differ by only a few bits from the address of the query document unlike sparse distributed memory that operates on 1,000 bit addresses semantic hashing works on 32 or 64-bit addresses found in a conventional computer architecture topic memory networks memory networks are another extension to neural networks incorporating long-term memory the long-term memory can be read and written to with the goal of using it for prediction these models have been applied in the context of question answering QA where the long-term memory effectively acts as a dynamic knowledge base and the output as a textual response a team of electrical and computer engineers from UCLA Samwell E School of Engineering has created a physical artificial neural network that can analyze large volumes of data and identify objects at the actual speed of light topic pointer networks deep neural networks can be potentially improved by deepening in parameter reduction while maintaining Train ability while training extremely deep eg 1 million layers neural networks might not be practical CPU like architectures such as pointer networks and neural random-access machines overcome this limitation by using external random access memory and other components that typically belong to a computer architecture such as registers Ballu and pointers such systems operate on probability distribution vectors stored in memory cells and registers thus the model is fully differentiable and trains and end the key characteristic of these models is that their depth the size of their short-term memory and the number of parameters can be altered independently unlike models like LST M whose number of parameters grows quadratically with memory size topic encoder/decoder networks encoder/decoder frameworks are based on neural networks that map highly-structured input to highly structured output the approach arose in the context of machine translation where the input and output are written sentences in two natural languages in that work an LST M R and N or C and n was used as an encoder to summarize a source sentence and the summary was decoded using a conditional R and N language model to produce the translation these systems share building blocks gated RN ends and cnn's and train detention mechanisms topic multi-layer Colonel machine multi-layer Colonel

more straightforward way to use Colonel machines for deep learning was developed for spoken language understanding the main idea is to use a kernel machine to approximate a shallow neural net with an infinite number of hidden units then use stacking to splice the output of the kernel machine and the raw input in building the next higher level of the kernel machine the number of levels in the deep convex network is a hyper parameter of the overall system to be determined by cross-validation topic neural architecture search neural architecture search nas uses machine learning to automate the design of artificial neural networks various approaches to nas have designed networks that compare well with hand designed systems the basic search algorithm is to propose a candidate model evaluate it against a data set and use the results as feedback to teach the NAS Network topic use using artificial neural networks requires an understanding of their characteristics choice of model this depends on the data representation in the application overly complex models slow learning learning algorithm numerous trade-offs exist between learning algorithms almost any algorithm will work well with the correct hyper parameters for training on a particular data set however selecting and tuning an algorithm for training on unseen data requires significant experimentation robustness if the model cost function and learning algorithm are selected appropriately the resulting an can become robust and capabilities fall within the following broad categories function approximation or regression analysis including time series prediction Fitness approximation and modeling classification including pattern and sequence recognition novelty detection and sequential decision-making data processing including filtering clustering blind source separation and compression robotics including directing manipulators and prosthesis control including computer numerical control topic applications because of their ability to reproduce and model nonlinear processes artificial neural networks have found many applications in a wide range of disciplines application areas include system identification and control vehicle control trajectory prediction process control natural resource management quantum chemistry general game-playing pattern recognition radar systems face identification signal classification 3d reconstruction object recognition and more sequence recognition gesture speech handwritten and printed text recognition medical diagnosis finance eg automated trading systems data mining visualization machine translation social network filtering and email spam filtering artificial neural networks have been used to diagnose cancers including lung cancer prostate cancer colorectal cancer and to distinguish highly invasive cancer cell lines from less invasive lines using only cell shape information artificial neural networks have been used to accelerate reliability analysis of infrastructures subject to natural disasters and to predict foundation settlements artificial neural networks have also been used for building black box models in Geoscience hydrology ocean modelling and coastal engineering and geomorphology artificial neural networks have been employed with some success also in cybersecurity with the objective to discriminate between legitimate activities and malicious ones for example machine learning has been used for classifying Android malware for identifying domains belonging to red actors and for detecting URLs posing a security risk research is being carried out also on end systems designed for penetration testing for detecting botnets credit cards frauds network intrusions and more in general potentially infected machines you topic types of models many types of models are used defined at different levels of abstraction and modeling different aspects of neural systems they range from models of the short-term behavior of individual neurons models of how the dynamics of neural circuitry arise from interactions between individual neurons and finally to models of how behavior can arise from abstract neural modules that represent complete subsystems these include models of the long-term and short-term plasticity of neural systems and their relations to learning and memory from the individual neuron to the system level topic theoretical properties you topic computational power the multi-layer perceptron as a universal function approximator as proven by the universal approximation theorem however the proof is not constructive regarding the number of neurons required the network topology the weights and the learning parameters a specific recurrent architecture with rational valued weights as opposed to full precision real number valued weights has the full power of a universal Turing machine using a finite number of neurons and standard linear connections further the use of the irrational values for weights results in a machine with super Turing power topic capacity models capacity property roughly corresponds to their ability to model any given function it is related to the amount of information that can be stored in the network and to the notion of complexity topic convergence models may not consistently converge on a single solution firstly because many local minima may exist depending on the cost function and the model secondly the optimization method used might not guarantee to converge when it begins far from any local minimum thirdly for sufficiently large data or parameters some methods become impractical however for CMAC neural network a recursive least squares algorithm was introduced to Train it and this algorithm can be guaranteed to converge in one step topic generalization and statistics applications whose goal is to create a system that generalizes well to unseen examples face the possibility of overtraining this arises in convoluted or over specified systems when the capacity of the network significantly exceeds the needed free parameters two approaches address overtraining the first is to use cross-validation and similar techniques to check for the presence of overtraining and optimally select hyper parameters to minimize the generalization error the second is to use some form of regularization this concept emerges in a probabilistic Bayesian framework where regularization can be performed by selecting a larger prior probability over simpler models but also in statistical learning theory where the goal is to minimize over two quantities the empirical risk and the structural risk which roughly corresponds to the error over the training set and the predicted error in unseen data due to overfitting supervised neural networks that use a mean squared error MSE cost function can use formal statistical methods to determine the confidence of the trained model the MSE on a validation set can be used as an estimate for variance this value can then be used to calculate the confidence interval of the output of the network assuming a normal distribution a confidence analysis made this way is statistically valid as long as the output probability distribution stays the same and the network is not modified by assigning a softmax activation function a generalization of the logistic function on the output layer of the neural network or a softmax component in a component based neural network for categorical target variables the outputs can be interpreted as posterior probabilities this is very useful in classification as it gives a certainty measure on classifications the softmax activation function as equals e X I J equals 1c e X J display style why underscore I equals frac II care 't X underscore I sum underscore J equals 1 carat see II carat X underscore J topic criticism you topic training issues a common criticism of neural networks particularly in robotics is that they require too much training for real-world operation potential solutions include randomly shuffling training examples by using a numerical optimization algorithm that does not take two large steps when changing the network connections following an example and by grouping examples in so called mini batches improving the training efficiency and convergence capability has always been an ongoing research area for neural network for example by introducing a recursive least squares algorithm for CMAC neural network the training process only takes one step to converge topic theoretical issues a fundamental objection is that they do not reflect how real neurons function backpropagation as a critical part of most artificial neural networks although no such mechanism exists in biological neural networks how information is coded by real neurons as not known sensor neurons fire action potentials more frequently with sensor activation and muscle cells pull more strongly when their Associated motor neurons receive action potentials more frequently other than the case of relaying information from a sensor neuron to a motor neuron almost nothing of the principles of how information is handled by biological neural networks as known this is a subject of active research in neural coding the motivation behind artificial neural networks as not necessarily to strictly replicate neural function but to use biological neural networks as an inspiration a central claim of artificial neural networks as therefore that it embodies some new and powerful general principle for processing information unfortunately these general principles are ill-defined it is often claimed that they are emergent from the network itself this allows simple statistical Association the basic function of artificial neural networks to be described as learning or recognition Alexander doodly commented that as a result artificial neural networks have a something-for-nothing quality one that imparts a peculiar aura of laziness and a distinct lack of curiosity about just how good these computing systems are no human hand or mind intervenes solutions are found as if by magic and no one it's beam's has learned anything biological brains use both shallow and deep circuits as reported by brain anatomy displaying a wide variety of invariance wang argued that the brain self wires largely according to signal statistics and therefore a serial cascade cannot catch all major statistical dependencies topic Hardware is shoes large and effective neural networks require considerable computing resources while the brain has Hardware tailored to the task of processing signals through a graph of neurons simulating even a simplified neuron on von Neumann architecture may compel a neural network designer to fill many millions of database rows for its connections which can consume vast amounts of memory and storage furthermore the designer often needs to transmit signals through many of these connections and their associated neurons which must often be matched with enormous CPU processing power and time Sh'ma doober notes that the resurgence of neural networks in the 21st century is largely attributable to advances in hardware from 1991 to 2015 computing power especially as delivered by GP GPUs on GPUs has increased around the million fold making the standard back propagation algorithm feasible for training networks that are several layers deeper than before the use of accelerators such as FPGAs and GPUs can reduce training times from months to days neuromorphic engineering addresses the hardware difficulty directly by constructing non von neumann chips to directly implement neural networks in circuitry another chip optimized for neural network processing is called a tensor processing unit or TPU topic practical counter examples to criticisms arguments against dude nice position are that neural networks have been successfully used to solve many complex and diverse tasks ranging from autonomously flying aircraft to detecting credit-card fraud to mastering the game of Go technology writer Roger Bridgman commented neural networks for instance are in the dock not only because they have been hyped to high heaven what hasn't but also because you could create a successful net without understanding how it worked the bunch of numbers that captures its behavior would in all probability be an opaque unreadable table valueless as a scientific resource in spite of his emphatic declaration that science as not technology dudeney seems here to pillory neural nets as bad science when most of those devising them are just trying to be good engineers an unreadable table that a useful machine could read would still be well worth having although it is true that analyzing what has been learned by an artificial neural network is difficult it is much easier to do so than to analyze what has been learned by a biological neural network furthermore researchers involved in exploring learning algorithms for neural networks are gradually uncovering general principles that allow a learning machine to be successful for example local versus non-local learning and shallow versus deep architecture topic hybrid approaches advocates of hybrid models combining neural networks and symbolic approaches claim that such a mixture can better capture the mechanisms of the human mind topic types artificial neural networks have many variations the simplest static types have one or more static components including number of units number of layers unit weights and topology dynamic types allow one or more of these to change during the learning process the latter are much more complicated but can shorten learning periods and produce better results some types allow require learning to be supervised by the operator while others operate independently some types operate purely in hardware while others are purely software and run on general-purpose computers topic gallery equals equals see also
