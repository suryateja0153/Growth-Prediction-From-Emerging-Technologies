introduce yourself please thank you shelley um carmen gilman buenas noches i am the principal of milwaukee high school in milwaukee academy of the arts in the north clackamas school district i was born in los angeles but moved to mexico and then came back when i was nine so as an eld student even though we didn't get services back then but just have a lot of experience of being pushed out of schools and um you know loving education until i came here and just felt really pushed out so started college later in life and it's just been my passion to do this work and help kids and families be successful and to help them navigate the system because the power of education has completely transformed transforms my life and the life of my children um and their children so i'm very excited about tonight um forgot to say that my pronouns are she her and aya and just excited to be in this work with folks and see how we can best support our our students particularly our eld students who we know are struggling in this time of being in cdl thank you carmen parla thank you hi i'm perla rodriguez uh i'm a first generation chicana born and raised in oregon native oregonian my parents are both from mexico my mom's from state of jalisco and my dad is from the state of sakatecas um i'm also very happy to be here mostly because i feel very much um very much like a learner these days and these weeks and these months and i i you know i'm struggling in a lot of ways as an educational leader i'm a principal of a pre-kinder through sixth grade dual language school in the forest grove school district and i'm i'm struggling and i feel like i'm i'm a sponge right now i'm really trying to pick up ideas and strategies and articles and books and anything that people can suggest to share to for all of us to kind of get through this stage that we're in and you know i have ideas i have ideas that i'm you know excited to share with folks today and really just happy for an opportunity to kind of verbalize and process out loud some of the stuff that's floating around in my head so thank you thank you so much carla thank you so much to all of our panelists today and i know that we have uh one more panelist who's going to be joining us a little bit later this evening she's actually here she's excellent so do you want to go next time and i think we unmuted her let me look i thought i did [Music] okay there we go i think she's now unmuted that's why i wasn't speaking because i was muted so uh i'm mina gomez i am currently the director of college and career readiness for the western wilsonville school district and i'm also the vice chair for the school board for gresham bar law school district um and i'm the chair for a program hispano which it's a nonprofit that provides services sustainability services and empowerment services to um to the latino community and i've been in education for 18 years i don't regret a single one this has been the toughest because it was the first time that i didn't get to greet students on the first day of school and that is one of the best days of the school year and um and it's been tough in different ways um i'm also first generation uh chicana like pedla like pedola and um my family's from michoacan i grew up very brown and proud i grew up in los angeles and uh that pride that cultural pride it was uh was very very obvious in my family and i grew up thinking that i could do anything and i could be anything i didn't know that my community was seen through a deficit deficit lens from others until i moved to oregon um and it wasn't until i was in high school student that um that i that i felt what racism felt like and that i felt what doubt felt like um and that's why i went into education because i didn't want students to continue experiencing that um i didn't i wanted to i want to disrupt that because unfortunately 20 some years later my students still tell me they experienced that so anything that i can do to disrupt that is what keeps me going and that's why i wear so many hats um because if we don't do it who is and we're not going to be waiting around our kids are not going to be waiting around um the other thing that keeps me going is knowing that so many uh people are in this in this struggle so many people before me um have been amazing mentors um and they've been able to do it so of course i can and having that support system um that i can go to when i do need to cry is also what keeps me going and it's a great support so i'm glad to be here today thank you this is mike thank you maida and uh for all of our colleagues here on this call uh one more reminder that yes we are recording today so thank you so much and if you would like to rename yourself or add your pronouns you are certainly invited to do so i wanted to just take a moment to point out how our panelists and our guests here today have identified and i will model that one more time for you i'm shelley reggioni in north clackamas i am a biracial vietnamese white educator who was born and raised in oregon in a bilingual home home that had seven generations of oregonians and first generation immigrants and raised in a time where elb services like carmen had mentioned didn't exist i'm a little bit older than kennywow but raised in a time where i could fully recognize some of the things that our colleagues have talked about in terms of the intersectionality of race language and culture and these conversations are really important for us to think about of how we personally identify and how we show up that's how our communities perceive us and it's really important for each of us to have that metacognition and think about how we show up for others and what it is that brings us to this place of education and today our theme our our purpose is that we are creating conditions for community and partnership within our latinx community in schools and we're here today to learn from each other to learn strategies and to raise our own critical consciousness to begin to examine the policies and practices in our schools that can open doors for our latinx communities to thrive in a time of cdl i i love how you said maida standing on the shoulders of the mentors before you and and that's our calling that's who we are today we are at a place of leadership for each one of us regardless of the seat you sit in the organization where you work you are in a place to allow others to stand on your shoulders where you're creating the conditions to improve education and tonight our focus being specifically on our latinx community so thank you each person for being here this evening i wanted to start us out with a native land acknowledgement many people in oregon are beginning to recognize the value of doing so and i wanted to start and model that for us here tonight we acknowledge the land on which we are meeting today in what is now called the state of oregon rest the traditional and indigenous lands and village sites of the native people representing over 30 different tribes and whose descendants now make up the burns paiute confederated tribes of the cous lower umpqua and sayusala confederated tribes of the grand ronde confederated tribes of the silets confederated tribes of the umatilla confederated tribes of warm springs cow creek band of umpqua coquille and calamus we take this opportunity to offer gratitude for the ability to learn work and be a community on this land and we offer thanks to the original caretakers of this region we recognize the historic policies of colonization that have led to genocide relocation assimilation and language genocide that have affected indigenous and native families both past and present and that will affect those in the future we honor their resilience and the revitalization of our indigenous and native communities and we pay our respects to the elders both past and present who have been the stewards of this land throughout generations thank you to begin us off this evening in this conversation with colleagues i wanted to encourage each of you that this is our time to learn from one another and while we're going to be having a conversation with these amazing women who are on our panel this evening as we progress through out this afternoon there will be a time where i will open up the chat and then we can hear from you and hear the questions that you may have for our panelists i wanted to thank our panelists one more time for the vulnerability that they're coming with tonight we have members who have signed up for this webinar who stretch all the way from the south coast of oregon to the far northeast corner of oregon we have some colleagues joining us from california and from washington so we represent multiple places all over this uh region and thank you for being here this is our struggle together and we're doing this transparently and with vulnerability and humility in front of you so thank you for joining our conversation as we just as leaders together as colleagues explore how we can remove barriers for our latinx communities especially during this time of a political divide within our nation and also in a time of cdl when we are not fully connected to our communities so i'll open it up by asking our panelists what what is challenging for you right now what are some things that have served as barriers for you either as a leader in reaching your latinx community specifically or for our latinx communities and connecting with schools olga would you like to start on that one i can start yeah thank you um so for me and i work for the hillsboro school district uh what has been challenging is that um the it's the the limitations that we have had with meeting families face to face meeting families at their level uh you know we as a system have created resources for students but have been limited with how much we are able to provide to support families for example with technology so we are meeting with parents on a very regular basis now but it took us a long time to help them understand how to access the chromebooks for that their children were using to access google meets or zoom to engage in the meetings and so that is still a challenge that um you know i am encountering myself with my family liaisons are asking me can we buy laptops or chromebooks for parents they are asking parents are asking because they feel bad some of them feel bad uh taking them from their students when they're doing homework um even in into the evening some some of the students are doing things and they need their their chromebooks they need so sometimes um they are engaging in meetings using their cell phones and um because they're on cell phones sometimes they can't access the powerpoints or the presentations well or they can mute or unmute when they need to do that so that that is one of the uh challenges that i'm i'm facing is how to navigate um the resources and and the systems to be able to provide parents with those resources the good thing is that i have seen a huge increase in parent participation it's interesting despite the challenges i have seen at every meeting we have more than 50 60 parents attend at one time whereas when we were organizing meetings in person it was you know smaller 30 up to 30 maybe 40 parents and we were excited and now it's like they're joining using their cell phones their tablets whatever um opportunity they have to join they're joining some of them are cooking and you know and cleaning the house as they are talking and listening to presentations and helping their children with with homework and things like that and it's just beautiful to see that level of interest and engagement and i just so much want to be able to to meet them have way and give them the technology that they need so they don't have that you know that challenge of having to take the the technology from their children thank you i think technology has been one of those challenges for many of us for all of our students but specifically for a latinx community like you mentioned another piece to that would be the power differential so before um for the parents having to take um the students now have a higher level of understanding of the technology and that with it brings the power um to power over parents i guess i would say and so when you're talking about getting laptops for the parents it actually would help not only to decrease the isolation of some of our parents that otherwise don't have connections with other adults but also if they learn that technology it would also allow them to have a more of a level playing field and be able to connect with teachers and all those other pieces thank you do you want to go ahead and then carmen and then we'll have maida sure so um the question is something i am struggling with and for me i think i would i would narrow it down to my greatest struggle being having to really conceptualize what my role is right now as a building principle it's not the it's not the actual work itself it's not learning new things it's it's that my work my job as i know it is completely different than what it's been in any other year and it feels very much like i'm learning how to do this this work that i care so so deeply about and wanting to resist just going to my playbook you know i've i've done this i've done this for a whole lot of years and i'm actually in my pre-pandemic life pretty good at this job and so i find myself still wanting to say it's easy okay let me go to last year's folder last year's file to strategies when i was a teacher none of that serves me right now and so it's in sometimes it's really exciting for me but i also am very aware that i don't have 27 tiles looking at me every for hours really exp i have the luxury of of just um time or be having the ability to control my schedule and to really embrace this as an opportunity and and i'm very aware that the people that i'm leading have none of that right now and so it's even hard even framing a new idea or strategy i have to think about how do i say hey i have an idea because i if i were teaching right now i think i would say i don't need a new idea i don't need you to be figuring out cool apps right now but that's where i'm really stuck is i i feel often many days like i'm not sure what to focus right now on and so i'm i'm spending a lot of time asking teachers how can i help what what can i do for you right now what what is needed or doing a lot of the tasks that i just know there is nobody else to do uh whenever whenever we're done with this meeting today i have two hot spots that i'm driving and dropping off with families to help log them on and it feels um feels like i'm like i'm never doing the most important thing that i should be doing at any given moment but i can't ever really articulate what i think the most important thing is you mentioned before um in one of our conversations how is that different within like you have a dual language program school and you also have a large concentration of latino families and there's different things that you've named um that you are actually doing that have that positive impact and bring families in and help them get connected to that technology what are some of those yeah i mean we are doing a lot of outreach um at our youngest grades pre-kinder kinder and first we are doing weekly or bi-weekly curriculum drops at homes and it's very structured families know we have a system where it's you know we'll pick up work from here at that level we just cannot rely on the computer interface for for our youngest kid we need to still work on things like like fine motor development students need to cut and they need to trace and they need to write and color so we are doing weekly we will go and drop off materials and pick them up we want learning to still be have dimensions to it so we're we're you know we're dropping off materials for kids to start planting something so we can do science units to watch it grow and it's definitely not something that our district expects us to do but we know that that's what our families need we're also modeling a ridiculous amount of humility and our families are in our homes too and so we're not hiding anything we're saying like sorry that's my son he's blah blah blah what are we gonna do we're also trying to continue to do the things that we know our families like culturally we you know when we were celebrating milestones uh my my son dj's so he came into the cafeteria we were all socially distancing we would let families like send in songs that they wanted to hear and we're saying you better you know we were live on facebook on our school facebook saying everyone you need to be out of your seats we're sitting too much and our mascot was dancing cumbias and that's still very cultural for us to take that mental break and to share and you know fun times together but yeah those are just some things that um i can think of off the top of my head that was amazing and you mentioned that live on facebook as a way to connect with folks and and the need for each of us to think about what is the preferred path of communication for our families number one in the language they prefer number two in a communication mode they prefer and a bi-directional communication so there's this exchange it's not just a one-way coming from the school but an invitation to participate at carmen earlier uh today you were talking about the use of live facebook as well how are you engaging with our latinx community well i do want to start out by saying i think we have a really powerful team that does a lot of outreach our engagement specialist the district family liaison and our instructional assistants um and they created a facebook in spanish and so tonight will be my first live facebook event which i'm excited about and a little nervous because i'm learning too but you know i you know the things that i'm noticing with um our latinx families is that we are very you know we like to get to we're relational and we bring food and my families bring food and we're relational and it's very you know we don't have to have the big power points it's all about um talking with one another and just being in each other's presence and that's been really difficult um since we can't do that but i'm excited about the live facebook event because one of the things that we're recognizing is that there's so many emails going out by so many different people that it's just overwhelming for our students and our families and a lot of our families they don't read their emails um they they the facebook is an easy one so i think that that's going to be an event that we're going to do regularly and i'm really excited to have that experience with them um i'm noticing just some things for our students that are really difficult and that is that you know a lot of our families are also essential workers and the students are also working so some of our students are working to support themselves and they're working 30 to 40 hours and so in some of these businesses even though there's laws right that when kids are in school they don't work past a certain time and some of our kids work until two o'clock in the morning um but but you get caught in the middle because it's also that's how they're gonna survive right like that's how they can help the family or they can pay their bills and so balancing all of that with also for a lot of them not knowing how to access the technology so it's not enough that they have a chromebook right like how do they navigate that chromebook how do they upload pictures how do they scan documents how do they you know move around in that space and looking at what kinds of videos are translated and all of that and what is it and so we saw a gap so us principals actually got together today and we're going to create our own videos we're going to take what are the videos that are critical that we can use district-wide rather than each building doing something but how of us at the secondary level um and even at the pro you know at a younger ages if we create videos that are that can be district-wide in many different languages so we're going to do that together as a team we don't have time to waste um recognizing when there's gaps like right like i think and so i think that's really important is how can we share with one another just like we are right now in um instead of reinventing the wheel so i i am concerned um it's shifted even what we're doing we have professional development yesterday morning and it was around supporting our eld students and special ed students with some particular strategies that folks could use um that are just really good strategies and good ways of teaching for all of our kids and we know if our latinx students are successful they're all successful so thank you carmen do you want to go next maya oh you muted again see if i can find it okay thank you i'm gonna start taking your personal care inside i know i meet allah i mean every challenge that has been mentioned i'm facing as well and um i think the the personal challenge for me right now has been the feeling of powerlessness because um i see the need i see that something needs to be done but not being able to is such it's an awful feeling i feel powerless and i've shared before with friends that since this started there hasn't been a single night that i've been able to sleep through the night not waking up thinking about what's going on thinking about the needs that haven't been addressed and what consequences that's gonna have for our students for our families um in in the near future so that's been one of the biggest challenges for me and also that when something is mentioned when something is pointed out uh that you know if a school or school district isn't being culturally responsive and that's and i point that out all of a sudden it becomes my job yeah and not and i don't mind the work i don't because i know i know what i'm doing and i know it needs to be done but there are only so many hours in the day so how how how do i build capacity so that it's not always me right how do i build capacity so that i'm not the only one pointing things out and add more to my workload right like i it shouldn't just be a small group of us pointing out these inequities or pointing out you know the needs and when we're not being culturally responsive to our to our families and in some instances even being offensive because who are we to speak for our families and who are we to say these are the needs and this is how we need to teach them to do things right so how do we empower our families how do we how do we give them that space and i'm feeling like i don't have that space because when this when the pandemic started i thought it would be such an opportunity for innovation to disrupt uh an education system that has not been working for our communities for our bipartisan communities not just our next communities so i thought this is such a good opportunity to disrupt this system that hasn't been working and that we've all known isn't working and haven't been able to transform it and there hasn't been time for that like i don't know about you all but i'm so busy that there isn't any time like to just sit down and reflect and think of how to make things better how to change things it's like it's so reactive everything is so reactive um that that opportunity that that i thought was there or is there i haven't been able to take advantage of it so the connection get out of it we have something better sorry yeah no i was right when you were saying maida the decisions that are being made in each of our schools and school districts are coming very quickly and what i um found often times was that raising my hand going what about the english language learners what about the immigrant well we're figuring out the system first and then we'll get there and that's the wrong way the wrong approach right because we know that they are part of our system so every time we speak about special ed students or we speak about any student we need to have at the forefront the students that we know that from march to the end of that school year last year we were failing and that's we need to put first in um when we we are you know constructing um these new paths for education so from each of you we've heard that there's actually some ways that you've been able to interrupt and some policy the policies that have been put in place and that there's ways that you've actually been kind of what you've been doing in your own spaces to make that um those shifts so i'm wondering if who would like to go first on those district level kind of shifts and how you you're getting around some of our policies really that are being put into place so quickly that aren't necessarily the best policies for our latinx communities um carmen when we were speaking a couple conversations ago one of the things that you had shared that has made a difference for you at milwaukee high school is your hiring practices and as a woman of color and a leader in our community you have made of just a significant impact in the way that you hire and retain that goes together that's absolutely critical i will say uh perhaps that might be one of the things that you talk about is the shift in your school culture and your school community by the way that you you hire staff um thank you yeah and you know i do have to say i think the shift in the culture because um i've had i've been able and blessed to really bring in a diverse staff is that it creates a completely different um culture right you have all these different voices and experiences and cultures coming in races and gender um that that's really important to me that that our staff and i know that that's something that's really important for a lot of people is this idea that our staff reflect our student body it makes a huge difference the fact that i'm latina makes a huge difference for not only latinx students but students of color um and students mentioned like they've said to me when we were in brick and mortar what is going on like what what's going on mr you've got all the you're hiring all these dip there's different people right there's like different colors different gender and i go what do you think about it and they go we love it like they just they love it and um and i think it allows us to do equity at a deeper level right and when i say that um you need to make sure well i know for me it's very important that i need to make sure that i create space and that our community of color our colleagues of color feel safe and they feel supported and for me i hire differently i hire when i look for mindset and so our core values of being student student-centered relationships equity diversity and inclusion and future ready those are embedded in our questions when we're doing interviews i'm always on the lookout so i could be in an uber and i might meet someone and say oh what do you do and um and they tell me some of their history oh let me take your number down real quick right um i hired this young man i saw him on the football field coaching and i said who is he because i could see the way that he interacted with our students and even when i saw chaos he was the calm in the storm and i said he has something i want and so i went and um and he works with some of our toughest kids and i recruited him from another district sorry you know but he was you know this young man was is a young man of color and he was um in a different role not working with kids and he is so amazing right and when i got him here he he didn't have his his high school diploma yet and he needed that and that's a policy and that's a policy that we were able to push on and say he is he is so good how do we support him getting his ged right and then moving forward from that and it's that kind of like trying to be creative pushing on the system advocating for these people that are so good for our kids and i look for a mindset you know i think there's there we we have to get out of that place where it's always about like um what kind of um what are the things what are the skills that we traditionally value right um the technology skills the being able to have everything in this perfect way when we have people that can build those relate that those kids are going to listen to that they have a way they're like the kid whisperer this guy's like a kid whisperer and so for me it's like i know how he cares about kids i know um how he can support kids and how he builds relationships and so those other technological pieces we can teach that and so i think like broadening how we look at things and view things and also just recruiting reaching out to colleges who do you have in you know your counseling program this is what i need i'll i'll get a paid intern this this year right if i'm going to have an opening next year so there's just different ways that i've gone about it and um and what it's created i think is this this it's hard for people of color to be in a building where there are no people of color right when they're alone and so what's happening is we're getting more and more folks and it's great for our white staff and our white kids too white students are telling me they love it so retention um so that's how i recruit because i'm always on the go i'm on a professional facebook for um professionals of color uh i'm you know i send emails out and things like that and so i'm always recruiting um and looking for that mindset so i think like one of the things that you mentioned is the recruiting piece as a way of kind of helping our latino families um in our just our bipart community and i know olga has talked about her packs her parents advisory councils that she set up so i would like if you could touch on that i know we have about um 20 minutes so whatever yes uh thank you i will be more than happy to do that um i can relate to uh carmen um i tend to do this the same same things you know i'm out and about and and in the community and i tag people and i try to you know one of my roles in life is to mentor you know i i like to see myself as someone who can um you know bring the best out of people and you know one of the reasons i i love teaching was because i was a high school teacher it was because i was able to do that with the jews you know seeing um the potential in them and encouraging them and and then advocating on their behalf for opportunity and resources and i i try to do that now with adults that i made out in the community and hey you would be an awesome teacher or you can be an awesome counselor have you considered you know so uh i am fortunate that in in in my district we have amazing um pathways now that we that allow our staff especially our classified staff to take advantage of opportunities to go back to school get the you know get a teaching degree a counseling degree go into social work and so that is one of the under our equity policy uh one of the strategies that we are working with because we also see the need of increasing our staff of color and so you know i i see us as leaders who are engaging in anti-bias and anti-racist work i think that in order for us to really begin to find solutions and to create change we need to see ourselves as anti-racist educators and so um i i love the the work that we're doing in our district we have an amazing school board that believes in this work and they are wanting also to engage in anti-racist work and that's just to me is inspiring um and so with that moving into our path phenomenon we uh several years ago started with a migrant education pack and our parents began to see um you know themselves as parent leaders and as equal partners with the education system and they started asking questions around you know how do we organize and how do we begin to influence change in the schools how do we work with principals so that they can begin to you know purchase books that are in spanish we have a dual language goal and we go into the library but there are no spanish books how is that and so you know in under my leadership in the with the family engagement team that i support they have felt so confident and supported and empowered that they they speak the truth and they you know they started asking about how can we begin to include other parents not just my grandparents we need title one parents english language learner parents we need more than just a migrant pack and by the way we also need packs in the schools we had started with a district level pack and it served as an advisory council to the leadership um what does pac stand for parent advice parent action committee or parent advisory committee so it's a latino parent advisory committee and so they started asking for help they wanted the support of the family liaisons to organize their own packs at the school level and pretty soon in less than a year we had several packs at the elementary levels right now we have pegs in middle schools and packs in high schools and those are groups of latino parents who are organizing to position themselves at a level that is that allows them to organize towards participatory power and they want to have a say in what happens and so the two years ago we also had pacs uh and ptas and ptos start to work together and to find ways to collaborate there have been some challenges with you know the communication piece um some of our pacs um have parents that don't speak english and so they you know having to find interpreters and you know ways to engage with the ptas pta parents have been primarily white parents um i never thought we would get there where they would see themselves as you know medical levels responsible for working together but they are doing it and they're making it happen and there's such a beauty in seeing that collaboration and that empowerment um and then this year it actually started last year where we started seeing other uh groups asking about how does the latino parent group organize we want to create form a black parent african-american pac or an asian pacific islander pack we also have a native american pack and so i'm just like in heaven right now with the pack you know phenomenon and parents are now looking at do we really call ourselves a pack or is there a different name that that we can you know use to identify who we are but they but they don't want to lose the sense of you know having influence in what happens in the school system they want to be partners they want to have a voice they want to have a saying in what happens and so you know the i just you know i love that that um i see ourselves as not only as educators but as cultural brokers and so my family engagement team also sees themselves as cultural brokers we are not parent educators we are very familiar with systems and we understand the education system so well so our job is to really make sure that parents are have access to information that they have access to resources and opportunity and that in itself allows the parents to organize towards participatory power and engage themselves and mentor each other and empower each other and it's great to see you know often we hear oh latino parents they don't come to our schools we don't they don't want to participate and we see that you know in this case they we have them at every school they're interacting with ptb or parent-teacher associations they are parallel they don't have to be one necessarily their strength in having both and i um you talked about being ant the anti-racist piece at the beginning and i wanted to actually bring it to pedla and talking about her elementary age students and talking about talking about race and anti-racism would stew latinx students in their home and we had had a conversation about that in the impact and what is that what is uh um what are some learnings that have happened when we're talking about race in the home in their homes right now yeah um well it's something we're thinking and and talking a lot about it's what we've um kind of narrowed it down to is that there's just one additional step in the pre-planning of a good strong lesson which is consideration for what the home environment is it's a piece of our lesson planning that previously we hadn't had to consider who else um might interrupt a conversation or have a an issue with it that in real time could interrupt the flow of of instruction and we um in conversations with teachers we've reached agreements that you know first and foremost we will continue to have these conversations with students it's that is non-negotiable that is the work that we're doing it's our job to to create a space for students to make sense of things that don't make sense and right now when it comes to the racial pandemic that we're all in the middle of it doesn't make sense and our students deserve educators that aren't afraid to tackle that and again to help them make meaning we are in no way shape or form trying to create you know 500 students that believe exactly what we believe that's that's the opposite of what what we are trying to do we want spaces where students can think critically where we can model looking at an issue from different perspectives anchored in you know what our own moral compass tells us what our families tell us what our upbringing is and we are committed to continuing to do that work um some of the agreements we have is if if teachers are concerned about a particular subject then um they've agreed that i will always have a heads up because it's just a res it's a mutual respect i respect my staff i have their backs but give me a heads up so i know if i'm gonna be bombarded or have people here i also am happy to join classroom conversations even if it's as a participant with that co-host authorization so that if there is a concern i could quickly maneuver certain calls or certain participants on a on a zoom session in a classroom into a breakout room with me so that the teaching and the lesson continues to flow and one of one of the things you had mentioned perla was that the realization that for many of our latinx staff the what's happening um around race right now is traumatizing for ourselves and then to go in and teach these lessons to our students can also be difficult and that was a new perspective um and i don't know it was something i hadn't paused to think about um in the since we're moving so fast but yeah yeah i mean i i think especially when it comes to the issue right now of the election so i remember when i taught third grade i mean election teaching is the best because it's such a real time example of democracy and the way that i mean we could teach so many different things when it came to elections and you know your role as a civil servant and i loved teaching around election time and then we would vote in class and but i was never teaching children about an election in a time that the outcomes of the election could be so detrimental to me to my family to people that i love and i could teach it really oh you know i always knew who i was voting for but i could separate that with my lessons and i think that right now asking staff to do that we are asking them too because we know our role and we're paid with taxpayer dollar we know the rules you know we're trying but it is an emotional burden to ask teachers who who are so deeply connected to what is happening politically right now to continue to create these spaces and try to separate the impact that they are feeling from that instruction and and i feel like the best we can do is just tell them thank you for do i know i i don't know what it's like but thank you for showing up every day for not leaving for sticking with this and i just go back to how can i help what do you need how can i help but i i don't think that enough of the educational leadership realizes all the heavy lifting and the technology is a part of it but that's not even what i'm talking about i'm talking about the emotional toll of the awesome responsibility that we have to these students when we are carrying so much in our souls and when you that's that's so spot on i'm sorry kind of there yeah you had talked about when at the beginning you know we're dealing with race we're dealing with issues of language and culture and then also for our latinx community immigration status and i know maida um would you like to speak to some of the not necessarily just about immigration status but the impacts of this on the students and families that that you're trying to serve you know uh it's funny that that you asked me that because i wasn't uh i'm also i'm also the migrant director for for one of the districts that i work for and um we just had our first meeting last week and i was wondering how am i going to meet my freshmen um you know i don't i didn't get to greet them on the first day i didn't get to do home visits this year and i'm in this meeting of course they're all teenagers so they have their cameras turned off um and this little girl i told her who i was and this little girl types in the chat so she mentioned the raids and said that if she or her family are picked up they're not going to be able to have an attorney and i'm thinking wow like we just met and she's already expressing these fears and and i'm thinking that's that's how isolated our kids are right now and that's the desperation that they're feeling right now which goes along to what birla is saying like normally when we're in a building that you know the kids all have lunch with their teachers there's always you know those people that they that they're able to connect with or confide in and i'm thinking right now who are they talking to who who are they confiding in and at the same time because i'm we're not in a building together how do i provide what information can i provide her how do i provide it to her and then i don't even know the information that i have is accurate because things are changing all the time and i reached out to a couple of friends and i'm like what do i say what do i do um because if this little girl is feeling this way how are her parents feeling how are other kids feeling and how how do we provide how do we provide resources information and how do i let her know me it's going to be okay because i don't know if it's going to be okay what you're saying is so real and uh i think one of the first steps in addressing trauma that our students and families and staff are experiencing is recognizing that it's real it's valid we can't begin for a moment to assume that we know how somebody else is living their life they are the expert of their life and how this impacts each of us differently and holding that space for staff and holding that space for students is is critical and for our families as well the first step in recognizing number one the trauma exists and creating those safe spaces for for students to be able to express themselves and then being able to point them in the right direction we don't have a container for all of the answers and we don't have a container for all of the resources but we see 126 people right here on this one particular zoom call who are leaning in who are curious and who want to work together to find some of the answers for that it's critical especially right now where we have a heightened sense of polarization in our community regardless of of outcomes there are winners and losers based off of how people's identities uh are perceived and if they feel as though they're going to be a targeted person by a policy an existing policy or a proposed policy or legislative or executive action based off of the color of their skin their gender identity the language within their home and these are real conditions for our kids that we need to think about on a regular basis each one of you has talked about that and and i so appreciate olga you mentioning the need for us to keep focusing on that culturally responsive approach through an anti-racist lens and how we do that and to tie that back to what carmen had said by when we when we center our students when we center our latinx students for this conversation we design education family communication family support school policy comprehensive distance learning supports communication around our students who have have not had the privilege of being as engaged as their english-speaking dominant culture peers in the past when we design here each child benefits in the system and we guaranteed a better opportunity for our students who are at the center focusing on our latinx students it's it's incredible um you were talking about embracing the difficult conversations and the need for us to raise critical consciousness amongst our students our staff and our families leaning into difficult conversations uh al air quote difficult difficult is because it challenges the status quo and then when that happens we have to ask ourselves and ask our staff as well uh status quo keeps certain people comfortable and it keeps certain other people uh quite uncomfortable for some very obvious reasons and we name that when we start talking about difficult conversations and when we're asking our kids to think critically it's about them examining issues from multiple perspectives instead of a single side instead of only one person's single story and it helps them be able to see where is privilege and where is oppression within any of these decisions that are happening in my community right now who benefits and who doesn't and then what is my role and that need to raise critical consciousness and if we're doing that through a culturally responsive lens and respect then it maintains the dignity doesn't necessarily make it easy to have the conversation but we become more fluid and we become more practiced and then we can do it better each time for each other i appreciate each of you raising all of these concerns at this time i'm recognizing that it's just a few moments right before five o'clock and our session ends tonight at 5 15. i wanted to go ahead and open up the chat so that if you had a question you can type it in we'll go ahead and continue the conversation and if you have a specific question karen or i will call out the question and then ask our panelists uh shelley yeah i do want to share quickly just because if anyone has any suggestions and they could drop it in the chat for me because i'm shamelessly going to ask for help every time i'm in a group of people these days i need all the help i can get we are um going to pilot with we've targeted four families for we have parent-teacher conferences coming up goal-setting conferences and what we've talked about is that we want our our especially they're all latino families we want them to understand that we see them as a unit now because we're in their home they're in our home we're in their home that we understand that sometimes it's hard to hear and we can hear the other teacher because the kids are sitting right next to each other so we're piloting with um a handful of families doing a family conference and so we've created a template where we will start by asking the family what what is working give us some idea of what's working what's not working and how can we help to address what's not working and then we're going to go through a process then where we will identify here are some things about your family and the way that your family has structured learning on this platform that we just really want to thank you for and then we're going to go student by student and say now this person and all the teachers will be on this call and so i'm just i don't i'm hoping it goes well what i don't want is for it to feel like oh my gosh all these teachers are he i don't want it to feel um like we're bombarding families but i want us to just own that you know we get it i want the parents to be able to hear that to see that the sixth grade teacher is hearing what i'm telling the kindergarten teacher this is why my sixth grader sometimes is late to your class because they're helping the kindergartner does that make sense um i i can let you all know how it goes after next but if there's any ideas or suggestions um i would love that great i'll i'll turn this one to olga uh one of the questions in the chat we have a couple thank you so much for going ahead and continuing those chris has uh written in how has anyone considered how to help our abuelitos who are caregivers from any of our latinx families and i would tag onto this that uh olga and karen we started another conversation about ways to help families through the pac idea but across schools and across districts and across our state olga do you want to talk a little bit about that and that idea of course yes uh we you know when we talk about uh the parent action advisory committee we're we're really talking about anyone in the family that has the guardianship role and so our family engagement team has been amazing at meeting with dios abuelitos older siblings madrina and really coaching them around how uh how to ensure that they are understanding the systems which within the school their children attend and so um one of the things that we are very mindful of is that in order for an abuelito or atiyah to call the school and get informed to get information about the child they need to be in the registry right they need to be inc their names need to be included in into synergy so that they can be given the access and so some of them have needed coaching around how to do that some of the parents have needed some coaching around how to ensure that you have the those emergency contacts updated that you have the information and synergy updated in regards to who can call the school to access information about your child and so that is a piece that we started picking up on a few years ago with you know with that phenomenon in the latino culture it's very very common very normal for a parent to you know allow the the theo the padrino de gualito to take charge of the education of the child you know and that happened in my family i raised two nieces and one nephew and i was the sole advocate educational advocate for for them and so uh that uh has been something that you know we are very knowledgeable and aware of in in our district and so family engagement is critical you know we we it's not just parent it's family you know we we are about providing wrap-around services for for families and ensuring that um you know it's not only the parents and the children that have the resources and the supports but that anyone in the family that is in need of that will have access to that one another thing and other resources um in education northwest we are going to be coming out with um like seven or eight modules that for the abuelos and the diaz and the theos that around technology and how to interact with school like actual things activities that they can do so we're just in the final stages of translating those and we're gonna make some short videos of how like it's it's a one pager like the module is a one pager but i was thinking of we could use it with your parent groups or your micro ad groups and if we did it in spanish we can model some of the activities so they could start trying out the abuelos and you know abuelitas and i'm actually going to use my own parents because they're helping me with my own kids and as a the guinea pigs of um for the video so you might see my family in the videos but um we're gonna get those out in the next month or so and we'll be they'll be free and available for people to share and use with their families we're also going to start organizing um we're going to have another meeting we're going to start a little bit smaller but having pat the parent groups leaders from various around from around the state coming together um to learn about what other parent groups are doing around the state and having those conversations so that we can start that concentracion right consciousness raising and we want a parent we want a leader from the district plus four parent leaders from that area because we know that we are going to need a school leader to help them navigate the systems in the school system so that's one of our next meetings that we'll be having um or webinars i guess but with the parents in spanish for the parents and for them specifically yes so we've reached out to some of our colleagues across the state you're certainly welcome to email uh each of us to kevin is you can find her on education northwest website and i'm located in the north clackamas school district if you would like to have some of your parents involved in a conversation across parent groups of how to lift and support one another i'm looking at some of the other conversations that's going to be in spanish so just to give you a heads up on that one yep i love the comments that are coming through the chat and the ideas that you're sharing with one another thank you so much for that i also wanted to just raise that there have been some wonderful questions about how to hold these conversations that are about anti-racist work uh in your schools and in your in your workplaces um carmen would you like to take that question sure so um i think this is really important and i think there's a lot of fear out there with our staff around this and um i feel pretty fortunate working in the north clackamas school district and equity being one of the pillars so when i got here like we had an equity committee and that equity committee in two years has really grown and the equity committee really took it upon themselves to create a ton of professional development so for us professional development around equity doesn't happen once a year it happens every single time we meet it's embedded in everything we do um we had a lesson yesterday actually with our community and connections class and that's when that's more around the social and emotional well-being of our students and it was there were some things in there and around equity and that caused a little bit of fear with my staff because what if you know what happens if someone in the background or a parent gets in there or all of those fears that come um that come out and you know i told my staff we also provided support with like if you want to reach out to an admin that can do it with you and that kind of thing but my staff i said you are the most equipped at being able to do this you've you've practiced for this for two years and um and i think like once they got through that lesson it it was easier for folks and what we found was that students um we did some of them did a word wall they did surveys but so many students were talking about what's on their mind and it was around racism it was around the election it was around feeling powerlessness it was around um black lives matter it was around our latin x community i mean all of these and these were all of our students not just our brown students that are feeling this way like they also feel powerless and they want to make a difference and they want to make sure that their peers are okay so i think that um part of it and i heard my stuff as well and this is something that our equity committee will be working on is we can role model right iu i do you do i do you do we do we can role model that um and i think that being actually able to have those tough conversations because i think it's great that we read these books courageous conversations right that we're looking at teaching tolerance but we have to be an action right and the more that we that we're in action the easier it becomes the and kids know right and so one of the things i want to be careful about is when it's a lesson that the entire staff is supposed to all the teachers are supposed to give and some teachers don't feel comfortable come alongside of them instead of not not having them do it because kids told me that they notice who does them and who doesn't now this this happened before and they said that they know right away well this teacher does might not want to talk about it or might not feel comfortable so i think coming alongside people and walking them through that we as people of color we're afraid too with the hiring and stuff you we get those comments you hire only brown people you you know those kinds of things that we also have to deal with so i think those conversations i think equity for for rural districts and other folks it's something that needs to happen all the time it needs to be embedded in everything you do you need to look at policy and look at like who does that policy benefit who does it leave out i mean there's a lot of ways to do that but to bring in folks that can help with those conversations i think is there were several questions about staff and how do you bring your staff along how do you how do you um work with your staff to build that capacity so i don't know if um maida or pedro or or any of you actually would like to speak to that question this is my first year as a principal so i'm learning from perla i think notes um but i'm using right now the initial conversation was it has been around the all students belong policy and what that means um for for our school and what it means for um for the classroom um so that's the conversation that i'm having with my staff right now and letting them know that um like what pedlar was saying if they're presenting multiple perspectives and our goal is to teach our students how to think critically i'm going to support them and i will be a knife i've um offered to be there in their classroom when they have when they're having these conversations with their kids and presenting these lessons and i've told them that i will block them up when a parent calls or emails um with any type of concern but i want to know um what the structure was in the in the classroom so uh so yeah like um what cameron and pedro was saying i join i join in i'm another student in the classroom that's brilliant i love the things that are coming in the chat about modeling and uh just really being present and adeselli had a question about uh moving staff from talking to doing and how to come alongside so thank you also for all of those examples and ideas it starts by knowing what it is you stand for knowing who you are and the skin you're in and how you present to the community how you see the world how the world sees you and then really finding out what is it that you believe in and i would say that would be step one in coming alongside of staff to become really clear when we say we're about equity when we're we say we're about anti-racism what does that mean to you as a practitioner and how does that show up in your lesson what does it sound like feel like what does it look like and if for a student to experience in that that in the classroom what would it be like for them those might be some of the initial questions and wonderings that i would pose to staff right alongside with them and it's not a gotcha it's a i've got you i've got you we are together in this conversation for the betterment of each other for the betterment of our kids and and that's how we chip away at the things that have been uh systemic barriers that have buttressed education to hold on to status quo because it's it's going to change and we are empowering our kids through that critical consciousness which is so exciting i'm so grateful to each one of you for being here on this this zoom call this afternoon there is a hunger for this work uh carmen did you want to have uh one more thing before we close out tonight just one more thing before we close out when you talked about like policies and just things that we do i we just moved into a brand new gorgeous building that overlooks the river right and so um there's a couple rooms that are on the third floor that are prime real estate like i was hoping i could get one of the rooms and make it my little condo or something but anyway um when i was um figuring out where people were gonna land um i wanted to there were these two rooms and i when i had i have 18 students that were dual identified special ed and eld and i didn't want them having separate classes so i asked two teachers to do co-teaching last year and they were able to bring these 18 students together so that they were getting that one class and getting the special ed and eld support so when i was thinking about where am i going to place people i place people in in different hallways and these two rooms i said i'm going to give to my special ed teacher and my eld teacher now these now that's not how we do business right we put our eld students out in the portable in the dungeon in the basement we put our special ed kids somewhere else as well and they had to draw straws of which room they would get um but these two teachers got these two rooms and that was intentional because i want our students to know that they matter they're valuable and that's just an example of how we can look at things differently sometimes and what an impact that we'll have on our students and i think that our thank you carmen are our latinos families and students they have a right to be here they have a right to an education they have a right to be in our classrooms they have a right to be asking for a new chromebook or for a place to study or they have a right to the food that we are serving in our schools that is their right and so i wanted to name that and i also wanted to um as a latina educator i wanted to speak to the latina latinos and latinx on this call and just say when you when your heart tells you something or your brain is saying this isn't right what we're doing right now you're right on you're spot on and you have to stay true to your core because um and believe in your core that little voice that little something in your stomach because you are right and if the rest of the system is saying do something different go with us in this river and you're like no no we're going this way we got to go this way use that voice when you feel you know use it for your students use it for your families and believe in that core that you that you hold true and those values that you hold true [Music] it is a basic right si padre we that one last thing i just want to share is that we as educational leaders also must uphold accountability for our um for other white educators it is not okay to just be anti to not be racist to be anti-racist it takes that critical consciousness and puts it into action what are you doing with the new knowledge with the new information with the new tools that you have that you are accessing what are you doing with that that's when the real change begins right on yeah and to tag on to karen that voice that's your superpower friends and you can hone that skill and listen to it and act on it just as olga said it is more than uh anti-racism is actionable and it's every day in the everyday steps that we take you took steps by leaning in today and being curious about how to help shift the critical consciousness and raising uh that critical consciousness of how to we as a collective system can do better for our latinx communities i want to thank each person for coming tonight uh it's late in the afternoon you have a full plate with cdl if you were each talking about it i was hearing the i was seeing the head nods across the the zoom screens on all the different tiles and we're connecting with one another at that deep level i want to just close by two things first some advice from a colleague to a colleague breathe every day multiple times let go of perfectionism we heard that from our panelists we are learning too embrace relationships with your colleagues with your families with those in your own personal circle remain authentic and listen to that inner voice seek hope and meaningfulness in your work partner togetherness team anti-racism and culturally responsive practices if that is our center we will chip away and we will make a difference we don't have every answer but we are going to find some of the right answers that are going to make a difference for our students and our families here in oregon and across our region that will make a difference for them and we will finally be at a place where we say when every student matters all students belong and all students will achieve it's not an afterthought it's the first thought i wanted to thank each of our panelists one more time you have my gratitude i am honored to know you amazing women thank you for sharing your stories and i want to also thank my partner in this work karen perez she has been my colleague for a long time and she and i have amazing conversations which spurred us on to say what would it be like to have official conversations where some of our other colleagues could learn from the wisdom of some of our friends here on the panel tonight and we have another opportunity coming up canon would you like to speak to that one yes so we have two on monday october 19th from 6 to 7 15 we'll have a session in spanish for our parent leaders and that will come with a leader from their district um you can email me i'll i'll put my email i think i put my email in the um chat for that and then the second one next month we'll be having we'll send out again information we're going to do a session on boarding school policies in the impact on our native students of today and so it's about the boarding school policies that occurred here in oregon and how those are impacting our native students so our next focus will be on our native american and indigenous communities and uh kevin and i are involved in conversation about race equity language culture frequently and we decided you know this is a bigger conversation than just the two of us and we can learn from each other in a bigger community so please look forward to additional opportunities for us to come together and through cultural humility we can learn from one another and strengthen deeply i'd like to wish each of you a wonderful evening stay healthy stay safe be curious about learning and stay in that positive space of hope and togetherness because we are making a difference for our kids and families and it starts with each one of you in the leadership that you do every day thank you so much everyone thank you jelly
