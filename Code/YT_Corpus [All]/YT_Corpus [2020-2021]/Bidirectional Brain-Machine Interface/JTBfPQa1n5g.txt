 good afternoon everybody we're delighted to have you here this afternoon and the biochemist society and portland press are very pleased to welcome you to this webinar which is part of our biochemistry focus webinar series there are a range of topics in the series and they include different research areas in the molecular brain sciences but we're also including some practical sessions to support career development of ecos and for every webinar there will be an opportunity to ask questions and interact with the speakers and if you think of a question during the two talks today just pop it into the question box on your screen and we'll ask the questions at the end of both talks today's webinar is entitled neural neurobiology of chronic pain mechanisms management and in between and it's brought to you today in association with the biochemical society and portland's press neuroscience journal neuronal signaling and neuronal signaling is a fully open access journal and it's now indexed in pubmed central so you may not be aware but a lot of institutions around the world have a read and publish agreement with portland press which means that authors can publish in your own signaling as a fully open access journal for free so if you want to know more about that just have a look at the website so my name is elish dowd and i'm a senior lecturer in pharmacology at national university of ireland galway and i'm also on the editorial board of neuron signaling as is our first invited speaker today professor rajesh khanna so professor khanna is professor of pharmacology at the university of arizona college of medicine in tucson and prior to joining the university of arizona professor khanna earned his phd from the university of toronto after which he completed post-doctoral fellowships at the university of california in l.a and at toronto western research institute we're very pleased to have professor canna join us today thanks professor kevin okay thank you professor dowd and it's great to be doing this webinar on behalf of the academic society in portland press so before i begin let me introduce what the lab does generally we're looking for developing therapeutics for chronic pain and addiction and we do this by examining new targets and specifically ion channels and their regulators some of the targets that we've been working on are for example the n-type calcium channel which is a very well documented target for chronic pain we've discovered new targets which i'm going to talk to you about today particularly cytosolic proteins that are regulators of key ion channels and pathways involved in plasticity of pain and maybe i'll have a little bit of time to talk about this really exciting story we found by discovery of a new molecule called neuropalin which acts to induce analgesia through the spike protein we also are fortunate to be working at the university of arizona in collaboration with physician scientists working on non-pharmacological development of management of pain as well as non-opioid-based products from natural sources so why are we doing all of this well it's because chronic pain is a massively complicated condition it spares no part of your body and mind and despite the fact that chronic pain patients are often waiting about 10 years for our diagnosis only a few of them are able to get only a fraction are able to get adequate pain management and it's for this reason because pain is complicated as i said earlier it can be both governed and by mechanisms that originate in the central and the peripheral nervous systems if there is support for the idea that the peripheral nervous system itself may be important and sufficient to drive neuropathic pain particularly in recent work there has been evidence suggesting that hyperextendability driven by the nausea scepters of the dorsal root ganglia are sufficient to drive this neuropathic pain and particularly that is done by ion channels in the example i'll give today is a voltage-gated sodium channel that is housed at key sites within the dorsal root ganglia as well as in the nerves both at the periphery and in some of the pathways here at key sites within the pain circuitry and a recent paper suggests that this may be the sort of the uh prototypical low-hanging fruit if you will and could lead to the development of successful therapeutic uh compounds for managing pain so let me introduce this main player sodium channel 1.7 is the key channel it defines the threshold of the action potential it also contributes to the upstroke of the action potential really the efforts to study this channel were galvanized by the discovery that mutations in the 1.7 channel cause human pain syndromes and this is really what led people to go after this channel the potential target for pain it's present in the right locations uh in the skin in the periphery in the dosuru ganga neuron the nociceptive neurons as well as in lamina one two of this also horn of the spinal cord and so we've been studying this for a while and our effort really efforts really we're gravitating towards finding regulators of the trafficking and activity driving this particular channel and about a decade ago we discovered a protein called crim2 collapse and response mediator protein which is a really an axonal guidance uh sort of protein and for the first time we discovered it to associate with with sodium channel and then that embarked a series of studies which led us to show that if you take out from heterologous cells or from sensory neurons the expression of cream 2 you saw a reduction in the sodium currents which was completely rescued if you added back the deficient protein suggesting that cream tube was sufficient to drive channel activity well in fact when we looked further it was the simulation addition of a small ubiquitous like modifier to crim2 by the enzyme called ubc9 that really had the effect of controlling the channel and in particular a graduate student of mine eric destrude found that it was a particular lysine 374 that governed the control of 1.7 as you can see if you knock out this lysine you see the reduction in current in collaboration with a group of dr khanna uh who solved the crystal structure of of crim2 we could see that the lysine was the most accessible and these results were consistent with the idea that this position was key to driving sodium currents taking this into the sensory neurons which are the non-susceptive cells we found that although sodium channels are of many different flavors in these cells one seven is the most predominant in small neurons we found that if you and transfected these neurons with either a wall type or a sumonol missing the three subforce site you saw that the resistant currents were not affected you saw that the sensitive currents which included one seven was affected and if you took out one seven with using protox you saw there was no difference in that the remaining currents to one one one six were not affected so by inference it was 1 7 that was affected and not only was the trafficking the density effect it was also because of trafficking as you can see in these confocal images surface trafficking of 1.7 is completely impaired in the presence of a sumo null mutation we came at this a different way when we looked at designing a small decoy motif that encompassed the simulation site and this site gave us an advantage to look at it in a to not using genetic approaches and so we we came up with this peptide coupled it to attach sequence to make itself penetrate and when we flooded the system in cells we could see using a denaturing ip that we could block simulation of crim2 here's the control condition and the presence of the peptide you see inhibition of simulation as you would see with the 375a plasmid importantly when you dialyze these this peptide into cells we saw remarkably an inhibition of sodium carbs and most amazingly pokey pardon most amazingly we saw that in animals with a model of neuropathic pain for example the sni spared nerve injury when we injected this peptide we could see a reversal in these red triangles here a reversal of both tactile and thermal aldenia so this was really convincing evidence that this mechanism could be amenable to uh for the studies delving deeper into the mechanism we decided to make a mouse and using crispr cast editing we made a knock-in mouse lacking the simulation site and very reassuringly as predicted the wild-type currents were much uh robust sodium currents were found but in the sumonal mouse these currents were dramatically reduced and this was directly because of a trafficking effect on the channel when we looked at taking this to pain models and knowing that now the simulation was affected and the trafficking of the channel was affected we next tested the sumonal mice in for the ability to in withstand or develop pain and in the spirit nerve entry model we saw that wild type animals develop pain but neither female or male homozygous mice developed as robust pain as the wild type but more amazingly they did not have any persistent pain so this all of this data sets up the idea that crim2 particularly simulation of crim2 is key to the initiation of neuropathic pain and to the development of neuropathic pain so this was a great time because we were now we understood the mechanism and we had built a model which shows that ubc 9 the enzyme that brings sumo to crim2 we had an understanding of that interaction and we also had the i already knew that we could block the interaction between ubc 9 and crim2 to prevent simulation of crim2 with a decoy peptide so we've leveraged these ideas in these data to come up with the hypothesis that if we could do the same thing with small molecules we could indirectly regulate the channel in this manner and so we would inhibit this mod with molecules this interaction and prevent stimulation and this would convert to a no pain scenario we began this with the docking effort and a 50 000 compound screen was performed by doctors kana and vijay gokule and this resulted in binding of many compounds to this pocket shown here in this 3d crystal structure and then those some of those compounds were screened and then iteratively improved after about 250 so compounds we came up with a compound called bpi or or 194 and this is really the compound for which a patent was aborted recently and this is what i'll talk to you about next few minutes so now having understood the mechanism that simulation was key and we had discovered this 194 compound we tested to see if the compound would work as we predict it so first david scott in my's lab showed that compound binds to crim2 but not crim 5 or ubc 9 if you buy into this this would be a problem and so this is a good thing it also inhibit inhibited the interaction between crim2 and ubc 9 as shown in this msd experiment and importantly taken into cells again we were able to recapitulate the inhibition of simulation as we saw earlier with the peptide or with this simulation deficient plasmid control 194 or bpbi inhibited surface trafficking of the channel as seen in vital experiments here or in confocal imaging where you can clearly see an annulus of 1.7 on surface versus in the case with the compound so it is inhibiting the trafficking and importantly because of this it was inhibiting uh the current so drg currents here are from normal uh from dms treated rad drgs were inhibited when treated with 194 all of this reduction was because of one seven because if you added the selective pfizer compound pf shown here we saw no further inhibition so everything that was being inhibited was 1.7 selective and it was only selective 1 7 as can be seen here as other channels are not affected also this calcium was not affected drgs from mouse pig and human were also uh showing similar degree of inhibition with 194 and remarkably the most convincing proof here comes from the fact that in sumo now uh in drgs from sumo sumonal mice which have no which have this mutation we saw no inhibition with 194 suggesting and proving that 194 blocks 1.7 specifically via crim2 simulation dependent mechanism so this was really exciting and this led us to then test these this compound which is our lead compound in models of neuropathic pain here's our two examples we tested in chemotherapy induced neuropathic pain as well as the nerve injury model and as you can see in a in given orally this compound reverse neuropathic pain so it's pretty exciting so if this was an evoked model of pain but we also sent out this compound and dr peter grace from utmd anderson's group performed conflict avoidance assays mechanical conflicts the assays where a rat or a mouse chooses to be wants to go to the dark side but it has to cross over a spiked floor so an animal of pain will not traverse unless it has a drug that's causing pain relief and so you know our compound a bsp i showed in green here was able to enter this compound to get because it had pain relief and so in this non-evoked assay we also showed relief of pain uh with our compound and we've done a lot of additional studies but i'll leave you with a couple small ones showing that chronic administration of 194 is is very i guess as most patients will take drugs chronically so chronic administration of 194 does not cause any tolerance we did not see any real loss of efficacy during the time course of the experiment where the pump is on neither did we see any addictive properties and this was done in todd veneras lab at the university of arizona where the comp where the compound the animals didn't prefer any chamber based on compound administration so with this uh i'm going to conclude on 194 was i know it's really rapid and uh and switch to it a very uh before i end switch to a very exciting discovery that our lab made a few months ago which is to which is really falls down onto the our studying crimp two and being in the right place at the right time so we were studying crim2 and i alluded to what we've been doing for the last uh 15 last few minutes or so and what we found were a couple of papers that showed a new protein called neuropalin well why is that important well neuropilin is a protein that sits upstream of cream too so that caught our attention neuroplane was shown to be a protein that a receptor protein sitting on the membrane that added that was able to have sars cov2 spike protein starch copy to bind to it in order to enter it well that got us very interested because we already knew from earlier studies from other people that vascular endothelial ghost factor vegf bound to neuropalin to induce pain so the idea came to us that what if the spike protein to source school sarsko v2 could include this particular side and that's shown in the cartoon here and what shows is that neuropilin has a binding site for vhtf which is exactly the same binding site in for star scope spike protein so that was fantastic because what and that got us really interested in doing this and what we found essentially was if we took animals added vgf we could see pain but when we added spike protein we could reverse the pain and this was through uh a crimson depending mechanism which we're studying but mostly it was through suppression of of currents to sodium and calcium channels and led to decrease in excitability and pain relief properties so i know it was pretty fast and my time is almost up so i just want to acknowledge the funding from the national institutes of health and the wonderful people that work in the lab and i'll leave you with this final slide that gets to the heart of what i was trying to convey which is that there are many potential targets in the peripheral nervous system we chose one particular target nav 1.7 and we think that we understand the mechanism of it we know how it works it relieves pain chronic orally it is very specific to reduction of one seven it also what i didn't show you it also potentiates and synergistic with other analgesis analgesics like morphine and gabapentin and finally it is uh not addictive so i apologize for going super fast but thank you for listening thank you very much rajesh professor thank you so much for that really really um fascinating talk so we're going to take questions but we're going to take them at the end of both of our invites and talks today so do you sit tight and hopefully some questions will come in on the feed so to anybody listening if you have a question just pop it into the question box if you see the little question mark on your screen you just uh take on that and then it'll open up a question box and you can type in your question there if you have a question for professor kanna or a question for professor finn it would be great if you could direct the question and if if possible so thank you very much rajesh and so i'm now delighted to to introduce our second invited speaker today our second invited speaker is professor david finn professor david finn is a professor and head of pharmacology and therapeutics at the national university of ireland galway um where he is also co-founder and co-director of the center for pain research dave is also currently president of the international cannabinoid research society so prior to joining nui galway professor finn hd from the university of bristol after which she worked as a postdoctoral research fellow at the university of nottingham so we are really delighted to have professor phil here today to speak at our at our webinar thanks chris finn thanks very much uh thank you for organizing this and for the invitation to participate and uh thanks to the biochemical society portland press and neuronal signaling uh for organizing this webinar so i'm going to speak about pain and negative affect with a focus on the endocannabinoid system and uh pain and negative affect by which i mean anxiety depression and stress they share a reciprocal bi-directional interaction whereby one can modulate the other and this is important because we know that there's a high degree of co-morbidity between chronic pain anxiety and depression and about 50 of patients with chronic pain also suffer from comorbid anxiety or depression and common pharmacological treatments are used to manage both chronic pain and affective disorders such as for example antidepressants or anxiolytics like pregabalin and there are also shared neural substrates we know this from functional neural imaging and neuroanatomical studies brain regions like the anterior singular cortex insular cortex amygdala are commonly implicated in chronic pain and negative affect now when we look specifically at um the relationship between stress and negative and pain and it the picture depends on the precise nature and intensity of the stressor in question so stressors which are robust intense fear and immediate threat to homeostasis tend to suppress pain through the phenomenon of stress-induced analgesia whereas stressors that are more chronic moderate future orientated tend to do the opposite and exacerbate pain through the phenomenon of stress-induced hyperalgesia and in my lab we're interested in both of these phenomena and i'm going to focus on our work on the role of the endocannabinoid system in both stress induced analgesia and stress induced hyperalgesia so a few years back we published this review article where we reviewed the neurobiology of stress-induced hyperalgesia and what was very clear is that it's associated with maladaptive changes throughout the descending inhibitory pain pathway and so what we see is there are maladaptive changes in a variety of neuronal pathways and receptor signaling systems such as for example the gabaergic and glutamatergic systems cholecystokinin corticotrophin releasing factor and indeed recent evidence for maladaptive alterations in the endogenous cannabinoid system so uh just by way of introduction a little more detail on the endogenous cannabinoid system or so-called endocannabinoid system it's a system that's a lipid signaling system comprised of at least two receptors that have been discovered and cloned and characterized to date these are the cb1 and cb2 receptors and these are both gigo protein coupled receptors the endogenous ligands for these receptors then are the endocannabinoids and the two best characterized here are anandamite and two arachidonic glycerol or 2ag and then there's a variety of enzymes and that either synthesize or degrade the endocannabinoids and for example fatty acid amide hydrolase which preferentially degrades anandamide and mono-acetylglycerol lipase which preferentially degrades 2ag and indeed there are also non-cb1 non-cb2 receptor targets for cannabinoids including plant cannabinoids that are derived from the cannabis plant and endogenous cannabinoids and some of these include the p-pars triphy-1 and gpr-55 interestingly the endocannabinoid system signals retrogradely so endocannabinoids are produced uh on demand since synthesized on demand post-synaptically and they are released and and then bind to cb1 receptors expressed presynaptically on the presynaptic nerve terminals where they usually serve to suppress neurotransmitter release and neuronal activity so it happens that you find the components of this endocannabinoid system distributed throughout the descending pain pathway in all these regions that are so important in pain regulation and also um negative affect uh stress fear anxiety regions like the prefrontal cortex the mig to the periaqueductal gray and um when this pathway is activated it generally tends to suppress um no susceptible transmission so we started out by asking is there a role for the endocannabinoid system in pain hyperresponsivity so exacerbation of pain in negative effective states like anxiety and depression and uh to do this we're um taking both pre-clinical and clinical approaches i'm going to focus mostly on our pre-clinical work in animal models and um here we're using the inbred rat string called the worcester kyoto rat which has an anxio-depressive phenotype so in an open field maze in an elevated plus maze for swim test at these animals this worcester kyoto genotype has an high anxiety high depressive like behavioral state compared to sprague dolly rats which are the most commonly used comparator strain and intensive pain such as the hot plate test and formalin test these with kyoto rats show a heightened nociceptive response heightened separative behavioral response to both heat pain and to inflammatory pain with formula injection so we use them if you like as a model of heightened pain responding against a negative affect background a high anxiety high depressive background and uh these uh whister kyoto rats have been studied in terms of the endocannabinoid system for depressive like behavior and what's clear is from this paper published by venating colleagues a few years ago is that a dysfunction in pha the enzyme that preferentially degrades an andamite is associated with depressive-like behavior in the whisper kyoto rats and if you chronically treat these whisker kyoto rats with a pha inhibitor it has an antidepressant like effect so in some of our earlier work published in pain we we were able to demonstrate that impaired endocannabinoid signaling in the brain stem in the raster ventrimedial medulla the rvm underpins this heightened pain responding in the wooster kyoto rat strain but of course the rvm in the brainstem receives innervation from the midbrain periaqueductal gray pag and so we next turned our attention in more recent work to the role of the endocannabinoid system in the pag and here i'm showing you some results we did a very comprehensive characterization of the endocannabinoid system in the pag of worcester kyoto and sprague dolly rats but just to show you a selection of the more interesting data we found high levels of the endocannabinoid 2ag in the lateral phd of worcester kyoto rats compared to sporadic rats significantly higher levels and significantly lower levels of the cb1 receptor in the lateral pig of the wooster kyoto rats compared to the sprang dolly comparator strain so we hypothesized that these alterations in the endocannabinoid system or differences in the endocannabinoid system between the worcester kyoto and the spray dolly rats may underlie the height and pain responding in that strain and so to test that hypothesis we next carried out some pharmacological challenge studies where we injected um cb1 receptor agonist ace a directly into the uh lateral pag of um both strains so in sprite dolly rats we see that this cb1 agonist gives us a nice antinocioceptive effect significantly reducing formulan of oceanosis after behavior and that effect is blocked by co-administration of a cb1 receptor antagonist at am251 but if we do the same experiment in worcester kyoto rats and we don't see these effects we see no um antinocioceptive effect of cb1 receptor agonists administration into the uh lateral pag of the wooster kyoto rats they seem to be hypo responsive to cannabinoid receptor agonism in this region the pag and if we look post-mortem at cfos expression as a marker of neuronal activity uh here we see in the sprite all you're at the cb1 receptor agonist increases fast expression in the in the brain stem and reduces fast expression in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord so this is consistent with the idea that it's engaging the descending inhibitory pain pathway in sprague dolly rats but we just don't see these effects in worcester kyoto rats so they're again hypo responsive in terms of recruitment of the descending inhibitory pain pathway to cannabinoid receptor agonism and um in terms of the circuitry of the rvm it's quite interesting it has these on cells and off cells beyond cells are taught to facilitate pain responding and the off cells are taught to dampen down pain responding and so in collaboration with dino myoni and colleagues in the university of naples we recorded from the on and off cells of the wooster kyoto and sprague dolly rats um at baseline and in response to mechanical stimulation and the strains are markedly different so um in in in brief uh the wooster kyoto rats have exacerbated on cell responding and reduced off cell responding which again is consistent with the idea that they have a heightened pain response and a dysfunction in the descending inhibitory pain pathway and so just to summarize the results that presented so far um the worcester kyoto rat strain is uh anxious depressive you know high anxiety high depression related behavior strain and we see hypoallergenic response to formula injection into the hind paw uh a blunted endocannabinoid signaling in the rvm um differences between the endocannabinoid system and the lateral pag of worcester kyoto and sprague dolly rats and differential responsivity to cb1 receptor challenge and agonism between the two strains and you can see that at the level of non-susceptive behavior at the level of cfas expression and indeed electrophysiologically as well so we feel that this function of this endocannabinoid system in the pag rvm circuitry likely contributes to um heightened pain responding in the wooster kyoto genotype which is associated with negative affect okay so so far i've been talking about how negative affects and fear stress anxiety how they exacerbate pain and next like to talk about how the opposite to that so how fear and stress can suppress pain and uh to study this we use a a paradigm which we call fear-induced analgesia or fear-conditioned analgesia and this is uh pain suppression in response to learned pavlovian conditioned fear it's a very very potent form of endogenous analgesia and so therefore it's of interest to us because if we could understand the neurobiology and physiology of this endogenous analgesic response um well it would be interesting of course from a fundamental and physiological perspective but also it may give us some insights into novel therapeutic targets for for pain fear and condition allergies is also expressed in rodents and humans so it has some translational value and it's mediated by um activation of the descending inhibitory pain pathway so that pathway that we looked at earlier when it's activated is critically important in in mediating fear condition analgesia now to model this in our laboratory we use a a two day paradigm on day one the rats undergo fear conditioning to context uh perspex arena and on day two they are injected with formalin into the hindpo and then re-exposed to the arena and the exposure to the arena results in uh a suppression of a formula and a vocal synthetic behavior through fear condition analgesia and we can interrogate the neurobiology of this response uh by systemic or intracerebral injection of of drugs that modulate the endocannabinoid system so in initial work uh with this model um we uh could show that if you block cb1 receptors pharmacologically with the antagonists ramona band that this completely prevents fear-conditioned analgesia in these rats um so our fear condition rats non-fear condition rats the vehicle-treated rats express robust fear-conditioned analgesia but the rats receiving the cb1 receptor antagonists from monoband do not and you can see this at the behavioral level but you can also see it at the level of immediate early gene expression as a marker of neuronal activity in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord too we next administered a drug that would prevent the breakdown of endocannabinoids so this is the drug urb597 it's a pha inhibitor and that does the opposite so that enhances fear condition analgesia and again you know this is consistent with the idea that during fear endocannabinoids are being synthesized and released on demand they're binding to cb1 receptors and they're facilitating this endogenous pain suppression and in a series of papers over the last you know 10 years or so which i don't really have time to go into in detail we've been interrogating the neural substrates and brain regions that are important in this endocannabinoid mediated fair condition analgesia and some of those papers just summarized here and we've shown key role for the dorsolateral periaqueductal grey for the basal lateral amygdala for the prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus also and here's just a selection of some of those data um and what we show is that fear condition analgesia is associated with increases in endocannabinoids and and anandamide in the uh baselateral amygdala and dorsolateral pag and if we inject cb1 antagonists directly into these brain regions we can prevent the expression of fair condition analgesia okay um just as i move into the latter part of the talk um i i've been talking to you so far about how anxiety and fear and negative affect modulate pain but um i'd also like to to turn it around now and and look at how pain can modulate negative affect because this is also very important clinically and some nice work from raphael maldonado and colleagues in barcelona a few years ago demonstrated that indeed there's a role for the endocannabinoid system in the emotional manifestations of osteoarthritis pain in in animals and we asked whether there might be a role for the endocannabinoid system in emotional manifestations of neuropathic pain and using a rat model of spinal spinal nerve ligation which is a peripheral nerve injury model of neuropathic pain and here again we have our two strains the whisper kyoto and the sprague dolly rats and we're looking here at the fourth swim test which is a test for uh depressive like behavior and antidepressant like activity uh and we're looking here about 38 days following peripheral nerve injury in both strains and so what we have the animals that do not have the peripheral nerve injury and the spinal nerve ligation animals that do have this this this this neuropathic pain like uh state and and and so what you see is that the worst of kyoto sham animals have a greater immobility in the four swim test compared to the sprague dolly shams and this is um entirely expected and i've told you already in the talk that most of the other rats have a high and depressive like you know behavioral phenotype and so that makes sense and then when we layer on the spinal nerve ligation then the peripheral nerve injury we see an augmentation of this depressive-like behavior in the whistle kyoto rats but not in not in the sprague dolly rats so we we followed up um this post-mortem work we actually showed that this augmentation is associated with increased cb1 receptor expression in the basal lateral amygdala which gave us a clue that maybe the endocannabinoid system could be an interesting target here and then we we carried on and carried out a subsequent experiment where we chronically treated the nerve injured worcester kyoto rats uh with a pha inhibitor urb597 um for about five weeks and we're able to show that this had a an antidepressant-like effect it's a it's a modest um effect but statistically significant reduction in the mobility in the four swim test in these nerve injured uh whisper kyoto rats compared to uh control rats receiving vehicle rather than the fan inhibitor so um that's all well and good and some interesting data in animal models but um what what's the story uh clinically and what does the picture look like in in human patients and for cannabinoids and um i i guess you know we've reviewed the literature here in a few different articles in recent years um it's just a table that i've pulled out from one of our reviews which summarizes the literature on cannabinoids for treatment of comorbid pain and anxiety depression and for the most part what you see is that the cannabinoids that have been studied do indeed you know reduce pain and also the comorbid anxiety fear depression but what i would say is that there's a very limited range of cannabinoids that have been studied to date largely only thc or thc analogues um for the most part so we do need more studies with with you know different types of cannabinoid drugs with fire inhibitors mag lipase inhibitors to advance this field there is some interesting work in looking at at human human snips polymorphisms in the pha gene which have been linked to differential pain responding and differential anxiety responding and this paper up here in the top left particularly interesting got a fair bit of media attention um last year it's a lady in in aberdeen in scotland who um has this fast snip who has very very high levels of an anandamide and never feels pain and is always happy and never anxious and she had surgery and and didn't feel any pain whatsoever post surgery and so it's very interesting and i think you know further proof of concept that it represents an interesting target for for chronic pain so you know fear condition analgesia is mediated by the endocannabinoid system in these brain regions shown here and we also see some evidence in fact for reduced expression of fear condition analogies in worcester kyoto rats which i haven't shown you but we have found that and that deficits in fast substrates um including endocannabinoids may underlie nerve injury-induced depressive-like behavior in mr kyoto rats the final bit of data i just want to present to you um for the last minute or two is in is in the area of post-operative pain and this is an animal model rat model of post-operative pain associated with inguinal hernia repair groin hernia repair we developed this model a few years ago and published it and here's work showing that if we administer pha inhibitors either a peripherally restricted fat inhibitor or centrally acting fat inhibitor then these have um antioxidative effects in this rat model of postoperative pain and finally we've been doing some clinical research in women undergoing cesarean section c-section is uh associated with uh certainly acute postoperative pain and um in a significant proportion of women chronic postoperative pain too and we've been measuring the endocannabinoid levels circulating in the cannabinoid levels in blood and they're markedly changed post uh cesarean section compared to priesthood section increases in 2ag reductions in anandamite oea and pea and so we're interested in this um in the context of endocannabinoids being potential biomarkers for predicting postoperative pain so to summarize the endocannabinoid system is a a an important lipid signaling system that i think plays a key role in regulating this balance between you know negative affect fear anxiety depression and pain and this is a very complex balance and and it is going to depend on on many different factors the levels and types of endocannabinoids the precise receptors they they act at and of course the the brain regions and circuitry but hopefully um our data may be of some relevance to the development of endocannabinoid-based therapeutics where you have co-morbid um anxiety pain and depression i just like to thank all the people in my group over the years who've contributed to this work and some of the postdocs and phd students who've contributed to the work i represented are highlighted in bowl there and collaborators and galway particularly michelle roach here in physiology in galway other collaborators in galway london naples and of course the funding agencies that have supported the work and maybe just while i have the the floor just to and draw your attention to this um cannabinoid meeting it's the international cannabinoid research society symposium which we hope to host um here in galway in 2022 and fingers crossed covered permitting and um if you're interested in this area we'd love to welcome you to the galway for that thank you thank you very much professor finn uh fascinating run through the the very complex relationship between affect pain and the and where the cannabinoids fit in when the endocannabinoid system fits in so we're going to head into the q a part of the webinar and just to remind all of our participants that are that are watching at home or at work if you have a question just to hit the question mark symbol on on your screen and you can pop a question in there and you can direct it to professor can or professor finn that would be great if you could do that um so we have some questions in so the first couple are for rajish so um joseph parsons has a question about if you are to deliver your decoy peptide as a therapeutic for humans what would the mechanism of delivery be because of issues related to you know going undergoing modifications or digestion depending on the root administration well thank you very much for that question so partly for for that very reason with the hurdles uh with using peptides we had resorted to developing small molecules so really pushing forward the idea that small molecules could recapitulate the key findings that we saw with the peptide peptide and what we were doing with that was really a proof of concept to set up the idea however that said the peptide works beautifully as you saw some other findings i didn't share with you it's not addictive it doesn't have any off-target effects and currently at least in the animals we had done integral delivery we had done in the past oral delivery as well and somehow the peptides was spared from degradation so it is possible if we were to go ahead developing the peptide further we could encapsulate it perhaps or staple the peptide we haven't figured out how to deliver it uh beyond the initial studies but we've been playing with ideas of encapsulation probably perhaps a nano particle particle-based conjugation to it but again the whole idea was to take that as proof of concept and then guide us to development of compounds okay there's another one here for you rajesh um from vivian tolfik do you anticipate that certain types of pain will be particularly sensitive to your compound oh thank you vivian that's a great question that's something that we've been thinking for a long time as you know one point nad 1.7 in particular the target here is important for a variety of pain at least what's been seen in preclinical models and and in humans as well what you've also what you also know is that 1.7 targeted compounds have really not fared well and they've been tried for post-therapeutic neuralgia for example for uh dialysis-induced itch and so because 1.7 also controls it so at this point for us the with our leak compound and improved versions of that what we're trying to do is to go after chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy because it's so prevalent and we have clear evidence from our work and from work across the globe from pain labs that this is going to be potentially affected there so i i would say although the strategy that we're pursuing which is this allosteric indirect regulation is likely to be broad broadly relevant across these pain models i would say for us going forward at least for the development perspective we would go with chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy all right thank you and one for david uh david somebody wants to peter pierre depping would like to know can you tell us a little bit more how the lipid signaling in the endocannabinoid system works was that how lipid signaling works yeah how how the endocannabinoid system works is yeah sure so um so endocannabinoids are lipids essentially they're derived from arachidonic acid so um they they are lipid-like molecules highly lipophilic and the signaling works in a sort of on-demand manner so endocannabinoids are not stored in vesicles so they're they're not like classical neurotransmitters which are stored and released by exocytosis endocannabinoids are synthesized on demand in response to um stimuli often physiological stimuli so so they'll be they'll be synthesized in response to pain for example or stress or other um you know physiological uh stimuli and and they're made from phospholipid precursors uh they're made that that's facilitated and catalyzed by by enzymes and so for an andamide it's nate pld largely and for 2ag it's tag lipos and um so they're synthesized on demand released they easily you know traverse membranes to fuse out into the synapse and then they serve to modulate neuronal function so they're sort of like neural modulators it's a neuromodulatory system and particularly important in modulating for example gabaergic neurotransmission and glutamatergic neurotransmission so you find a high expression of cb1 receptors on gabaergic interneurons so um so yeah it's it in that sense it's um it's a lipid signaling uh system because the endocannabinoids themselves are are essentially lipids yeah so they're quite different to a lot of the more classical neurotransmitters in our brains so that the fast nip that was found in the patient who was pain insensitive has that been subsequently found in other patients um not with such dramatic results i don't think there are variety of different snips and you know there have been other fast snips reported and some of the papers i showed there on that slide and linked a fast snip for example to post operative pain um and uh and also to anxiety and fear extinction as well but that particular snip um was was i think the first report uh of of of of that uh as it was um it was a very interesting um it was it was was two polymorphism two genetic alterations in in that one person i believe and um there was a fa the fat um protein was was deficient and it was almost like a decoy fi in there as well which was encoded for by uh by a snip so that that was the interesting thing there uh and and the ultimate that the the end result for the for the for the person was that they had very low levels of activity and and therefore very high levels of an anemone um which which then conferred um analgesia and and anxiolysis you know um so yeah um there are other snips uh that have been reported but not to my knowledge um that that particular combination that was that was found and reported in that lady from aberdeen i wondered do these people also have issues with weight regulation just because of the role of the endocannabin endocannabinoid system and driving appetite yeah um i don't think i don't think that was a a reported or a feature there in that particular case um but definitely cb1 plays an important role in appetite regulation and of course we we all know about cannabis and the munchies i guess and and um and also that the ramona ban which is one of the drugs i i i presented some data for cb1 antagonist or inverse agonist that was on the market um a few years ago for the treatment of obesity actually and so you know blockade of cb1 receptors does uh does appear to have um an effect on you know appetite regulation and um weight weight gain uh but uh the flip side to that is is the drug um had to be taken off the the market because uh of suicidal ideation uh and tendency towards depression which i think speaks to the role of the endocannabinoid system in in negative affect and in mood regulation yeah that's fascinating fascinating story of ramon evans and obesity back to you we have one here about and targeting uh crm p2 nazir this one comes in from harrison stratton has your group investigated other residues of crmb2 that could potentially influence chronic pain yes we have thank you for that question so uh it's this protein crimp two crm p2 is a is initially was initially uh identified in the context of its ability to uh guide and and grow axons by binding to tubulin and so um our work has really sort of diverted its uh real canonical role now to seeing whether it's available for conversations or dialogue with channels to affect their activity and in doing in in these courses in these studies we discovered that there is indeed sort of a code built into the protein where different modifications drive it towards different pathways so for example loss of simulation which i talked about today was sufficient to convey regulation of 1 7. in other studies we found that phosphorylation in particular residues within crim2 can drive its interaction and activity regulation of calcium channels there are reports from our work and others that show in the interaction with an mda receptor so it's it's a multifunctional protein and coded into the structure and the sequence of crim2 are these modification sites which are really a code for driving and having different activities so we do we are looking at different uh residues that drive either phosphorylation simulation and some other modifications and ultimately it's going to be sort of an interplay between these residues and these modifications that will determine the outcome for chronic pain great i have another question here from rayochitaguchi from the philippines hi rayochi it's nice to know there's people that far away listening to us today and so this one is also for rajesh and it's about a pre-print publication about the 1.7 channel and from mcdonald in 2020 i don't know if you're aware of it but it's about it says it principally modulates the opioid urging system and he's wondering if your inhibitory compounds might also affect this system i was hoping to avoid that question and absolutely great question thank you and hello uh this is a great venue amazing across the world so thank you for that question absolutely to answer your question in short banner absolutely our mechanism is directly affecting the opioid system so for those that don't know i'll give a little bit of context in the last five to ten years particularly in groups in the uk and john wood and colleagues have shown that the reason that the sodium channel targeting drugs are failing is because they're not engaging the opioid system so what he's his group has shown particularly is that you have to completely suppress one seven which then drives up regulation of pro pre and keflans and some of these endogenous opioids and that could explain why the compounds that have been tried by other folks and other strategies haven't worked so we've looked at that mechanism and we have data all that data by the way i showed was unpublished with 194. so we we do have evidence that our compound through the suppression of crim2 simulation does engage and upregulate much like john woods group showed the pro preequin keflan pathway and we have some behavioral evidence to suggest that indeed there is a connection that is through the uh opioid pathway this was also verified by a group uh tim husho's group in germany so we are very convinced now that we are indeed engaging the mechanism and thereby and therefore perhaps our compound is likely to succeed where others have failed great question thank you great thanks rajesh and there's another question here from loretta bradley and unless there's another regret loretta brownlee somewhere in the world she's one of our own students here in galway so this one is actually for rajesh so and loretta wants to know rajesh if damage to neurons danish neurons has been known to lead to over expression of sodium channels so she wants to know if there was a differential over expression in the 1.4 and 1.7 channel in your models compared to other sodium channels there is uh that's been reported thank you for that question as well that has been reported by lots of groups we also see enough regulation but curiously and this i failed to mention this within the short time frame um the reason we're going after crim2 simulation as a potential way to manipulate one seven is because in the context of chronic pain in the injury situation the level of crim2 stimulation goes up so it's almost like a biomarker and in all cases we've seen the level of crim2 simulation goes up the channel expression goes up so the the targetable proteins are themselves plastic they're showing this change after injury and which really then reinforces the fact that we can control them in this manner but yes we are seeing uh up regulation we haven't followed it across the time course but we do see up regulation both at the current density level and the protein level in the channels and particularly in cryptosimulation and the total chemistry is not changed but the stimulation has changed okay brilliant there's one here for dave um really interesting question so it's from megan hannon and she asks about epilepsy so she said that um there's a high degree of co-morbidity with anxiety and effective disorders and epilepsy so she's wondering if there's been any studies showing that there's been improvement in effective states in epileptic patients that are on uh can an endocannabinoid modulating drugs oh yeah that's a very interesting question um well the big development in epilepsy i suppose in in recent years in the context of cannabinoids has been the launch to market of epidialex which is cbd or cannabidiol and drug by gw pharmaceuticals i got fda approval there a couple of years ago and this is specifically indicated for childhood epilepsy so dravet syndrome and lenos gusto um and um you know it hasn't been on the market very long the clinical trials were were quite positive and of course that's why it got its fda approval but um i'm not so aware of of data on on anxiety and depression in that cohort you know i mean the the primary endpoints there of course were seizures uh and it it is effective um cannabidiol in terms of um effects on reducing seizures um but i think we do need more data on on some of the comorbid symptoms of epilepsy uh in in those kids and and also in fact in in adults with epilepsy as well um yeah it's a really interesting question um i just don't think we have the day i'm not aware of the data at least for for cbd uh and negative affect in epilepsy and there are reasons to think i mean cbd is very different to to to fan inhibitors for example and cbd is has is quite a complex pharmacology um it's probably a negative allosteric modulator at cv1 but it may also have effects that gpr gpr55 and and and other targets as well um you know whereas obviously fan inhibitors are elevating you know and endocannabinoids and anamite specifically and then acetylamines and largely you know then having effects through the targets that an anthem binds to cp1 cb2 and others so um yeah it's hard to make a direct comparison with the kinds of drugs i was talking about and in my talk and cbd but um yeah the whole question of of anxiety depression co-morbidity and epilepsy and whether there's a role for in the cannabinoid system i think it needs further study yeah yeah yeah great um who have we got we've got one here from you feng zee for rajesh and what do you think is the relationship between crime 2 or crm p2 and 1.8 channel thank you for that question uh so we don't know uh the short answer is we don't know uh we know that crim2 is able to have regulation of on one seven and on cab 2.2 for example and we we see some residual currents still left even after the simulation is inhibited that are not one seven so there's something that's still as you saw from the data and some of our papers that there is some residual currents that might be still in play whether and how they um talk to and are regulated by crim2 we don't know we have evidence for example that some of the other currents are not affected by crimson particularly t type calcium channels so we haven't looked at 1.8 but um to be honest if it didn't affect one eight it wouldn't be that bad uh it is a also a high value pain target so um well i don't have an answer your question and unintended for uh crim2 affecting this channel would not be a bad thing thank you okay and we're coming up to the end of of time i'll take one one more question here and from andrew scarberts for dave so dave it's it's a relation it's in relation to somebody with a chronic pain obviously would have to take medic may have to take medication for long periods of time and he's just wondering about side effects of cannabis based medicines and particularly you know on the liver on liver function oh yeah yeah good another good question yes um i mean what continuing on with cbd then and cannabidiol you know there are some data um to suggest that cbd may have some negative effects on liver enzymes on um you know cytochrome p450 family of enzymes and indeed um reports that in those uh children who were who were taking cbd for childhood epilepsy that that levels of some of the other anti-epileptic drugs that they were on um were were higher when they were taking cbd um probably because of pharmacokinetic effects of cbd you know and effects on liver enzymes so um so i think you know cbd um people often say it's very safe it's not psychoactive um i think we need to be careful with that it actually is psychoactive it's just it's it's not psychotometic in the same way that thc is but actually it has effects in the brain and anxiolytic effects and clearly anti-epileptic effects and so it must be functioning in the brain and it does have a degree of psychoactivity um cannabis more generally um i i i mean we could talk about this for a long time there are obviously risks with with chronic cannabis use you know um um in the general uh population of users who use it recreationally there's about a nine percent um dependency to cannabis particularly if it starts in adolescence and with heavy thc high thc containing um strains but uh but then there are also risks around you know mild cognitive impairment perhaps um and then um for peripheral um you know cardiovascular risks as well um thc can induce tachycardia it can be quite marked um so there are there are risks and i think you know we probably need more clinical trials um with larger you know sample sizes for longer duration um particularly in pain we do have trials there's about 35 to 40 rcts and a number of them to do show some efficacy or be sometimes quite modest at the evidence probably best for neuropathic pain um but uh yeah i think we just need maybe studies of longer duration larger sample size and that focus a bit more on on adverse effects as well okay that was fantastic um i really want to thank everybody who participated today especially professor finn from galway in ireland and professor khanna from tucson in the united states and to all of you who joined up on to this webinar there was a lot of people
