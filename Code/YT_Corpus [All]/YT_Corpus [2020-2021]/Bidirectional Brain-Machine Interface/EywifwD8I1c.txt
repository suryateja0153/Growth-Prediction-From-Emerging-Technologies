 all right hi welcome to the threat protection workshop in the ignite learning zone uh my name is adam baron and i'm on the security marketing team and i'm joining you today from sunny maple valley washington just outside of seattle uh we're really excited for this all digital version of ignite obviously a huge uh milestone and something super new for all of us uh you know and if this is the first workshop you're taking it at ignite this year the workshops are designed to be a great place to get started with microsoft's learning solutions there's lots of learning opportunities and so today we're going to take you through some of that around threat protection and i'm joined today by a set of experts from our engineering teams that can help uh answer all your questions across the variety of threat protection solutions at microsoft so if you have questions please put those in the chat window or the q a window and we'll get to as many of those as we can all right now first of all what i want to do is just introduce those experts so as you can see we have a variety of those experts we've got zv from the m365 defender team jeff and haika from microsoft defender for endpoint ed from microsoft defender for office 365. uh tai uh from microsoft defender for identity and itamar from microsoft cloud app security so we've got a wide group of folks that are all going to be able to help us uh to answer any of your questions today so again feel free to put those in the q a window and as we get started you i mentioned at the beginning that microsoft has a wide array of learning opportunities because you can see on this this quick screen grab here these are all designed to help you get going as you continue your journey of learning at microsoft especially around security whether you're just getting started or you're a seasoned expert we've got lots of great resources we have things like learning paths for you to go in and get uh started to understand the depth resources that you have you can take instructor-led classes all to sort of culminate in the certifications that we've got we have both an ms500 and an azure security certification all around us the security solutions today now those topics from a learning path perspective cover a variety of elements they cover the full gamut from identity to threat protection cloud security and azure security as well as information protection and compliance so this really is your one-stop place to go get all the learning capabilities from microsoft around security compliance and identity and today you know our workshop is going to drill down into that threat protection learning path and today's workshop you know these are new experiences for all of us so it's going to be a little bit different uh what we're going to go do first of all with microsoft the threat protection capabilities is we're going to learn a little bit about the new announcements we made at ignite today this morning if you didn't see them already in the keynote from vasu we're talk a little bit about how defender is now the most extensive xdr solution in the market then we're going to do a super deep dive demo led by our engineering experts to show you microsoft 365 defender in action then we're going to close with an overview of the learning path that you can go get started with today and you can ask any questions of any of the folks on this call and we'll we'll do our best to answer all those questions for you so with that in mind we really want to start you know grounding everyone in our threat protection solutions you know today's threat landscape really requires a new worldview and we think of that as a zero trust worldview this world view really requires an incredible understanding of your environment you have to be able to understand who's accessing what an identity the devices the apps the infrastructure infrastructure and the data you know at some levels it seems it's almost requires you to know everything about all the the elements of your environment all the time and it has to work with everything that you care about across clouds across os platforms and applications whether those are microsoft's or not it's a tough task but it's one that gets easier with our solutions for microsoft you know if we look at this diagram and starting at the center microsoft has an approach uh to both broaden and deepen your understanding of your entire estate and everything going on inside of it this is driven off of two central pillars that help inform all of what we do you know one is this idea of machine learning and machine learning uh helps to drive our is driven by our unique breadth of data microsoft has a massive amount of signal and it has more comprehensive signal across you know modern workplace and cloud infrastructure which gives you faster insights with greater accuracy and then second microsoft employs thousands of researchers and engineers like the folks we'll have on the call today to help drive to understand you know these new macro trends around security the threat landscapes as well as unique attacks and then anomalies for you know these indiv and helping you understand anomalies for your individual company these insights are built into oh excuse me one one slide too many uh these insights are built into our products uh to help superpower your security your superpower your security teams in a couple of ways um you know first that's protection you think about your security teams have the ability with microsoft solutions so they to stay on top of any new attacks in a really efficient way you know very few of our customers say they have enough security resources to take care of all the security tasks so being able to provide tools that automate responses and in some cases respond entirely automatically really helps to drive efficiency inside of a sock and all of this helps save your team time and lets them focus on critical items then there's this idea of prevention being able to stay on top of the endless to-do list of you know everything that you need to do to make attacks useless to begin with is sometimes daunting and the things like updating devices and configurations uh is sometimes uh you know a thankless task it's you know the thing about hygiene here is that it's essential sometimes it's thankless and it's never-ending so being able to help automate and and drive more consistency around prevention is really critical and so there's two key solutions that we have in this space the first one is azure sentinel this is our cloud powered scene uh that gives you a breadth of insight across all of the tools in your in one place and then there's microsoft defender which gives you depth of insight on your modern workplace and your cloud infrastructure now let's take a quick second and talk about sentinel we're going to focus on microsoft 365 defender today but i wanted to spend a minute on sentinel you know first of all sentinel is microsoft's cloud native uh seam solution this is not an on-prem tool that's imported to the cloud it's brand new it's built for the world of cloud connected data it scales across any data and any workload and we announced even today a variety of new connectors that you can put additional data into microsoft sentinel or excuse me azure sentinel and of course azure sentinel is powered by ai and this idea of microsoft's security brain in the cloud all the telemetry and data that we that we see makes microsoft solutions and azure sentinels smarter over time and of course azure sentinel works best with our defender elements with our defender suite microsoft 365 defender and azure uh defender this really is this best end-to-end threat protection and we continue to invest in sentinel uh we were recently announcing this idea of iot support with our acquisition of cyberx we're adding new um user and entity behavioral analytics tools this is a huge ask for customers and we have thread integration information from threat quotient and we have a variety of elements there as well so it's even easier to connect your data to the cloud with all the connectors that we're creating so that's a little bit about sentinel now we think about the the second solution in this tool the idea of microsoft defender uh microsoft defender in this case is microsoft's complete cross-domain protection across end user computing and infrastructure and we're making a variety of changes today we're actually changing some names and making microsoft defender uh our lead product here so microsoft defender as you can see on the slide is made up of two things it's microsoft 365 defender formerly known as microsoft threat protection and azure defender which is formerly the cloud workload protection pro elements inside azure security center so this azure defender tool is all native and built into your azure workloads today it has a massive adoption it's already protecting 95 of the vms in azure and it's now cross-cloud this is a super important part of the story it allows you to extend those controls to on-prem with azure arc and now to gcp and aws workloads and you have so you have one control plane and management fabric to understand your security across your entire estate and then today the second element is microsoft defender right microsoft defender uh mike as we fl fast forward here's microsoft 365 defender is this fully integrated cross domain xdr or extended detection and response solution it provides your organization with the ability to prevent detect investigate and remediate cross-domain attacks within their microsoft 365 environment and those domains are identity endpoints cloud apps email and document email and docs so this is an important element because microsoft 365 helps you automatically detect these breaches across these domains do analysis and it correlates these this data to turn silo siloed alerts into end-to-end incidents that help tell a story with context and timeline of how an attack is entered how it spreads across your environment and it enables you to proactively hunt across your m365 data and helps you search for breaches and helps you gain a better understanding of your data to help build custom detection remediation with tools now we talk about these domains for just a second microsoft 365 really is both a best of sweet integrated cape uh set of capabilities and a best-in-class set of tools across each of these domains we think about identity that's really protected by azure active directory identity protection microsoft cloud app security and now microsoft defender for identity which is formerly azure advanced threat protection on the endpoint side this is microsoft defender for endpoint formerly microsoft defender advanced threat protection a leader in gartner's magic quadrant and apps uh microsoft cloud app security is our lead here uh also um uh you know uh office or excuse me microsoft defender for office 365 which used to be uh microsoft or excuse me office 365 atp which also protects email documents so really when you integrate these products your security perimeter becomes even stronger microsoft 365 leverages all the raw signal from these individual domains identity endpoint apps email and docs and then analyzes that signal uh to bring that together into those incidents like i talked about so then you get a whole bunch of really powerful workflow and a and ai to help auto heal and really automatically remediate against attacks this is a super important part again across azure defender microsoft 365 defender coming together with microsoft defender so like i said that correlation of data into this integrated incident view is what we're going to focus on today and this is where it really comes to life and so with that we're going to switch over to our engineering counterpart zv who's going to join us and do a demo of how microsoft 365 defender actually brings this to life so zv i'm going to turn it over to you now and uh i'm looking forward to seeing microsoft 365 defender in action hi everyone adam can you just confirm everybody can hear me i can sure hear ya hey so good day everyone my name is steven schaefer i'm a program manager on the microsoft track protection engineering team and probably for the next 30 minutes maybe more we'll take that take our time i'll try to walk you through uh that integrated solution of uh microsoft's 365 defender and probably less capable of following the name changes as good as adam did i'll do my best so i'm going to share my screen here moment i forgot to do that okay cool and i'm going to walk you through microsoft 365 defender but first before we do that i'm gonna set the stage and maybe give you an appetite to go and learn more about the individual solution as well as the overall xdr suite by actually trying to put ourselves for a moment in the shoes of a security operation analyst uh looking at various alerts coming from various platforms and in this case all of the microsoft platforms that's what i'm using for the demo but your reality could be multiple kind of best of breed solutions that completely behave and look different and have different type of that have uh different terminology different portals different locations everything so um i'll connect all that together so the as we progress through the demo but let's start with a day of an analyst that's looking at in this case looking at cloud app security we're looking at sorry email um microsoft defender for email and looking at that alert in this case this was an alert uh with malware that was uh detected after delivery and our solution going went into a zap uh capability went unclean but there is still uh the our concern that barbara and roberto here on these two email accounts may have received that email and something happened so me as a stock at that point just try to go to the mental uh note of what am i going through i probably want to check what happened with these two users to his two emails accounts so i'll need to find out what machines they have i'll probably need to go into another portal another solution uh plug in these machines and go and look at their timeline around the time of delivery here to see if something was downloaded something was clicked something progressed from the fact that they actually received that email and i was not able to clean them out of their mailboxes in time uh and i may want to go into maybe my identity solution if i have one uh and kind of look at the status of these was there any suspicious login was there anything uh out of bound done with their user i may want to even go into my gas machine microsoft cloud app security and see if under that user there's any access to new types of applications there's any uh login uh into any of their cloud applications right after that email was received so i have a lot of questions that i want to ask and that's a single alert that i'm getting uh on my um on my system and i'm probably going to now have a list something before i can actually dismiss that as denying nothing happened or have more questions and go down the investigation let's look at another let we know now because i'm going to do a demo that they all connected but let's look at another alert this alert has a different user this one is a portable credential set from ntts so someone dropped dropped the domain server uh ntds file um that's a completely different alert we have different use here there is a um some information about the severity of the internet again a lot of information i can go and do recently from here but what i would probably try to understand again the status of that user who connected where did that come from i can see the command line that ran uh in order to dump this file and copy it into the c drive so um i learned a lot but i still don't have a full scope i understand it's something probably not as good unless this is a benign activity and maybe janet is uh someone that should be doing this activity but i got an alert and i need now to correlate it across other things that are happening uh let's look at just another one so this is from our uh advanced threat protection on action directory so microsoft defender for identity has the new name and i have another alert and this is a suspicious uh suspected overpass the hash attack and in this case now i may be able to start connecting it because i see that the resource had actually connected and used roberto's credentials was barbara that's the same user that i had on our alert for the email that was received so at this point i'm probably understanding that i have an issue there was an email that was received there was uh uh some activity from barbara using credentials of roberto to log into uh dc uh this me knowing my t information i know that this is my adisi we named it easy to understand um and again i have a lot of questions what's the connection what happened did i lose basically control over barbara's pc does someone have barbara's credentials is this malicious what else what other users got hit by maybe that same email or this type of fish have a lot of questions and i'm jumping in between these kind of views and portals to try and stitch everything together so the daily work that we have on the huge amount of earths be it we are individual teams that uh if we have a very big sock team then we are maybe specializing on remediating and protecting our endpoint and someone there's another team specializing on stuff that's coming from email and there's another one that's looking at identity in that case they will probably need to meet at some point open a onenote open an excel sheet like we do in microsoft start dropping them all these iocs and stuff and start stitching the picture together it's time consuming it's a manual process and for a lot of that we can probably apply uh what we're building in terms of logic to build incidents and apply automation to try and help you get ahead of the curve so with that i'll go into different view let's close these individual learners we'll probably get back to them into the story and what we did with microsoft 365 defender is actually connect these four domains into one integrated solution and this is not connecting them at a portal level only and connecting them for you to have one comfortable place to go and do all your work this is them actually joining them at the hip these solutions are now talking to each other and think about endpoint alert and the microsoft defender for endpoint can go and basically if you want the logic of the detection can go and query the status of the user which underneath that alert privileges was run and that level of alert could change for that individual solution even before we connect that all to an incident based on uh the status of the user or something that came through email before that or uh some suspicious activity that happened in this that we found on casbi so the individual solutions work better when they can actually make decisions based on data that's available across multiple workloads and not just looking through the keyhole only of the problem let's say of email without understanding what actually continued happening on endpoint or the level of integrity of the user for example uh here on the incident we're actually changing the way that checkups start working so versus working on hundreds hundreds of sorry versus working on hundreds of uh individual alerts from verticals and different workloads that you have start thinking about working on the level of an incident and some of these could be 50 alerts global together and some of them could be only one alert and you will ask why so we need to create an incident from one alert and the answer is that this is also an important information to know that this is a singular event that is we couldn't correlate to anything else that's happening in your environment is also something that will help your stock make to determine the decision so that priorities prioritize that is it benign uh do i know what it means there's other machines involved uh on the other hand i can collapse 50 we see hundreds of alerts sometimes collapse into a single incident for example if you have uh a good email campaign happening against your organization good meaning the attacker is good you may have hundreds of associated emails that may be polymorphic and uh the body can change the sender can change attachment can change but still we can associate them to the same campaign and we can collapse all that into one incident helping you understand the scope and helping you uh see whatever is part of that so i'm gonna dive into one of these um we can name them we're naming them here in our demo tenant just for us to easy what the system will do automatically for you is actually try to create a meaningful name for you uh based on what was part of that so the multi-stage incident involving privileges scheduled multiple endpoints reported by multiple sources indicates that we have a multi-stage incidence uh we can see here the detection sources uh my apologies that our naming convention will take more time to change on software than on marketing slides so expect these to change on the product into their uh new names but you can see here the detection sources of hazard atp or edr microsoft cloud app security custom ti that we fed into the system anti-virus detections office atp detections and even alerts well i'll show you shortly that were only possible when you're connecting multiple data sets so this microsoft thread protection alert is not an individual workload alert it's an alert that has been possible by stitching together two type of events uh that together had been elevated to an alert and we couldn't do that without actually connecting these multiple data sets so i'm gonna take this one which is quite um a very extensive attack that we took by compromising uh barbara's machine as he saw in some of these alerts and she will then um do some reconnaissance uh eventually uh get uh roberto which is uh uh an admin uh credentials there is log into a domain server dump those uh files over there and then at the end this ends up in the restoration but um what i want to show you through this demo is the overview that you can actually get very quickly as a psycho to understand the scope and then how deep easily you can go into each one of these individual alerts and finish by doing some advanced hunting and show you how you can expand that over the full data set ask more questions and create your custom detections based on what happened so first thing you will see is you land on the summary page the summary page will try to give you at a glance uh the information that we have about that incident you can get a little bit more information here on the on the side when it started uh who is it assigned to how is it classified this one we already closed uh there are other incidents that this is associated to uh we are attacking that environment this is our government over and over every week so they look the same they have the same um if you want entities so there is some hint here that other things that may pop up in your environment if another campaign started and it has similar uh uh indications to something that happened in the past okay so you may want to associate that i'm going to close that for a moment we can see all the alerts or at least the main ones that are popped as part of that incident and we can start reading and threading to that we can see all the entities that were found on that i'm going to jump into the alert page itself and let's try to understand a little bit better uh what is part of that again to the right you can see the detection source that raids that specific alert uh the time the impact identity be it a device be it a user uh whatever is that uh status oops that was good sorry for that let's re-authenticate and go back hopefully that's not going to happen again this has been idling for a while so i had to re-authenticate us okay let's see if that works great so here you can see that by actually collecting all that together you can already understand the amount of work that we solved for the salk analyst even at tier one level i'm able to actually read through that incident with even not very deep understanding of everything that happened here and have a good idea of the chain of events that happened probably uh ending with credential steps and and expectation of data outside of organization i can quickly look at the number of devices that were impacted and i'll show you how we go into that in a moment i can look at the users that have been impacted as part of this uh attack i can look at the mailboxes that can be detected and i will see all the automated investigation that kicked in uh as part of that and tried during the attack to actually go and auto heal the environment for you as this was unfolding and also a list of all the evidence if you want to go and investigate and reject each one of them which one was uh suspicious which one was actually vetted malicious and what was remediated for you so let's go back to the alert page and try to dive i have some questions i'll go and uh look at some a deeper uh alert in this case so in this case this is a uh defender advantage protection um uh sorry microsoft filter for endpoint uh alert and in this case i can see uh that this was remediated uh i'll see the alert story populate in a moment probably too many people doing too many demos in the same time we'll get back to it in a moment with respect to that i'm going to go straight into the investigation that thought so what happened here is our auto ir capability or selfie capability uh kicked in based on a specific alert so while we do have a whole dictionary of detections if you want uh indications of compromise or indications of attack um and we have these uh traps of alerts across the four workloads that feed into this uh we also have a dictionary of playbooks uh and in auto investigations that can actually kick in based on a specific type for the alert and go and do investigation proactively on that alert vet the entities or the the findings of this investigation by comparing them to various total reputation of ips running them to a live sandbox that we have in the cloud in order to understand if we have something which is vetted malicious if we have something that's vetted malicious then we can do something about that based on what workloads you have connected and how you configure your system it will take actions if you are actually one in fully automated mode maybe a moment to pause and say our auto ir system can run in semi-automated mode of fully automated mode it can be customized to run on certain devices device groups and users in your organization or not run based on sensitivity you can do automated for some of the groups semi-automated for other ones you may want to have a livestock analyst vet a um isolate machine decision on satya's machine for example manually before we actually go and isolate this machine uh but for other machines uh that are less let's say um on your critical business applications you may want to stop that right away automatically and prevent the spread of the attack in your organization so in this case investigation kicks in uh we actually were able to analyze uh 300 3 000 files process it up and uh up and loaded in memory drivers ip addresses connected uh persistent methods it will actually go to a library of persistent methods and see if anything happened on the machine and at the end of the day to remediate that specific document cleaned it off machines that was the specific action that it could take against that endpoint so go back to the alerts um and actually um go into the alert queue and i wanted to show you another case of an investigation so let me go back into the incident lost my track here let's look at a different type of investigation nope that's not the one that i want okay i'm gonna go into um this we did already so let's look at another interesting one uh down the attack itself let's look at uh suspicious credential theft on the activity i wanted to show you here the the rich um actually timeline of the alert itself the full process tree that we can actually look um on that full incident tree to understand how we progressed and went down um from the service that executed uh what was run get the information about uh um open that on the site and get a little bit more information about that all the alerts that was associated in that tree there's several alerts that all part of that three of events that happened all that activity i'm gonna go back into the incident and actually look at the users that have been impacted and see how much i can learn about the user itself so hello yes that's what i figured oh that's where my siri kicking in and helping me in my presentation sorry um by fact that we are stitching all these solutions together uh i have the ability from one system to pivot left and right and understand the scope of that incident in this case because i understand that barbara is part of that specific incident and she's probably a key uh to starting uh the infiltration into my organization and from here she moved i can actually go directly into a user uh page uh and bring this is a user page that brings information from multiple um workloads okay so i have here information from my login events information for my device information for my cloud app security and even information for my email source here and i can see that this user is very high we are using barbara uh for most of our attacks and demos here so week after week she's very high she's on the 92 percent of presenters in the organization there is a list of all the risky uh um events and suspicious stuff that happened over that user i can see that she logged in from multiple locations which is a bad indication by itself she's logged into a lot of resources here is a suspicious uh indication which we saw in the other alerts that she actually logged into roberto's pc we know she has now his credentials and she's able to log into his pc from here she moved into um other uh domains are actually uh roberto move now because she now owns roberto's id the device says that she's been logged into um um as as part of that time frame uh etc so there's a lot of information i can uh all the open alerts that i have specifically um about that uh user impossible travel risky signing numbers ip all the stuff that we had on barbara and i can actually go into users and do something very interesting so let's try to expand what we know about barbara because i understand now that i want to understand her activity a little bit deeper and let's say i have questions that are beyond what i can get here or i want to create a little deep deeper view for that so i'm going to pivot from here to our go hunt capability which is basically opening our hunting capability across the datasets a few words on what we did here we did a lot of work on our backend to actually normalize the data across email identity endpoints and applications only to a schema where alert is an alert a user is a user device as a device and everything can actually be joined uh into a single query you can see here on the side that we actually bring into the schema alert information evidence information so all the entity types and everything that you can measure from that incident you see app and identity so identity queries and events uh application and file events inside the email you have email post delivery uh information that i can actually match into my query i have email pre delivery events on the devices i can look at very detailed device event registry event logon event network connection events and threat vulnerability if i want to check entities against what we know on the threat vulnerability which is part of our defender for endpoint solution so we're looking here at an automated if you want query that was created based on the context of what we're looking at and this is actually looking at the timestamp of when that alert happened it's looking at barbara's id uh it's it's trying to search for all the device login events process event device network events all around that one hour plus hour to that alert and i'm getting here all these events across all these let's go and try to narrow and look at something more specific okay so in this case let's look at identity queries so what identity identities did bob query um during uh that time frame let's expand a little bit on the time frame just to be safe in terms of when to run that on the attack scenario so we're going to expand it a little bit and let's run that again so now we're actually looking at a more narrow question right or what are all the identity query events run by barbara within that time frame and i can see that she was looking at harry gobble's uh um information and the um domain admin information and i can customize my query here i can go and create a detection rule with a range of users with a range of information that will then uh capture that in the future this is an amazing tool that we actually uh are giving you because think about it all the raw data is now available for you to actually write your custom detection rules and take custom actions against that um i wanted to give you an example of a cross i'm going to discard the changes for the sake of other people that are going that demo uh here is an example of something that you can do over that data that joins two of the worlds together okay so we're looking at emails right in the last 30 days we're looking at specific domains in this case the demo environment is quite small so i'm looking at all the domains that are not part of what i call my organization and i'm going to project all that information but i'm also going to look and see if i had any login event that followed um that event after someone uh received that external uh email and that will that's kind of if you want a interesting question to ask right because i'm looking for a very suspicious suspicious email it has at least one link in it so it has where one url in it and after someone received that type of email there was a logon event and i can see that the email i can see where it came from i can see the logon time the account name the timestamp and all the information that can go on uh there is another one that we can actually run here this is to see if there was actually um any file download uh follow that and then we can we're actually now looking for something a little bit more sophisticated right we're looking for a very specific email range with a login event and then was a download or maybe a payload onto that and i can i can see that what happened here the file path where it will download and and customize what queries uh according to that this can be turned into a detection rule uh have defined what's the name of that alert you know your environment better than anyone else you may have your own uh intel that's coming in that's specific to your vertical where you want to write a very specific detection you may know that a certain group of people is not supposed to be outside of the country in certain time and you want to capture if they're logging in so you can create your own traps uh that are very specific to your organization based on that you can also very easily using gohan go and expand on an existing incident uh and go ask more questions with that i want to show you uh the action center uh where what we're doing here is we're taking um all the auto ir um alerts um let me close a few tabs here on walmart sorry go back to the action center and this is the one-stop shop for all the automated investigation that took place in the actions that you need to um take so i'm looking at the history here and i want to filter um let's filter on type of actions on quarantine files so let's look at all the auto ir that happened and and where we took an action to quarantine the file um to see if uh let's say i'm going in and auditing what's happened and i was running and fully automated and i wanted to make sure that nothing happened so i'm gonna look at let's say suspicious machine so i want to look and see what happened on the dc because i want to make sure that we didn't block anything or cause any damage so i'm now filtering down to all the quarantine file that happened automatically on that specific dc and i can get more information on that specific um file that run uh it was the asset is on full auto the this the health status is active what did happen more information that i want to know about that specific action that happened and with that i think i covered uh the main building blocks i think of what you get out of meshing these solutions together uh i wanted just to point out that microsoft 365 defender will work either if you had only one of the detection sources uh applied so if you just had for example uh microsoft defender for office 365 uh the logic of the incident will still help you collapse uh incidents that have common uh uh case so they are part of the same campaign into a single incident even if you didn't have the other solutions passed in add to it uh the endpoint protection you will get more visibility to what happened in the end point and be able to stitch together but the capability of actually creating the incident condensing all the auto ir and then having advanced hunting above your data will work what if you have one of the solutions two of the solutions or all of them uh it's also part of the solution there is no uh you don't need to configure that to turn that on the solutions once they are in your same tenant are working together and connected there is no extra deployment or configuration needed for that it's all part of the solution um and you get all this out of the box last words of out of the box uh a lot of you are probably doing that and and that's where the industry was working in the last i would say five years uh you're building a lot of that over your uh sims source solutions in-house solutions meaning you're um you're you have a team dedicated to actually design and write these correlations and then build playbooks and trying to stay ahead of the curve uh by actually understanding new attack vectors changing in your environment changing in the detection choices that are happening microsoft defender microsoft 365 defender gives you all that out of the box the raw data you can go and hunt off out of the box without needing to pipe pipe it into a single location and then normalize the data and go hunt over it the ability to stitch all these smart correlations this is not only naive correlations we do much more than just alert to alert correlation we'll do event to event correlation will do actually logic of advanced hunting inside of the incident logic so by looking at one alert the system will go and ask questions to actually understand if this progress somewhere uh automation kicking in with playbooks that we keep updating based on things that we are learning in in the world in the wild and how we can auto remediate them for you that are getting maintained and updated currently uh all the time by our research team all that comes out of the box as part of microsoft 365 security um and with that i'll hand it back to adam to show you where you can learn more about that solution and then use the rest of the time to probably take questions and address some of the questions thank you yeah awesome that was great really really exciting to see uh microsoft 365 defender in action and there were some great questions really appreciate the engagement from um from the folks on the uh on the on the meeting thank you again for that there were a couple things that v that we saw um kind of asked a few different times the first one you may want to weigh in there were some great great answers as well in the q a but there were the the question that was asked a couple of times which was which was around hey what's the difference between microsoft 365 defender and sentinel and i think the the the quick answer and you can expand on this be if you'd like to but the quick answer here is really that like you know microsoft 365 defender is your place to hunt and to do this automated security uh you know depth investigation for your microsoft 365 workloads for things that that are part of that microsoft 365 environment this the sentinel is a seam it is the place where you feed all the rest of your invent information and that kind of governs across all the rest of the things that's a super high level i don't know if you'd want to add to that v but that was a really common question yes that's a question i get a lot on our executive briefing center when i talked to csos uh yeah and let me let me give you two views of the same uh and and uh i said that and there's a um i think there's a dedicated session that talks about the integration but um uh look at it from for two points of view sentinel is your single source of truth if you want to pipe in as as adam mentioned all the information all the event logs that you're getting from third-party software from microsoft offer into one place uh incident coming from microsoft defender uh one extra 365 defender is one entity that you're pushing into sentinel and that's where you uh cross that information that's where you manage the queue of your work that's where you are able to correlate microsoft incident maxwell defender 365 defender incident with additional data that you might have lob application network tools any other tool you may not have the microsoft full stack only parts of it and you want to match that information together you will start your work usually most of the most of the socks that we visit will live inside of that queue of that same write their prioritization and their methods and how to manage the cues of their resolved incidents and then sign them to different teams and we'll probably deep dive into microsoft 365 defender to do a deeper look in what i just did in investigating that specific incident over the properties that are available on microsoft the other way around i microsoft physics by defender uh engineer mike when i finish my presentation a lot of the customers say okay but i want to bring into your incident logic my my palo alto network logs for example okay and i want to correlate them can you do that for me and get that feed into you and i'll say my extension tool for that my third party connector is sentinel okay so we will always look at sentinel for pulling in additional information to augment on the data that we can give you out of the box on microsoft properties and we will try to give you as much as we can out of the box on the properties that we can control out of the microsoft stack so hopefully that answer is kind of where we see the relation happening uh that connector by the way between these two solutions will allow you to seamlessly resolve the incidental alerts on on sentinel get them resolved on the end point uh their debt connection is bi-directional advanced hunting uh over the data if you decide to pump all the data from uh microsoft defender into your sentinel sim solution you can uh we will build over time a query parity so you can actually run the same quality over these two uh data sources of course if you then added to that a third party then that hunting happens inside of central hopefully that clarify that yeah that's helpful to me thank you um the other question kind of thematic question that we saw was around everyone's favorite licensing um a lot of questions on like what do you have to own to get all the goodness that we're showing here and some various products there um just to be clear so microsoft 365 defender shows up uh in a couple of places right so he has microsoft 365 e3 license which includes office e3 windows e3 and ems e3 and then there's microsoft 365 e5 and that includes uh office e5 windows e5 and ems e5 and so if you the capabilities around microsoft defender for endpoints and microsoft defender for uh for office 365 as well as microsoft defender for identity those are all capabilities that are included in that e5 package um so that's the that's the the offering that um most of the capabilities you saw were showcased um everyone has access to the defender portal that that owns uh elements of these capabilities but really it gets richer and more integrated the more of these services you have turned on and working together uh just as a point of clarity i wanted to figure out just be just be clear on what you have to buy to get what things um and there were some other questions on like how do i bridge this gap you know we talked about defender being about microsoft 365 and azure defender and the azure defender is kind of a different like um a different thing that you license right like on the microsoft 365 you pay for your users and then on your uh azure side you pay basically consumption and so on the azure defender piece of it it's really a per vm model and then you know your partner or your account team will be able to help you find the right licensing elements to get exactly what you need um there are sort of step ups and bridges and how to get to the pieces that you need so you can buy it all together in these e5 bundles or you can buy each piece of it separately i just wanted to take a second to clarify that because it's always a great question um with that i wanted to just wrap us up uh you know around the learning path you know where do you go from here with your depth learning um one of the questions you can see in the q a i pointed people to our virtual hub as well i'll reflect that that link in there uh but there you can go get um additional depth content here as well as things like interactive guides so you can actually follow along and almost have a video presentation of very similar to what v just just uh walked us through those get updated really uh frequently and so we'll always have those up to date continue you know as we land new capabilities and features while we don't have this live demo available for everybody to access uh those things are great substitutes to help you get up and ready on the learning side of it and so for those that want to spend some additional time now uh you know we're we we have this time sort of blocked off for the next about 20 minutes or so and so if you wanted to drive into actually one of these learning paths this is the one that we're suggesting here you know we think about this idea of defending against threats with with microsoft threat protection now microsoft 365 defender um this is a great place to get started and as you take a look here if i if i can get my slide to advance there we go um there's four chapters inside of this threat protection uh learning path for modules if you will and so you can you can understand that each of these modules include a variety of things like videos or written content or links to other depth elements you can go and consume at your leisure and then you know the nice thing that i i like is that you can see about how long each of these modules take to complete you know if you need to budget an hour or two hours or even a half an hour you can kind of chunk that out and determine it you know on your schedule as you can see these four elements that exist today there's an introduction which kind of covers a lot of the stuff that i cover at the beginning of this session um around what microsoft 365 protection or microsoft 365 defender does what's included um those kinds of things and then you can deep dive into additional chapters from there on endpoint protection with microsoft defender for endpoint office 365 protection for defender for office 365 and then identity protection with microsoft defender for identity so each of those four elements of this learning path are great places to go get started um you know again uh as we as we flip to the next slide here you can find this link and i'll pop this into the chat window here as well um if i can copy it and paste it we'll get there in a second i'll put that into the q a window and you can uh take a look at that that'll take you directly to the module here um that takes about 28 minutes to complete and if you want to you can you can walk through that uh so uh with that i just want to pause i think we're you know a little bit ahead of schedule um we can give you 15 or 20 minutes back so you can go grab some lunch or a snack before you get to your next ignite session and just encourage you to go and learn about you know the rest of the security capabilities we have at microsoft that will be talking through at ignite there's a variety of what we call ask the expert sessions so if you take a look and even just search for xdr in the ignite catalog you'll find an ask the expert session or two there that are optimized for um for giving you more exposure to experts like we have on the call today um so you can go and do that as well um so with that i am just going to pause really quickly and see if there's any questions particularly on the learning path element of this that we'll want to answer and i don't see any here adam yeah i thought i don't know if one of the smiths on the call had a very interesting maybe question on the specific workload or something they want to call out um maybe give an opportunity is there anyone um of the experts that think there's a question they want to answer a little bit broadly that came up yeah it's a great yeah so if there are specific um workload questions you're saying go ahead and pop those in we'll we'll have you know again we want to make sure we use as much of this time as we can um and there was a question here about where do i go to get access to this stuff like where can i see it i talked about how you can you know you get access to the value that you have that you own you can go to security.microsoft.com if you're an admin that's the place you can go um heiko was kind enough to put that into the chat the q a window there as well so you can go get started today i think the other great place to start too is secure score uh you can go to secure score which is our report report card basically it's also part of security.microsoft.com and it gives you recommendations of things to go do next if you're just getting started all right any any of the q and a that you see in there oh thanks uh for popping in that that fret intro aka link that's the place where you can get started with this learning path if people are interested i actually going through the answers and i see uh great answers from the from the moderators thank you uh um ik jeff hi everyone that's on that uh answering these questions um i'm good thank you cool yeah and there's a couple questions about you know there's i can take that there's the last one i thought we answered that as well that came from tim uh asking if we can manage all these alerts for a single interface uh now they have a defender solution so the answer is it's coming uh and we are just a few weeks behind the corner on that i think one of the sessions is uh announcing a lot of the new stuff that's coming up uh we're already running private preview of that expect the public preview shortly uh single api to microsoft 365 defender to allow you by directing api to raw data events incidents and also into your uh hunting so you can actually use apis into hunting and auto air all that is coming as a single conductor you will not need to use individual connectors as you've been doing so far with the microsoft product see one product for m365 security we went with the uh m3 ms 365 defender apis live last week for private or public public i will i will add the link again someone else asked earlier and so i have the link somewhere here so coming up okay yeah so the innovation is coming fast and furious in the space it's a huge investment area for microsoft so um again you can go take a look at that uh oh i was gonna i think i grabbed the security um so i'll just make a quick announcement you can go to the security compliance hub or security identity and compliance up and you can take a look at all you can get additional data on there's some training around threat hunting you can find some of that stuff so great i think with that um i think we've answered just about all the questions um and again i just really want to thank everyone for coming to this all digital ignite and participating with us with the workshop as we're sort of figuring out how to work all this stuff together with you we're really excited that you took the time to learn more about microsoft 365 defender and our threat protection capabilities um do make sure that you take a look at the follow-on kind of items go visit the virtual hub take a look at the rest of the sessions within the microsoft 365 and azure security catalog attend those ask the expert sessions we want to make sure you get a lot of opportunities to get all of your questions answered so with that i just want to thank everyone again on behalf of zv and all the rest of the engineering team that we had answering questions furiously in the background or feverishly in the background i just want to say thanks again and enjoy the rest of your ignite experience
