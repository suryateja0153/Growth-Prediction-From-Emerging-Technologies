 My name is John Beck I'm the Executive Director for the National Center for Autonomous Technologies. I want to put that out there because I know we've got a couple of new faces that may be plugging into this call today. We've got a group that's come together pretty fast and furious and doing a lot of brainstorming in the last couple of weeks looking at a transition to distance delivery environments both for the virtual classroom transition that we're seeing across Technical Education but a lot of the core NCAT team members have a lot of activities coming up as far as educator workshops, stem camps, student competitions and and those different types of activities that would typically be ramping up right now into the summer and through the fall on and looking at the current situation we know it's not going to be possible. We've cancelled most of those events and are kind of looking at new and innovative ways to still be able to reach out to those participants and still have some of those same activities in a different format. So that's been the group coming together here and almost were on the the line last week where we did a high-level overview of everything from VR to video capture and the intent moving forward is to have some more detailed nuts and bolts sessions like what you're going to see today that that dive into each of those different areas that we'd talked about. In the case of today we're looking at virtual conferences and collaborative environments we've got MarK Gill with the St. Cloud State Visualization Lab or VizLab who's going to be talking about how to create more engaging environments. I know like many of you I'm sitting in virtual meetings, zoom and in teams 4 to 6 hours a day right now and that's a daunting task. I know Vince is planning out the GeoEd conference that's taking place in June and kind of thinking about how to really enhance then engagement, realizing it's going to be tough for people to be sitting a computer all day long so I think the presentation that Mark's going to put on today, looking at how to create more engaging virtual environments is going to be really good to kind of lead that discussion and we've had meetings between caves a center or aviation not a motive technological education using virtual East schools and we've had conversations with caves and st. Cloud State here in the last week kind of looking at some of these different dynamics SES you focusing on the presentation today and then caves is gonna do a follow-on presentation looking at the development of digital interactive content they've been a nationally they're funded by the National Science Foundation for many many years focused on that that type of resource and providing that out so they're gonna do a follow up here I just got an email from Kapil who may also be on the line it looks like we're targeting the May 5th date at 1:00 p.m. to have that discussion which I know as is something both of these presentations are going to be something of interest for both the group but we also see on a national scale right now a lot of people trying to figure out how to transition to the digital distance modalities then thinking about Technical Education and how far you can push those boundaries I think we've got Craig MACD with the National Coalition of advanced technology centers on the line as well who had facilitated a interesting discussion with AACC last week kind of talking about their positioning and concerns with the Technical Education transition into these environments and how far you can push that limit and I know that something Kapil be able to talk about in his presentation is all the great resources they have and the methodology that they use for development of the tasks and skills and evaluate criteria that goes into their work so lots of good presentations coming down down the road here and I guess it won't take up any more time with the introduction I'll pass this back to Marc Gill with the visualization lab at Saint Cloud State to lead today's discussion and then we'll kind of talk about the follow up after that yes yes I can hear you and I see your screen okay so what we're looking at here this is a virtual space that we've constructed that we use as a classroom and a presentation environment there's several areas of this and it's designed to facilitate classroom presentation and group discussion and meetings and as the the camera gets down to the stage a little move it just a little bit and present it so everybody can see the slides this is myself and my partner in crime Ellen's rock from the st. Cloud State University meteorology department we've been working collaboratively for about eight weeks developing virtual spaces getting involved in all space and trying to figure out how we can transition our classes and our presentations into this social vr sort of environment and today i'm going to be talking about with allen's help on teaching using social vr first i would like to take a minute and pay some respects to another casualty of the corona virus a program that we were involved with together called Minnesota nice-nice stands for networked immersive collaborative environment it was funded by the Minnesota State System office and it involved getting large groups of people together in a confined space all sharing and wearing VR headsets and doing all sorts of things that sound really horrible today yeah but instead of everybody remote it was everybody the same room seeing the same new virtual experience together and now with the exact opposite of what we need but it was a great idea and we got a lot of cool stuff from the project we did we got a lot of really cool stuff from the project and the nature of the work that we were doing the project sort actually sort of was the the precursor it laid out the groundwork for the research that we're doing now so it's it's Minnesota nice isn't completely dead I think it lives on in some form but the story really starts when I encountered the educators and VR virtual reality conference there's two events that happened right back to back there really opened my eyes about the possibility of social virtual realities the educators VR is a group that uses virtual reality as an educational platform they've been together for actually a number of years developing and teaching in virtual reality environments such as this they held a conference last February and ran for six days there were 150 speakers and about six thousand attendees across a variety of different virtual worlds and virtual platforms such as this it was it was really an astounding experience I got a lot out of it and it was all the good parts about going to a conference without the going part I liked the going part to a conference but you did get to see all sorts of talks and other things it was really cool the other eye opening event was I Triple E VR their conference was completely canceled by the by the co-ed virus and then over the course of about two weeks they transitioned the entire proceedings into virtual reality using Mozilla hugs now this was I Triple E VR I would expect if there's a group that could do this in two weeks it would be I Triple E VR but these two events really sort of sent a snowball rolling for us looking at this this platforming and opening our eyes to the different possibilities so what exactly if you think about it real real quick we started this the the conference was mid February so we were talking about this even before some of the kovetz stuff hit and it just went from this is something we need to look at too this is something we need to look at now yes fan of about two weeks it was crazy how we went from this is really interesting - this is necessity yeah it was it was a lightning fast right there at the beginning so when when we talk about social vr or sometimes the term is collaborative vr right the the environment is designed for for networked social interaction I can see Alan Ellen can see me and we're both using oculus quest headsets so we have a fairly natural sense of bodily presence I can see my hands and talk with my hands I see my the motion of the head we see our mouths move when we talk it's it's very engaging and even though we look like cartoons I buy into it very quickly and a lot of people bring they buy into that engagement right and Mark looks like Mark in real life I looked kind of like me in real life so you can tell just it's the right voice it's even similar mannerisms because I'm moving my arms the way I would when I normally talk because I'm holding controllers and doing what I would do mm-hmm I do weigh about a hundred pounds lighter in virtual reality I like that a lot yeah me too so as we were just talking about this this whole rush to get online and look for alternatives it is driving a spike in demand for these boomers what was that so the instructor I'm getting a really better good yeah so the there's a drop there's a spike in demand for these sort of environments and this sort of presentation medium one of the things that's challenging about doing research for this presentation is finding current statistics on virtual reality market usage and adoption that are that reflect the impact of the virus all of the the market resources that I have go up to the last quarter of 2019 and don't reflect this increase in the demand but a lot of people are looking to find an online replacement for previously face-to-face functions so things like job fairs and in conferences workshops classes we had to build a virtual campus tour and we built it in all space so that candidates for the new deans position could come in here and take it tour the facilities which normally they would do but now they can and then other people are looking for social engagement a way that I can have a natural feeling conversation with another human being and just not feel quite so isolated and and detached from everything and then there's one more thing that I want to add to that is it's really fun to be able to talk with the group like you would talk with the group so instead of staring at a flat screen it's been really interesting we've had five or six of us and we naturally make that circle as people join in or move around or whatever so the the conversation dynamics we normally do it feels like you're in a room we're seeing a grid of faces doesn't give you that kind of immersive I'm in a real conversation with real people feel and with a client like all space it even does spatial audio so Mark's voice comes from over here and if somebody were standing over there their voice would come in more in that ear and so it's really it feels a lot like you're in this room way more than a group zoom Chatwood sure absolutely absolutely and then there's there's some secondary benefits that people are discovering from the the use of this it saves a lot of money on time and expense you know I talked about being able to go to a conference without the going part of the conference turns out the going to a conference is quite expensive you've got travel cost you got hotel costs you got food cost you've got infrastructure you have to pay for and all of that sort of evaporates when you when you hold your conference in an area like this and then we've got a reduction on the carbon emissions and since I have an actual meteorologist over here I'll let him talk about that right so basically there's been all sorts of interesting takes all over the world actually them the more that there has been a reduction in people traveling the more we've seen that pollution release has been less so mark mentions on the slide here reduced carbon emissions and that's been very true for carbon dioxide that's measured the map you see up here is nitrogen dioxide and similar major reductions in the amount of pollution that are being put out from places now this is good and bad I mean bad maybe for the economy because things aren't happening but the idea that we may be able to limit travel and move certain things to this online world even after some of the virus stuff goes away it has some appeal for for public health as well so there's lots of aspects for what we can do with this medium and we're going to talk about a bunch of them here coming along too sure absolutely and then you've got you've got the support in the connection aspect that comes along with it too it's largely anecdotal but I've heard from a lot of people that alts face and things like all space are keeping them sane during this time it's it's a pretty remarkable thing yeah we were talking to a guy from England a couple weeks ago who just was you know he was in his 70s and was basically saying you know I'd be stuck where I really couldn't talk with anybody he lived alone and he said I'm meeting people there great from all over the world so for some people who are very isolated it's been almost really a lifeline for them right and the the social aspect of social vr is something that can't be understated I'm gonna talk about it several times over the course of this presentation so now I'd like to step through a few different examples of different VR platforms this the environment that we're in is only one and there's different scales with different capabilities and different access levels so the first one I want to talk about is Mozilla hubs Mozilla hubs is its open source it's free to use free to play and it supports browser-based interaction so it runs on pretty much every device every platform every browser it's it's wide open and completely democratized which as will point out later is not necessarily a good thing another very popular example is the environment that we're in now currently alt space alt space has a focus more on the social interactions and presentations so we're given a bunch of tools in here that allow us to facilitate presentations and delivering content and then there's a lot of stuff to do outside of these presentations within all space there's games and activities and movies there's churches their support groups there's medications and mindfulness there's pretty much every topic that you can think of and ever since this whole quarantine shutdown thing the number of events and the diversity of the events that we see popping up all over all space is just mind-numbing right it's been really cool for comedy shows actually because you can actually have the comic walking back and forth on stage it's really kind of fun yeah it's it's it's interesting it's really cool so alt space supports oculus headset so the oculus guru the oculus quest and then PC tethered headsets so rift of vive and index windows mixed reality pretty much anything that plugs into a PC can get into alt space or go or a quest so it's not quite as open as Mozilla hubs but it's still fairly accessible the next example is engage I've ever used to engage I've looked at it I haven't downloaded it yet so engage is really good they've got a lot of tools and their focus is on education so there specifically presentations around education the the structure the environment the way you find classes you go to classes and attend classes is is really geared for institutional sort of like a collegiate system it is not free now you can get into it for free as just an individual account but there's a limitation on the presents the presentations you can host and the things that you can do a pro version and then there's an Enterprise version that open up larger presentation capabilities more users but it the the prices according to scale on that and then at the top level we have a platform called glue that is really just amazing to look at it's got some powerful content the avatar is the environments the models the meshes everything is high resolution high fidelity real-time lighting it's just beautiful it only works on pc tethered headsets so currently there is no mobile version of it and it is really expensive it's really expensive it's like there's if you wanted a team to do it it's it's far from cheap yeah yeah it's um it's like $1500 a year base and then $50 a head for users on top of that if yeah it's really good as I think yeah yeah per month fee for users yeah so but you pay for with that it's a really cool set up it's just maybe for students use it's kind of out of their price range maybe right well it's geared for its it's geared for corporate enterprises it's not really made for an educational institution it's made for a large company like international paper or Exxon or all of these platforms that we've talked about have 2d version for non VR users so they either run in a browser or they have an app that runs and it gives you a nice clean you what what you folks are watching is the 2d version of the alt space browser it's another client that I have he's standing right there he looks like a red robot but it's it gives you a nice a nice platform or a medium for streaming into something like like a like a video chat or making a recording it also lacks the engagement of the immersive environment it's it's just such a night and day difference when I'm immersed in this system and I'm my brain is totally believe in it and I've got the perp Rio section from my hands where I feel like they're you know a natural extension of me you don't get any of that stuff from the 2d client but what you also don't get is a motion sickness motion sickness is something that really has to be considered when you're thinking about a large-scale virtual environment because about 25% of your audience is going to experience some level of motion sickness there's things that you can do to mitigate that there's design considerations that you can put into your environment or you could use a 2d headset but it is going to continue to be a consideration going forward right now to be fair the six degrees of freedom have it's like the Questor better than three degrees of freedom headsets and there's things they can do to make it better but you're like it's still an issue and so having to decline options for students is very helpful so while we're on the subject of a 2d client or desktop VR there's some characteristics of it you don't have to have any special equipment so I don't have to buy a headset I don't have to have trackers or motion controllers it's it is not immersive right so I don't have the the sense of being there many of them are browser-based so there's no extra software to install you just go to a website and open it up in your browser and it allows for wider distribution so you view if you really want to maximize your audience you want something that is accessible through pretty much any mobile phone or laptop whatever kind of device that you have that may be connected which leads me to the the relationship between quality and audience right so the quality of the experience is going to be inversely proportional to the size of my audience that I'm going to that's going to be able to engage in this you've got considerations like price what kind of hardware do I have to have what kind of experience am i trying to recreate and then what kind of security do I want to have this right here is sort of a secure event it's listed as private right so that many people can get into it but if it were open to the public and many of the events in alt space are open to the public then I'm going to have to manually secure that space I would at the solution to maintaining order when the public is coming in in virtual reality is very similar to the way that you would do it in real life you put somebody over in the corner and you charge them with kicking out the troublemakers some platforms do that for you some platforms are completely closed and the only people that are going to be coming in are people that you want to come in so the the nature of your event it has to be considered when you're when you're thinking about stuff like security but all of those things that improve the quality of the experience are also going to act to limit the number of people that can get into it so if I've got something like glue where I've got the best experience the best graphics best security not many people are going to be able to get into it because of the hardware requirements of the price content is something that's very important and content is available on all of these platforms it's also different on all of these platforms every platform gives us what we call a sandbox that limits what we can do and what we can interact with we've got some examples here of some content I will just briefly bring the Sun and Moon so this is a model that demonstrates the orbit of the earth and the the phases of the Moon and the different seasons and it's got a nice bright light associated with it but I can move it around I can spawn this in other worlds like it in to this space and we can manipulate them to scale them up scale them down move out of the way of the camera but in terms of teaching like I would use something like this in class but taking something that we have to do with 2d maps or I have to try to draw on a whiteboard to being able to show this in 3d is one of the huge perks of going this route for me there's new ways to interact with the world even though it's virtual there's a way to pick up three-dimensional things and especially being a meteorologist that missed fear is 3d so we need that to understand some of the processes so this is opening new doors for all sorts of ways irrespective of just a generic classroom mark and I have been talking about doing labs in this kind of world for years yeah and then we've got other examples like the the map on the wall over Allen said is a live map that is coming in from the internet one of my students Marty wrote a a little script that goes out and retrieves the latest version of this map and displays and I think it goes and it looks every 15 minutes or so but that's an example of the type of interaction that we can add to this it's it's a lot of these environments is very limited for security reasons they don't love they don't allow us to write anything that has any kind of coded to it because it'd be far too easy for me to put something malicious into this space so in in the in the pursuit of giving everybody a equal in quality experience they don't allow us to do a whole lot in here and that's true for almost all the different providers it's limited for for security purposes on their end some other common limitations right now there is sort of a a practical limit on the number of participants that I can get into about a space almost all of these platforms seem to have a limit of about a hundred participants at a time in any given space now there are ways around that so that we could get larger people a larger groups than 100 people engaged in a space motion sickness we've talked about 25 percent of people would come in er going to be susceptible to it to one degree or another not everybody you know gets violently ill but you know even myself after a couple hours I start getting a little queasy yeah it also lacks experiential interactivity now experiential VR is something that Kapil is going to be giving a presentation on on the fifth of May and he's going to be sort of looking at the other side of this coin I mean you've got experience well I'm going to be talking about the difference between experiential and collaborative er here in a second but this collaborative social space lacks an experiential sort of Magic School Bus component to it and then assessing and testing assessment is challenging in this space I can do something like bring up a personal web browser and give somebody a quiz or have them take a poll but really assessing the skills that they learn is is something that is much better suited for experiential BRV are currently there's not a whole lot in here that we can do to assess accurately the the value or the efficacy of a particular presentation right and we're working on that too but it's a challenge because you still need controls and still it's so new that it's hard to come up with valid assessments - so one of the ways that we can handle large events and this is sort of a logical diagram of how a large event might be handled if I have more than 100 people that need to get into a space say I've got thousands of people that I need to handle then I can design my space so that I sort of allow them to flow through these container worlds all these different worlds in smaller groups you know I can't put a thousand people into one room but I can put on a hundred people into ten or 50 people into 20 and then I can start playing tricks with it like if all the rooms are identical but they may not know that they're in different rooms especially if they can all see the same presenter that's a capability that adult space has if we wanted 400 people in this event but the room is only limited to 100 people at a time I could spawn in three other worlds each with another capacity to have a hundred people and inside of each world each of the participants would see the presenter but they may not be able to see all of each other so talking about experiential versus collaborative VR and I put this in here to sort of lay the groundwork for the distinction between the research that Kapil has been doing them that we've been doing experiential VR it simulates a specific interactive environment so it could be a cell or a diatom or a human heart or something a lot of times changing the environment in a experiential application requires changing that application I may have one application that simulates the the processes in your lungs I may have another application that simulates an atmospheric event I may have another simulation that has a a physical mechanical component to it and all of those things are likely to be in separate applications and I'd have to I have to re-engineer or restart or bring up a different application if I want to change those environments the interaction in those environments can be designed to simulate a task or an activity or a process so I can engineer my environment so that my task is to do a specific thing on a piece of equipment for example and everything in the environment would be geared towards simulating that task the testing can be built directly into the environment and typically these experience with VR experiences are not collaborative there are some examples where they are but for the most part it's just a singular experience I'm taking my training I'm doing my job I'm taking my tests that's that's the the workflow of it collaborative VR simulates a largely non interactive space right so we've got this really nice room here and we've got some maps and screens and slides on the wall but there's really not a lot of interactivity with the space itself spaces can be repurposed without a major change we can I can teach a computer science class in here I can teach a math class or an economics class well I can't I don't know anything about economics but but you see what I mean I mean we can repurpose this space for lots of different subjects without having to make a major change to this space right and the more that the the project involves discussions and talking the more quasi generic space like this works but if you need a specific targeted purpose or application that's that experiential side and it's trying to blend both but we're still getting to that point yet as I mentioned earlier testing in this environment is just limited it's probably the best thing you can say about it so now we'd like to present a couple of examples of how different faculty members in different schools are using alt space or social vr for their classes there's a link at the bottom of this slide Stephen King from the husband School of Journalism and Media is teaching his entire class in all space he immediately began the process of transitioning all of his students over to - alt space and he's designing the the coursework he's designing the the environments and he's regularly presenting to his classes in all space yeah they all have oculus goes he has an oculus quest so they're all in this immersive environment during class mm-hmm now even really he was fortunate enough to run a Media Lab and had enough virtual headsets for all of his students I'm getting getting your students into the equipment typically it's going to be one of the challenges that needs to be overcome and then we've got this event itself right this this environment this our avatars the the presentation that we're doing is another example of how these sorts of processes could be could be done we could have an audience full of people in VR experiencing this same sort of thing at the same time and then I'd like Alan to talk a bit about the work that he and Rachel are doing as regular there for their classes so we're approaching this from a couple different directions so Rachel Humphrey and I basically coat each two versions of our AHS 106 course it's basically a natural disasters course that we teach she's part of one section I'm part of another and as soon as some of the shutdown happened we said well we need to make videos but we want to do something different from everybody else but I have a hundred something students in my section she's got eighty or ninety something like that so we certainly couldn't get headsets out to everybody but what we came up with was this idea of we can record kind of like what you're seeing here on the stream but we can record ourselves actually teaching and put the recording off of us both in VR so it feels a bit more like a podcast there's interaction we're joking back-and-forth taking turns with slides and making a bit of an engaging certainly a more engaging experience than somebody where you can't see their face there's no motions or whatever else and it's just PowerPoint slides and the recording so the idea was how do we get something that even if it's not really interactive yes the student is still just watching a video how do we make it something better in the short term and we came up with this in early to mid-march and said hey we got to make this happen and we've been doing this since we started back for classes on the 30th of March we've been putting up a couple of video lectures we've done some of our slides that we would have talked about in class we just post so they review some slides on their own they watch a video supplement it's a little bit shorter on each of the topics as we would have presented them and then we make him do a quiz through our online grading system so it makes them look through both aspects and so we're doing some testing with the materials and some ideas of that now that's what we're doing for now and we can show you kind of how this environment works but I'm also going to show you a video here that we have set up it should be firing up behind you here or behind me but this is an example of where we would like to go with this going forward so this is a brief demo we did this is up online mark and send the link around if you want to see it another alt space room Rachel's there on the left me on the right up on stage and then we have a few people here you can see marked there on the lower left he was kind of moderating the room but we've got students and other faculty from around who were listening to us present and you may not be able to hear much because of the teams and all space and whatever all trying to work together but we're flipping through slides like Mark and I are now but we can have student interactions when they're in this world with us they can do things like raise their hand or give feedback that something was good or whatever else and so we're able to get some responses from the audience we can mute the general audience and then have them be called on so mark was acting as the moderator so he could unmute people and then they could ask the question and so on and so forth it was really a cool way to have everybody be able to participate in this room and again this was just a brief demo that we did but it shows some promise but you need everybody in a headset or with a toonie client or something to really make it work and so that's one of the challenges we're dealing with right now is how do we take this thing that we're kind of just emergency putting up there in the short term and how do we build this into that collaborative space where you can actually look at your neighbor and say something to them and do breakout groups and things which you can do there's spatial audio with mark and I could go to the back of the room and you could not hear us and so we could have conversations in small groups and then come back together and meet and all these other kinds of things but you'd actually like physically walk in this space upstairs or downstairs in your group can meet upstairs which is really kind of cool and then I can just call everybody back hey let's talk about what we did is groups there's lots of things that we do in a regular classroom that this would enable when the technology is in the hands of the people right and that's what that's what it brings up another another interesting benefit of this the geography is irrelevant geometry is irrelevant if we had if we had too many people in here or if we had a group in here that wanted to go to create a breakout session and go have their own discussion if we didn't have the space and here for them to go do that I can spawn in another space we can we can add spaces dynamically Adam take them away expand the capacity in real time so if somebody needed privacy or something like that we could just there you go there's your little private world you can have for the next you know 20 minutes or so right and for some of these tools they have whiteboards or other things you could actually work on a problem with your colleagues in this virtual space too so there's lots of possibilities for taking this into new and useful directions for collaborations and so on and so forth yeah yeah glue glue especially has a lot of productivity tools productivity editing tools of collaboration tools immersed is good for that too yes immersed is really good for that too so another another thing that I wanted to pick out is the the future direction of Education for virtual reality and this is another instance where I don't have any relevant data to see you know what the impact of the virus is so these these numbers are from the end of 2018 2019 where they're expecting a growth rate in the K through 12 educational virtual reality market of twenty eight percent so that without any other kind of drivers like this virus assuming that the virus turns out to be a significant driver but with a twenty percent growth rate we're going to be looking at millions of kids engaging on a regular basis and virtual reality as part of their education by the time they get to college they're going to be expecting is similar if that's better sort of experience so we kind of need to get ahead of this curve when these Ben these youngsters here when they get old enough to figure out what college they're going to go to we want to be able to offer them the best most modern technological experience that they can have the best engagement the best education right I'm sure there's a lot you could say about planning for your vr course oh no oh there's tons I could say and I'll just take this and shorten it a little bit the biggest thing I think is and Rachel and I have talked about a lot about this in course design she's also a meteorologist but has some science head background as well so she's a perfect colleague to work with for this and one of the things we realized early was the VR thing is not a panacea it's not going to replace everything right now it's a tool to bring into your teaching toolbox basically and so like we're not doing all of our course in this because I still think the average students not gonna want to sit us through us talking for 75 minutes but if we can do shorter segments and make it work for students and really hit the high points of the stuff that's difficult to explain or hard to put into words without hand gestures there's one thing you were doing with relative humidity where it's just easier to use one hand is temperature and one is dew point and we were able to do that in this VR world showing things the way we would in class and that made a huge help for for us for how we would normally teach in person but it's not so much about doing everything in here it's what lends itself well to this environment what can we not do with standard zoom or a 2d whiteboard thing on a computer what do we get here and there are still plenty of opportunities for that and then moving toward the experiential things that Mark was talking about and how do we build some of those into this world if we can get those experiences collaborative and social where you can start doing even basic chemistry labs and see what happens based on this in this kind of world that would be great now we're a little bit away from that yet but at least as a start you know if we can get the social aspects of this world worked out we can get the experiential pieces worked out then we can work on integrating them together and that's where I see this going in the the medium term but not in the next two weeks before our semester ends right right right so one of the things that I would encourage anybody anybody that's interested in getting into social vr whether it's alt space or something else headset get into it practice it get the feel for it get comfortable with it and then engaged with the community a lot of these platforms have active discord servers discord is a it's a it's an online sort of chat interface where you can go and you can talk to other users you can ask for help alt space is really good about having their admins and their developers active on disscourn so you can go and you can ask questions directly of the developers of the space and get you some pretty good answers and that sort of engagement where the community is critical for figuring out how how the how it all works in here I don't know how you do it with a tech really and then you've got to provide multiple solutions for your students right if you're gonna get all of your students 3d headsets then get them 3d headsets because that's gonna be the best experience if the ones that can't or don't love to use 3d headsets we've got to deeper hours and then the bottom line is the we can take a stream and we can pipe it into zoo oran teams like we are here same for teams teams I should have put teams up here just assumed but sky hangouts whatever right the only the only problem with that option is now it becomes difficult to get bi-directional communication especially if we want to share all of the audio we want to stream a bunch of video if I had a zoom window or a team's window back into this environment the the latency would would make it untenable yeah we'll try that it was like 20 seconds alike or something it was 10 to 20 seconds it was unteachable yeah but something to think about so you guys may be able to see and hear me but I can't see you I can hear you right but it does feel like I'm standing here talking with mark it's time to cool it does it's very convincing I like it down so I guess here's the call-to-action portion of this faculty and admin pion is critical if this is going to be successful then somebody has to step forward and go wow that looks brilliant I think I want to do my class in virtual reality and take ownership of it and start using it and we're healed it we're here to help this this is largely becoming part of my mission here at Saint Cloud State is facilitating and designing and just sort of assisting people getting their virtual reality courses off the ground and then I think that is the last slide we've made it all the way through we did and I know you've got a I know you've got to leave quickly was there anything that you'd like to I got another five minutes or so first questions okay let me add one let me add one thing to this though and I lost my train of thought I'll get it back oh the other thing the other thing with this is because especially of the situation we're in there's been a huge rush on VR headsets especially the oculus quest has been sold out everywhere so adoption may be tricky because the quest with the six degrees of freedom vision stuff is much less motion sickness inducing than the go all that was being equal and so adoption for this right now may be a little bit trickier than say normal times because these things are backed up everywhere if one pops up on Walmart it's gone within five minutes or something like that so they're definitely ramping up demand they know there's demand for this but it may be a challenge even for the fall to get enough for a full class especially if places are remote making sure these get into the hands of your students may be really really tricky so that's something we're considering to is we may want to do things in VR but can we actually pull it off in time I mean a quest can be had for $400 now it's not nothing for money but it's cheaper than a laptop it may be useful for some it may be unapproachable for others but there are some challenges out there as new technology comes online there's all these other things change over the next couple years the ease of access should go much ease of access would improve but this will get a lot easier to get into but part of the challenge here is being ahead of the curve so there's things ready for people to use when they get access to this as opposed to waiting to do that development for a couple of years until it's in the masses hands right has anybody got any questions yeah I do this is so I know I myself in there you know the prices are getting higher and higher on them if you can find them is there a mid-range one that you'd recommend safer for participants or students or whatever yeah you know you want to call it there knowing that it would still have the same issues as far as making sure that they're in stock but is there is there a mid-range set that you'd recommend you go the oculus go oculus go that can be what 150 bucks yeah 15 I think they're a lot easier to get yeah they're still in stock I think on Amazon and stuff now yeah they're easier to get there they're cheaper it's a limited sort of experience you've only got three degrees of freedom and you'll only have one hand in here but it it runs the software it's perfectly interactive and for for a lot of for a lot of use cases it's perfectly adequate right so a student perspective ago would be great I think for teaching having both hands to talk at least because I talk with my hands having both hands moving around helps but you can tell with a go like if you've noticed marks and my hands are both moving but our heads are moving too as we turn around the go will do a lot of that too when you're on a 2d client nothing moves with the mouth so the head stays fixed the arms are just stuck at your sides and so in terms of that natural feeling for a converse you can really tell and so if you're presenting especially I think having a quest would be good but for student purposes goes work some of our students have borrowed goes from the labs and they make it work okay yeah especially if they do it sitting down or whatever the disorientation tends to be a little bit better because you can move without physically walking which helps right any other questions so if they're using a browser can they still move there I guess you'd say like avatar around yes the the interactions were like a like a like a first-person game you can still grab things in the environment you can still interact with things and move around but you use a mouse and keyboard combination so it's the the way I'll counties and you look around with a mouse just like a first-person shooter yep so so if you've ever played one of those it's gonna be really familiar and then one other go ahead can you have like a whiteboard tour if I was in there and I had like I have the quest would I be able to draw on the whiteboard or no not in old space yes they're working on it yet but glue has a whiteboard engaged as a whiteboard that's usually one of the first things people ask well can I have a whiteboard can we draw on it you're gonna have to get creative with if you're trying to do something like that in all space but other platforms have different different platforms have different contact capabilities and different tools right and there's also the possibility of doing something more like google tilt brush for your just drawing in 3d space as opposed to a flat whiteboard so you may be able to swoop with your arms and draw that way which would be a very different thing but you have to have pretty precise tracking to track writing letters on a whiteboard so there's there's lots of potential options for writing it but I do know the alt space devs are aware and have said they're working on some sort of solution for a whiteboard type thing in this world you know and there's no lots of these companies are pursuing that and that's an example of you know the limitations of the platform in in favor of getting a broader audience we can do less stuff in here you know the other platforms that have whiteboards also have smaller audiences where they cost money right or both usually all right and then I have one more question so you said you made this room right who could you have so you have your PowerPoint in the middle right now let's say this was two rooms could you have a PowerPoint on the left and I forgot his name could have his own PowerPoint on the right and I could choose which part of this room I want to go to kind of like breakout rooms well there's a limitation of the number of browsers that I could have in a space right now yes theoretically yes okay because the go hardware is pretty low level it limits the number of browsers that can up in the room just so it doesn't run out of memory but going forward yes that can happen I think we're limited to three browsers but with this one plus the ones we're using to control the slides we've kind of used up what the room is capable of but there's nothing saying that we couldn't do more with that or that they wouldn't up that number in a year or two so the potential to have multiple screens or things is certainly there going forward mm-hmm and other platforms do allow you to do that Mozilla hubs you can have as many different browsers open as you wanna it all right that's all I had for questions okay there's a following to what Mark was talking about call for action on next steps here and what we're looking at I know we we talked about the transition for a lot of the Edden cat educator workshops to M camps competitions and and that type of material so I know mark is already working with Zack Nicklin for one of the the drone tech it's a Geo ad hurt correction geotech Center Regional Conference that was supposed to be hosted at the aerospace site and they're kind of talking about creating one of these environments that you can actually navigate the aerospace site and go to the different rooms and then look at either pre-recorded video or live streaming video in these type of synchronous sessions so kind of exploring those options I was gonna have Zack speak to that a little bit but I know where we're about five minutes to the top of the hour here but those are the type things if there's interest from this group on identifying specific events where you've got interest in exploring this just getting the the different SMEs synched up on the team to look at what's feasible for those projects and we've already got a couple identified where we're working on this transition and then I guess one of the other things I just I don't know market you and Kapil Kapil had anything at the tail end here as far as lead-in to the presentation that he's looking at doing on I believe it's May 5th did you have anything compelled that you wanted to make sure to get out to the group so yes thank you mom for giving sedation and I really enjoyed it and so I guess I will be giving a talk in two weeks and the talk will be primarily focusing more in terms of the browser-based you know desktop based virtual reality based systems that we built and then more in talking more in terms of the lessons learned maybe build all these virtual reality simulations and looking more in terms of a process you know that other virtual reality development groups could use when you're developing simulations it supports the needs of actually uses so I believe the presentation if you are scheduled on the 5th of May and and I will closely work with mark and adjourn to make sure that you have got access to the presentation and I look forward to talking to you all on May 5th what for it as well thank you very much for that Kapil and mark awesome awesome presentation looking at the the possibilities that are out there and future transitions educational delivery you guys did a phenomenal job on the presentation here it looks like Allen might have had to step up with already yeah it's great yeah definitely send my thanks to him you guys did a phenomenal job on this with that I'll kind of turn it back to the group here if there are more questions I just wanted to make sure we got a couple of those those points in there made sure where we're setting the stage for the future offerings so I can't wait to see the recording I'm curious to see what it looks like are you able to share your world with other people yes developers yeah okay that was my next one hey mark this is Zack could you shoot me a link there in the old space chat or something sure are you are you with where aren't you in here in a headset man I actually tried to find you and it will not be the arrow to go to your world is grayed out oh that's right because this is a private of a yep I have a headset - that would have been cool to join it like that I would I've had I started using the headset this morning for about two hours and it is once you use it it's very immersive it's really cool it's hard to even explain it compared to this meeting yes that's what I was gonna say - I mean it you guys did a phenomenal job on giving a understanding of these environments but it is super tough - real appreciate until you step into it holy persecute and sorry you can't yeah but you guys did a great job and I appreciate marks comments there as far as he's looking forward to seeing this recording that gives indication beyond the phenomenal work here this has been rapid turnaround I know mark you've been deep in in some of this stuff for a while but the conversations within cat specific two and a thought process for all these deliveries just change in the last two weeks and comments like that where he doesn't even know what this presentation is gonna look like it how well it went speak to the expertise of the team and that drive and innovation so thank you thank you
