 Good morning, I'm Jessica Gill the acting  deputy director of the National Institutes   of Nursing Research or NINR I'm delighted to  welcome all of you joining this meeting today   today the meeting is Genomic Responses to  the Social Environment: Implications for   Health Outcomes this is an important and timely  topic as it's been acknowledged that the social   environment can influence the risk manifestation  and trajectory of disease and associated symptoms   yet the underlying biological mechanisms  remain largely understudied this   transdisciplinary event will address  the relationship among genomics   the social environment and health outcomes across  populations conditions as well as the lifespan   the goals of this are to build on the knowledge of  the genomic mechanisms underlying the contribution   to the social environment and ultimately to health  outcomes today there'll be an exchange of ideas   to advance a social genomics research strategy  to illuminate gene environment influences   on the burden of disease and ultimately inform the  future interventional approaches that we undertake   the ninr greatly acknowledges the funding support  from the office of disease prevention as well as   the office of behavioral and social sciences  research here at nih as well as our colleagues   across other institutes at nih as well as centers  also a big thank you to lois tully and nathan   brown from minr whose efforts were instrumental to  the success of this meeting today i will now turn   it over to dr tully who's the program director  program officer sorry overseeing a portfolio   that focuses on the genomics to address the roles  interrelationships and moderating influences of   genes on the environment and ultimately patient  outcomes again i extend a warm welcome to all of   you joining us today for this very exciting  meeting now i'll turn it over to dr tally so good morning everyone and thank you dr  gill as jessica said i'm a program director   at the national institute of nursing research  and i echo dr gill's words in welcoming you   so i'd like to start with a little bit  of housekeeping uh there will be some   time following each presentation for questions as  well as additional time set aside for discussion   uh for speakers moderators and others are logged  on as panelists you will be able to ask questions   and provide comments in real time but when you  aren't speaking please remember to mute yourself   others that are logged on as attendees  you'll be able to use the chat box   to ask questions or make comments  please send your question i'm done sorry can everyone hear me yes sorry i thought i heard  some someone talking to me okay uh so uh please   send your question or comment uh to everyone if  you're using the chat box so we can all see it   and for those of you viewing the workshop on the  nih video cast we welcome you as well and while   you won't be able to ask questions directly please  feel free to follow up directly with the speakers   to echo jess's words it's increasingly  evident that chronic disease and other poor   health outcomes are multifactorial in nature  underscoring the importance of an approach   that incorporates and examines both the social  environment and the underlying biology including   how these factors associate with each other to  impact positive and negative health outcomes our   agenda today includes a diverse set of topics that  cross-cut diseases populations and the lifespan   so now an overview of today's agenda which is also  available on the event page of the ninr website   we'll start out with two keynote speakers our  first keynote speakers is dr janice keycold blazer   and she will discuss the influence of marital  stress on adverse outcomes such as inflammation   and depression and poor wounds healing  we will then move to our second keynote   speaker dr steve cole who will speak about his  pioneering work in the field of social genomics   each keynote presenter will speak for about 30  minutes and we'll have about 15 minutes after   each for q a and discussion following a short  break we'll have the first of two sessions that   are focused on the state of the science there'll  be some time after each presentation for q a   and then a short time for additional  discussion at the end and also note that i   asked the moderators uh these sessions to also  say a few words about their research interests   after the first session we'll have a break  and then we'll have our second session   you'll also notice that at the end of the day  there's a longer discussion time here our goal is   to address special topics which have been shared  with the speakers and will be shown during the   break as well as during this discussion session  and one more thing before i introduce our first   keynote speaker as we listen to the speakers  today and we engage in q a and discussion   it will be important to think about potential next  steps that will move us toward translation of this   work in other words how can we integrate a social  genomic approach into personalized strategies   that prevent modify or buffer an adverse social  environment and lead to better health outcomes so um again as uh jessica pointed out we  are grateful to the speakers the moderators   and others that are here with us today i look  forward to hearing about the latest research as   well as listening to and participating  in an engaging interactive discussion   and lastly as jessica also pointed out i want  to acknowledge the other offices here at nih   that provide a support um my colleagues  across nih that helped in the planning   to ninr leadership uh and my colleagues for  uh their support moral support and uh and a   special shout out as jessica pointed out to nathan  brown who is working very hard behind the scenes   to make sure everything proceeds flawlessly okay  so where we're obviously running ahead of schedule   so um and you know as this is a virtual event um  we're hoping that um our webex and everything else   cooperates with us today um but uh we will all  be flexible and nimble and um i think it will be   a wonderful event and i'm really looking forward  to it so um we can move on to the first keynote   uh but before i do or is there any questions  or anything uh we need to address first okay great okay so um uh dr janice keycolt  glazer is the director of the ohio state   institute for behavioral medicine research and  she also holds the title distinguished university   professor as well as the bronbau chair in brain  research and teaching at the ohio state college   of medicine a clinical psychologist who works  in the areas of psychoneuroimmunology she has   published more than 250 articles chapters  and books her studies have demonstrated   important health consequences of stress and she'll  be speaking about that today our programmatic work   has focused on how close personal relationships  influence immune and endocrine function and health   and most notable among her honors and there  are many uh is her elected membership in the   national family of medicine the title of  dr kiko blaser's presentation is lovesick   how couples relationships influence health and i  will now open uh for dr kiko placer's presentation   i can see the slides they're not in slideshow  yet but looks like all is good okay great so thank you for for kicking off the um workshop   thank you i'm really delighted to be  part of a really interesting workshop   so we know from epidemiological research that  the married people have better health outcomes   than the unmarried or unpartnered cross  cancer surgeries cardiovascular disease   all cause mortality but the simple presence  of a spouse is not necessarily protective   a troubled marriage is itself a prime source of  stress and it simultaneously limits the person's   ability to seek support in other relationships  i'll start with a really extreme example in   terms of more marital disruption and that's  caregiving for a spouse with alzheimer's disease   or another dementia um early in our work we  were really interested in health consequences   and how health consequences might uh what  health consequences we might actually see   from a number of small immune changes that had  been shown the issue was with many of those   immune changes what did they actually mean  and my late husband ron glaser suggested well   let's look at vaccine responses because when  what you do is give everybody the same vaccine so   you're giving everybody the same immune stimulus  and you look at their ability to respond you have   a health relevant outcome so in that in one of  that one of those first studies with caregivers   we gave caregivers and non-caregiving controls who  are comparable in terms of age and other behaviors   a flu vaccine and we looked at their ability to  mount a four-fold response to that vaccine what   you see is caregivers in blue were less able to  mount an effective response compared to controls   in red but that was only part of the what we  found because there's also an age-related effect   aging magnifies the effects of stress on an immune  response something that we and others have shown   pretty uh well over the years and that um among  people who are 71 or older there were clear there   were even greater differences in terms of their  ability to respond to the vaccine and in this case   a poor vaccine response means an increased risk  for the flu and probably other infectious diseases   we looked at these changes all we looked  at uh caregivers and controls in response   to another vaccine as well a bacterial vaccine  pneumococcal pneumonia and caregivers in yellow   were able to mount the same response  initially to the vaccine as the controls   in green or former caregivers whose spouse  had died in red so two weeks no differences   three months out however we can see  that caregivers could not maintain   the same protective antibody response that we've  seen and seen in the other two groups their   ability to maintain a protective antibody response  was diminished by the stress of caregiving   those vaccine data are have been replicated  across a number of different labs and a number of   different vaccines and they're important because  they're a proxy for responses to infectious   illness those alterations have been shown in  both antibody and t-cell responses to vaccines   and so that across these vaccines stress or  depression is associated with poor responsiveness   and these days i think you can't go without  mentioning covert 19 and what i haven't seen   mentioned in any of the discussions about  vaccine trials is how stressor depression   might actually enter into those vaccine responses  and especially when we looked at the group who's   going to get those vaccines first healthcare  workers and how that might affect responsiveness   to the vaccine we are interested in other  kinds of health related outcomes as well   um and we wanted to see what else we could see  that might show relationships phil maruca who was   part of our group at the time now at oregon said  wound healing would be a great model because it's   another immunologically mediated event i looked  through a lot of literature to see how we might   measure wound healing i looked through a lot of  surgical literature but surgeons had this really   unfortunate habit of suturing wounds closed after  surgery and we wanted to look at wound closure   so we adopted a technique that's been used  in dermatological literature extensively   we wounded people we used a small punch  biopsy about the size of a pencil eraser   to create a small standardized wound and  caregivers and non-caregivers and we looked   at how long it took that wound to close it took  caregivers 24 longer than non-caregiving controls   to heal exactly the same small standardized  wound and again this is the stress related   differences here have been replicated  across a number of different laboratories oh infection in wounds are important because  they trigger the inflammatory response   and inflammation is really critical here you need  to resolve the infection repair tissue damage if   you don't have an initial local inflammatory  response you're going to be in trouble   but chronic or persistent inflammation increases  the risk for many diseases or disorders   if you look at this slide here how many of these  issues do you have in your own family it would be   a really rare family that didn't have any  of these because they are so very common and   this is really the the very short list of things  that have been linked to inflammation over time   in a variety of different studies so we can go  from stress and depression to immune dysregulation   so that there will be an enhanced  risk of infection prolonged infections   and delayed wound healing all of which would  increase pro-inflammatory cytokine production   we can also go directly from stress  and depression to greater inflammation   in our caregivers we were interested in what  happened with a very chronic stress as well   with a sample of 225 caregivers and non-caregivers  we followed them over the course of six years   getting blood samples twice a year and  looking at the changes in il-6 an important   inflammatory marker on the x-axis there you  see we're modeling changes in il-6 by age   so we're looking at the predicted il-6 levels at  rising with age what we saw was that stress the   caregiver's average rate of increase in il-6 was  four times as large as that of controls a really   large difference but one of our reviewers said  what does that mean in terms of actual risk well   i went to epidemiological literature to see if  i could find some clues if i used the value from   epidemiological literature in their upper quartile  our caregivers would cross into that risk zone   around age 75. our controls wouldn't hit that risk  zone until around age 90 a 15-year gap so what   we could see then was that aging and stress  the combination was accelerating that curve   as we saw earlier in terms of the flu vaccine at  a really bad combination in terms of what could   happen with all those age-related diseases  that we saw associated with inflammation   well what i've been talking about so  far are caregiving which is a really   high intensity stress but i want to talk now about  uh less intense stress and what we started with   in one of our early marital studies and this  is a paradigm we've used in others so you'll   hear a bit about the paradigm first this was  these were very happy healthy newlywed couples   so we recruited 90 newlywed couples that  we screened intently fined they represented   eight percent of the people  who had initially responded to postcards we'd sent out to marriage license  applicants and um so these folks had   so we were interested here in getting a sample  that was absolutely pristine in their first year   of marriage so that we didn't have other kinds of  complications so in terms of mental and physical   health these were as clean as we could find we  brought them into our clinical research center   a hospital research floor for 24 hours and we  first inserted a catheter on each person's arm   so we could draw blood across the 24 hours without  puncturing them each time which otherwise evokes   a stress response after they'd settled down  completed some questionnaires had breakfast   an interviewer would sit down with him and  each member of the couple had at this point completed in areas of disagreement questionnaire  where they'd rated didn't come in areas of   marital disagreement in-laws finances sex in  terms of the intensity of the disagreement   uh and the chronicity and the interviewer then  sat down and had the two uh questionnaires in   front of her and she would say okay mr smith  i noticed that in-laws are a hot spot for you   and for you too mrs smith when was the  last time you talked about your in-laws   the interviewer is trying to find one or two  topics that are both hot and timely and then   she'll then at the end of 10 to 20 minutes she  says i'm going to go behind the curtain and in   the next half hour i want you to try to resolve  one or both of these two issues you raised   what you're going to do about mr smith's mother  who keeps dropping by unexpectedly all the time   and or this second issue about whether  you're going to save money for a baby   or buy a boat now in the picture you see there  that white on the man's arm is actually covering   a heating pad and there's a line from the  captain on his arm as if there is in the   wives leading behind the curtain because  during the time the couple is interacting   we're going to be drawing blood as  they're actually talking and we have   a video we're videotaping the interaction  as well with one of our psychology folks so across our studies what  we've been very interested in   is what people say to each other when  they're trying to resolve a disagreement   those disagreements are coded using the marital  interaction coding system and we're looking at   hostile or negative behaviors i'll use hostile  and negative interchangeably here and there the   code the system also codes positive behaviors  but we haven't found that those carry a lot of   freight by and large compared to the negative  behaviors so those could be either those could   either be verbal you idiot which would be a code  of negative behavior where they could be nonverbal   if your spouse says something and you roll your  eyes at them you have a coded negative behavior   people and people really buried according to how  much of those how many how intense those behaviors   were during the interaction well here's what we  see when we're looking at catecholamines during   that interaction the baseline there that first  sample point in each of those graphs is when the   interviewer is sitting down and saying okay mrs  smith i notice the in-laws are a hot spot for you begin conflict is when the interviewer says okay  i'm going to go behind the curtain uh in the next   half hour i want you to try to resolve one or  both of these issues you see the mid conflict   point as the couple still they're talking the end  and then 30 minutes later they've been completing   questionnaires and sitting quietly and what  we see is that there's continued escalation   especially for norepinephrine and there are  differences in terms of how the couple is behaving   and those differences were not related to  anything else that we saw it's related to   the behavior during the actual conflict we  also had measures of cardiovascular reactivity   a variety of other things but it's behavioral  data it's behavior that appears to be driving   the differences we're seeing i want to  emphasize norepinephrine in particular   because it's going to be important it's part of  the pathway to inflammation through nf capital b we also drew blood from our newlywed couples  on entry into the clinical research center and   then when they left and we found that  they had four immune function the next   morning if they were if they were  more hostile and more negative we followed up those couples  ten years later we were able to   uh get data from all those who were still married  17 of those couples had divorced during that time   that's actually a lower divorce rate than you  would expect but again we had selected people who   were so pristine in terms of mental and physical  health they didn't differ in terms of anything   that we could see in terms of the whole in terms  of all the self-report data those who divorced   didn't look any different in terms of how happy  they'd been they'd seen themselves at baseline on   any of the things you see there there were  differences in baseline conflict behavior   one of the patterns that's considered  particularly destructive in marital interaction   is negative reciprocity it's a tip-for-tat  pattern where a person says something the next   person the next person the next person and then  a more functional kind of relationship that gets   cut off a lot earlier and less functional  interactions that continues and escalates we found difference when we look back we  saw differences when they'd actually been   discussing the interaction but what i thought  was more striking was when they hadn't been   discussing the interaction now catecholamines  only have a half-life of a minute or two so what   we're seeing here are cooled samples we didn't  have the money to analyze every hour eventually   uh drawn from eight in the morning to ten at night  our daytime cooled sample and then at night time   while couples are sleeping so a nurse would sneak  into the room and while couples were asleep or   sleeping draw blood from the catheter so we had  blood during the time they were asleep as well   and when we looked at those who were divorced  compared to those who were married there were   differences over time not only when they were  awake but when they were sleeping in epinephrine   and at nighttime during norepinephrine so we can  see differences in the first year of marriage   related to what happened later even though couples  were not spreading themselves any differently and   it wasn't just those who divorced when we look  at norepinephrine among those who were unhappy   because we had the follow-up day or later  on those who are dissatisfied or distressed   we found the same pattern norepinephrine was  higher again both daytime in this case and   nighttime among those who are distressed  later so that among those unhappy couples   among those couples who were going to become  more unhappy over time i should say even early   on we could see differences in terms of key stress  problems related to subsequent marital adjustment in another study we were going back to our  old friend wound healing to look at whether   marital interactions could actually affect the  rate that wounds would heal we had 42 really   healthy married couples we admitted them twice  to our clinical research center hospital floor   in the first admission in this case they  had a structured social support interaction   so this is a paradigm where each  spouse is asked to talk for 10 minutes   um about something that about themselves they  want to change it can't be a marital issue so   you know maybe time management might be an  issue for example and the other spouse can   respond as they wish and in the second admission  we had another conflict interaction this time   20 minutes to match the time span the same kind  of conflict interaction you heard about before   in this case we are using a much fancier wound  healing protocol though we're looking at suction   blister uh a suction blister model so  we can actually look at wound healing   immunologically at the blister sites so um  in the first picture you see there what we're   scrapping onto the person's arm is a plastic  template that's attached to a suction pump   we're going to be raising suction blisters over  the course of about an hour to an hour and 15   minutes um it's not that it's not a big deal  that people often once when i describe this study   like having i've had i gained it several times  it's like having someone pinching your arm a bit   once the blisters have been raised the nurse  removes the plate takes the top off the blisters   and straps that second plate on that you see in  the bottom picture and she's filling those wells   with the person's serum so we can measure the  infiltration of cytokines and leukocytes at the   wound sites and actually look um in real time at  what's happening at the wound sites um at overtime   now following an event like  wounding that local inflammation   is really important and really  positive you really want to see   good local inflammation because that's part of  the world human process systemic inflammation   is bad and those two are not correlated in  our blister studies christian wound studies   0:27:05.040,1193:02:47.295 and others not when we looked to available day with conflict  well our couples had come into the crc twice   we had um people were more apprehensive  the first time and rated themselves as   more stressed and anxious on the first visit  at the four-hour point the initial point   there were no differences or the conflict the  second visit was higher when we're looking at   cytokine secretion for il-6 tnf alpha and il-1  beta but 22 hours later when we look at what's   happened on a day with the conflict we see that  cytokine secretion is lower in each case that the   that at the actual wound sites there's lower  production of il-6 tnf alpha and il-1 beta and consistent with that they found that time to  healing was one day later following the conflict   visit and after the social support visit so  in conjunction we could show both the immune   outcome um and also the health outcome together  associated with the day was set with conflict   and of course i'd have to mention hostility  here uh when couples were more hostile they   actually got a two-day penalty worcester women's  and our high hostile couple was healed at only 60   percent of the rate of the low hostile couples  so they took two days longer to heal exactly   the same small wounds we looked at systemic  inflammation as well now we have a catheter   in each person's arm over 24 hours and that  in and of itself is going to evoke a local   local inflammatory response so inflammation is  going to rise locally over time no matter what but there were differences in those first  in the high versus low hostile participants   in terms of the top figure in il-6 the low hostile  folks uh rose about the same extent um following   social support or conflict but our high hostile  folks really jumped uh from 45 following social   support to 113 following conflict and we see  similar things below in terms of tnf alpha   so that what we're seeing is both in terms of our  local women response in terms of wound healing   and in terms of systemic inflammation the way  the couple is interacting makes a difference people often ask do these data actually reflect  what happens in people's homes and in fact   they're really an underestimate uh we know from  other studies some really lovely data by gala   margolin when they gave couples tape recorders to  take home showed that couples fights at home are   more negative and last longer than those that are  studied in the laboratory which doesn't exactly   seem like a big surprise overall and troubled  marriages are a particularly useful stressor   and that they um a troubled marriage provides  regular acute stressors arguments that   heightened chronic relationship stress  and distressed families have about twice   as many tensions per day as non-distressed  families margolin showed as well so that   you have really a good laboratory for  marital stress and what happens with it well marital distress and depression are  pretty closely tied i've been talking about   the physiology but i should mention also that  marital distress is clearly associated with   enhanced risk for major depressive disorder   and for depressive symptomatology and they're  really strong bi-directional effects when people   are when people's marriage is going poorly not  surprisingly there's a greater risk for depression   when your primary relationship is really not  doing well but on the other hand when people   are depressed it doesn't help the quality of the  primary relationship so you have a really nasty   kind of mix there where you can even get stronger  bidirectional effects that feed on each other mental marital stress and depression  promote all the poor health behaviors   that promote inflammation of course as well   when we're stressed we're more sedentary we sleep  for smoking alcohol abuse and unhealthy diets but uh the the final work that i want to talk  about or i think i think is the final work   i hope i remember what i'm talking about  here has to do with some more recent work   that we've been looking at here um during the  microbiome and leaky gut kinds of things so um   we got interested in the  microbiome a few years back   and one of the things that i found interesting was  a leaky gut the idea that there's a thin mucosal   layer in the gut that keeps bacteria inside the  gut and that's really important because as you   see in the graphic there what you get otherwise is  a release of endotoxin and with a polysaccharide   and when you get that inflammatory stimulus  into circulation you get inflammation   so that the leakiness of the gut can actually  enhance uh systemic inflammation leakiness   and increases with weight and with age high  saturated fat diets will increase gut leakiness   and there's growing evidence that depression and  stress may also increase gut leakiness as well well in a further study that we had we were  looking at uh it was a meal challenge study where   we had really interesting data across a variety  of metabolic changes but what i want to talk   about here is marital distress that was related  to inflammation and a leaky gut we had couples   who were admitted twice to the crc for a day-long  admission in this case so we have data across two   days um they had two different meals but that  didn't matter for the data you're seeing here   and what we see is that mega that negative  behavior during the conflict was associated with   higher levels of lipopolysaccharide binding  protein or lbp it's a marker of it's obviously a   marker with a polysaccharide release render toxin  so um it's been used widely in that way oh no this   like how powerpoint has stopped working this can't  be let me see if i can keep going oh shoot okay um this is one of those things as a presenter where  you're kind of going no this can't happen to me   ah okay and then i'm going to tell  you that lipopolysaccharide release   was that binding protein was associated  with enhanced crp as well so that what we   were seeing was that the greater a leakier gut  was associated with a higher c-reactive protein in our couples as well um okay let's see if i can share again is there  anything we can do nathan to try and get it's   the slime i'm on my last almost last slide this  is the good news so let's get it back okay uh   so go to the end i think you know i've never had  this but then i've never presented at home either   okay let's go back get all that okay okay take time we're way ahead of  schedule so okay let's take a second so higher gut leakiness uh boost  inflammation as well as you can see here um   so what i've shown you is that um across a  whole series of studies we can look at uh really   difficult marriages where a person is caregiving  for a spouse with alzheimer's or another dimension   or extremely happy and healthy newlyweds  in their first year of marriage   um or couples with wound healing or um and that in  the last case they were couples who were selected   because they were more sedentary and heavier but  in behavior in each case is driving adverse immune   changes um particularly focused on inflammation  in our as as we're interested in here um   and i want to give so that across those studies we  see those differences and i want to give credit to   nih for whom i am incredibly indebted to support  for this research i could never obviously do that   without excellent nih support i've included my  collaborators names on each paper on each slide   i don't have time to mention them all but  those were all noted before in addition to   my late husband i'd note bill malarkey and martha  belluri have really been central to the studies   and papers from my lab can be found at  that url thank you and that's it great okay   thank you so much that was an excellent talk and  um i really enjoyed it and i was glad to see uh   that you uh spoke about uh wound healing uh  that's a topic that will actually be addressed   by a few of our speakers today and you know i  was grateful that you highlighted the importance   of that holistic person-centered approach that  it goes beyond you know stitching the wound as   you mentioned that that's kind of the surgeon's  approach or um you know healing the skin reducing   infection that we really have to look at the  person as a whole including their environment so   um now we can open it up to questions or comments  um and we don't have a since we're not in a room   face to face uh i can't see who uh has a question  or raise a hand we're not able to do that uh   within this webex so i would just ask uh people to  feel free to speak up to um please state your name and happy to continue the discussion so um does anyone want to start with some questions  comments i could start with a question if that's   all right uh this is mary frances o'connor um  wonderful talk i i love hearing the scope of   of your work jen um i guess my question has to do  a little bit with resilience um i've been thinking   recently about the difference between um partners  who are coupled versus partners who are married   um and so we know demographically right that  not as many people are marrying as previously   in our in our history um and that people even sort  of have sequential relationships with the same   person right um and so i i guess i'm wondering  if there's any way that the sort of resilience   of a commitment um you may not actually have  any data on this but the resilience of the   commitment gets under the skin so that stresses  within a marriage are perhaps not exacting the   same toll or the same length of toll um than in  a situation where the commitment is less clear   boy that's a great question i wish i knew  the answer you're right demographic trends   are such that when we're recruiting couples  now we ask that they have lived together   not that they've been married because that  tends to be more of what people are doing   and it may mean less of a commitment i'm not  sure but it's certainly a commitment to live   together i would love to know if there are  data like that it would be a fascinating question other questions or comments i guess i can ask kind of a very general question  maybe all speakers may have thoughts on this uh   we're living in a unusually challenging  time uh so i was wondering if you have   any thoughts on you know you talked about  these psychosocial stressors add a pandemic   to that um do you have any thoughts on how  that may further exacerbate uh these outcomes   in individuals and you know what the impact   can be that's a really fascinating question  and a really good one um what we're seeing is   in a naturalistic experiment is overlaying  social isolation which itself is stressful   um economic stresses uh and interpersonal  stresses on top of whatever else was already there   the there's been an escalation in terms of  loneliness that i've certainly seen reported   some of our earlier studies back in 1984  we were showing differences in terms of   immune function and lonelier medical students  versus their less lonely counterparts so that   what i would assume is happening over time is  that we are the the general stress is increasing   um it's having an impact physiologically  and that the more resilient uh and better   connected are better off but those who  are already disadvantaged in terms of   marital or other stresses in their lives  are finding themselves increasingly at risk right thank you i don't see anything in the  chat box i don't know if anyone else does this is bill elwood lois could i have a  question that kind of combines both janice and   mary francis's points sure thanks uh with with  the covid pandemic and the um unique ways that   human beings are mating and procreating and  raising children's these days there are perhaps   non-tradition there are non-spousal caregiving  relationships that are going on and yet have a   sense of commitment over their  life course um and i i think   some of what i'm seeing janice are absolutely  right about all the risks of loneliness uh um and   health consequences from people being isolated i  think another example though are stories of people   who have either bonded out of necessity uh um or  within their communities and um and or families   spending more time together in strengthening  bonds i i i also think i think everything you've   you've both said is is worth exploring and  i think that the the positive possibilities   of of whether these these uh um idiosyncratic  relationships that have come together by din of   the epidemic will endure and perhaps have positive  longer-term effects over the course of these lives thanks oh that's that is a fascinating  question uh for both the good and the bad um   because certainly we're at a time where everyone is challenged and that there are unique  there are unique relationships that have emerged   you're you're focusing on positive social  relationships which i tend to focus on the   negative because it's more useful in terms of  what i'm studying in terms of just regulation   but the flip side of it is exactly that  um with with more positive relationships   and with the growth of other  relationships too there could be   some really positive outcomes that are emerging as  well it's uh that's a really great question i wish   this is one where i wish i had unlimited  funds to study lots of people over time   uh and unlimited time and resources as well  but of course this is life doesn't happen any other questions or comments we are running  ahead of schedule so we have time yes lois i'm   wondering it's bill again i'm wondering if  you've seen the question from teresa cruz oh okay i'm seeing it now thank you for pointing  that out sure okay so uh teresa cruz is uh one   of our nih colleagues she's at the national  center for medical rehabilitation research   okay so uh i will read her question and she  was also served on our planning committee so   thank you for your question teresa um so you  started with data on vaccine effectiveness and   the impact of stress you also mentioned cover 19.  i was wondering if you had any thoughts about the   misc multi-system inflammatory  syndrome in children i don't know a lot about it and i wish i did in  terms of saying something um it might be useful um it's not something i know enough about to really  comment about intelligently and i wish i did   so i'm sorry i don't think i could add  to that discussion okay that's fine um and you know trees and others i mean  obviously feel free to follow up   uh independently with the speakers um if  you have other questions or comments okay   so okay teresa says thank you okay uh i don't see  phil do you see anything else that i'm overlooking   uh um you're not you're not overlooking it  uh um lois it just came in from martha matoca   our colleague from ninr for the marriage  couples with high conflict behaviors and altered   takalamin levels were these couples informed  of these changes and if so did it alter their   behaviors no we didn't tell couples about any  of their physiological data boy it would have   been interesting to do so i doubt that it  would have personally i doubt that it would   have affected the behavior but i don't know but no  couples did not know about any of their own data we were studying physiology  and behavior independently okay uh there is another question um from the  shoddy uh one of my nih colleagues at nihd really   uh have you looked at or observed any racial  ethnic disparities in wound healing among couples we did not but we did not have a  very diverse sample uh columbus ohio   and the samples that we have we were about 16  to 17 african americans so we weren't powered to   see differences um in terms of i know that  there are ethnic and racial differences in il-6   that are thought to be genetic in part but   we were not powered enough in our  studies to be able to see those uh hi this is betsy corwin i have a question  for janice if i may i'm just thinking about   the uh the risk the risks the health risks  associated with chronic stress and chronic   inflammation just almost setting people up for  for different multiple chronic conditions and   i'm i at columbia university and in new york  city we certainly saw this disproportionate   effect of covid on low income and minority  populations and so it's impossible not to think   that perhaps the chronic conditions that afflict  people when they are exposed to chronic stress   racial discrimination you know many different  types of chronic stress and um neighborhood   stressors and living in multiple families  in smaller places it's do you think that uh   that is something to think about in terms of how  to reduce the social disadvantage or these health   consequences um in the future would you could you  think of how we might address that or think about   preparing or working to relieve these  risk factors for the future well   you know you raise such an important question  and we know with effects of kova that yeah the   the the effects are greatest in the people who are  most disadvantaged it's not surprising if you look   at mental health data or not surprising  to me if you look at mental health data   because those are groups that are at greater  risk for a variety of poor mental health outcomes   the stresses of disadvantage and discrimination  are are notable and make a big difference   i don't know how we remedy those easily going  forward um but it does mean that in terms of when   we're looking at things like vaccine responses  that we would likely see that there could be   differences in vaccine responses in those groups  that might be disproportional to other groups that   there may be greater disadvantage in those groups  as well okay um anything else we're running ahead   of schedule still so if there's anything else we  can uh take a few questions if not um thank you   again janice that was a wonderful presentation  and as you can see there was a lot of interest   uh among the others here in the virtual  room um one thing i just want to point   out for people who are watching on the nih  video cast you will not have an opportunity   through the video cast um to um submit questions  and you will not have access to the chat box   and so but but i as i said earlier i'm still very  glad you're with us today and um you can always   feel free to follow up with the speakers um with  me and uh we'll try and keep the discussion going   okay so now we'll move on to our second keynote  dr steve cole steve cole is a genomics researcher   at the david geffen school of medicine at ucla  his research utilizes molecular genetics and   computational bioinformatics to analyze the  pathways by which the social and environmental   factors influence the activity of the human genome  as well as viral intuitive genomes he's a pioneer   in the field of social genomics and serves as  the director of the ucla social genomics core   laboratory the title of dr cole's presentation  is social regulation of human gene expression   so i will turn it over to steve thank you um  good morning to everybody and thanks very much   for the opportunity to join you all today for this  fascinating conversation i'm gonna essentially in   a sort of mechanistic sense sort of uh dive down  deeper into the kinds of relationships that dr   kiko glaser just articulated and essentially  sort of bring genomics-based technologies   into that realm of psychoneuroimmunology in  an effort to understand essentially sort of   the genomic programming that underlies these  relationships between stress and immune function   between social support and relationships and  immune function and hopefully shed some light   on some of the questions that just came up in  the question and answer session it turns out   we have at least some indications about  likely answers to some of those questions   based on inferences from the genomics world so for  those of you who are not familiar with me i study   the everyday life of the human genome essentially  how the life circumstances we inhabit the cultural   social economic political context that we live  in how those kinds of extra individual influences   make their way into our bodies often  through our brains and perceptual systems   and ultimately impact the function of the human  genome the patterns of activity across the 20 000   or so genes present in our genome this is a sort  of a weird thing for a genomics researcher to do   so uh usually i start my talks by just giving  people a little bit of a sort of insight into   our motivation for getting in this kind of hybrid  world in the first place so i'm going to show you   data here from a molecular epidemiologic study  if i can get my slides to advance there we go um   in this heat plot what you see are results from a  small study comparing a number of individuals who   are exposed to high versus low levels of one of  the most toxic environmental risk factors known to   epidemiology um in this heat plot this is a sort  of a conventional way of summarizing genomic data   when there's many many outcomes being surveyed  in this case the rows correspond to individuals   exposed to high versus low levels of the risk  factor columns correspond to one of about 200   genes that were found to differ in their average  activity level the sort of abundance of messenger   rna for that gene present in a population of  white blood cells sampled from individuals   exposed to high levels of the risk factor in  the first few rows of the heat plot and low   levels in the last few rows columns and the the  cell formed by the intersection between a row   corresponding to an individual and a column  corresponding to a gene to the extent that that   cell is colored red that means high expression of  that gene and that person's white blood cell pool   uh to the extent that it's colored  green that stems from low expression   of that gene or low uh sort of activity  of that gene in the white blood cell pool   so all these organized blocks of red and green are  really telling us is that uh individuals exposed   to high levels of this risk factor have around  70 to almost 80 genes that are systematically   more active in their white blood cells and  about 130 genes that are systematically less   active in their white blood cells and it turns  out that these differences um don't reflect a   random smattering of all 20 000 genes in the  human genome they actually represent a few   coherent themes or you i guess you could think  of them as organized conspiracy so for example   prominent among the genes that are more active in  people exposed to high levels of the risk factor   are a block that are involved in the  inflammation or the cell's initial   response to wounding injury and the process  through which immune responses get initiated   and then prominent among the genes down regulated  in people's white blood cells when exposed to   high levels of this risk factor are blocked that  are actually involved in protecting us against   viral infections particularly type 1 interferons  involved in innate antiviral responses as well as transcripts involved in encoding uh one particular  isotype of an antibody now this particular sort of   you can think of it as like a coordinated shift  in the basal gene expression armamentarium of the   immune cells i don't think would be particularly  surprising if the risk factor that we were looking   at in this particular study were the kind of sort  of physical chemical or microbial stimuli that we   all worry most about i think in epidemiology like  you know exposure to a coronavirus or uh cigarette   smoke in the lungs or benzene in the drinking  water but what got me particularly interested in   this area of research is that in this particular  study the risk factor that's actually structuring   these differences in immune cell gene expression  profiles is simply the extent to which the people   in the first few rows of this heat plot  feel disconnected from the rest of humanity   it's actually loneliness that is the risk factor  structuring these differences in gene expression   and for me that was a little bit more of a  surprise um because i you know i'm used to   thinking about immune cells as responding  predominantly to microbial influences or   other kinds of proximal physical chemical  stimuli it wasn't particularly clear to me   or other immunologists why these uh cells  would be systematically altering their   basal transcriptional stance in response to  social conditions in an individual's life and   completely independent of you know sort of  any kind of incident disease so after kind   of initially stumbling on to these findings and  again it's it's kind of resonant that some of the   earliest psychoneuroimmunology work documenting  differences in cellular immune function and and   humoral immune responses involved this same  dimension of loneliness as dr kiko glazer was   articulating earlier so we got very interested in  this and started a number of follow-up studies and   it soon became obvious that this particular shift  towards greater expression of inflammatory genes   and the circulating leukocyte pool and reduced  activity of genes involved in antiviral defense   wasn't particularly unique to social isolation  as we did more studies we found that in fact in   response to a wide variety of adverse life  circumstances we see similar general themes   in transcriptional profiling studies that  essentially any time works exposed to extended   periods of threat or even uncertainty you don't  need to be overtly threat uh you know overtly   threatened or experienced you know like a a a an  accident event you can simply feel worried and   insecure for an extended period of time and that's  enough to activate this kind of transcriptional   shift away from anti-viral defenses and with a  complementary upregulation of inflammatory biology   in subsequent studies we start to map the  biological mechanisms involved and i'll spare you   all the you know sort of gritty details in the  animal and cellular research signal transduction   studies and all that but what i can share with  you is kind of the take-home point that we now   understand pretty well how these effects occur  many of these effects are mediated in large   part in innate immune cells particularly  myeloid lineage cells monocytes neutrophils   dendritic cells other cells that come out  of this myeloid differentiation program   in the bone marrow and then traffic through  the blood eventually making their way to either   healthy tissue sites for long-term surveillance  or making their way particularly at during periods   of injury or infection or autoimmune disease to  localize tissue environments where they attempt to   essentially eradicate the threats to cellular  health and well-being so it turns out that   monocytes and neutrophils and other kinds of  myeloid lineage cells are exquisitely sensitive   to signaling from the fight or flight division  of the autonomic nervous system when our brains   uh essentially assess the world that we  live in as threatening or insecure that   triggers fight-or-flight stress responses in  sympathetic nerve fibers that end up releasing   uh particularly the neural effector molecule  norepinephrine that dr kiko glaser again mentioned   earlier as being sort of prominently associated  with certain forms of relationship adversity   um in if you've got norepinephrine released  from these sympathetic nerve fibers that is   going to interact with beta adrenergic receptors  present on the surface of these myeloid linear   cells as well as on the surface of other immune  cells but their effects in myeloid cells are   particularly distinctive there's a particularly  clear transcriptional program that gets activated   when myeloid lineage cells are exposed to  norepinephrine from the sympathetic nervous system   um essentially what happens is the evolution  has programmed the signal transduction machinery   the biochemical response pathways that are  associated with these beta adrenergic receptors   to essentially suppress the transcription of genes  that are involved in type 1 interferon responses   while at the same time actively stimulating the  transcription of genes involved in inflammation   so that includes genes like il-1 beta il-6 tumor  necrosis factor interleukin-8 basically at this   point you know every major usual suspect in  pro-inflammatory biology seems to be engaged   by this kind of acceleratory program through beta  adrenergic signaling and at the same time there's   a profound suppression of uh transcription of  type one interferon genes and as you all might   appreciate this is a particularly bad program  to run right now in the midst of the coronavirus   epidemic because innate immune responses to the  extent that they can be mounted against this virus   are actually quite effective at limiting  its replication if you can limit this virus   at the earliest stages of infection you can  largely avert even symptomatic disease much less   you know sort of serious morbidity in the covid19  sense so we'd love to have more of this type one   interferon biology on board at this time and of  course that inflammatory biology is the recipe   for the airway inflammation that ultimately  culminates in uh covet 19 disease and sort   of symptomatic airway inflammatory biology  that leads in some cases to really severe   respiratory distress and coagulation syndromes  related to the the sort of inflammatory response   so this kind of stress biology into  reprogramming of innate immune response is   a dysfunctional certainly in the context of  coronavirus infection it's going to turn out   as i'll show in a few slides to be a major  driver of other disease processes as well   um so as i mentioned it's these monocytes that  seem to be the primary if you will sort of   listeners for this kind of stress induced  autonomic nervous system activation and   noradrenergic signaling and that happens at two  different levels um at one level we have existing   monocytes with those receptors present on the cell  surface that i just described that essentially   when the fight-or-flight stress responses occur  they hear the norepinephrine signal and alter   gene expression as a result but there's a second  layer of influence that may in fact be even more   influential than this um sort of per cell response  by existing immune cells and this has to do   with the sort of fluid nature of the white blood  cell compartment the ongoing regeneration of the   circulating leukocyte pool because these myeloid  linear cells it turns out don't live very long   in circulation so every single day our bodies  have to regenerate huge numbers of these myeloid   lineage cells to replace the ones that  are lost under steady state conditions   so in adverse environmental conditions one thing  that happens is as the brain perceives uh the   world to be threatening or at least unsafe that  activates these sympathetic nervous system neurons   uh to release norepinephrine and one of the places  those neurons terminate is actually in the bone   marrow micro environment where these hematopoietic  stem cells are busy regenerating the white blood   cell pool every single day of our lives and  what happens as the norepinephrine is released   essentially it makes a sort of a relay set  of signals that persuade the hematopoietic   stem cells that are busy regenerating the white  blood cell pool to reduce production of lymphoid   lineage cells these sort of big smart antigen  specific cells like t cells and b lymphocytes and   to enhance instead output of myeloid lineage cells  so you get stem cells producing more myeloid linea   cells more neutrophils more monocytes other kinds  of granulocytes and these cells then make their   way out of the bone marrow environment and into  systemic circulation so these cells essentially   become the complement of circulating blood that  we actually draw when we we do for instance um you   know sort of blood sampling studies in in human  clinical research so what's happening essentially   is this threat biology is remodeling the you  can think of it as the cellular demography of   the circulating blood cell pool we are getting  more myeloid cells in circulation particularly   more young immature highly pro-inflammatory  myeloid cells that has a variety of implications   in the context of the brain for example we know  from the work of john sheridan at ohio state a   colleague of dr kiko blazers that these cells for  example make their way into the central nervous   system and contribute to neuroinflammatory and  neurodegenerative diseases these same monocytes   when they become recruited into damaged blood  vessels particularly in the coronary arteries   precipitate atherosclerosis monocytes end  up over recruiting into the lung and cause   lung and airway disease pneumonia and asthma  and of course this same dynamic greater monocyte   development and sort of pro-inflammatory priming  and a greater population of inflammatory monocytes   is probably part of the you know sort of variation  in individual vulnerability to covid19 as well   and in addition as we're changing the gene  expression profiles in these monocytes they become   less effective at responding to viral infections  and this is true in part due to the intrinsic   characteristics of the monocytes as they come  out of the bone marrow and in part because when   these monocytes then become involved in  antigen presentation in the lymph nodes   there's another set of sympathetic nerve fibers  in that micro environment that essentially alter   the kinds of cytokine production that at  that point macrophages and dendritic cells   are making that would otherwise induce strong  antiviral responses instead they tend to produce   stronger humoral immune responses that are  relatively less effective at antiviral responses   and then finally these monocytes are also um  recruited into tissues when uh those tissues   are intruded upon by their sort of out of  control neighbors the in the from the world   of cancer so as you know individual tumor cells  begin to squash the surrounding healthy tissue   the healthy tissue ends up triggering monocyte  recruitment and then monocyte mediated responses   that inadvertently end up actually accidentally  precipitating tumor metastasis and the progression   of many particularly solid tumors and then finally  a particular relevance for wound healing is the   fact that as these monocytes get recruited  into damaged tissue they play a key role both   in mediating the initial phases of inflammatory  response to wounding injury as well as perhaps   even more importantly the long-term conversion of  that initial inflammatory response into a wound   healing response particularly a reprogramming of  the sort of original epithelial cell structure of   the wound environment back to a more kind of you  can think of it as as a primordial mesenchymal   differentiation program that is actually  necessary to effectively uh sort of repair   the wounded tissue to decompose the existing  damaged epithelial tissues and then restructure   uh the production of new organized epithelial  layers that require this kind of mesenchymal gene   expression program that allows for cell motility  and the development of new cell cell interactions   and relationships as well as for instance the  production of blood vessels to help supply that   growing tissue and a variety of growth factors  necessary for the development of nascent tissues   so particularly relevant in wound response so what  you can appreciate here is there's a wide variety   of disease processes that are impacted in various  ways by this uh particular flow of information   from the environment outside us through the  central nervous system essentially into the   hematopoietic system that ends up altering  the relative prevalence of particular types   of cells in the white blood cell pool and as that  white blood cell pool then interacts with various   disease processes we get very different kinds of  pathobiological responses very different kinds of   immune responses out as a result and so this is  uh at least one of the major ways through which   social adversity of the type that we've just been  discussing ends up becoming changes in concrete   cellular immune processes that ultimately mediate  differences in disease development and progression   so i'll show you a couple more examples  of this in detail one of the things that   we see for instance in animal models of  stress is that um in many cases stress   enhances the recruitment of these  myeloid lineage cells neutrophils   monocytes sometimes dendritic cells into  tissue environment so compared to the control   cells on the left in this particular case we're  using cancer as a model of damaging healthy   tissue around it but you can see that  in the stressed animals there's simply   more monocytes recruited into the tumor  micro environment itself to differentiate   into macrophages and therefore in this case  produce much more pro-inflammatory signaling   and then uh shortly as i mentioned before pivot  into this more mesenchymal gene expression   program that inadvertently promotes metastasis by  growing blood vessels and supplying growth factors   and sort of keeping cells in this highly  modal mesenchymal differentiation status in addition to more cells in the wound environment  the cells that do get there are more inflammatory   and you can see here an example of this where  we're looking just simply at a kind of per cell   level so these are monocytes macrophages  isolated from all other tissues and then   just stimulated with norepinephrine and we're  following up at various points in time comparing   gene expression for two key pro-inflammatory  cytokines uh interleukin-6 and interleukin-8   over the first four or so hours  after this monocyte macrophage cell   is exposed to these kinds of noradrenergic signals  that interact with the beta-adrenergic receptors   and you can see what we typically see is somewhere  on the order of a three to a sort of an eight or   a nine fold increase in the activity of genes  encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines so this is   quite uh you know enough to alter the course of a  sort of a macrophage mediated biological response   um as i mentioned before there's also this pivot  away from a uh sort of what you would think of as   essentially a sort of basal epithelial phenotype  but towards a more mesenchymal phenotype and that   epithelial mesenchymal transition is mediated by  some key transcription factors i wouldn't claim   we know all of them yet but certainly we have  a set of usual suspects and you can see here   some similar examples where we're exposing uh  macrophages to norepinephrine and asking whether   the activity or in this case the expression  of messenger rna for these key mesenchymal   polarizing transcription factors uh increases over  time you can see again something on the order of a   you know 30 fold or so increase particularly for  the snail one member of this family for the other   members of this emt differentiation control system  we typically see maybe two to four fold increases   um it's probably the case that many of these are  downstream from the snail one transcription factor   itself that it's probably snail one itself  that's directly stimulated by beta adrenergic   signaling and fight or flight stress physiology  and that in turn kicks off a secondary wave of   activity through a host of different uh epithelial  mesenchymal transition uh promoting transcription   factors like these so um in animal models we see  the same kind of thing if we go in and survey   tissues either in wound settings or in you know  settings involving cancers the you know sort of   pathological wound that never heals uh stressed  animals show more expression of messenger rnas   that are characteristic of this mesenchymal  differentiation phenotype including that snail   one transcription factor as well as markers  of mesenchymal differentiation like momentum   and other transcription factors involved in  mediating these effects like snail 2 or slug i'll show you some data from human cancers here  as a representative example uh again uh you know   sort of probably pretty representative of what  we would see in experimental wounds that don't   involve in cancer but we personally don't do those  i think some of the subsequent speakers may have   more to say about this kind of thing but broadly  speaking if we just do genome-wide transcriptional   profiling and then metric the empirical  differences that occur let's say in tumors   that have high levels of norepinephrine in them  essentially highly supplied with sympathetic nerve   fibers we find modest reductions in the expression  of epithelial characteristic genes but usually   pretty marked increases in the transcription of  genes involved in mesenchymal differentiation   so this again tends to promote metastasis and  tends to undermine efficient wound healing if   it becomes protracted it prevents the sort of  efficient reconstruction of epithelial tissues   if this kind of mesenchymal bias is maintained  for too long in a kind of dysfunctional way   we see similar kinds of things if we make  distinctions not in terms of do tumors have   norepinephrine in them which you can think of as  sort of the proximal you know sort of stimuli but   you know just in terms of let's say social  epidemiologic risk factors if we look for example   at breast cancer patients who have low levels  of social support they feel essentially isolated   as they're confronting this tremendous health  threat um you can see that those who have low   levels of social support relative to patients  who have high levels of social support when   we actually look in their resected breast  cancer tissues we find that they show more   expression of mesenchymal genes to the exclusion  of epithelial genes and they tend to show more   expression of genes that are characteristic  of the so-called m2 macrophage differentiation   profile that is part of the key mediator of  this kind of mesenchymal gene expression program   so these kinds of effects we can map them out  at every layer we can start with the kinds   of real world observations that dr kiko glazer  talked about we can use observational studies   with genomic methods in those kinds of populations  to look and essentially identify correlations and   sometimes when we can do experiments even causal  effects on these gene expression profiles and we   can move these down to cellular and animal models  and actually work out in relatively clear detail   the specific molecular pathways through  which these trans these these sort of   biases or transformations take place i mean  then once we have these mechanistic models   locked down they're certainly not comprehensive  but they provide us at least some clear molecular   targets we can start trying to translate those  into protective interventions we can use these   as biomarkers to assess the impact of behavioral  metrics or behavioral interventions and we can   also use them as targets for pharmacologic  interventions to actually block these effects   so broadly speaking you can think of this  programming that the the human genome seems   to inherited as a kind of a recipe for how not to  live both in the figurative sense that the risk   factors that activate this transcriptional program  are unpleasant things like you know sort of um   major threat insecurity adversity  you know things like discrimination   poverty uh loneliness low social support  but also literally in the sense that these   inflammatory gene expression programs tend to  promote the development of most chronic diseases   and the suppression of those type 1 interferon  responses is certainly not very helpful in the   context of viral infections like the  pandemic we confront at the moment   so at some point you know as we were documenting  these relationships between risk factors   um from you can think of it as the world of social  epidemiology and the kind of biological impact   at the level of genome function we began to ask  the question that was brought up by some of the   the you know sort of queries at the end of the  last presentation what about resilience what are   the kinds of psychological or social or cultural  factors that might block these effects um in other   words one way to put it is can we find people  who are in adverse life circumstances but aren't   actually showing this molecular fingerprint of  distress and sympathetic nervous system activity   how are there people who are protected from  this at least to some quantitative extent   and so you can think of this broadly as a  question not about how not to live but more   kind of prescriptively how should we live instead  what are the characteristics of people that seem   to be relatively protected from this kind of  genomic response to adverse life circumstances   now most of you will you know recognize that  questions about how we should live have not   traditionally been the providence of molecular  biologists it's typically been um you know moral   philosophers or maybe more recently happiness  psychologists who are asking these questions about   what's the best way to be in life but it struck  me as an opportunity to answer that question in   a slightly different way if we could survey gene  expression and ask who's doing well despite living   in adverse circumstances or adverse times so as  we began to do this work and i interacted more   with people studying positive psychobiology it  became clear that there was really sort of two   broad theories about the best way to be in life  traditionally i think we we mostly think about   uh happiness in the sense that epicurus did in  the way that psychologists call hedonic well-being   that you know sort of one version of the good  life is to just simply have lots of positive   emotions to you know do things that drive our  hedonic machinery forward our brain chemistry   of happiness and well-being you know see beautiful  sights uh eat tasty food buy stuff from the mall   you know keep our reward circuits humming in  terms of positive stimulation you can think   of this as essentially the epicurean recipe for  the good life epicurious really thought that you   know the good life is a life that's happy it's a  life that's filled with positive emotional states   um that perspective can be contrasted to some  extent with another conception of well-being that   doesn't stress positive emotional states so much  as a more abiding form of well-being that comes   from doing something significant or important  a sense of well-being that arrives not from   feeding my own you know sort of consummatory  self-gratification machine in my brain   but rather comes from you know sort of engaging  in some kind of self-transcendent effort to   help others to create things to make the world a  better place to you know to to put it i guess you   know sort of crudely to pursue virtue instead of  happiness so this conception of well-being um the   you know sort of the positive psychologist  generally referred to as eudaimonic well-being and   this is really the conception that stretches back  to aristotle who coined this term um to describe   the process of finding the real you your inner  daemon or your inner true spirit um and so you   demonic well-being is kind of distinguished from  hedonic well-being and being less oriented towards   positive emotions per se and more um you know  sort of oriented towards uh if you would uh kind   of put it this way helping to uh you know sort of  pursue virtue make the world a better place help   others create things discover things that sort of  thing so as i was doing research with uh positive   psychologists in this area you can get a sense  of sort of how they assess hedonic well-being   and eudaimonic well-being from some of these  representative examples from the questionnaires   so if they're assessing hedonic well-being they  use surveys that ask how often do you feel happy   or satisfied with your life uh whereas the kinds  of questions that assess you dymonic well-being   have more the flavor of how often do you feel  like your life has a direction to it or a sense   of meaning how often do you feel like you're  growing and becoming a better person you can   think of this as a more you know kind of complex  or nuanced or kind of virtue focused um approach   to feeling well what's been interesting  is that as we look at gene expression data   although the the people that i initially you  know started this work with were very much in the   hedonic well-being camp that's what they study uh  interestingly we almost never found that people   with relatively high levels of hedonic well-being  at least to the exclusion of eudaimonic well-being   we're really showing favorable differences in gene  expression in fact if anything they showed either   similar uh or or sometimes even worse profiles of  inflammatory and antiviral gene expression than   individuals with modest levels of psychological  well-being where we really saw recurrent defects   is in the context of eudaimonic well-being where  a number of studies now have found that people who   report greater sense of eudaimonic well-being  especially relative to hedonic well-being they   they maybe feel good but they feel good they  got to that feeling of of sort of well-being   by pursuing this more effortful eudaimonic virtue  related path and surprisingly consistent pattern   of results that people who report greater sense of  purpose meaning and eudaimonic well-being in their   lives tend to show more favorable gene expression  profiles that is lower expression of inflammatory   genes and higher expression of genes involved  in type 1 interferon innate antiviral responses   so i'll show you an example of this kind of  thing that that may be particularly irrelevant   these are data from a study  in which teresa seaman at ucla   basically trains older african-american adults  in south central l.a so in a relatively economic   impoverished environment she basically gets what  she calls grandmas out of their houses and into   the local public schools to serve as teachers  aides so these people are trained over the   course of the summer months and then essentially  uh sort of allocated to some of the classrooms in   kindergarten to third grade in the south central  la schools and their job is essentially to help   all of the kids with you know sort of self  regulation and and sort of curriculum mastery   but to especially focus on helping the maybe one  or two kids per classroom who are really coming   from the most adverse home environments and we're  really you know most challenged in terms of their   ability to just kind of get things together for a  productive learning day and uh so they they really   have been fabulous teaching aides but what's  interesting if i i may point this out is that the   people who put this generation exchange program  together in the la unified school district they   weren't pediatricians they were gerontologists  so that alone might lead you to suspect that   there's a kind of a secret sauce at work here and  in fact that's exactly what uh is going on this   intervention was developed predominantly to help  the helpers to help these older you know sort of   grandmas as teresas calls them who would otherwise  you know basically spend the the bulk of their day   relatively inactive maybe watching tv not going  out very much at high risk for isolation and   all of the kinds of things that we know attend  to that particularly for older individuals for   those of you who are not familiar with this um you  know living in isolation late in life is kind of a   recipe for a variety of things ranging from  sarcopenia to you know sort of falls and other   kinds of things that can really be kind of a  sort of a behavioral death spiral essentially   in an older age so she's basically getting them  out and into the public schools where they can   help these at-risk kids but what we see here in  this graph is that as they're helping these kids   they're showing a you know notable decline in the  expression of inflammatory genes and a relative   reciprocal upregulation of expression of type  1 interferon genes so in absolute terms these   aren't huge huge effects they're somewhere on the  order of you know five to eight percent reductions   in average expression in this case of a composite  of 53 indicator genes but they're at least an   indication that this kind of correlation that i  described earlier can actually be protocolized   it can be implemented in programming that takes  place in community settings and in these kinds   of community settings that are realistically  achievable they can have discernible positive   effects on aspects of biology that are clearly  relevant to health disparities it can reduce   inflammatory biology that for example might help  accelerate coronavirus infection and precipitate   airway disease and it can uh favorably impact  type 1 interferon responses that would be great   at you know sort of maximizing host resistance  to viral infection in this case so that's one   example of this kind of thing there's a number of  other studies where people have used you know sort   of randomized controlled experiments to document  similar effects on uh inflammatory gene expression   and antiviral gene expression so it looks like  this you know this is not a huge literature at   this point but so far the experimental data  suggests that the correlation probably has   at least some causal mechanism to it in other  words if we can change pro-social behavior if we   can change helping behavior if we can essentially  enhance eudaimonic well-being we can see favorable   impacts on gene expression um so how does that  happen in the context of that model that i just   described earlier well one thing that we we  suspect and again i should now sort of paint   a bright line and say i'm about to tell you a  hypothesis i'm not going to claim that this is   what i you know this theory that i'm about to  articulate is sort of well documented at this   point but it's actually the only theory that  we have right now that we haven't been able to   relatively easily refute with the data at hand  but one of the things that is is reasonably   well established is that the sympathetic nervous  system can be functionally inhibited by caregiving   and this happens because there is a fair amount  of investment it turns out in human physiology   around caregiving particularly for mother infant  caregiving and the long-term pair bonding that's   required for the human life history strategy  the strategy of producing babies that are kind   of taboola rasa and need to be taught and cared  for for many years that has developed uh over our   evolutionary history a bunch of neurobiological  infrastructure including a special wing of the   parasympathetic nervous system that seems to  be associated with relationship development   and maintenance in general in particular with  mother child caregiving in ways that relate   to for instance breastfeeding and other kinds of  you can think of them as literally physiological   components of caregiving one of the things we  know about the parasympathetic nervous system is   that it can laterally inhibit the activity of the  sympathetic nervous system so if the sympathetic   nervous system is carrying these fight or flight  stress signals from the brain down to the monocyte   it is possible that the parasympathetic  system is actually sort of inhibiting   that kind of biology when we undertake this  more kind of eudaimonic or caregiving biology   there is a particular set of reward related  regions in the brain that seems to be key to   this kind of caregiving behavior and although  i'm not going to go into it we now know when we   stimulate the activity of this neurobiological  circuitry experimentally in animals   we can see similar favorable changes in gene  expression in the circulating immune cell pool   so um that i think is the bulk of what i wanted  to you know sort of present to you guys today   um we now know that there is a sort of conserved  transcriptional response to adversity there's   a kind of generic core response in  the circulating white blood cell pool   um this is certainly you know a component of  lots of adversity i'm not going to claim this   is the only pathway that's active and certainly  other pathways are active in any given form   of adversity or stress or other kinds of local  circumstances but beyond these sort of localized   idiosyncratic genomic responses there seems  to be a generalized theme where people express   uh people exposed to adversity for extended  periods of time tend to develop a stereotyped   transcriptional response that involves increased  inflammation and reduced type 1 interferon biology   this seems to be conserved across species we can  see this all the way down to fish so you know it   seems to be a relatively primordial component of  genome function and it in connection between the   nervous system and the uh sort of biology of the  immune system it seems to be mediated by central   nervous system perceptions of threat or safety  and it is mediated particularly in vertebrates   predominantly by beta adrenergic signaling that  is norepinephrine releasing from the sympathetic   nervous system impacting these white blood cells  um impacting both per cell gene expression in   other words existing cells change their gene  expression profile as well as altering the the you   can think of it as the the population structure  of the existing white blood cell pool through   those effects on myelobuilesis or the development  of monocytes and other kinds of myeloid lineage   cells in the bone marrow that leads to a bias  in the characteristics of monocytes macrophages   and to some extent neutrophils and dendritic cells  that end up altering the biology of wound healing   of epithelial mesenchymal transition in other  contexts like cancer that alters the biology of   cardiovascular disease and infectious diseases and  i think as we think about how to respond to this   we know that there's at least a couple things  that can make a difference in reducing this   one pharmacologic beta adrenergic antagonists  seem like a promising idea we use them in animals   with great effect so we understand the mechanisms  pretty well i'm not going to claim at this point   that we have enough human clinical trial data  that we should just put beta blockers in the   drinking water but um in certain contexts where  we can't solve stress or threat problems any   other way like you know patients who've just been  diagnosed with cancer and are going in for surgery   and we don't want this adverse biology to you know  sort of uh undermine the efficiency of surgery and   promote minimal residual disease there now are  trials ongoing to use beta blockers to block   those effects i think one of the most exciting  opportunities is this discovery that you demonic   well-being that activating our caregiving  circuitry that engaging in things that are   important and valuable and pro-social that  tend to activate this set of reward circuits   known as the ventral striatum that seems to  be an interesting sort of touch point for   theorizing about what kinds of behavioral or  psychological interventions might be effective   in counteracting these impacts as well so with  that let me thank you for your attention and let   me also acknowledge a number of collaborators that  were particularly relevant to the data panels i   shared today including naomi eisenberger and her  group barbara frederickson and sonia lubamirsky   and also i i omitted her name here by accident  but particularly teresa seaman and her generation   exchange program and with that uh lois let me  know how much time i have to answer questions   or whether i should just kind of get off the  stage and be quiet sure so uh well since we're   uh ahead of schedule we have time for questions  and uh so there are some really good questions in   the chat box but before we get to those i want  to kind of open it up to the other uh workshop   panelists and uh rita pickler i believe you have  a question so if you'd like to mute yourself and   feel free to ask it yes thanks lois can you hear  me yes good so dr cole that was a very interesting   talk thank you so much for providing that today  and i will tell you that i have at least uh one of   my former students um watching today and she and i  are working together in her postdoc now uh with uh   pre-term infants and we're particularly interested  in the stress that babies experience very early in   life particularly in the nicu and so our question  was we had a little communication back and forth   during your talk was um whether you have collected  any data about any of the long-term effects   about these immune changes about whether or  not they in fact might be reversible because   that's i think really important for the kind  of work that we're doing in infant research   yeah i agree uh that i think is one of the most  important and frankly kind of understudied and   often misunderstood questions um in this kind of  whole biology of gene expression and epigenetics   i think we have become conditioned by the kind  of the epigenetic dogma to believe that early   adversity is going to lock in and essentially  curse us for the rest of our lives and possibly   even be intergenerationally transmitted and curse  our progeny for the rest of history for a variety   of reasons i don't think that's likely actually to  be the case in reality and empirically i can tell   you we actually have pretty good data from a study  that steve sumi did so as you probably know steve   randomizes monkeys at birth to relatively  adverse early rearing conditions you know   sort of a cage with no adults and a lot of other  infant monkeys kind of flying around chaotically   um and what most people uh know is that  you know those monkeys show changes in in   you know behavior and disease risk we see  exactly the same kind of biological adverse   you know that conserved transcriptional  response to adversity in those monkeys   what most people don't know is that at some point  steve puts those monkeys back into their natal   colonies and so i got especially interested in how  quickly that transcriptome deviation would change   if at all once the monkeys went back to a stable  social environment i think this is our best model   for answering the question that you just asked and  i can tell you that basically there are hundreds   i think it was something on the order of 600  or so genes in the white blood cell pool that   deviated outside the range of normal variation in  the monkeys in these adverse rearing conditions   95 of those genes reverted to back in the range  of normal variation within i think six months of   reintroduction to a kind of a stable social  environment so there's still five percent   of the genes that do appear to be relatively  permanently if you will locked down or imprinted   in addition these monkeys that were in  these unstable early conditions still are   very twitchy they show higher variation higher  responsiveness to adverse stimuli later in life   but to a first approximation their basal  regulatory set point seems to go back to normal   you know about 95 uh within a relatively  short period of time so that leaves me   on the whole relatively optimistic that we can  intervene even relatively late in life so steve   re-introduces you know a stable social  environment at a time that corresponds   to something like reproductive maturity somewhere  around you know um i think like 14 to 18 years in   human years so that's basically  spending your entire childhood   in a relatively chaotic environment has definitely  documentable bad downstream behavioral effects so   i was particularly heartened that you can you  know at least if you're a rhesus attack spend   your whole childhood under adverse circumstances  and still within the course of six months in   calendar time which probably is about you know  two to three years of human developmental time   relatively well revert most of these effects so  i'm an optimist in this regard and i think this   really underscores how much we need to  not give up and we need to keep going with   interventions because they can make a big positive  difference even relatively late in in development right well thank you for that answer and i  i will tell you i think that you know for   me and for many of the researchers whom i work  with it's particularly important that we try to   not engage that sort of um you know genetic   embedding that we later might have to reduce and  i would i think we would all agree that if we keep   that from happening that's even better even  in your setting what i would say yeah even   in your study i i worry there's a lot of people  that say well you know by the time the baby is   born it's been exposed to so much of this prenatal  stress undoubtedly true and there is still room to   have positive impact so i think that's the the key  take-home point i want to leave you with thank you   great thank you uh so we do have some other  questions in the chat box but i first want to   go to uh any of the other workshop uh  panelists uh to see if you have any questions   if if you do um please unmute yourself and  speak uh if not okay i will go to the chat box   and uh some of this you might have already touched  on but i think these are some important questions   the first is from uh lou wang how does recovery  from lowness meaning no longer feeling lovely   associated with positive changes to  omics molecular and cellular profiles   and how does loneliness cause genomic  changes impact the genomes of the offspring   so for the first question we can say that recovery  from loneliness seems to be salutatory i mean we   in in john cachiopo studies we  were able to longitudinally follow   uh you know a cohort of about 200 people over  the course of 10 years and we were able to   track the waxing and waning of loneliness  and what we see is this transcriptome profile   follows loneliness up and down with a certain  amount of lag i have to admit but in general if   we can get people feeling socially secure and sort  of well enfranchised within a kind of a community   they tend to show favorable you know changes in  gene expression so there are favorable impacts of   reducing loneliness do loneliness related genomic  changes impact the genomes of offspring this is   somewhat less clear because there just hasn't been  a direct study of that yet but i would say that i   i first i would say i think it's very likely  that there is intergenerational transmission   of loneliness in part because the psychology of  loneliness particularly chronic loneliness is   driven in no small part by perceptions of threat  or insecurity and these kinds of world views   are easily transmitted from parents to children is  the world a safe place is it a relative you know   can do can you have faith in your fellow human  being versus is the world a dangerous place and   is the world full of people that you can't trust  and you should never expose yourself to risk and   that kind of thing those kinds of world views  are very easy to transmit vertically so that   even if we're not vertically transmitting less  multiplication that changes gene expression   we might still be transmitting a cultural or  perceptual filter that ends up then driving   differences in gene expression in  progeny generations so i i would say   it's possible that there's vertical transmission  biologically i generally am skeptical of that   for a variety of you know kind of technical  biological reasons but uh no doubt there will   be vertical transmission related to you know  just sort of world views and cultural processes   and you know sort of coping styles and  affective responses and that kind of thing great and we have another question in  the chat box this is from michelle hamlet   how is loneliness defined and are there cultural  nuances that would modify that definition does   loneliness exist alone or does it tend to co-occur  with other risk factors so first loneliness is   generally defined um as feeling a sense of sort of  mistrust or disconnection from people around you   and loneliness should be distinct from isolation  loneliness is really a view towards whether you   feel is you can think of it as kind of emotionally  or spiritually connected to other human beings   there don't actually have to be other human  beings around to feel connected i think the   prototypical example of this is neil  armstrong you know setting foot on the moon   you know and thinking about all of humanity when  in fact he's farther from any other human being   than you know anybody else has ever been in  some respect and at the same time as we all   know you can be lonely in a room full of people  if you don't know them or you don't trust them   so loneliness needs to be distinguished from  isolation in the objective sense and it's really   defined in terms of people's perceptions that  they can trust or depend on or count on uh the you   know sort of goodness of others when that doesn't  exist then you know that's that's sort of the key   you know sort of ingredient of loneliness so  with that you know it we i think a natural   extension to expect that loneliness will um  possibly you know sort of vary across cultures   particularly there's a as you may know  in cultural psychology a big distinction   between uh individualistic cultures uh of which  america is probably the paradigmatic example   and these more collectivistic cultures that  are common in asia where individuals are less   focused on their selves and their own well-being  and more focused on family units and national   cultural units and kind of local community units  and feel a much greater sense of kind of fealty   piety that kind of thing so loneliness does  seem to operate differently in those kinds of   cultural environments that's not to say people  aren't lonely in those environments what it is   to say is that the sources of loneliness are  different in different cultural environments but   we can find you know wide variation in loneliness  across all cultures so far it's just that their   correlates in these cultures or their causes in  different cultures may vary and that brings up   the the final part of this question does  loneliness exist alone or does it tend to   co-occur with other risk factors loneliness  does indeed co-occur with other risk factors   um we therefore have to spend a lot  of time sort of directly measuring the   co-occurring factors and controlling from them  controlling for them in statistical analyses so   loneliness is often associated with depression but  you can find lonely people who aren't depressed   and vice versa so we just need to take those kinds  of things into account similar things with respect   to anxiety um hostility uh a sense of you know  sort of sometimes even negative affectivity a pre   kind of almost uh temperamental or neurobiological  predisposition to negative emotional states   so loneliness uh definitely kind of in this  sort of you know free range ecological condition   is often part of a bundle of risk factors but we  are exceedingly careful in the loneliness research   literature to try and control for those to ensure  that what we see is really really relatively   focally associated with loneliness right are  there other questions from the virtual people   in the room there's a another from rita pickler  if you'll oh yeah uh i had asked her to read her   question uh out loud rather than be reading it so  got it um i don't see any questions oh i'm sorry go ahead oh sorry i didn't realize you're going to  read this um we didn't read this question um steve   you talked about the noradrenergic stimulation  of the inflammatory response in mediators   and then of potentially beta  blockers or beta agonists to   switch that responsiveness i was thinking  about behavioral mechanisms to switch the   the alpha and beta adrenergic responses  perhaps or the autonomic nervous system   for example other societies or people do or  and are all a lot of yoga or mindfulness that   involves breathing changes and with the changes  in breathing affecting stimulating parasympathetic   versus a sympathetic nervous system responses  can you predict that or have you tried   to see whether practices like yoga or mindfulness  or exercise that changes breathing rhythm might   impact the responses and on inflammation yeah  that's a great question and uh luckily there's   a actually a surprisingly robust literature of  research on that now including you know very   well done randomized controlled experiments in  addition to more you know sort of observational   studies in general what that literature shows is  exactly what you would expect there are small but   certainly statistically you know significant  favorable effects on these threat related   gene expression profiles of things including  mindfulness meditation um uh let's see uh yoga   tai chi um let's see what else is out there  variants on meditation like yogic meditation   there is one study right now where they  actually were trying to do um essentially   sort of respiratory sinus arrhythmia uh  bio feedback to just get people you know   not even to meditate but to just essentially  try and get control of their respiration   in order to you know sort of uh experimentally  change uh this this kind of parasympathetic   activity and all of them seem to have again  you know small but but favorable effect so   it's certainly possible to exert those kinds  of favorable impacts through these kinds of   consciously deployed you know wellness  practices i guess broadly speaking right uh since we're running ahead of schedule but  not by very much um if there are one or two more   questions we can take them if so you can unmute  yourself uh if you're uh one of the panelists   i don't see anything else in the chat  box did someone say something yeah hi uh   lois this is a teresa jones and i just had  a question i thought it was a super talk   um i was just wondering if these patterns these  gene expression profiles are at a point in their   development that they could be used in clinical  trials or in uh you know clinical care looking   for a response and if not what would you see  are the the missing pieces to to get us there   that is a great question so we're working  hard on that um we it you know these kinds   of metrics are being used in small clinical  trials particularly in the context of cancer   there's probably room to do this in cardiovascular  disease as well but cancer was the kind of the   first out of the gate because it was easiest to  demonstrate the sort of prognostic significance of   these molecular profiles for things like  disease progression in the context of cancer   um what we really need frankly to make this  useful as a sort of a biomarker a marker or as   a biomarker for management kind of a biofeedback  biomarker is we need data in large population   health studies of thousands of people showing  that this transcriptional profile is predictive   of either disease incidence for high prevalence  diseases or disease progression for you know   at least some you know significantly prevalent  diseases so those studies are ongoing but as you   know if we put gene expression data collection in  a study today and we're still waiting for people   to develop cancers or heart attacks or all cause  mortality that takes years so we've got these   kinds of data collection efforts underway in  studies like the health and retirement study uh   the national study of adolescent to adult health  um the mida study of sort of midlife in the united you know states of surveys have just gone in in  the last two or three years so it's i would say   realistically gonna be another probably three to  five years before we have enough quantitative data   to make the case to very skeptical trials that  these molecular biomarkers aren't just significant   in laboratory experimental settings but that  they're prognostic in community-based health   settings that's the kind of biggest evidence  component we have to you know sort of prepare   at this point one of the big questions we do have  though is can we use these as bio feedback metrics   in other words if we told people what their ctra  gene expression profile is can that help motivate   and shape people's lifestyle modifications to um  achieve more favorable you know status on these   kinds of biomarkers so that's a tricky place to go  i mean obviously you don't want to terrify people   with biomarkers you want people to interpret them  you know with appropriate nuance and skepticism   while still recognizing that this represents  some of the key ongoing basal physiology   that controls whether you're going to have  you know metabolic disease in 10 years or   a heart attack in 10 years or metastatic cancer  so it we we're doing a lot of work right now on   messaging and how do we get patient understanding  of this kind of biomarker right and especially   how can we use it in a way that's positive and  constructive instead of frightening as we've   seen it can be highly detrimental to frighten the  general public about health issues it can produce   all kinds of unintended consequences so we're  taking a kind of deliberately slow approach to   you know learn as much as we can about how people  perceive these and what kinds of impacts they have   on you know ordinary human psychology before we  kind of roll them out in clinical trial settings   great so so i want to thank both of our keynotes  we're all virtually clapping for you and uh we're   back on schedule so uh i will take a break now and  uh we should uh come back uh by 12 15 eastern time   um and we'll start at 12 15 sharp so  thank you thank you again so why don't   we get started and i'll turn it over to  our moderator for the session bill elwood   thanks so much lois um i'm bill elwood from the  office of behavioral and social sciences research   one of the program coordination offices  in the larger office of the nih director   and welcome to this segment of our workshop  social genomics state of the science epigenomics   and janine and gene expression um lois  asked to tell you a bit about myself   and uh um in addition to being an obssr where  you can see what i work on uh um one of my positions that takes a great deal  of my time is the opnet initiative   a trans nih collaboration that accelerates  discoveries in the basic mechanisms and processes   that underline health behaviors you'll  see that link and perhaps another time not   today check that out and you can see some active  funding opportunities that we have um for you   for your consideration uh um first  though it's time for me to introduce dr   jackie taylor jacqueline taylor is a member of  the national academy of medicine uh recently   elected in 2019. congratulations um and among her  accomplishments that is that she is professor and   director of the center for research on people of  color at the columbia university school of nursing   her work focus focuses on the interaction of  omics and the social factors that contribute to   health disparities for common chronic conditions  among up underrepresented minority populations in   the states and vulnerable populations abroad  um dr taylor was honored with pk's award the   presidential early career award for scientists  and engineers by president barack obama in 2017   and she is examining next generation  sequencing environmental interactions   on blood pressure among african americans he's  been co-pi and director of a core project for an   ninr exploratory center and has another  ro1 intergenerational impact of genetic   psychosocial factors on blood pressure looking  at gene environmental interactions so please let   me turn things over to dr taylor jackie thank  you so much um trying to get my slides up here great okay can you see that yes ma'am  perfect all right thank you so much   for having me today it's uh been a pleasure  listening to um the presentations thus far   so today i just wanted i would like to um talk  with you all about the study that i conducted   my research team and i conducted entitled  the intergenerational impact of psychological   factors of genetic and psychological factors on  blood pressure studies so we we refer to that as   the introgen study because all of those words are  a mouthful to keep saying that over and over again   so just a little bit background on the entrogen  study this study was funded by ninr from 2014   to 2019 and this was a longitudinal study of 250  mother child dyads we recruited african-american   women from priests um from head start  programs across connecticut where the   mothers self-identified as african-american and  the eligible children in the city were between   the ages of three to five and we followed these  families for over two years we conducted repeat visits with these families every six months so  this was for a total of four visits and these   visits included data we collected data  on psychological and clinical measures   every six months and we collected data for one  dna sample at the first interview for dna analysis   the overall purpose of this study was  to examine the not only the genetic but   also the epigenetic and psychological factors  that influence um blood pressure over time so   some of the psychological factors that  we were interested in were things like   mothers perceived racial discrimination  symptoms of depression parenting behavior and   parenting style on blood pressure the genomic  factors included both genetic factors which we   measured through genome-wide association  techniques epigenetic factors that were measured   through epigenome-wide association techniques  and then we also took into account ancestry and   formative markers the aims of this study were  similar in nature but we looked at different   psychological factors so we wanted to look at the  genetic and epigenetic and environmental factor   interactions on perceived discrimination  on blood pressure maternal mental health   so symptoms of depression on blood pressure and  also mother's parenting behavior on blood pressure the study measures included not only the dna  sample which we used one saliva sample for   high throughput genomics that included genome-wide  association we use the mega array which accounts   for multi-ethnic populations and provides for  more than two million snips across the genome   we also use the alumina epic array for  epi genome-wide association that provided   information on more than 850 000 dna methylation  sites across the epigenome we took into account   ancestry-informative markers which are  included on the g-wash chip we also did   some additional analyses which i'll talk a  little bit late talk about a little bit later   which included whole genome sequencing on  a subset of the sample and also whole exome   sequencing on the on a subset of the sample we  collected blood pressure at all four time points   we also collected height and weight so that we  can calculate body mass index and in addition   to body mass index because it is not the always  the best method for out of measuring adiposity   and african american samples we also looked  at percent body fat in percent body water in   addition to this clinical information we collected  information on health history whether people have   had a history of hypertension diagnosis in  the past any other comorbidities um other   health history we also included a birth history  which resulted in um another investigator from   our research team a former trainee was able  to write a k award that was also funded by   ninr where she is now looking at pre-term birth in  this sample and dna methylation on blood pressure   using some information from this birth history so  in addition to those study measures we collected   um a lot of information on psychological  factors the interviews that we conducted   with these participants took approximately two  hours to complete they answered questions related   to parenting stress parenting behavior parenting  style experiences of discrimination race related   event scale which is all timely especially right  now based on some of the events that we see   um here in protests across the united states  stress overload coping and then for those that   were born outside of the united states they also  completed the vancouver index of acculturation   and then of course we collected information  on symptoms of depression in addition to   these psychological factors we also collected  information um on trauma um the the parents   the mothers answered questionnaires related to  trauma um experiences of trauma throughout their   lifetime and also experiences of trauma  related that the children um experienced   experienced but these were reported by the mothers  because the children were ages three to five   the conceptual model that we decided to use to  guide this study was um adapted from braun from   brenner's ecological model and we thought that  this model was the best for this study because   it took it took into account not only the basic  biological underpinnings or the genetic components   but it also looked at the environmental factors  that can affect disease outcomes so here we're   looking at genotype allele frequency epigenetics  dna methylation as an interactive effect and then   also looking at these environmental factors and  stressors and how people deal with these stressors   and the interaction between the the biology  and the environment and how this affects   health outcomes and in this case blood  pressure in both the mothers and the children to find out more about how we utilize the  conceptual model and what we did in terms   of the methods for this study we thought it was  important to publish two methods papers one was   just focusing on the design and methods for  recruitment and psychological measures that we   chose to include in the study and you can find  more on the conceptual model in that article   that we published in nursing research and  then we published another methods paper   that describes the laboratory methods and the   dna analysis methods that we used in  this study for the for the dna component so in terms of study enrollment and  retention we were successful in enrolling   all 500 targeted participants in the  study we had about 79 retention rate   by the second interview 75 percent retention  rate at the third interview and 72 percent   retention rate at the fourth interview which  we completed right before the covet outbreak some generals demographics for the mothers   in the study the average age of the mothers  was about 31 years of age the average blood   pressures were in the normal range but as you can  see here the average bmi was in the obese category   and we had um 22 of the participants  that reported they were current smokers   which was something that we had not expected in  this younger cohort of african-american women   we had about 20 that reported that they had  been diagnosed with hypertension previously   and then when we look at the level of education  you can see here that most of our participants   had at least a high school diploma or some  college in terms of level of education   study demographics for the children in  the study the children the average age   was three 3.7 years of age blood pressure  readings were in the normal range for this   for this group 46 were the youngest child in  their household we only had seven children   that were born outside of the united  states and we had 146 girls and 104 boys just a general overview of our analysis plan  of which you can i won't go into this in   detail because you can refer to our methods  paper for for more information on how we   um analyze the data in in terms of the complex  dna analysis but we use everything from you know   basic regression models to multivariate  regression models linear mixed modeling   we did multivariate mix modeling for  different interactions in this case it   could be snip a little dosage or it could  be cpg site um and then we corrected for   antihypertensive medication use among those  that were diagnosed with hypertension and   taking antihypertensives and then we also  took into account ancestry informative markers we had um in terms of some of the social  environmental factors i'd like to bring up some   of the articles that we've currently had accepted  one has been accepted to archives in psychiatric   nursing where we found an association  between social determinants of health   perceived discrimination and bmi on symptoms  of depression among african-american mothers   in the intergen study and that will be  forthcoming in archives and psychiatric nursing   we also have a paper coming out in health equity  health equity which again is very timely with all   the protests that we see here in the united states  which focuses on the influence of discrimination   and coping style on blood pressure among  african american women in the intergen study we have also published um articles on where we  found that there was a significant association   with perceived racial discrimination and dna  methylation among african american women in   in the insurgent study particularly with major  life discrimination um based on using the   information from um our intelligence study in the  850 k epic array um and this study was published   in i can't see i think it was medicine we also  found a positive association between stress and   coping with the dna methylation of blood pressure  related genes among african american women   in this study we published in chronic stress and  this was on just looking at blood pressure related   genes not blood pressure as an outcome but blood  pressure related genes among african americans we also found that there was a significant  association between parenting stress   and dna methylation among african americans in the  intergen study and we published these findings in   the journal of clinical and translational science  this study was particularly interesting because   we found that parenting stress led to changes in  dna methylation on the part 1 gene which is part   of the stress pathway so giving giving us further  insight into the biological mechanisms regulating   health outcomes in this population we also utilized the information from the intergen  study where we looked at obesity because as   you can see in our cohort the um on average  the participants were in the obese category   that there was a significant association with  obesity and dna methylation age acceleration in   this cohort of young mothers so we found that as  um adiposity increased that there were there was   an increase in dna methylation age acceleration  um we're also interested in looking at   we used the horvath method of data analysis to  conduct the analyses for this particular study   and now there's been a release  in horvath has a pediatric   method of analyzing data for pediatric populations  and looking at dna methylation age acceleration   so we're very interested in conducting  the analysis in the children in the study   as well so that will be another article that  will be forthcoming from the intergen study   and lastly um we also found we were able  to discover in the entrogen study novel   dna methylation sites that were associated  with cigarette smoking in african americans   and so what we did in this study and this was  conducted by one of our postdocs at the time   but as i mentioned dr barcelona who is currently  funded with the k award from ninr now um conduct   she's assistant professor at yale she found that  um using the introgen study that there were six   cpg sites that were significant with with  cigarette smoking among african americans and all   on genes associated with cancer development so  what we did here is that we actually replicated   the findings in a large epidemiological  study of genetics and hypertension using the   genetic epidemiology network of arteriopathy  the genoa dataset and were able to replicate   the findings in that data set with the findings  original findings from in the entrogen study   so this is something that you know  we've been very collaborative with other   large epidemiological studies we've been  open to others using our data set to for   replication sampling and also you know working  with other uh groups and investigators to   analyze the data to look at cardiovascular  health outcomes in the intergen data set in addition to the work that we've done looking  at social determinants and social factors that   influence dna methylation on health outcomes  in african americans in the introgen study   we were also very fortunate to re  receive additional funding through   the p case award the presidential early  career award for scientists and engineers   this award provides an additional year of  funding um that's added on to the r01 so   what this provides is that you want to expand  the aims of the parent study but stay within the   the concept of the work that you are doing so what  what we decided to do um with the p case award was   to utilize an additional method of analysis to um  to utilize whole genome sequencing as a screening   tool for cardiovascular diseases among african  americans in the community so what we did is   left oh okay i will i will hurry up we selected  participants from our androgen study and utilized   this method to look at to utilize whole genome  sequencing now why use whole genome sequencing   we wanted to look at certain disorders that  african americans and people of african ancestry   are not typically tested for but have health  disparities in so one example that we use is   sequencing for familial hypercholesterolemia and  this is because we know the outcome of uh familial   hypercholesterolemia is sudden cardiac death those  that are typically tested are of european ancestry   however african americans have one of  the highest incidence and prevalence of   sudden cardiac death so in this paper we talk  about how sequencing can prevent that they can   be tested and treated with lipid lowering drugs  like lipitor and not have this devastating outcome   also my research team and i also provided this  paper that we published in nursing research   we talked about genome sequencing technologies  and how nurses can be influential and important   at every aspect so anywhere from intake of  the patient identifying symptoms conducting   the testing doing the lab work reviewing the  results and doing the conducting the counseling   that goes along with return of results so in  this paper you'll see that you know i talk   about how nurse scientists are important in  every step of the way and it's just a point   of deciding which component that we feel is um  something that we would like to contribute to   so what is the impact of this work  that we've conducted in the next steps   so the impact has been that we've published  more than 25 articles in nursing medicine   transdisciplinary journals on the combined  effects of genetic epigenetic and environmental   factors on blood pressure we hope that some of  the work that we've done has shed some light   on these epigenetic and environmental factors  that affect health outcomes in black populations   however there's still a lot more work to be done  and a lot more factors that we need to consider   so one of the things that i would love to do  would be to repeat the dna methylation over time   based on the funding that we had we had you know  funding constraints so we could only do the dna   methylation analysis at one point in time but in  the future i would like to repeat the methylation   so that we can truly look at change over time and  lastly ways to improve health outcomes i think   that we definitely need to move from the discovery  phase to the intervention and implementation stage   and focus on some of these root causes like stress  or discrimination and how these factors can be   identified early on and how we can intervene prior  to these health disparities that we see now so i   just want to say you know many thanks to ninr for  supporting this work and you know a huge thank you   to all the families that participated in our study  um i always want to thank the co-investigators   trainees students and volunteers that participated  in the intergen study it was truly a team effort   and if you want to learn more information about  the intergen study or collaborate with us in   any way you can find us on our facebook  page or you can go to my columbia faculty   webpage and i can direct you there but thank you  for your time and attention and um i appreciate   you um watching this uh webinar oh thanks so  much for for sharing the tremendous product   productivity from um across your science dr taylor  um i'm sorry we we don't have time for questions   but if you are in the if you have access to the  chat box you can see the link to dr taylor's   publications and if you're one of the over 2  almost 300 people watching on the video cast   you also cannot get access to dr  taylor's articles through pubmed.gov   and i believe if you type in taylor spat space  jy she is the only investigator in that regard   and uh um with a prolific number of uh um uh  articles and given the pre-print you mentioned and   nih's effort to advance pre-prints to um people  uh um you may those may emerge in pubmed as well   um to keep on track though it's time  for me to introduce dr shandin sen   uh um from indiana university where he is a  distinguished professor and the jay stanley   battersby endowed chair of surgery in addition  he's the founding executive director for indiana   university's health comprehensive wound center  home to the nih national diabetes foot consortium   dr sen also is the editor of the  top-ranked journal in wound care   advances in wound care he has an h index  of 96. uh um please won't you begin   dr sen thank you nathan would you please  pass the ball to me so i can share my screen yes you have it yes i just saw that and please  let me know if you are able to see my screen yet yes we can okay so uh good afternoon  and uh thank you very much for this   wonderful opportunity to be part of this right  thank you lois thank you ninr and the team   organizers it's a wonderful learning so much today   yes we see the uh notes version can you click  the display and switch it like we talked about   okay click there and then switch swap there you go  thank you thank you are you is the audio all right all right i'll assume you're good thank  you so this is a wonderful opportunity   thank you to the organizers and we heard uh  you know three elegant talks this morning   and two of which addressed the matter of uh wound  healing and experimental wounds have so much   to offer with respect to learning  and then there is the real life   chronic wound not the experimental wound  which itself is quite a stressor and   once that wound does not go away for a while and  we have seen wounds that are many years old and   one faces the prospect of an amputation that is  an added burden or stress if you will so it's   makes for a very interesting and unique uh sort of  experimental setting um compared to uh our own uh   you know experimental studies so i would like to  approach this wound healing from the standpoint of   the wound care provider and you know we have just  found it this year our group moved from ohio state   about one and a half years ago and  established the comprehensive wound sector   the first in the state of indiana and here our  primary goal is to make sure that we provide   such care that would bring down wound chronicity  and would bring down the the incidence of   amputation with that i would like to share with  you a little bit about the hoosier state a very   unique experimental setting i think with respect  to health outcomes you have this 28 miles apart   life expectancy changing from 83.7 years to 69.4  years and this is also known as the monon trail   and we have a large initiative of the university  a grand challenge in the initiative called the phi   personalized health initiative of which we are a  part that is gathering data from this monon trail   in multiple ways and the way we have plugged in  our wound center is uh we leverage this ongoing uh   you know learning that is happening along the  monon trail and then put those data side by   side with wound uh outcomes and try to see if  we can make a broader sense as is the scope of   the current meeting now this particular wound  center uh is located right at the heart it's in   the marion county that's the city of indianapolis  and that's all the zip codes that are the worst   outcomes are just around us so we have in our own  center are sort of tilted to the negative side the   outcomes and therefore the opportunity is even  greater to fix it as you see the amputation rate   per 10 000 drops precipitously from one part of  the state to the other and that zip code to the   other and that makes for a very interesting uh  setup for studying outcomes now before getting   into uh discussions on chronic wound healing i'd  like to share with you some general uh notion   about the healing trajectory so we all get wounds  at some point of our life and we quickly heal   and those are acute wounds and sometimes when we  get wounds they don't tend to heal so quickly so   we go and intervene one way or the other and  then they quickly heal and that is also an   acute wound with some help it could be healed and  this is also what you see in the experimental side   of wound healing and the sense of data that you  get from that side is quite different from this   side which the wound is now there four five six  eight ten years and in many cases that would   lead to amputation in other cases amputation is  not warranted but the person is actually with   the wound for many many years so as you cross  the 30-day mark of the wound remaining open it   essentially uh is in the direction of chronic  wounds but if you look at the average age of   the wound that presents at the comprehensive  wound center by the time they come there by   the time their primary physician or the other care  providing physician feels it is important to now   send them to a specialized care in a several year  old wound already so most of our wounds that are   in first presentation are several years old and  now when we start intervening uh uh you know uh   the main considerations today the standard of care  mostly focuses on the local factors so debridement   dressing so on and so forth so there's not too  many practical wound care centers that i know of   that actually provides something that  addresses both systemic as well as local when   i say systemic i mean including psychosocial  factors so that would be obviously the ideal   setting but today the way it is practiced is local  factors our barriers are taken care of and then   some won't end up closing but some whom  shrink but still stay open for a long time   and the wounds that do close the bright green  line that you see many of them end up reopening   and that's the problem of wound recurrence and  this is a nagging problem so here the story is   that if we were to understand the systemic and  the local factors that are responsible for the   chronicity of the wound then potentially we could  our intervention would look different from how it   is today and we would be achieving a much better  outcome and hopefully that would have a direct   impact on bringing down the accounts of amputation  that we have in our country now speaking of   healing trajectory there are actual equations  already published in the literature so if you   look at the numbers if you take the best healer  from this cohort of 111 patients in our center   you would see it ranges from 0.1 to 1.9 so you  have a wide window to intervene so following the   healing trajectory we believe is very important  approach now in this particular case 84 chronic   wound patients were selected and their blood  samples were you know sent for snip detection and   what we were able to see in these 84 all of whom  had chronic wounds that some uh there are several   snips that were detected which very closely  and tightly associated with wound chronicity   very interestingly when we start looking one by  one these mutations we can quickly connect them to   literature saying that those particular genes when  non-functional does provide uh impaired healing of   course for some there is literature for others we  are validating uh in other words there are several   such snaps that can be identified so  we view them as one of several systemic   factors so steps looks like uh you know quite  promising and should be further developed   now if we take all those snips that we just saw  and we get into the process of gene enrichment   for significantly associated slip when i say  significantly associated i mean significantly   associated with moon chronicity one would find  these uh allele c's the cc that you see in blue   elliptical uh circle enclosed the one in red  that is the allele a and if you now uh take them   through a pathway construction what you would see  are these what you have to the left of the screen   that these genes seem to be the primary player  and the ones that are encircled with brown line   uh are primarily associated with the obese  patient and and the others are with all so in   particular with though these are the ones that  are encircled in drama now many years ago when   i was a junior faculty at ohio state i happened  to meet this wonderful man ron glazer who then   had a center grant and we just heard from  john keycol glaser this morning and ron was   had a center an eyes funded center on stress and  wound healing and was dispensing some type of a   pilot ground system and and and we had submitted  an application to that system uh and competitively   we won that and ever since more than the  money the import important part was we had   access to this wonderful team of the uh jan  ron bill malarkey john sheridan phil maruka   and that taught us a lot about the psychosocial  aspects of wound religious a wonderful exposure   now not to belabor something that was  published 15 years ago but the overall   finding there was in these myeloid cells that  we were studying using that beautiful blister   approach that jan uh described a few uh hours  ago uh we were able to note that there's an   overall suppressive gene-suppressive effect uh in  in these myeloid cells now fast forward 15 years   now when we take uh chronic wound edge  tissue and run single cell sequencing   and you see here to your left the disney plot  and in that disney plot now if we do our liz   identification you will see that uh there  is this island that is in the bright red and   black and yellow that is the myeloid cell  population now if we take that myeloid cell   population and further explode that we would see  what you see here as wound and severe wounds if it   won't means the wound we could not fix and ended  up an amputation wound is also a chronic wound   that then actually responded to care and could  be improved now in there we see a very clear   difference in the transcriptome profile  as we see after the single set approach   but very importantly if we go back to  the genes of the identified in 2005 uh   in that exam stress model that we were studying  with jan braun and the team the same genes are   moving in the same direction in the same myeloid  cells after all these years and and interestingly   there's this connection so the study that model  that they have in studying uh these psychosocial   in a barriers of wound healing actually hold  up in actually clinically presented wounds   so that's a very interesting insight which we are  currently working on if one further explodes that   line one would see a whole series of genes and  with this uh we are currently doing pathway   analysis i would not have the time to today uh  describe all of that but i just thought of uh   disclosing the line of pursuit that we're  currently engaged in now if we so for a while   we were focusing only on the myeloid cells  which is number three cluster number three   in this disney plot that you see but this is the  entire spread of all 12 populations that we see   when we take the woundage and we run a single  cell sequencing on it and of these we also have   candidates from different populations of cells  about myeloid cells clearly and myeloid cells   keratinocytes uh these are uh some of the key and  endothelial cells and to some extent fibroblasts   are some of the leaders where you see vast amount  of changes as it relates to severity of wound and   chronicity of actually clinically presented wound  so that was a snip i discussed earlier that was   more of a systemic factor and now we are moving  on to a more local factor so here we are taking   the wounded tissue from the wound and then  running an epigenomic analysis so the slide   here is about human skin and in the human skin  there is a dynamic balance as you would expect   of methylation and demethylation which can be  traced by uh in some ways by methylcytosine   and hydroxymethylcytosine staining and as you  see here but this balance is clearly disrupted   because in the moon you have a highly acidic  environment you have a lot of bacterial product   it is chemically very loud it is one of the  most loud chemically allowed micro environment   you can think of in the body anywhere else within  the body we would have been dead because of sepsis   or some other severe outcome but in the moon  the body can compartmentalize and have this very   loud environment and and so you start seeing some  very interesting epigenetic pattern in the wounds   in this case what we show is you take a chronic  wound you do a sharp debridement or a biopsy and   then you run a methyl cap seek and then once you  take the data as you would see from the blocked on   the top left panel you will see that the chronic  wound edge is a pretty dark showing the overall   five methyl cycles in abundance is very high  as you also see with the bar graph but when you   go to the heat map it's very clear that in these  cases overall methylation dominates so the chronic   wound age tissue is clearly hypermethylated now  if you can go through all of this data and sort of   get the gist of it at least one uh facet of  that gist is the fact what steve just mentioned   during this talk we see that emt so pathways  regulating emt is clearly affected and these   pathways essentially are extremely important  as steve pointed out a short while ago in the   healing process and we recently also published the  importance of emt i also saw zeb one as a player   in steve's slide and we also had a very similar  observation where we show that not only is emt   required to close the wound but also to perfuse  the wound and importantly that these factors are   glycemic status dependent and so that's a very  in its recent work published by dr singh from our   group and we are further pursuing this now coming  to some example of a epigenetic modification we   did some bisulfite sequencing and were able to  identify you a few candidates which i would not   have the time to talk but i will talk about a uh  in a candidate in this case that is p53 so what   you would see is that p53 is hypermethylated the  promoter is hypermethylated and because of which   as you see a lot of brown to the left of your  screen in the human skin now that brown is lost in   the wound edge showing a depletion of p53 or down  regulation or p53 in the chronic wounded tissue   if you take the same p53 and just go into a more  sort of reductionist system take keratinocyte   cultures human keratinocytes and culture  and look at the migration and and you try to   hypermethylate the ketnosides using in this case  sam or s adenosine methionine with our donor   one can quickly arrest the speed of uh migration  of this kepner site now the speed of migration   is a very important factor in the  re-epithelialization of the wound   and and if you go to a animal mode model and have  what is known as a flap model for wound ischemia   so in this case you make a wound but that wound  does not close for a very long time as you see at   the bottom of the bottom right of the screen  the red line shows how it stays steady over   several days but if you just go in and put  a dnmt or dna methyl transfer is inhibitor   5 as a cytodine then you can quickly change the  course of healing now granted this is a very   crude approach to begin with because it would  do this for pretty much uh all types of genes   the dna methylation would be changing so we are  currently doing a crispr castline way of gene   editing very specific pathways we are editing the  methylation status and we are able to uh you know   see how it changes the outcome and once we have  that knowledge that would give us a very pointed   direction as to what it takes to change the course  of healing in the wound side with that in the   interest of time i would like to wrap up and thank  all our team members that contribute to this and   all our sponsors that have been patiently  funding us for many years thank you thank   you dr sen uh um first let's turn to our panel of  experts to see if they have any questions for you hello can you hear me yes teresa so it was  a great talk a lot of information there   have you looked uh we had talked a little bit with  dr cole about the time course of these things so   so you're showing that there's a lot of  this hypermethylation in the chronic wounds   um by any chance have you looked  backwards to see when this happens   how long does it take in a wound to get  the this pattern of hypermethylation   so first of all the degree of hypermethylation  you see you know the question you're asking can   only be studied in the experimental wound system  because like i said pretty much everybody we get   at the chronic at the comprehensive wound center  already has the old wound and that's very loud   with respect to hypermethylation now between  subjects there are changes very clearly but but   uh if you now move over to the model that dr cole  was talking about you know the acute one model or   we also have been studying that there you would  need to infect which we have done and over a time   of infection and ischemia you can see in a matter  of weeks this will rise over time and and there   you can trace it but it is almost impossible  in a chronic wound to back calculate it when it   originated because by the time the patient appears  in the clinic it's already pretty hypermethylated thanks thank you both so much uh um if if you  have questions for dr sen or dr taylor uh um   please hold them or feel free to put them into  the chat box where they will get first priority   when we have our moderated discussion  uh um first though it's time for me to   introduce dr mary frances o'connor who received  her undergraduate degree from northwestern   and her doctoral in clinical psychology from  the university of arizona in 2004. she did her   postdoctoral fellowship at the cousins center for  psychoneuroimmunology at ucla and followed that   with a k award from nia where she was assistant  professor in residence at ucla and then moved to   the university of arizona psychology department  where she currently is associate professor and   director of clinical training and directs the  glass lab for grief loss and social stress um   it's been a tremendous pleasure and honor  learning uh um from her as we prepared for this   um presentation uh she received her  75th anniversary award from the american   society in addition to her nih funding uh  she received support from the dana foundation   and the retirement research foundation  uh um please mary francis once you begin to make this technically possible under uh such  constrained circumstances as we find ourselves   so i just want to start by saying that the work  that we do that that ninr is really highlighting   today is so vital and that's because it  demonstrates that the expression of genes   and even the plasticity of genes is  related to environmental and social factors   what's important for us to remember i think as  scientists is that research shows the general   public associates genetic contributions  to individual differences as essentialist   and so our work is stands in contrast to that   but what it means is that we need to communicate  to the public what social genomics research is and   some geneticists and science writers have even  begun to do this through blog posts so that each   time an article comes out there's an associated  blog post that explains to the general public   what those findings might mean and  importantly what they might not mean   so i think that opportunities like today give  us a chance to really think about how our work   is taken in a broader context as well as really  drilling down into the details which i'll do now   so in my own work i've studied the social stress  of bereavement and bereavement is a unique   social stress because it requires an attachment  relationship for it to occur so this is not an   affiliation relationship where you might see other  social stressors like social evaluative threat   or racial discrimination but this is an  attachment relationship type of social stress   the reason i got interested in bereavement  as a population is because it's linked to the   widowhood effect sometimes called the broken heart  phenomena which is that spouses surviving spouses   are nearly twice as likely to die following the  death of their of their spouse in in the immediate   after effects of um spousal loss and i thought  wow if there's ever a phenomenon that links   something psychological to some medical outcome  then certainly mortality seems to be a good   choice so this has been uh my area of interest in  addition to that although the majority of bereaved   people are very resilient grief disorders or  depression may arise following bereavement   and so we know that it isn't necessarily the  bereavement event but rather the psychological   stress in response to that bereavement event that  may be having an impact on individuals health and so i'd like to talk about a paper that a study  that we did a few years ago back when i was still   at ucla and this paper looked at bereavement  modulating immune function gene expression so   this was a rather small study this was 63 people  and these were older adults an average age in   their mid-70s and it had been just short of about  two years since the death uh for two-thirds of the   of the sample who uh were bereaved and then  there was a remaining third of the sample who   were married control subjects in addition to that  of the bereaved individuals half of them had what   we call complicated grief now this is an umbrella  term for prolonged severe grief and we now find   criteria for these grief disorders in dsm-5  or icd-11 so one set of of the bereaved group   had complicated grief and the other set of the  bereaved group had non-complicated grief what   you might think of as a resilient response to  this bereavement stress what's notable and that   you'll see in the figure there is that people  with complicated grief and non-complicated grief   differed markedly in their expression particularly  of type one interferon related transcripts so this   is related to what dr cole was explaining  earlier this conserved transcription   response to adversity where although these genes  are being affected across bereavement it's in the   complicated grief group that we find the down  regulation of these interferon-related genes   so uh yeah so in the gray bars you can see that  compared to married controls we actually saw up   regulation in the non-complicated grief widows and  widowers but in the complicated grief groups uh uh   with those genes uh on the x-axis there  we shot we saw substantial down regulation   so if we look at that in a more umbrella fashion  what we see is that bereavement related distress   is linked to differential transcription  transcription factor activation and gene   expression particularly in innate antiviral  responses right so we see a strong response there   in crab in gata1 and irf1 although we're not  actually seeing a statistically significant   response in nf kappa b now as i mentioned this  was a limited sample this uh certainly bears   replication in a much larger sample and you can  see the pretty wide error bars in nf kappa b there   and that may be because the differences between  groups were so small that we weren't detecting   statistically a difference in that  particular transcription factor   now this has clinical implications for bereavement  so decreased expression of antiviral response   genes among individuals with complicated grief  may be linked specifically to their resistance   to infectious disease so what we know from other  research is that older wind older widows have   significantly lower influenza vaccine responses  compared to non-bereaved controls and this mirrors   some of what dr kiko glaser was saying earlier  where we saw caregivers had a lower vaccine   response and in this instance we have widows  and widowers showing a lower vaccine response   similarly from some of the large epidemiological  studies that that appear in that figure on   on the right odds of dying of infection sepsis  influenza or pneumonia are increased for widows   and widowers so that's the the top two lines of  that uh looking at the hazard ratios increased   in widows and widowers for those categories  of illness now certainly it's not the only   categories of illness that are increased in widows  and widowers but i think this unique response   to bereavement that has a level of distress  warranting a diagnosis of complicated grief um   is then showing up in our morbidity and mortality  indices uh when we look at epidemiological samples   now usually we ask the question how to stress  from the mind you know understanding some   stressful situation how does that get under the  skin or into our genes but i'd like just for a   moment to flip that question and ask how does gene  expression could gene expression get into the mind   and cause us stress so in the next part of the  talk i'm gonna focus on some plausible hypotheses   for future directions but i don't want you to  um to think that you're gonna get to see a lot   of human data uh in this portion of the talk so  making sort of that bright line distinction like   dr cole said was talking about uh toward the end  of his own talk so neuroepigenetics from social   experience to behavior change neuroepigenetics  is an exciting new area that i think it's useful   for social genomics researchers to understand a  little bit about so the field of neuroepigenetics   investigates how the brain encodes information  things that it experiences in its environment   to form long lasting memories literally how does  the brain encode a memory that will lead then to   stable changes in behavior so let me give you some  examples social experiences like pair bonding and   also trauma memories are known to have epigenetic  effects in the brain and in brain regions that is   to say activity dependent molecular mechanisms  like histone modification or dna methylation   dynamically regulate the gene expression that  are required that is required to create a memory   so let's take the example of pair bonding let's take the example of prairie voles  where this has been studied quite extensively   um prairie voles demonstrate a lifelong pair bond  and the initial meeting that first uh that first   date where uh prairie voles are have the initial  mating it induces this uh specific acetylation in   oxytocin region promoter in the nucleus accumbens  specifically of the brain now i just will say the   nucleus incumbents is a portion of the ventral  striatum that dr cole referred to earlier   now this acetylation enhances  transcription resulting in higher oxytocin   receptor mrna and protein expression and  it facilitates partner preference formation   so because we're able to do experimental studies  in voles what we know is that experimentally   blocking this epigenetic change at this specific  loci prevents the pair bond from occurring   even when that initial mating  that initial first date happens   on the converse if you are able to induce the  epigenetic change even without mating you see   pair bonding occurring a stable behavioral change  that then occurs throughout the life of the vole   now these are voles uh human beings have an  extra two pounds of brain so it's a little more   complicated in humans i will give you however  this suggests that epigenetic modifications   shape neural systems that modulate bonding  behavior and there is no reason to think that   some aspect of this is not necessarily conserved  in human beings once the pair wand is formed as   i said it uh the vole shows uh this change in  behavior across the lifespan showing partner   preference over preference to spend time with any  other role or what we might think of as monogamy   in human beings we also often call this attachment  so we assume there's a mental representation of   this attachment figure your spouse your mate  uh happening after you have bonded with this   with this other person with attachment comes a  particular attachment belief so a key feature   of attachment is a perseverative belief  in the existence of the attachment figure   even when they're not present we  see this in developmental psychology   as infants are able to learn that mom still  exists even when i can't see her or hear her   and that stable representation enables us to stay  put say for example while mom goes out and forages   believing that mom will come back and feed me and  i shouldn't actually leave home in the meantime now bereavement on the other hand  is this low probability experience   of an attachment figure dying now that sounds  like a strange way to describe bereavement but   if you think about the idea that your mate leaves  home every day they go off to work and every day   they come back and walk back into the house and  you begin to expect that that's going to happen   bereavement on the other hand occurs really  only once preferably never in one's lifetime but   really only once and so it's a low probability  experience that the brain has to understand   this actually creates conflicting information for  the bereaved person which creates a great deal of   stress so let me explain that a little bit i like  to call this the gone but not forgotten hypothesis   so one source of information in the  brain says that the person is alive   this is encoded in these epigenetic modifications  of neurons on the other hand another source of   information says that they're deceased we have  an episodic memory of the death of this loved one   the mismatch of these two sources of  information causes grief confusion and stress   you hear this sometimes when widows  or widowers will say you know i know   that they're gone but i just can't help but  feeling they're gonna walk back in the door   they're just on a long trip or joan didion talked  about the magical thinking of not being able to   um get rid of her husband's clothing  because he might need it again   while simultaneously recognizing  that her husband was gone so the bereavement stress can be found  in cardiovascular endocrine and immune   responses to grief and results in this greater  morbidity and mortality i was referring to   earlier there's quite a large systematic body of  research now investigating this phenomena so some   questions then in my mind remain the epigenetic  bond this sort of biological fingerprint   is that change permanent after pair bonding or  does it eventually revert after the death of a   pair bonded mate what we know from voles is that  80 percent of female voles will never show a pair   bond again even if they will mate with other  voles and and have litters they never show   partner preference uh for the nouveau in the way  that they did for the initial role additionally   at the level of human beings i asked myself what  clinical interventions might help to reconcile   the two sources of information reducing the stress  of the paradox of believing on some level that the   person is still alive and simultaneously having a  memory for the fact that they are in fact deceased   our clinical interventions for complicated grief  have come a long way and we are able now to   uh in the majority of cases treat complicated  grief and lead to a reduction in distress so   my curiosity has uh has me looking uh for  studies that might look at the the change   that happens with psychological intervention to  see if some of those uh sorry some of those um   gene transcription changes might uh be be reverted  under a psychological uh treatment so to summarize   complicated grief in one study was associated  with ctra changes in genetic expression while   non-complicated grief was not relationships seem  to create a biological fingerprint in the brain   at least in animals and when the partner dies the  brain misses them but in a real biological sense   now grieving may occur until we adapt biologically   as well as psychologically to the new world  where the partner doesn't exist any longer the stress of the bereavement then  consequently may affect morbidity and mortality   this this portion can be seen  in epidemiological studies   in human beings the gone but not forgotten  hypothesis is is well founded but it remains   an empirical question lacking human data now  looking at the epigenetics in specific bit   human brain region sounds impossible but  it's actually not and we have some good   translational studies between animal and human  neuroscience planned all right a wide ranging   talk i'd really like to acknowledge the national  institute of aging who funded some of this work   some of the other funders for my work and my  many collaborators including my animal research   uh collaborators uh zoe donaldson and oliver bosch  thank you very much thank you mary frances let's   start with our panelists to see if they have any  questions for you and how your work may relate to theirs i can also just say that we believe that trauma  memories have a similar neuroepigenetic foundation   and so some of you who may be interested  in other types of stressful life events   may find that literature interesting as well   i'm curious when you speak about the the  translational pipeline how do you think we need   more translational from the model animal  research into humans or more on the uh um   basic bioneuroscience in humans and into  more intervention and applied research   it's an excellent question and of course  i'm all for funding all sorts of research having said that some uh the animal researchers  who are specifically looking at neurobiology   of grief and and myself and some  other fmri researchers have really   been trying to put our heads together to make  the most out of this area and what we find is   that you know in animal research and human  research even with grief uh we tend to focus   on very different things so for example it'd be  very helpful to know if immune cell transcription   i'm sorry if immune cell epigenetic changes are  in any way mirroring brain region um uh epigenetic   changes because we can get to immune cells fairly  easily in human beings and not so easily to brain   tissue although again as i say not impossible and  so because animal researchers neuroscience animal   researchers were not particularly interested in  the immune system they didn't necessarily think   of that as an important question however now  seeing the translational reason for doing that   they're able to say well sure we also have  blood we can look at the immune cells as well   so i do think that these com conversations  across disciplines are really important to   not just doing research but advancing  research in a direction that's helpful oh i think you might be muted bill maybe  just for me thanks so much uh um i i'm   curious whether there is a a link to dr sen's  work and the sense of grief uh um people   with severe i can't remember the terms you use  for like the severe wound the loss of a limb and   and function you're not losing a a a spouse but  you are losing a tremendous part of your body   and i wonder if there's an intersection  there either one of you might want to start   i do actually think there's an intersection there  so while i think that we evolved uh in our grief   mechanisms and our biological grief mechanisms  to handle this bizarre bereavement event that   happens because it's so important because  attachment relationships are so important   i think that that neurobiology can  get harnessed for any aspect of loss   that prevents us from functioning in the  world the way that we either anticipate or   need to function in the world and certainly  amputation is one of those so that type of   grief stress i'd be very curious to see uh what  what his experience is of of amputees psychology chen dan can you speak to that i'm sorry to  put you on the spot oh no i'm good can you   hear me yes sir no i i fully agree i think that  there could be there is certainly an interaction   in the intersection there the question will be  to find out uh you know because much more have   been studied with respect to grieving for the  loss of her in a loved one but this is a very   different angle not much work on it but i would  uh speculate that there would be uh overlap and   certainly i suspect you find that some are more  resilient in handling that stress than others   absolutely that is true and that also has to  do with their care and support providing system   around them as to how it is that is handled  so that could be in itself a subject of study sounds like we're putting a new  investigative team together uh um uh uh um thank you for those thoughtful  comments does anyone else want to weigh in if not i'd i'd like to go back to uh  um dr jackie taylor's talk for a minute   is just i i and i i may have missed it but i  know that many of the african-american mothers   um in in your study had uh um multiple children  and i'm i'm wondering if there were differences   by family size in in some of those results jackie before you even send it to you while i'm waiting for jackie to connect i bring  that up because we're um in in all three of these   questions we are talking about uh um the these you  know biological neurological uh uh um expressions   going on in individual human beings but in  a larger social context whether it's spousal   or or or children what kind of caretakers you  have with the wound or in in your uh talk most   recently mayor francis talking about the the  uh um immune responses to influenza vaccine   among among widows uh um and so i wonder about  the the number and or type of relationships among   all of these different people and the  the the responses that we'd have going   well and i think what's interesting about that is  that is the point that dr cole made which is that   uh you know the perception of loneliness can occur  in all of those scenarios regardless of the number   of people that exist in all of those scenarios  and so i do sometimes think it is the perception   that is most critical which we only access by  asking you know self-reported type questions jackie please unmute yourself  um if you can hear me i guess i might ask a question if that's all right  of dr sen um i'm curious you also are looking at   these connections between animal research and  human research and do you find there's anything   that helps to advance animal research in such a  way that it's actually useful in in human research   you know do you find that same tension in the work  i absolutely do and i think you know we study many   different species in our program and in brief  of course the rodents and then we have studied   uh the dogs we have studied the pain from immune  you know a big part especially in the context of   wound healing is the immune system as we have  heard all across uh the talks this this morning   and afternoon and it seems that the pig skin and  immunology is very much uh you know in parallel   with and also in the pig you have the skin  that does not rapidly contract so so we are   finding that the pore science system is giving us  very interesting clues that then we can you know   validate sort of in humans and we can go back  and forth between the two not so much with mice   but if you exactly know which gene that pathway  i think the mouse is a good model to study but   if you're trying to find new pathways mouse may  not be the best place but to dig into the biology   mechanisms that mouse could be uh  useful so that's out of the range does that answer your question thank you okay mary frances this is elizabeth can i ask  a question yeah thanks it was very very um   fascinating your top very interesting and it's  kind of this kind of a quirky thought but do you   think this could be almost like phantom limb um  feelings that if something has been if there's   been a stimulation of something for a long time  and then it goes away the brain tries to fill that   in has that everyone discussed in this uh i'm very  fond of quirky ideas you might you might imagine   so i i think i actually have thought about this  a great deal and here's the reason that i think   that our brain is not always so individualistic  as as we suggest so that we actually begin to   map two human beings as one in many ways so you  can think of this as sort of you know the classic   is i can't remember who bought that sofa it's just  our sofa you know but you also see in older adults   that they will fill in for each other when they're  trying to remember something so though the memory   is distributed across the two individuals so they  won't remember which one of them said it or which   one of them came up with something but between  the two of them they can put it all together   and i think this has quite a physical  aspect as well so in neuroimaging   research we see ways in which the social  distance is mapped uh neurobiologically   and i the other example uh that i like to think  of is you know when you learn to drive a car   initially you sort of put the car in the wrong  part of the lane because you're mapping yourself   in the middle of the lane right but then not very  long later you begin to put the car in the middle   of the of the lane and it's as though you've  expanded your own physical parameter to the   car and now that feels quite normal and natural to  center that in the lane i actually believe that as   time progresses and we get better understanding  of neurobiology um that we will see that when   um an attachment figure dies that the mapping  of that um changes in the brain so that we that   that response that people have part of myself is  missing which is so universally said uh i think   actually probably has a neural basis and and it is  not too dissimilar potentially from phantom limb   experience where there's not been a remapping yet  right a bereavement event happens and you know   probabilistically after a thousand days of waking  up next to someone the next day if you don't wake   up to them it's not the obvious conclusion that  they're gone right and so i think the brain takes   quite some time to catch up with the new reality  and i think i i don't know what dr sen would say   but i think there's a piece of that learning  that has to happen with the amputation as well   i think i think an amputation sometimes and  obviously the experiences perhaps i'm just   guessing here are a bit more severe because all  the time you're watching and that leg used to   be there and normally when you live with somebody  they go away they come back and that's the reason   that person was talking about their  clothing not to use the clothing   thinking that they may come back although she  knows that he's dead in the case of a limb every   moment you see that and there is an important  angle to that which is when you have a child   now looking at a mom that does not have a limb  the child's stress becomes the amount of stress   as well so there is a circuit here a loop here  if you will it's not just your own stress but   the way people feel about you and when they look  at you they can almost cannot celebrate or enjoy   without barriers because as if not  having their limb becomes a barrier   so so it is a little bit more complicated topic  here and is worth studying as a subject on itself wow that's a really good point and i i  hope i'm not overstretching my bounds   lois please stop me but uh um that makes me think  about about the the caregiving portfolio as well   as self-care and would seem that in those those  cases when we are i know an inr has uh i believe   has a forward two out on on avoiding caregiver  burnout and and so it would seem to me that with   with like a redwood patients who who have this  serious wound or are missing a limb uh um we you   this may be a given already so i  apologize uh uh um but one not only has to   edify the caregiver to provide care for the  patient but we also have to somewhat provide   coping skills to the patient to suit the  caregiver's grief in this in this cycle of of   biopsychosocial recovery for both it's it's your  conversation is really illuminating for me how   how more complex this is than  i i ever had contemplated and i i'm very thankful for that i  think one of the key pieces sorry   um i think one of the key pieces for me is not  this isn't just sort of a neuroscience you know   armchair experiment idea but i think it is because  of these conflicts in the way we understand   that the stress is uh develops right we  feel stress when there is conflict around   the way we understand the world and that very  directly leads to things like sympathetic   activation right which then leads us into the  trail that dr cole was talking about and so   you know things that we see are the interventions  that reduce psychological conflict and thus stress   have these effects potentially or in some cases  on sympathetic nervous system activity and so   while all the pieces have not necessarily been  strung together i think it's easier to see why   psychological intervention can be so important  in the very downstream morbidity and mortality   effects now it's not all strung  together so i'm not going to say   there's a direct link and certainly  we've gone down rabbit holes before   but but i think it's worth continuing to  try and work out the molecular pathways jackie i've just seen you come on  the video did did you want to join us   uh there was a question for me i think lois just emailed me and said  there was a question for me oh uh uh um yes uh uh um the we were wondering whether uh um  the the african-american mothers in your study   um did not all have the same they had different  numbers of children yes they were wondering if   you had if if there were outcomes in the mothers  or perhaps the children based on family size so   that's something that we can definitely analyze  for we have not looked at uh parity yet in terms   of our analyses i have looked at that in previous  studies and did find that number of children did   affect um you know parenting stress and blood  pressure and in a sample that i collected in   detroit and three generations of african-american  women in detroit so that's something that we can   definitely look at with this sample we can also  you know look at not just parity but then um   age differences and um developmental um stage of  the children as well and how that affects stress thanks a lot um steve and janice we've been calling your names  quite a bit in this panel discussion and i i   wonder if you'd like to respond to anything that  we've been saying about your work or whether you'd   like to just provide your own perspective on as  a result of where we are now in the conversation uh steve's happy to do that um i would say  that uh it you know i i'm heartened to see   the coherence among the different talks here  and the you know sort of way in which no one   talk necessarily covers the entire spectrum  you guys are after on this but um you know sort   of connecting together for instance the basic  biology that dr san is talking about with the   the sort of the the clinical psychoneuroimmunology  that dr kiko glaser was talking about um and then   kind of bringing in these angles of psychological  adaptation um and you know sort of demographic and   uh health disparities i it seems like a great  fabric for you know the initiative that you   guys already have announced so i'm actually you  know convinced that we're perhaps farther along   the road um you know in the areas that i think  will be raised for formal question later then um   you know i had certainly expected i agree with you  it's nice to see this all come together i think my   biggest questions you know about the significance  of this and the implications again uh will   probably be addressed in part in the additional  presentations that happen later so i would   say you know i think insofar as it's possible  yet there's great connections here and we're   on a good course and i would just look forward  to hearing what others talk about later today okay thanks so much uh um theresa cruz i'm  now going to put you on the spot because   we have been talking a great deal about uh um um  amputations and uh um which part of which involves   the portfolio of the international center were  there any questions you might particularly want   to ask or talk about applications in this regard  to either the lay public or armed forces people   in rehab thanks bill can you guys hear me okay yes  ma'am go right ahead okay great um so this makes   me think of a few things um i haven't heard of  any uh discussions of pain um so pain associated   with with limb loss there's there's the  phantom limb pain but you know are any   of these um caregiver stress mediated um  issues that we've been hearing about today   how do they influence the experience of pain  particularly in these amputee patients and then i   guess the other thing that that i would just plug  is um you know nih is working with dod on a limb   loss and preservation registry and you're giving  me ideas of other things that we might want to   put into that registry as we try to understand  limb loss and really get a handle on it are there other measures that we should be taking  so i'm finding this very helpful thank you i'm glad any other comments betsy i do have  one i know i'm sorry but to say i'm really   interested it's fascinating so um mary frances  did you see any differences in the responses   from people who had lost a spouse to something  quick and sudden or violent or you know a   car accident something like that  the reason i'm thinking about it   and have been in regard to the military is  you know and i am not an expert on this at   all but i've read how military um that  when that's when soldiers are wounded is that they're often sedated which then  some research suggests that this might end up   in reducing the risk of post-traumatic stress  syndrome and um i don't know anything more about   it than that but it's fascinating and if um if  the people who really are involved in the military   have insights into that but i wonder if in regard  to your belief as well is if something happens   very suddenly and it's hugely traumatic does  that have a worsening response on psychological   i think it's an excellent question and  something we always have to address in   bereavement research but the answer is not always  what you're expecting so in this particular study   there were no differences between those with  complicated grief and non-complicated grief in the   type of death that was experienced so just you  know across groups there was no difference what   we find is although sudden death or violent death  which are not necessarily the same thing although   those are often predictive of psychological  response in the first couple of months   usually it's not a long-term predictor of people's  adjustment which people find very surprising um   the only other thing i would say about that uh  uh in the case you know one result obviously of   bereavement or or death of a of a of uh um of a  brother at arms um can be uh complicated grief   but it can also be ptsd right and and we know that  there are differences between a complicated grief   profile and a ptsd profile the piece i  find most interesting that you mentioned   actually um sedating them i i'm not familiar with  that research but but a piece of research i'm   fairly familiar with is that actually if you don't  have a strong enough cortisol response at the time   of a traumatic event that actually  can be problematic with encoding the   the memory uh in in the in the way that we  then encode it as a past event rather than   a recurring sort of flashback event um and  so there have actually been some studies of   giving cortisol in an emergency room to people who  say for example just experienced a car accident   a very traumatic event that not infrequently  leads to ptsd and that sounds so counter-intuitive   but uh it i think that some of these stress  hormones are a way that the brain has adapted   to understand what just happened and so trying  to understand how the biology is supposed to work   and then trying to support that is is  an interesting way to think about these   problems excellent thank you uh um any other  questions from our panelists or the uh um group if not we may keep this train running uh um early  and i believe uh um change our break from 145 to   um 215 but first let me thank you all for  outstanding presentations and uh to our experts   and to all of you for a really stimulating  discussion that demonstrates uh uh um just   this complex interdisciplinary and multi-systemic  network uh um involved in this topic uh um lois so i i want to thank here i am i i want to thank everyone uh  also and um i agree with bill uh it's it's   it's great to hear this um outstanding simulating  uh science uh it crosses several disciplines   and interest areas to to our institute and i'm  sure across the nih so i'm also very grateful   so as bill said we can start our  break early and this break is our   quote unquote lunch break so we have half an  hour so we'll start again at 2 15 uh eastern time   and so enjoy the break and we'll see you soon  and thank you everyone welcome everyone back   hope you enjoyed your break um and i will turn  it over to kathy bender who's the moderator   for the next session but i first want to point  out that i don't know if you noticed during the   break there was a slide up with some discussion  topics and they have already been shared with   the speakers and moderators and our plan is at  the end of the day to address those uh topics   and uh we look forward to hearing everyone's  thoughts on those as well as you know your   questions and discussion following the next set of  uh presentations so with that i will turn it over thank you louis and i'm gonna pull up my try to pull up my slide unfortunately i don't ah so lois also asked me to say a few words about  about our work i'm catherine bender from the   university of pittsburgh and my research focuses  on changes in neurocognitive function with cancer   and cancer therapy we've also uh with my longtime  collaborator dr yvette conley led a series of uh   studies examining the biological mechanisms uh  underlying these changes uh in our most recent   work we are leading a randomized controlled trial  to examine the influence of aerobic exercise on   neurocognitive function and brain health in women  with breast cancer and led by dr conley that we   also are conducting a companion study to examine  the dna methylone to identify genes and biological   pathways associated with neurocognitive function  in the context of breast cancer its treatment and   to examine the mechanisms underlying the influence  of aerobic exercise on cognitive function   and with that i am very pleased to introduce our  new our next presenter dr elizabeth corwin um   thank you nathan are you i am going to try to  say uh open my screen now if you give me that   ability otherwise nathan um mack has been  reluctant to give up and to uh let me show   these here so nathan is going to help  me with the slides if this doesn't work   go ahead well dr while while you're working on  that i'll i'll go ahead with my introduction so dr   coyne is the anna st actual professor of nursing  research and the vice dean for research and   innovation at the columbia university school of  nursing he is both a phd prepared physiologist and   a nationally certified family nurse practitioner  her research focuses on understanding the   biological and omic underpinnings of adverse  health outcomes and associated symptoms   especially those experienced disproportionately  by disadvantaged or marginalized populations she   is also a committed mentor and she's committed to  supporting the next generation of nurse scientists   uh dr corwin is going to speak today about social  and bio bio um sorry behavioral determinants of   the um the gut microbiome in black women okay  thank you um does my screen show right now we see   i think we know we do see your screen yes but not  it's not working so i'm gonna go ahead and share   okay thank you nathan all right i'm excited  to be here next slide please i'll be talking   about the outcomes from our recently completed  r01 on the microbiome and pre-term breakfast   well chronic stress has clearly been suggested  in many different studies strongly supported to   be of increased presence amongst  african-american women likewise   in many many studies our own and others  have found that like next next nathan um nathan i don't see uh your let me see here okay i got you now um yeah so african-american  women also consistently have been shown to report   higher much higher rates of pre-term birth and  other adverse work outcomes to compare compared   to white women currently it's about this year  14 versus 9 but it varies on significantly also   there have been biological indicators identified  in african-american women that correlate with   or associate with increased stress including  shortened telomeres as reported by geronimous   on this part of the weathering hypothesis  but also exaggerated inflammation and hpa   dysregulation from our group and others and  the question that we'll be discussing today   is whether chronic stress or life stressors are  also associated with dysbiosis of the vaginal   microbiome by dysbiosis that's a term  that really officially sort of refers to the composition of the microbiome or microbiota in  an area that is different from what's reported on   the nih microbiome website but it also refers  to just an increased diversity and on the   presence of organisms that are associated  with sometimes pathogenesis or increased   inflammation or other or  infection next slide please nathan so the healthy vaginal microbiome is important  because it reduces bacterial vaginosis sexually   transmitted infections utis and because those are  all reduced the likelihood of a scent of pathogens   into the pregnant uterus is reduced as well the  pathogens do arise into the uterus inflammatory   reactions start and contributing to um preterm  birth in early labor i see a there we go   protection of the vaginal microbiome is typically  attributed to dominance by lactobacillus species   these species produce lactic acid as well as  other antibacterial compounds they're very tricky   and what they can do and they can block expression  of certain or transcription of genes they block   receptors through nutrient uptake by other  organisms and as a result lactobacillus just   holds the ecology holds the ground there it  makes it difficult for other organisms to take   hold without lactobacillus dominance however  um other organisms do take hold gardnerella   mycoplasma prevotel all these are common in bb and  all of them have been identified as risk factors   now the most common species of lactobacillus are  lactobacillus crespatus which is a very stable   it doesn't change and it holds its ground a very  stable organism it dominates the ecosystem and is   protective against other organisms taking root  or setting up their own space in that ecology   lactobacillus irons is also secretes acid and  has some protection but it is less so in that   it's considered a transitional organism it can  either transition towards more correspondence   which would be it's more um firmly holding the  ecology or can transition to other organisms   that are must protect next slide please there are  certainly have been identified variations in race   based on um vaginal microbiota variations  and rates for specifically non-hispanic white   women have been vaginal microbiomes are pretty  dominated typically by lactobacillus cresponus   with colonization rates in the 60s 70s sometimes  you'll even see 80 percentiles vaginal diversity   in white women also appears to decrease across  pregnancy with lactobacillus cresponus remaining   dominant and if anything becoming even  more dominant as pregnancy progresses again   it prohibits is protective against other organisms  setting up their own space there african-american   women on the other hand are on the other hand are  more likely to have lactobacillus irons and they   are also more likely to have other organisms bb  for example is increased amongst african-american   women even during pregnancy so those are  organisms such as gardenerella propatella   but other bb associated bacteria this is  i'm abbreviated in my other slides v b a b   these are kind of new newly identified with  the very new technologies we have and there   you'll be reading more about these as the years  go on early pregnancy in african american women   the early pregnancy vaginal microbiota may be more  important not so much to change across pregnancy   but what is there at the start factors  contributing to these differences and   lactobacillus predominance across race and  ethnicity are unknown next slide please so health   disparity researchers recommend that in order to  really identify the risk and protective factors   we must look within the disparity population  to identify those factors and i think all of us   are have known before but now it is darkly  apparent to everyone that there are very   many different life experiences that are  encountered by african americans compared to   white or other populations in our country  microaggressions or macroaggressions and   it's very difficult to tease out those when you  look across race and ethnicity so we did look   within the disparity population to identify risk  and protective factors our women are recruited the   study i'll talk about is from emory when i was  at emory and grady memorial hospital in atlanta   downtown atlanta is the safety net hospital for  the city emory prenatal clinics is a more diverse   socioeconomically diverse clinic and the providers  are the same across both of the hospitals or   other revisit ob gyns but very different  populations as you'll see next slide please um we have data collection uh in the study  was twice to go back please twice during   pregnancy at the first prenatal visit  and again between weeks 24 to 30. we ask   questionnaires all about anything you can think  of stress diet health sexual behaviors hygiene   behaviors we also collect blood for inflammatory  markers stress exposure and nutrients and the   women self-collect oral vaginal rectal swabs for  16s our rna gene sequencing of which i'll only   really discuss the vaginal samples today  after delivery do a very rigorous medical chat   chart abstraction for complications  and outcomes next slide please so this is on the population we are going  to recruit those 540 women we've exceeded   that to date but these are the results  on demographic results on the first 500.   as you can see the emory subjects are  shown here and the grady subjects here   and just to point out some of these differences  which are highlighted in red the great um the   women at grady are a little bit younger they're  also more likely to be not in a relationship   compared to the emory subjects they are also if  they are in a relationship less likely to be cohab   they are not as likely to be cohabitating and they  are also significantly less likely to be married   you can see their educational is almost  the mere opposite the grading women from   grady have 72 percent have high school or some  high school or diploma whereas with the emory   subjects 73 percent had college or graduate  school or on a professional degree such as a   nursing professional nursing degree or  medical degree many different ones there   was no difference in their prior number of births  they've given or in their preterm birth experience   previously but if you look at the percent  medicaid the grady subjects were almost 100   medicaid um supported in their insurance  they all had insurance but mostly medicaid   whereas the emory likewise had insurance but it  was pretty split half and half between medicaid   and private insurance no differences in their  risk of experiences of prenatal infections   or antibiotic use although i'll show you you can  see at the bottom the antibiotic use was about 50   amongst all the women during their pregnancies  birth outcomes are markedly different um if you   look at that bottom um part of the slide at the  grady hospital the patients had about 19 risk of   preterm birth that's really high on the other hand  at emory the women had a nine percent nine percent   is about what um white women in the us uh have  um good years pretty good years next slide please you can also see we did measure stress  exposures based on self-reported enrollment   and there were really no differences almost  between the res the um reports of stress   behavior between our women at grady no significant  difference in where they placed themselves on the   social ladder no significant differences in  perceived stress depression scores which are   pretty low depression scores anxiety was  not different um stressful life events nor   nor were stressful life events different you can  see though that the gradient women did report   although the numbers are small but significant  increase in adverse childhood experiences store   which does remind me of dr cole's  presentation earlier where he mentioned early   adversity and then we can also see  that the women from grady reported   slightly higher on likelihood of emotional or  physical significantly higher next slide please so this is the overall composition of the  microbiota within the sample now this is a sub   sample we have just finally won all the microbiome  samples from all 500 and some women and their   children many of their children as well and i  don't have all of those yet but we anticipate   from our early analysis these will be very similar  overall 46 of the population with dominated   vaginal microbiome these are the green organisms  or the green lines you can see well 46 percent   had lactobacillus dominant on the other hand about  54 everybody else had a diverse vaginal microbiome   if you look at this purple group over here these  are these bb a b they're primarily lactose foracia   dominated and these ones are are odd they're um  they're very stable they don't go away and they   are associated with um bacterial vaginosis as well  and we'll come back to these later you can also   see there was a quite a bit of lavender which  is previtela these this peach color is snethea   and the light blue at the top that's gardenerella  again all associated with preterm burp i'm sorry   with bacterial vaginosis which is associated with  next slide please now this just looks pulls it out   specifically for the emory private pay which again  was about 50 of the emory group preterm birth rate   in this group was four percent they had which is  um really very very low they had 64 lactobacillus   our our population from grady hospital on  the other hand had a preterm birth rate of 18   38 lactobacillus dominant and again you see  this um this bb ab colony here next slide please okay um i know you guys can't see  my cursor running around but the one   thing that um since we had such a difference in  lactobacillus that's when this health disparity   recommendation comes into again to look within  the disparity group and see what is going on   so what is influencing lactobacillus dominance and  it was not very much what we found is cohabitating   with a partner married or not but cohabitating  was significantly different with lactobacillus   dominance and 65 of the women versus 38 we  also saw health insurance and that related on   to the fact that many of our grady subjects had  were on medicaid percent medicaid but that also   came out significant also the likelihood of having  vaginal sex was near significance and this was   specifically here it shows 10 times  in the last 30 days and women at um   who had lactobacillus 35 35 reported  yes to that question whereas 21   we're not lactobacillus dominant reported yes  same thing if you ask within the last week or   the last three days not quite significant  but we were all wondering uh what about that   so we follow up a little bit and then again  you see that the non-lactobacillus dominant   on there second from the bottom row uh  71 of non-lactobacillus dominant women   had bacterial vaginosis and that is also highly  significant so not many things not tobacco use   marijuana alcohol different sex or in this case  douching spray or cream so lactobacillus dominance   we then started trying to follow up  what is it about cohabitating next slide   so we look within this group and what we found  is uh are some interesting things which is that   the cohabitators were a little bit older that's  the age a little bit older they were a little   likely to be in their first less likely to  be in their first pregnancy they also um   were the cohabitating women were had about 50  50 on medicaid whereas the non-cohabitating   88 received medicaid and if you go down to the  next group current practices again neither tobacco   marijuana or alcohol pulled out but vaginal sex  did vaginal sex was more common among cohabitating   partners or women who were cohabitating  compared to those who were not   and also douching the use of douching sprays and  creams was higher among the non-cohabitating women   28 percent of non-cohabitating women reported  either douching or using vaginal sprays or creams   were 14 of the cohabitating movement did  that and then this new just score is just   indicative of bacterial vaginosis risk factor  higher among non-cohabitating next slide please okay so then now looking at the  very specific microbiota taxa   by these factors again cohabitating pulled out  um and vaginal sex within 48 hours pulled out   and that's commonly known that the microbiota  changes a little bit in people who've just   recently had vaginal sex but not much else on the  other hand with significantly different species   there are two species that pull out differently  amongst people women who cohabitate versus   those who do not the megasphere and the lac  lacnosterosa the bba these are both associated   with bacterial vaginosis again and and we'll  take more follow-up we also saw pretty clear oral   microbes in women who had had receptive oral sex  but just in a couple instances so we question   whether this will hold up but streptococcus  dentistante and streptococcus solar bearings were   detectable as taxa in the vaginas of women  that had receptive oral sex next slide please   this just shows that again the cohabitating women  58 lactobacillus dominant much of um mixture   between einer's and and alka-spot is mostly  ironers and then um also these other organisms   and you can see this white now is that used to  be purple sorry be the associated bacteria b d a   b and uh it's not too much there if you go down to  non-cohabitating percent lactobacillus is about 32   with again the significant amount of bba bacterial  vaginosis associated bacteria and these um seem to   be very stable themselves in the vagina they don't  seem to give up their space as pregnancy advances   as other organisms next slide please so you have  about two minutes left okay great so in summary   then oops with multivariate analyses controlling  for key factors we found that merit cohabitating   remain associated with taxa vaginal douches  grazing cream associated with non-cohabitation   and the only variable associated with   overall composition is married  cohabitating next slide please there is significant by summary there is  significant variability in the rate of   preterm birth within the population nearly all the  women in our population showed taxa dominated by   lactobacillus trainers with some bva b as well  as these well-known organisms women with their   partners are more likely to engage in vaginal sex  less likely to douche or use creams more likely to   have a lactobacillus dominant microbiome women  not living with their partners were more likely   to harbor these two organisms but only married  cohabitation was associated next slide please in conclusion living with a partner may be  associated with social and behavioral changes   that are conducive to lactobacillus predominance  this reminds me of our earlier presentations today   whether this is a stress related finding  that financial security by having a partner   or whether it's emotional support or loneliness  that lack of loneliness that came up previously   or whether it's frequent contact with the  same host for example it's known that micro   gut microorganisms are very similar to the people  with whom you live they're very similar to those   with whom you grew up and live and or live now and  it may also be that um frequent contact with the   same host the same partner is really what could  be driving the stability of the vaginal microbiome next but cohabitation may be important  to consider in future studies next slide   please and recommendation is really  avoiding douche and uh and ob gyns our   study doesn't necessarily suggest limiting  number of new sexual problems but for   decades that has been a recommendation in  the ob and midwifery groups next slide please um i we did look at metabolomics of chronic stress  related corticoid resistance pretty cool it turned   out some interesting things mostly related  to the krebs cycle energy production but also   if you see this glycophospholipid single lipids  these are important for cell membranes and   neuro and myelin type organisms coding the neurons  and these are significantly different amongst   women who are exposed or who demonstrate  biological indicators of chronic stress   dexa c50 in our case next slide please i think  that's it next slide please thank you thanks   to the women at grady and memory midtown and next  we'll keep going there something that's about that   and our coordinators students and fellows that's  it thanks can check that off now nathan thank you   for an excellent presentation dr corwin are there  questions uh for dr corwin from the participants this is mary francis o'connor i had  a question that i put in the chat but   i was just curious how systemic  infection like viral infection   might affect the vaginal microbiome and of  course in part i'm thinking about this because i   have collaborators looking at how covid19 might  affect pre-term birth and just wondered if you   had any thoughts about systemic infection well um  i do believe that systemic infection when people   are sick there can be changes just inflammation  systemic inflammation and you ca especially if   you say had a wound a site that was infected you  could theoretically and i'm sure it does happen   have some virulent organisms transfer in the blood  or through some other pathway if it's a rectal   infection or something like that but and then also  systemic infection is associated with inflammation   and fevers which can also influence pregnancy  outcomes but we did have a lot of women   with infections we have a lot of utis and  which contributed mostly to the antibiotic   administration also some stis and we did not  really able to pull those out as significant dr corwin i'd like to ask a little more  about the issue of kind of financial   security i know we have a real interest in  this kind of perception of economic burden   and the role you think that might play  in the stress that that women experience   yeah so well um i think that other speakers have  sort of addressed that in different ways as well   i think that um having a partner unless the  partner is you know part of the stressors   but having a partner can be stabilizing  for a number of reasons including financial   security and that can't be minimized but  also someone to help perhaps listen to   to your worries and your day so there i think  the literature does and maybe wait uh back with   our first speaker dr kiko glazer  in regard to partners having   better people who are partnered having more  supportive outcomes so i we also have our   data in the gut microbiome which you also heard  is influenced by chronic by stress exposure and   can become more leaky so in that sense chronic  stress can increase systemic inflammation as well   and which can also impact um theoretically  impact pre-timber as well with inflammation   typically the inflammation that drives preterm  birth is intrauterine or vaginal inflammation   but there are situations that publications  where you can show systemic information   also can uh initiate early onset  labor thanks hope that helped very good all right well with that i think we  will um turn to our next presenter dr rita pickler dr pickler is the flo ann sauers easton professor  of child and adolescent health and the director   of the phd and ms in nursing science programs at  the ohio state university college of nursing her   research focuses on the care of pre-term infants  since 1980 in pre-turn infant feeding care since   1990 since 2001 her research has focused on  measurement of neurodevelopmental outcomes of   pretern inference and other high-risk children  as well as prematurity prevention she has   a member of the sigma theta tau  international researcher hall of fame   and is um currently the editor of nursing research  so dr pickler is going to be speaking about the   effects of health determinants on telomere length  acculturation and adverse childhood experiences   hi this is louis i just want to make sure as  people are speaking to please turn your video on   okay i'll do that but nathan i have i'm i'm  having trouble sharing my content at the moment   um okay did you click the share share content and  yeah and then what i'm sorry i'm trying to figure   out where it comes up because i don't know that i  got it never mind okay great got it thanks sorry   no problem always a challenge um let's see and  i need to uh yes yeah on display settings at the   top hit the little drop down and then click  switch there you go got it good thank you   and lois she wanted me to turn my cell phone no  i'm i'm just saying uh when people are speaking to   turn your video on so we can see you as  well as hearing you and that goes for anyone   who has the capability it is a panelist to do  so thank you great i'm going to leave mine off   for now because i have a little bit of internet  instability so with a lot of windows open but i'll   turn it on later sure thanks thanks all right well  thank you everybody it's a pleasure to be here um   i wanted to note that i don't have any conflicts  of interest i do have an outline for today's um   talk and i'll just uh skip through that right now  so i'm going to talk a little bit about telomeres   and specifically telomere shortening telomeres are  a region of repetitive nucleotide sequences that   are at the end of chromosomes protecting  the chromosome from deterioration either   from loss or from fusion with neighboring  chromosomes and the average telomere length   declines as we age from about 11 kilobases at  birth to fewer than four kilobases in older adults   and these telomeres act as buffers at the  end of chromosomes keeping the the actual   gene content on the chromosomes from truncating  during cell division so they're very important   to us telomeres do shorten with normal aging  and thus with mortality and and aging related   diseases however it isn't known whether short  telomeres are just a sign of cellular age or   whether they actually contribute to the aging  process themselves we do know that shortening   of telomeres occurs at a faster rate in men than  women and we also know that there is evidence   of oxidative stress mediated dna damage as an  important cause of telomere shortening in fact   telomere shortening due to free radicals explains  the difference between the estimated loss of   per by division or end replication and  the actual uh telomere shortening rates   and telomere shortening due to free radicals has  a greater absolute effect on telomere length than   does shortening that's caused by n replication  we also know from meta-analyses that increased   perceived psychological stress is associated  with a small decrease in telomere length   so both extremely short and long telomeres have  been associated with neurodegenerative diseases   cardiovascular diseases and cancer risk certainly  most known i think is that shorter telomeres are   associated with an increased risk of cancer but  at the same time cancer cells themselves have   elongated telomeres as the result of reactivated  telomerase which is reactivated or increased   in almost 90 percent of all cancers and we also  know that there are health determinants that are   that have an association with telomeres and  that's what the focus of my talk is today   the term social determinants of health of course  refers to any non-medical factor directly related   or directly influencing health including values  attitudes knowledge and behaviors it also can   refer to more external sources of influence such  as family neighborhood and social network a large   and convincing body of literature over the past  several decades shows that health across the   lifespan is strongly linked to social disadvantage  and this is where telomere length gets interesting   telomeres appear to be biomarkers of social  stress social stress telomere shortening has   been associated with many social stressors and  stress-related telomere shortening could evoke   physiological weathering in a way similar  to aging likely mediated by many factors   but despite research that replicates the  association of telomere length to social   stress it's not clear whether telomere attrition  contributes mechanistically to the health effects   associated with chronic stress or whether it's  simply a biomarker that reflects these effects   some researchers have suggested that the  physiological correlates of stress for example   activation of the hpa access and inflammation  impose an increased oxidative burden on the cell   which then damages the telomere resulting  in accelerated telomere attrition   other studies point to depressed telomerase  function also associated with stress as   contributing to reduced average telomere length  but the evidence for neither mechanism is strong one health determinant is acculturation the  process of social psychological and cultural   change stemming from trying to balance two  cultures while adapting to the prevailing culture   of society at the group level acculturation often  results in changes to culture religious practices   health care and other social institutions at  the individual level acculturation is linked   to changes in daily behavior as well as numerous  changes in psychological and physical well-being   one explanation for the negative health behaviors  and outcomes associated with acculturation   is acculturative stress stressors can include the  pressures of learning a new language maintaining   one's native language balancing differing cultural  values and brokering between native and host   differences in acceptable social behaviors  acculturative stress manifest in many ways   and a widely used four category model of a coach  acculturation shows that individuals who abandon   their heritage cultural identity alongside  of acquisition of cultural ident of the host   cultural identity or who retain the cultural  identity heritage cultural identity and don't   acquire many aspects at all of the host cultural  identity may be at greater risk for poor health we   we saw the result of this acculturation paradox  in our own work as a secondary analysis from data   collected as part of a larger ro1 conducted  by my colleague dr jeannie ruiz we analyzed   the relationships among cellular senescences  measured by telomere length acculturation   depression discrimination and stress in hispanic  mexican-american women during pregnancy the parent   study used a cross-sectional prospective design  with data collected from hispanic mexican-american   women aged 14 to 40 years of age data were  collected at 22 weeks gestation a critical window   for the development of neuroendocrine system  in the fetus and a time when maternal stressors   may significantly affect placental functioning  fetal development and infant outcomes at birth a factor analysis of the variables in  this secondary analysis indicated two   latent factors accounted for more than 70  percent of the variance in telomere length   with anglo-orientation and acculturation  level loading on one factor   and total scores for depression discrimination  and perceived stress loading on the other   acculturation had significant negative effects  on telomere length while negative effectivity had   a smaller indirect negative effect on telomere  length basically what we found is that pregnant   hispanic mexican american women who were more  acculturated had shortened telomeres compared   to newly immigrated pregnant hispanic  mexican-american women with negative   effectivity having an indirect effect on telomere  length through mediation by acculturation   so what do we do about this well in a grant  application currently under institute review   we are planning to test a mastery lifestyle  intervention targeting those areas of greatest   concern in these women depression anxiety  perceived stress acculturative stress   and coping we hope to determine if  the intervention is efficacious in   decreasing these depressive symptoms and  in improving coping from early pregnancy   through post-delivery we also want to explore the  effect of the intervention on neuroendocrine risk   factors of preterm birth and we want to explore  the effect of the intervention on birth outcomes   and now i'll turn to adverse childhood events  which is another sort of interest of mine aces which we've all heard of are  typically defined as stressful or traumatic   experiences that occur during childhood many  things count as aces if they're experienced   before age 18. and in fact it's been projected  that approximately two in every three americans   have experienced at least one ace and 12  percent indicate experiencing at least four   types of aces adverse childhood events can have  a lasting effect on health and quality of life   and are associated with a wide range of long-term  poor health outcomes and there does appear to be   a strong dose-response relationship between  exposure of aces and poor health outcomes   where individuals who experience a higher number  of aces may be at greater risk for poor health   aces have been linked to a number of biomarkers  including telomere length and in a recent   analysis of 41 studies of early adversity and  telomere length were significantly associated   and adversity type and timing significantly  affected the association with telomere length   so how does one put all of this together  to think about these relationships   at the ohio state university college of nursing in  our phd program and more specifically in our t32   training program we use an adaptive life  course health development framework that   posits relationships between health determinants  and their potential effects at various sensitive   and critical periods throughout life one  aspect is quite clear about health determinants   and that's that individuals may or may not have  direct control over the factors that affect their   health for example children born pre-term or  born into poverty to low-income mothers with   high levels of social and economic stress will  be at greater risk for poor health outcomes   these children may continue to be  exposed to impoverished environments   and unself unsafe neighborhoods further  compromising their health we use this model   in proposing a new study looking at aces and  telomere length in adolescence so my colleagues   and i propose to focus on adolescence as a  sensitive health development period adolescence   is a time where areas of the brain responsible  for emotion regulation and stress responsivity   undergo structural and functional reorganization  thus exposure to adversity during this period   may increase the risk for future pathology  regardless what is what has happened before   but additionally the developmental changes that  occur in adolescents such as greater autonomy   and time spent with peers as opposed  to parents may increase increase the   likelihood of adolescence exposure to  adverse social and physical environments   we think that any interventions targeting  the prevention and mitigation of exposure   to adversity can alter the physiologic stress  responsibility specifically because adolescents   are still developing biologically and socially  so thus in our proposed study we aim to identify   which and how adverse exposures exposures affect  and alter adolescence chronic physiologic stress   processes so that we can develop interventions  to take advantage of this plasticity   and specifically we plan to investigate the  relationships between aces and telomere length   during adolescence using data from the adolescent  health and development and context study which   was a longitudinal representative cohort study  of the effect of activity space exposures on   the health and well-being of a representative  community sample of urban and suburban youth   age 11 to 17 years the study includes rich data  at the individual and activity space level on   adverse exposures during childhood and adolescent  collected from the adolescent as well as from   parents smartphone gps and administrative sources  along with stress biomarkers including saliva for   telomere length and hair for cortisol we  really believe that because of the richness   of this data set we will be able to assess a wide  ranging panel of aces and the relative importance   of these aces experienced during specific  developmental periods as well as cumulatively   on cellular senescence and we believe  that we will be able to link data in a way   that will help us to develop interventions  for the future to mitigate some of this stress   so i also wanted to just give a nod to the  to the fund of a measuring telomeres and this   particular diagram was created by colleagues  who were funded by ninr and the schematic   actually shows how various estimation methods  of telomeres work and telomeres are one of those   fun biological measurement challenges of course  there are no norms for these kinds of data   but rather we look at estimating what the length  is from the sources of data that we have and this   diagram nicely shows how the various methods  of estimation target particular areas of the   telomeres in the subtelomere ranges and there's  also this nice table for telomere measurement that   provides information about relative advantages  and disadvantages of these various telomere   estimation methods and as with all biomarkers  there's a lot to consider about collecting   storing and analyzing these samples and that  gets us to where else we might need to know   about telomeres and their relationships to the  social environment this really nice figure i think   shows some aspects that might influence telomere  length clearly many social psychological and   environmental factors are associated with  telomere length and with illness oxidative damage   appears to be the main condition that can  destabilize telomere dynamics but we have   a long way to go i think in terms of figuring out  all that might affect telomere length as well as   understanding how telomeres interact with health  determinants to determine human health thank you and i can stop sharing i think yes well thank you uh dr picker that was an a  fascinating uh presentation i was really   struck by by your findings particularly around  telomere length and you know in cancer certainly   accelerated aging is uh something that we  see that that puts you at risk for cancer   and then we give you therapies that accelerate  things uh even more but i'm wondering about   your thoughts about kind of the time course of  where we see these effects in telomere length um   and how that might inform timing of interventions  well i think that's a great question and actually   in response to the questions that lois had posed  to us to consider for this day-long seminar   it seems to me and with telomeres this is quite  particular that there is uh most of the studies   almost all of them of course are cross-sectional  and so we are very limited i think in our ability   to sort of make sense and understand how things  might really all come together because we only   have one shot in time in terms of the telomere  length measure so i do believe we need studies   large cohort studies that include the measurement  of many of these biological markers across ages in   order to understand perhaps how those biomarkers  may change and thus be indicative of concern as   certain health experiences occur during that  time period but we don't really have those data   yet we don't we will be able we hope in our study  of adolescents to be able to look at the historic   record of these adverse events and compare that  to telomere links given that these kids had a wide   range of adversity throughout early childhood  we have data from birth all the way through   adolescence so we have a lot of opportunity to  look at what the telomere links actually look   like but it's still just a one-time measure of  telomeres and i think that's a weakness in in   these studies that we have is this cross-sectional  nature of them are there questions by any of the participants so in terms of of intervening to kind  of mitigate so the effects of some   of these social determinants of health  um what approaches are do you think um   need to be explored um to to intervene  in these for this these problems so i think we have ample evidence  over many decades that shows   poverty and impoverished living conditions is the  single biggest predictor of poor health outcomes   and so we can do many things i think at individual  levels we can help people manage their health and   we can help them appraise stressful situations  we can do all of those kinds of things   but the reality is we need a very large  effort to change the living conditions   of people and particularly i'm a you know a  pedia pediatric uh nurse we need to change the   conditions in which children are born into and  in which they grow up in and so that's going to   take a lot more effort than our individual  interventions that we might create however   i think while we're getting to the bigger social  interventions i think we can teach individuals how   to avoid unhealthy situations i think we can talk  to young people in particular about the exposures   that they place themselves next to and how  to avoid some of those kinds of things and   strengthen their own sense of well-being  so that they learn to make good decisions very good uh there's uh yeah so um would you would yours can  you read that reading yeah so i see jackie has a   uh sent me a um a question about interested in  trauma we do have um uh measures of violence and   trauma that these kids have been both that  they've personally experienced as well as   traumas such as gun violence and things such  as that in their neighborhood that they have   been exposed to or seen so we will be able to  analyze some of those kinds of um things the   data set is huge and has many different is there  have been a number of papers written from it   not anything related to this but um but there  is there are trauma related um data in the data   set and we will be able to examine to examine  that so we'll have to talk offline jackie about   some collaborations there's also a request  for you to comment on other measures or   biomarkers of aging such as dna methylation  clocks that may complement telomere length   so methylation and telomere length are i didn't  see that one but methyl methylation telomere   length are associated there is some evidence of  dna methylating at particular sites that affects   the telomere length i'm not a dna methylation  expert by any means but as i have been reading   and thinking about this it seems to me that again  studies that provide an opportunity to look at   both dna methylation and telomere length  simultaneously along with predictors of   um of methylation and telomere shortening  would be a wise research move to take and i   am unaware of a lot of that kind of work going  on but i think it would be helpful to to study it together good any other questions for dr pickler i do kathy this is bill elwood hi uh um  rita you toward the end you you spoke about   you know uh uh um grander sociostructural change  uh um for a world in which healthier children   could be born and stay that way uh um but we we  do have a number of larger health care systems and   and research universities that are either   collaborate with them greatly or are all part of  the whole system uh um can you see collaborations   going forward that it with an integration of  both care and data that could move us somewhat   toward that overall grander goal well i  think so yes absolutely i i think that   that those are those are terrific undertakings um  we you know it's a bigger issue than than that of   course but yes i think those would be great and  i think institutions should collaborate across   institutions around these kinds of things as well  and certainly one size won't fit all what works in   one community may not work in another but i think  when we don't have conversations about what's   working in particular places we don't ever make  movement in in particular places where nobody's   doing any of the work so i think there has to  be collaboration across um you know all of our   health care system and and i guess i would say our  human system you know our just how we our culture   if you will um allow me to say that you know  we really need to give it some serious thought   it's not like this is a new problem we know  these problems they've existed for ever and we   we you know we really need to just finally do  something i think culturally and socially about   the way our lives are affected  by the way in which we live great thank you all right well um i don't see any more questions if there are none um by the participants  um are we ready to uh begin the um the moderated discussion so this is lois i would say yes and um   just a reminder to people if you do put a question  in the chat box make sure it goes to everyone   and also as you're speaking uh if possible turn  your video on so we can see you as well as hear   you and i'll turn it over to kathy and bill  bill is here also to lead the discussion topics so one of the thing one of the questions i think  that and i think some of this came out today   was was a discussion about the disciplines that  need to be engaged to move this science forward   what are your thoughts about about that so kathy  i i will start sort of um continuing with my theme   that um uh i think this is a collaborative  effort that's needed i think that certainly nursing psychology sociology medicine  the biological sciences it's a team science   approach needed i'm certain of  that i'm not a biologist so i   definitely need the help  of folks who have more of a   knowledge of biology than i do but i i in my  work as a nurse i see human beings and i know   what they experience and i think we bring that  to the table as nurses i think our sociologists   help us understand the bigger sociological picture  i think folks who are uh trained in psychology   bring a a a view of the the way the human brain  works and the human mind that that others don't   have so it's clearly team science that's needed in  order to um get a um you know in order to help us   with the social environment and understanding  how it affects our health and how we might   amend the social environment in ways  that produce better health outcomes you know it also to me uh sounds like there  need there there should be a call for how we   um how we communicate this to influence the  results of this work to influence health policy hi this is jackie um just um adding  on to what rita just said i think   that it definitely takes a multi-disciplinary  approach definitely nurses are well poised to   lead you know investigations looking at  social environment and genomic responses   for health outcomes but also social  scientists and historians um i think are very   um influential in this area social scientists  to look at um some of the factors that we've   all talked about throughout the discussions  today such as racism discrimination how those   social factors affect health outcomes and  then also historians to look at things like   how these these structures in the united states  and other places such as structural racism how   that affects our health and our well-being and how  history can repeat itself i mean looking at some   of the social um influences today with you know  with the protests and then also with a pandemic   happening at the same time same time but then also  looking at the past of what happened during the   flu epidemic um in 1918 so just looking at um  across disciplines but maybe um even looking uh   outside of what we are what we are accustomed to  of health sciences but looking at social sciences   historians um people that study african  american history um and other types of history this is betsy corbin i also think ephesus i don't  know if anybody's mentioned that but someone to   pull it together in an ethical way and  also i think the time is getting nearer   that we really have to work hand in hand more  with clinicians to help to make sure that   these early indicators of clinics or acute  stress and different risk factors are   brought to the intentions before brought to the  attention before adverse outcomes and health   patterns are established and we think presenting  our work more i know in nursing we often do   have collaborators right there but you know  with the middle from my work the midwives   and really reaching out to these  other populations of clinicians   betsy i missed the last part of what  you said and i i'm not sure you said   i would to but to that i would also add we need  the we need the voice of the people we're trying   to help absolutely in our in in our research and  i'm this is not something i've been particularly   great at over the years but i do think it's an  important aspect of work as it goes forward to   tell us what's important to people people  need to tell us what's important for us to   be working on to help them absolutely we need to  find out the perspective of the people living it i think another this is mary francis that  i'm struck by you know in the course of this   pandemic i suddenly have all this  contact with our county government   um so in dealing with providing mental health care  for healthcare workers who are on front lines and   doing contact racing because i have access to  undergrads and all sorts of things and it's really   struck me i have a colleague several colleagues in  germany and when they make presentations like this   they always invite local health officials um  so at county levels at city levels um in in   health policy but you know in the sort of civic  government kind of aspect of a public policy and   and they've asked me before why  don't you ever do this and and i   thought well it's just cultural but then i  thought well it's not that they can't be invited   um it's just not a way we're used to thinking  about inclusion in an in an audience of this type another thing this is jackie  taylor again another thing that   i think that we should be mindful of  as we do research particularly in this   era area and with underserved populations  is not just you know looking for people to to just give us information or to help us but i  think our impetus should be to include not just   include people but to look towards equity to have  members of the community or the people that were   studying as part of the research team not just  a part of the people that we study and then also   have them participate with us all the way through  so that we are looking at the needs of this   community not just for the research needs of our  um of our research question what are the things   that they are interested in and how can how can we  best help those communities and not the other way around kathy can i jump in thanks you've uh um  in addition to uh um multiple disciplines history   anthropology rhetoric talking about listening  to other people you've also been mentioning   principles of community engaged research  and and or the more formal community based   research model and um i i think that would  fit very nicely into your toolbox whether it's   working with a forgive the um clinical phrase  target population to determine what their   the health problem that they're most concerned  about and work toward resolving that but also just   simply beginning to practice that mary  francis mentioned of inviting members of   of health departments and other perhaps  lay communities to these presentations   because you know the topics are you know  how do we identify these cohorts uh um   what sorts of tools and disciplines uh um will you  need and and what are how do we prioritize these   social environmental factors yes you all have a  lot of data that lead to specific conclusions but   involving those additional communities you've just  mentioned both in the present and in the past over   time through uh um african american studies or  the history of public health uh um i think you've   really coming in on uh on a an interdisciplinary  toolbox to move the field forward really nice work something else i i i would uh want would like  to get your opinion on is is the need for um multi-institutional research or in which to  help ensure the diversity that i think is needed   in samples to really answer these questions um  i think that's can be a challenge for some and   and um and so um i would like to see more of that  so that we we do have the diversity that we need   in our samples to to answer some of these i guess i haven't oh go ahead sorry no it's  all right i guess i have a thought on that   i've done some community participatory  research and um my experience is that   those relationships take a long time to build  for good reasons um and i also have you know   multi-institutional relationships and and those  take a lot of attention as well but i think that   in some ways it can be that if you want to to  work with a particular population then sort of be   think global but act local makes a lot of sense so  maybe you can have multiple institutions that have   that relationship in their own community although  that sounds like a pretty tall order to me   but i think in many ways it is how  do you find the diverse population   within where you live um so that that type  of diversity might look different than what   it does in a in another part of the country but i  suspect that almost everywhere there is a type of   social determinants of health under served  populations etc that can be partnered with   yeah and this is jackie taylor again i i  absolutely agree with what uh mary frances   just said and i think that when we look at genomic  studies and social environment studies it's always   a great idea to partner with our with other  institutions and other geographic areas for   example you know university of michigan has  a program for research on black americans   you have the jackson heart study in mississippi  and then now here in new york we have the um   center for research on people of color so i think  you know by you know um combining our resources   and working together it can only enhance  the work that needs to be done in this area is there a need for the development of tools  to help us capture um to help us capture   some of the outcomes um that that we need to  look at as well as um some of the to accurately   capture some of the predictors that were  that need to be looked at in this area jackie again yes definitely there are  tools that are needed to study we have   um psychosocial measures that we currently  have in existence that have been tested on   certain populations and that have a reasonable  reliability and validity however if we think about   things like covet right now there are tools  that need to be developed on how people are   particularly minority populations are being  treated um with covet since they have these   health disparities what does this mean for um  future health outcomes um after the fact and how what does this mean for  social genomics and covet i might take a a different approach  to your question and talk about what i   think would be helpful in terms of related  outcome measures with social genomics um   i particularly like to see longitudinal work that  includes molecular aging markers and some have   already addressed telomere link dna  methylation and then there's a newer   one that we've been interested in i just started  playing with uh p16 a marker of cell senescence   because part of the idea would be if we want  to see outcomes associated with the differences   that might be one way to do it  longitudinally in a broad kind of framework teresa cruz typed in a question uh she wondered  if data sharing would data sharing policies in   current practices help address this need to bridge  institutions and build larger more diverse cohorts   uh this is jackie taylor um there there are  currently data sharing um mechanisms in place   like dbgap um we also have the onsen group  um that's a part of not only data sharing but   sharing of resources and information on studies  that have been funded by ninr but yes i do think   that there needs to be something in place in  terms of maybe looking at data coordinating   centers um for certain studies maybe for studies  that in social genomics you know across you know   various institutes i think that may be something  that you know would be very beneficial because   as of right now there are data coordinating  centers for large genomic studies but a lot   of times they don't include the social factors  that we're looking at here so if we had a data   coordinating center for social genomics i think  that would be extremely helpful thank you i was   assuming that the genomic part was covered  quite well through nih policy over the long   last 10 15 years but i wasn't sure that the  social part um that goes with it had been   connected so that's helpful um and and i just  want to point out since there's been so many   um discussions about covid and health disparities  that there is a major program right now um   called rad x up underrepresented populations  um and there is significant funding   available for um community-based diagnostics uh  and and um development um uh stubby social ethical   uh behavioral research um that many of you  might be interested in uh to uh increase uh cova   diagnostics in these populations so i just want to  point that out thank you you mentioned that teresa   i i'll just jump it add on to say that that does  include a data coordinating center a big one yes and sort of to that same discussion i think dennis  has taken big steps in the last several five   years or so four years to institute common data  elements into this all the studies funded by mino   that allows these um questions to be addressed  across populations if the data if especially   the socioeconomic socio-demographic data is  consistent um coded consistently if the data   dictionaries are the same can ask bigger questions  with more people and in regard to the to the new   announcements about covid it comes up there  too because uh one of the announcements i   think it's the 21 but it could be i think it's  the 21 is the last numbers on it um it's for   center grants and so ninr centers are set up now  within um the center cohorts you know the center   studies the p20 p 30s to ask some of these  big questions across populations and it was   the foresight i think of having these common  data elements be required that now that ability   to merge studies across five different p20  p30 centers gives us a lot more information   potential to gather information about co-bed  but other conditions as well so you know   i think that's been a real plus that indiana  instituted to require the common data elements   so this is lois tully i just wanted to follow up  on something jackie said she mentioned onsen um if   you're unfamiliar with that please feel free  to contact me it's the omics nursing science   and education network uh it was developed in  conjunction with nhgri and nci it's a web resource   and uh it's open to all it's not just for nurses  uh but we encourage nurse scientists and others   to take advantage of it so it's a place where  you can um find resources to help establish a   collaboration with another scientist to advance  omics research on a variety of topics it's   a place to get the word out about predox and  post-docs positions if you want to be a mentor   you can um go on to the onsen website and and  complete some information get the word out there   and there is a section on  cdes also so i just wanted to   put a plug in for that and kind of  follow up on what jackie said thank you hi this is fasil do you hear me well yes sorry  my internet is too poor to display my video so   i'm from nic hd so i just wanted to comment about  tools needed to further social genomics research   in the future also in relation with data sharing  i think uh we are talking about diverse state of   social environmental data from different sources  so combining all this together we need a different   approach in addition to the statistical uh ways we  treat data currently like artificial intelligence   machine learning also integrative genomics where  we bring together methylation expressions oil   microbiome and other datasets  together and learn from the data   and add the social environmental factors  together so i think scientific disciplines that   uh take advantage of artificial intel intelligence  will be an important resource to learn from and   incorporating studies of social genomics in  the future i just wanted to highlight that hi this is teresa jones from niddk  and i had uh this kind of a general   question i i found this workshop to be  fascinating really exciting research   and this kind of broad but do you think that  uh the biggest need is to be able to confirm   uh the current findings in in larger data larger  cohorts or different cohorts different diseases   more kind of a translational  end or do you think there's um   maybe a bigger need in understanding some of the  the pathways that are involved that that lead to   these changes in gene expression or telomere  length or you know you know the microbiome   so you know is it kind of uh you know do we  do we still need some good basic science or   are we really at a point where you think the  key is going with translational studies thanks this is betsy corbin i'm sorry my  video is not working anymore but   um you know i think for the microbiome there's  still a lot of standardization that needs to be   made clear you know how decisions are made  throughout the collection process but also   also in regard to the analyses plans they can  vary you know which programs are followed and   how do you choose which what number of reads to  require now just so many decision points that i   don't think are quite hammered out yet so there's  still some basic science in that area for sure this is rita i i agree with that as well  although i i have to say that the understanding   the mechanisms is you know really important how do  does how does telomere length interact with health   is it is it only a biomarker or is because  the telomeres themselves are shortening   is is that contributing to the adverse health  effects i don't think we know that so you know we   do need more studies my concern is that as long as  we're doing them in a cross-sectional way we don't   necessarily we can't tease that out unless we're  also adding other kinds of measures in order to   help us sort out what might be going on  so while i agree that we don't really   you know we we need more um precision  i think in how we're actually measuring   whatever it is we're measuring but we  i'm hoping we're also thinking about   so what does this how does this really work that's  i think is kind of the question that needs to be   addressed really important that's absolutely the  bottom line in order to really um either both   identify but certainly to target and  intervene we need to understand the   mechanisms and to evaluate you have to see if what  you're saying you are working on really produces   shows it by looking at the mechanism is the  mechanism affected by your intervention or not   so yeah i think that we need it across the board  we need strong metrics rigorous research and also   evaluation of the outcomes based on the predictor  mechanisms and what the mechanisms really are thanks this is bill again tagging on to  that do you think that there are   areas of research that are  sufficiently developed that   uh um could move the science forward uh um  with some mechanistic in translating some   known knowns along with more  basic research for discovering   for example you know it the chicken or the egg  with the telomeres you know we we don't know   exactly when and we know they're involved with the  aging process but we don't know where it starts   uh um is there some translational research  we could be doing with additional subjects   that would also allow us to make some progress  in the foundational work that still needs to be done well there are interventions so  betsy corbin there are interventions   that um are looked at in light of  length following the change over time   and there's a few um you know let's  discuss this but there's a few behavioral interventions or behaviors that  can affect or slow down telomere   shortening and so some of those i think  are being done looking at the mechanisms   by which the interventions say something like  exercise might reduce telomere shortening   among people is that what you're getting at  there bill um yes ma'am but i don't i didn't   mean to pick only on and telomeres  it it also could have been on uh um well we certainly could include that it could  also go into any of the other settings and   and groups we've talked about today so  for example uh uh um moving forward on   uh on vaginal health with women  in a larger cohort or in uh um in   more social intervention work uh  including the the omics measures as well   is there room for that if you're trying to  advance the if if we're trying to advance social   genomic research that eventually leads into  improved care prevention practices etc uh um can we add these is there room in   research for a research project that i guess  does both to be press excuse me absolutely   yes it's time okay yes so this is great i agree  it's uh it is time i think we can do that i think   many of us have have incorporated um various  biological measures in intervention studies   um and i think that more of that will be helpful  as betsy points out there indeed are some healthy   behaviors that can be taught that will that seem  to be associated with less shortening of telomeres   for example there are certainly behaviors that i  think we think improve our microbiota and various   places in our body and and what what we need  is our what we need are studies that look at   the particular intervention in relation to those  things so yes we need to include all of those um   kinds of biological measures and honestly i think  this is something that as an ninr funded scientist   for most of my career that that the ninr has  encouraged us uh to do for many years and so um   many of my colleagues do this very thing in trying  to incorporate it as you know adding any sort of   biological markers exponentially increases the  cost of the work that you're trying to do and so   you do have to you know weigh all of that um out  but i think that that absolutely just as we need   longitudinal studies of the same measures over  time we also need to make sure that we have a   a a nice um array of both behavioral and  biological measures included in our work this is lois we have a funny announcement  out now i think just that topic omics guided   behavioral interventions for improved health  outcomes something to that effect so if anyone's   interested in knowing more about that please  feel free to contact me but i would agree i   mean that's where the field needs to go this  is lois again that last question on the list   uh do you think we covered that one well  enough or is there anything to add to that does everyone see the slide well you know at columbia dispensing  again at columbia we have a strong   lgbtq program and a center for lgbtq research  and so i would really emphasize that we have to   start looking at this growing population it's  always been a population but we're adding new   types of differences to our repertoire to really  look within this that's another socially this   marginalized group and it's understudied so  i think in terms of the question high risk   disease and or not necessarily high risk some are  some are patient populations that would benefit   really thinking about that group specifically  even unlikely um i think so saying good things   about the ninr cd ease uh that i think the choice  about sex or gender is very limiting you know and   nowadays some of my colleagues at columbia are  really extending the list of choice on sex or   gender and you know small things like that  would open up um interesting and you know new   knowledge related to the um the different  other populations as well but for example and and this is i would um add in lois and we've  we've heard from several of the speakers today   the intergenerational approach to looking  at disease risk and patient population   so you know is there intergenerational  risk what happens when we look at   pregnant women and then their offspring  and follow those children for some time   it seems to me that that's um those kinds  of studies to me are intriguing and they're   just by their very nature because it does give  us a a chance to see the whole development of   the the biological behavioral system difficult  to do i will acknowledge but i believe that we   need to focus on that kind of at least in part  on that aspect of of our life course pregnancy   through the next generation i think those  kinds of studies are desperately needed i would say that certainly probably across all  chronic diseases but but certainly in cancer   both in terms of risk for the disease but also  in those who have a diagnosis of cancer there is   a huge need for this kind of research who benefits  from treatment how they benefit from treatment and   so i i think there is a there is a big  need for this for this type of research   both from a biological as well  as a behavioral perspective   this is jackie taylor i i certainly believe that  um minority populations uh particularly those that   suffer from health disparities across all common  chronic illnesses such as hypertension diabetes   metabolic syndrome and the like would definitely  benefit from continued social genomics research   also you know populations i agree with rita that  we should start looking at across the lifespan   from birth to aging and determine what are some  of the risk factors early on so that we can   intervene and hopefully prevent or improve  health outcomes for these populations also it seems important to expand  the social context of where   people are in their lives for example neighborhood  factors are obviously important you know first off   whether there's trees you know terry richmond that  penn school of nursing has wonderful research and   just having trees and foliage and greenery and how  that impacts uh violence and you know so things   like that her neighborhood also um housing  projects i mean again in new york city it's   you can see where the um the coveted patients and  deaths locate and a lot of it has to do with this   just the social environmental factors  of many of us are our citizens hi this is facil um in terms of the live course  perspective i think uh thinking about pregnancy   birth and aging usually forget the male  partners i think it's also important to include   the male partners from both genomics biological  point of view because they don't in sperm   and but also because they contribute a lot to the  social environment during pregnancy as well as   childhood development and they'll be very  helpful to interpret what we learn from the   maternal environment by incorporating the  paternal factors and also to disentangle   epigenetic factors from genetic or  sequence variant contribution to   fetal development as well as the  context of the social environment this is lois i want to make sure that everyone has  the opportunity to weigh in if you haven't already   okay i'm looking in the chat box i'm not  seeing anything that we didn't discuss uh so if   there are no other comments or questions we  can we can move on to the closing remarks   um which i will make so i really  enjoyed spending the day with everyone   i thought was a wonderful workshop wonderful  opportunity to hear about so many different topics   you know address multiple omics and other  biological markers psychosocial stressors   and how these relate to health outcomes and that  was the goal of the workshop which i think we   achieved um it really drives home the point  of the importance of this biobehavioral   person-centered approach to improved health  outcomes and uh seems like the field is moving   relatively quickly i think that's in part  due to our ability to collect molecular data   quickly in a high-throughput way and i  think that helps uh move the field forward   but clearly from today there's still lots more  work to do and i think that fox today set the   stage of where the field can potentially  go so again i want to thank the speakers   the keynotes the moderators kathy and bill i  think you both did a fabulous job in keeping   the discussion going um and i also want  to again uh thank um and in our leadership   for supporting this workshop now nathan um  is there another slide that we wanted to show there you go so i just wanted  to make sure everybody is aware   of the boot camp artificial intelligence virtual  bootcamp in august registration opens july 1st   the ninr sponsors these boot camps each year i  think this is the first time it's virtual but   i think that uh being virtual they may be able to  accommodate more people and so uh i encourage you   to take a look at that um and yes with that any  unless anyone has something else they want to add   uh there you go uh thank you again  and um you know i look forward to uh   seeing future collaborations as some of you  met today for the first time and i hope that um   i think you've given us all you know a lot  to think about and uh i just thought it was   a great day so uh with that i guess we can  sign off we're a little ahead of schedule   but have a great rest of the day and look  forward to meeting you virtually or in person   in the future and thank you to everyone that's  on the videocast and my understanding is that   it will be archived so if anyone wants to go  back and look at it they'll be able to okay take care everyone thank you thank you  bye thanks so much yeah so much thank you oh you're so welcome it's a  lovely meeting thank you thank you
