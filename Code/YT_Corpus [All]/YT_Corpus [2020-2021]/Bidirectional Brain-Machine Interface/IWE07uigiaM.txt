 understand a word of that but that's my fault I don't know how many almost I mean a billion people speak Spanish and I don't that's my fault but I'm I'm very happy to be invited here and I'll be talking about psychological and sort of in and biobehavioral late effects of cancer in cancer treatments because that's what my research unit a lot of our research is focusing on and rather than just covering the whole area I will sort of focus on one example focusing on cancer related fatigue but I still think that even though my talk will focus on cancer related fatigue we'll cover some of the other areas that are correlated with this late effect just you might not know where OSes but it's the second-largest city in Denmark and we are situated where the red arrow is central region Denmark which is approximately 1.5 million people and OHS is a small city of 350,000 so our unit has existed in some form or other since 2000 was a very small research unit and it was sort of financed by the Danish Cancer Society but later on after a number of years we're sort of we became a permanent sort of research unit associated with the department of oncology and also the department of psychology so it's a sort of interdisciplinary research unit and I don't always have the right number but I think we are sort of 17 18 19 staff at the moment and and everybody is more or less focused on teaching and and research a lot of our research is focused on cancer but there's also other health psychological research going on at our unit some of our people been interested in fertility issues others have been working on dermatological diseases like psoriasis in mainly but but most of our research is focused on on cancer and our mission is that's to produce scientific evidence about these two psychological and social consequences of disease and treatment in general but with specific emphasis on cancer and also a large part of our work is to develop and to evaluate approaches and interventions aiming it sort of minimizing these costs associated with illness and treatment and then in general our I mean our task is to contribute to the development of a more interdisciplinary perspective in in health so that's our unit I'm also involved in a very recently established center national Danish center called the Danish breast cancer group centre and clinic for late effects and what we're doing and our mission is to develop sort of an app or sort of a program for collecting patient reported outcomes mainly focusing on the late effects in all women in Denmark treated for breast cancer and we'll be collecting data throughout their treatment and sort of survivorship trajectory so and all these data will be sort of collected and subjected to artificial intelligence to machine learning that's the the the aim so we'll try to be able to identify who will who will be at risk of developing these light effects so we can intervene earlier that's the idea and then this knowledge will sort of will signal sort of staff at the various alcohol oncology departments around the Denmark about that this patient for instance has significant fatigue so and then we'll sort of the idea is to provide hospitals with treatment options so that's a long-term perspective but we're still working on on this app we are sort of testing a beta version at the moment right so we have a number of projects research projects focusing on symptoms and late effects and some of our projects have been focusing on cancer related distress both depression anxiety and in in specific we've been focusing on fear of cancer recurrence both how can we assess fear of cancer recurrence and how can we intervene and we've been collaborating with psychologists and psychologists in Sydney who have been developing developed and an intervention for fear of cancer recurrence sort of a third wave act based intervention and right now we're sort of transforming it into a group based intervention in collaboration with with Sydney we have some a number of projects that have focused on pain both the prevalence of pain especially in in breast cancer looking at what aren't really the mechanisms because not everybody develops pain some patients develop pain some develop of neuropathic pain others don't and their treatments are not sufficient predictors I mean there are other factors as well that might be psychological predictors and so forth and we've been trying to tease those apart and then we've been testing a psychological intervention mindfulness based cognitive therapy for pain and have sort of you know reasonable effects and now we are sort of engaged in the task of implementing that intervention into the hospital and that's a bit uphill because there's cuts all the time sort of so resources it's always a question of resources but hopefully we can implement it as something that can be offered to all cancer patients and in you know who's a group of us are very interested in cognitive impairment following cancer treatments and the old days it was called well that's chemo brain or chemo fog but as it turns out it's it might to some degree be associated with chemotherapy but it's also associated with a number of other factors so right now we have intervention we have studies looking at how hormones like testosterone how that will affect or predict cognitive impairment in in men with treated for prostate cancer and testicular cancer we are looking at different genetic sort of variations like a pro e4 which is a genetics or risk factor for dementia and how does that sort of work in the cancer setting well it seems that if you have that genetic variation you'll be much much more vulnerable when receiving chemotherapy in terms of cognitive impairment and then we have a number of projects focusing on sleep and fatigue and I'll talk more about that now but just in general I think you probably all know that you know cancer and cancer treatments have a lot of consequences for for patients and and not only patients in fact but also caregivers we have projects looking at caregivers as well and because caregivers are distressed caregivers have higher morbidity hi immortality so we actually just completed a study focusing on helping cancer caregivers informal caregivers and we'll have well have published just recently but all these different sort of sort of challenges associated with cancer and cancer treatments they're both psychological sort of general sort of consequences there are the consequences directly or more or less directly associated with the toxicity of the treatments and then there are some some of these symptoms and late effects that are associated with the disease itself because cancer also has a number of consequences so when you have a cancer patient or cancer survivor who's fatigued I mean a part of that fatigue could be related to the cancer itself part of that fatigue could be related to the treatment and so forth so all these factors affect the quality of life of patients they affect also the their ability to return to work and that's of course of general interest in for society right now we have a PhD project looking at you know what really predicts are the ability to return to work of cancer patients we are looking at the self efficacy of return to work we are looking at physical activity is physical activity a predictor of the ability to return to work and it might be so that could be an argument for sort of supporting patients with our sort of physical training physical exercise interventions anyway okay but so there's no doubt that Penn's cancer patients and cancer survivors of those who have completed treatment experienced a lot of sort of different symptoms and late effects and when you look at the literature it's really varied I mean in some in some groups you will see almost no late effects of symptoms in some groups you will see really reported really high prevalences so there's a huge variation and we still really do not know exactly what the prevalence is at what time four different cancers and cancer treatments but but these are some of the numbers and so what I'll be doing now is try to talk about some of the main sort of consequences of cancer treatments and cancer and how they relate to each other so I think what is really important when we're looking at this is that all the different cancer related symptoms and late effects they appear in correlated clusters so when a patient experiences for instance pain on they are also more likely to experience depression when you have sleep problems you are more likely to be fatigued if you have pain you may be more likely to have sleep problems when you have sleep problems you are more vulnerable in terms of anxiety fear of cancer recurrence and if you have sort of chronic sleep problems you will you will be more likely to develop cognitive impairment and so forth so these are correlated but if you look at the research most studies look at one symptom at a time and do not really take all this correlation into consideration so but in recent recently there's been research into it focused on on clusters and there are sort of various clusters that have been identified this this latter of this figure that's um it shows of the network graphic of how different symptoms that patients talk about right about in on sort of on social media platforms about cancer how they're correlated so if you have a write about chat about fatigue then you're also more likely to chat about sort of cognitive problems and so forth so that's just one example of trying to to identify some of these clusters and what's important is that many of these associations are likely to be bi-directional so if you have sleep problems you will have pain that will increase a pain but pain will induce sleep problems and so forth and what really seems to be behind is a common factor here is inflammation so it seems many of these symptoms seem to be driven by what is termed sickness behavior and I'll return to that because what we know today is that the brains a central nervous system and the immune system are closely related they there's bi-directional communication between these systems continuously and there's both sort of more dry hardwire connections between the brain and the immune system and various immune related organs but also there are sort of more humoral sort of communication paths as through various sort of cytokines and and neuropeptides so there are receptors in both systems enabling sort of communication between the brain and the immune system so we both have sort of top-down associations and over the last maybe 25 years or so 30 years or so we know that factors such as stress depression sleep disturbances will affect various systems in in the body the sympathetic nervous system and we'll sort of release stress hormones these stress hormones will affect the immune system and perhaps lead to immune suppression sort of suppressing the cellular immune responses the adaptive immune response increasing the risk for our susceptibility to to infections and and cancers for instance but at the same time you will see activation in the immune system in terms of a higher level of various pro-inflammatory cytokines and these cytokines high levels of these cytokines are correlated and predict the development of cardiovascular diseases autoimmune diseases a wide sort of array of inflammatory diseases including cancer and also sort of depression and what is called sort of sickness behavior so but of course it's moderated by a number of factors it depends on genetics it depends on age and and so forth right but there's also bottom-up sort of associations and and one example of a bottom-up Association is the term is the concept of sickness behavior and what is sickness behavior well is it's an evolutionary conserved sort of bio behavioral syndrome induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines it could be like aisle one aisle six tnf-alpha so the common sort of cytokines of usual suspects so to say released by activated immune cells and when these cytokines are released are they pass the blood-brain barrier and they induce a production of additional cytokines in the brain and these cytokines will then induce what one could term a motivational state that promotes adaptive responses during infection that's you know that's the evolutionary part of this so it induces fatigue muscle pain reduced appetite fever and depressed mood and that is an adaptive sort of condition adaptive state especially I mean if you have a disease or infection you shouldn't be running around hunting for food you should you know rest and conserve energy you should withdraw from the rest of of your tribe so as not to infect them and so forth and so forth but the interesting part is that these various symptoms that are induced by the immune system and are generally adaptive we see them also as cancer and cancer treatment related symptoms they're very very similar so these are some of the same mechanisms and that's really interesting another important factor is that when you look at the research a lot of research is cross-sectional and you will see maybe even in large studies you will see that they've with questionnaires have measured maybe depression sort of in a thousand patients but all these patients will be at different time points in the disease trajectory so what is really important is that how these symptoms really relate to each other they may change over the treatment trajectory and this is an example from a study where we see how they are correlated at different time points during the cancer treatment so in principle I mean here's like the possibilities when we look at data but we're usually see published the means and the standard deviations so across a whole group but that might not make sense really because behind that mean might be very different trajectories the blue one top blue one for example could be I mean some patients could be having high levels of symptoms from the very start and continue to have so throughout their treatment and the bottom some people may have very few symptoms and continue to have the few symptoms throughout the treatment some will start low and go high some will start high and improve and if you just take an average you will end up with theoretically the gray line saying okay nothing happens here but behind there are differential debt trajectory x' here's just one example of a trajectory analysis sort of following looking at mental health over a four to fifty-five month sort of trajectory in after a breast cancer so that's another major point we should look at different trajectories in different patients because one size doesn't fit all right are you with me cool but good good good good it's good to to get feedback and just you know check you know maybe I was just way off sure sure sure okay well and here's another model and you might know this model when when you when we try to figure out how does certain symptoms go from being acute to becoming chronic or persistent I really don't like the word chronic because that seems so deterministic but say persistent symptoms at least and this model says that if you have a certain people will have different predispositions to develop various symptoms and I'll return to this model when I'm talking about sleep problems in a moment and but also and then some precipitating sort of situation a factor will induce the symptom to a high level to a clinical level and then over time when this problem sort of disappears then for most people they will go back to their sort of normal state but in some patients are these symptoms will be perpetuated they will be sort of strengthened and maintained by various factors so what we really need to do when we are looking to treat these various symptoms we need to look at not only the predisposing factors but also the perpetuating factors and attack those and target those in our treatment so what I will look at now is fatigue as an example and and there's no doubt that among cancer patients and cancer survivors cancer related fatigue is is very prevalent it's also among the most distressing aside and light effects this is something that patients really complain about that if they could sort of get rid of one of their symptoms then it would be the fatigue and up to 70 to 90 percent of cancer patients experience fatigue during chemo or radiotherapy and what's really distressing is that even years after completed treatment many patients continue to experience a fatigue right so here again if we use this model and look at fatigue we can look at their precipitating factors these are the cancer diagnosis and treatment there's some predisposing factors as shown in the literature like childhood adversity if you have a history of depression if you have trade anxiety and and so forth and if you have certain sort of genetic variations that will sort of predispose you to develop fatigue or cancer related fatigue then there are these perpetuating the maintaining factors so once you have developed fatigue what sort of keeps the fatigue sort of even after you have completed your treatment well one factor could be coping mechanisms like negative coping mechanisms such as catastrophizing so if you think in a negative catastrophizing sort of cognitive way about your fatigue that will be a predictor of developing persistent fatigue loneliness sleep disturbances physical inactivity is also a main factor so if you're very fatigued you become less physical active and when you're less physical active you become more fatigued so you have sort of an evil circle that we need to break but also inflammation and viral infections and generally cellular aging how the cancer in stress and distress affects our sort of basic DNA and how our mitochondria works are some possible mechanisms right so so we're maybe if we should treat sort of fatigue how could we what should we do so we could target some of the other symptoms in this sort of cluster and one possible intervention could be like the sleep disturbance for instance what happens if we if we look at these patients with fatigue and sleep disturbances what if we target their sleep disturbances what how will that affect their fatigue or even their depression and so forth so and we know from studies that poor sleep has been prospectively associated both with increased pain it's been and treating sleep disturbances have been shown in chronic pain patients not only to reduce their sleep disturbances but also their fatigue and their pain which is which is interesting so the whole idea is that if you target one sort of core symptom it will have positive effects in other symptoms yes so let's look at some of the mechanisms involved here let's look at are the circadian system and and and look at sleep but because generally what regulates our sleep is what is called the dual process model as you may know there so sleep is regulated by the balance between homeostatic sort of sleep drive mechanism and the circadian processes and so it's this balance that sort of determines the degree to which we have sleep disturbances or even sort of circadian disturbances the homeostatic sleep pressure is increased as soon as we wake up in the morning we produce adenosine which is a hormone that sort of that's released when we when we are awake and broken down during sleep and has adenosine levels sort of grow then we become more and more tired but at the same time we have sort of waking mechanisms that keep us awake during the daytime but then at nighttime are driven by the the light of most other things melatonin will be released and that will sort of induce sleepiness and and in that way we can sort of maintain also sleep during the night even when the sleep pressure is is lowered the melatonin keeps us asleep during the night so that's sort of the basic sort of sleep regulating mechanism if we want to sort of check and measure or assess our circadian activity and patients are there that has been developed a number of sort of a tigress assessments and you can see here's an example the top example is is an example of a probably circadian well structured person a well organized person and below you see a more sort of dysregulated pattern and that can be sort of assist with these actor graphs and and various are sort of algorithms okay what about circadian disruption and sleep and inflammation and fatigue how do they really relate to each other and I'll just briefly present some some results here we know there's sort of communication between the cancer cells and the central nervous system we know that both tumors and the tumor associated macrophages the activate an inflammatory cytokine network so when you have cancer you have more inflammation and when you have more inflammation you will be more fatigued and you will also have be more depressed so there's an association by just having cancer and being depressed so that's a biological mechanism inducing fatigue and depression in addition probably to the more mental psychological processes as well also we have the HPA axis which is the axis responsible for our stress responses as well and it works as negative feedback mechanisms for various inflammatory processes I mean we need an intact valve regulated HPA axis in order to sort of curb our inflammatory responses and when we have dysregulated HPA axis we get chronic inflammation that influences sort of melatonin our production of melatonin and so the diurnal rhythm is is an indicator of HPA accurate access competence and when people are fatigued or fatigued cancer survivors we know when we look at how how they produce their cortisol when we look at their cortisol sort of diurnal sort of patterns they appear to be disrupted right and when we look at sleep disturbances we find that cancer patients may both have sleep disturbances before surgery and after treatment and during treatment and but when they improve and sleep we see that this is associated with reduced inflammation and when we have elevated nocturnal cortisol we see higher levels of fatigue poor performance data status more depression for a well being and so forth so there are all these sort of associations between sleep or circadian disruption cortisol the inflammation this all sort of works together okay let's move on and look at sleep sort of in general it's estimated that 10 to 20 percent of the general population will experience at least in the Western world will experience some level of insomnia and six to ten percent meet sort of the diagnostic criteria but when we then look at cancer patient there's not that much research but the research there is suggest that cancer survivors are two to three times more likely to to have insomnia and here's some some data from breast cancer lung cancer head and neck cancer it seems by the way that prostate cancer patients seem to have fewer problems in general they they they complain less than many of the other cancer groups that could other factors could be at play here too but let's look at if what do we know from the literature and the research about insomnia and its consequences well we know that insomnia sleep problems sleep disturbances will affect a lot of physiological systems we know for instance that we'll see activation of the sympathetic nervous system we see higher more release of catecholamines cortisol will see a ghrelin which is sort of the hunger hormone levels there will be elevated so people have more appetite they're more hungry they consume more food we'll see increased inflammation and more increased oxidative stress and also we see suppressed parasympathetic sort of activity in the parasympathetic system we see decreased melatonin production we see decreased leptin function function and leptin is the hormone that tells you that now you now you're safe you don't need to eat more and also it you'll see sort of decreased insulin sensitivity and you'll also see sort of this regulation of of others or important aspects of the immune system this will lead short-term to fatigue pain depression stress cognition problems and in the long run this could develop into cardiovascular diseases obesity not the least cancer type 2 diabetes and increased mortality so there's a lot of interest in sleep and its potential sort of health consequences right so let's look at at sleep how should we think about sleep in terms of I mean everybody experiences sleep problems from time to other I think approximately 95% of the population has at some time had difficulty falling asleep or been waking up at night and having difficulty falling asleep again and so forth but most people sort of get over it and and but some people seem to develop chronic or sort of persistent sleep disturbances and let's let's look at this model again we have the predisposing the precipitating and the perpetuating factors and here's some what we know from from from research people who are sort of more anxious have a tendency to ruminate to worry they have they are more sort of likely to develop sleep sort of to develop sort of persistent sleep problems people who are a sort of sort of hyper aroused easily hyper aroused and people who have late chronotype sort of the the night owl people and people who have cancer I mean these are some of the physiological sort of predisposing factors purposely problems if we look at their precipitating of course periods with stress and anxiety that will keep people awake of course because when you're anxious when you're afraid when there's a threat you shouldn't sleep you should be aware right so that's stress keeps us awake and physically I mean pain and and we know hormone therapy will you know induce hot flashes and and will sort of will be factors that can increase li problems but then the they're perpetuating the maintaining factors we know from research that once people have devolved easily problems some people will develop maladaptive beliefs they will start to catastrophize about their sleep saying if I don't get at least eight hours of sleep I will you know I will die I'll be sick I won't be able to function at all tomorrow and I won't close an eye tonight when I go to bed I will be completely unable to sleep that kind of sort of catastrophizing that's really not helpful that's a sort of very sort of serious perpetuating factor all this sort of affects people's attention they'll be selectively attending everything that has was to do with sleep and that will make it harder to sleep they will start to develop various safety behaviors like napping in the afternoon maybe several times that is not very helpful because that relieves the sleep pressure they will start to go back to bed very early so they can get as many hours in bed as possible hoping that they will sleep more that's not the case so that's not a very good behavior either and then fear recurrence cancer recurrence depressive symptoms are all sort of factors that give people something to worry about and will make that harder for them to sleep and if they'll be aroused by all these stressful thoughts and these are the the maintaining factors so the treatments should target these maintaining factors what do we know about the consequences well we know that when when people have insomnia they have reduced emotion regular regular flexibility I'm it's probably due to that the sleepless problem sort of affect our frontal prefrontal structures that will sort of make it less easy for us to control our sort of sort of urges so we'll be less flexible in our emotion regulation and we have higher levels of fear of cancer recurrence we see that's been shown in research in some days is a prospective predictor of depressive symptoms and breast cancer survivors so if you have depressive if you have insomnia then you will have a higher levels of inflammation that will induce and maintain depression over time and we know that pain affects sleep but insomnia is in itself a prospective predictor of worsening of chronic pain so actually it seems that sleep is probably is a better predictor of pain than pain is a predictor of sleep at least in the studies we have so far and and and and in fatigue we have sort of perpetuating dynamics so you have cancer and treatment will lead to fatigue that will reduce physical activity that will alter sleep patterns that will increase fatigue and so forth so we have some some very negative dynamics being produced here and cognitive impairment we know from from studies that insomnia in breast cancer survivors is associated with poor executive function and and verbal memory and there's no doubt that these factors will also affect health behaviors so when you have sort of sleep problems if you have insufficient sleep then your sort of executive function will diminished that will make it harder to maintain sort of sort of healthy health behaviors like avoiding fatty foods and so forth so and it seems it's still more difficult to stop smoking when you have insomnia because again you have difficulty sort of regulating your emotions your stress you have poor executive function that will make it more difficult right so and but again these directions are bi-directional and finally how can we intervene well I mean so we have the sleep we have sleep problems we have the circadian disruption we have the fatigue so in general tiredness and fatigue differ and usually just one good night's sleep generally does not you know relieve cancer related fatigue but I've said targeting some of these aspects could be helpful so let's see well how could we if we target sleep for instance could we use sleep medication is that a good idea well no really not it could be for one night sort of limited use of sleep medication is okay but longtime use is has limited efficacy it's not curative tolerance P patients develop tolerance dependence and various side effects and also a longtime use of sleep medication is associated with cognitive impairment and has even been associated with mortality as you can see from from this example here so it is really not recommended for long-term use so what should we do well another approach if we want to target for instance are the the circadian sort of aspect of this then light therapy could be an option we know that light is the central site giver regulating their circadian rhythmicity we know that these Pro inflammatory mediators they're sort of associated with melatonin production so when you have acute inflammation then melatonin is suppressed so if we could sort of counter this effect on melatonin that would be interesting and we know from other research that life therapy has been known to alleviate seasonal affective disorder and so given the associations between circadian regulation inflammation fatigue in cancer then it might also alleviate cats related fatigue here are sort of three studies I mean that very few studies so far we also have one study we're right on the verge of publishing it but here are three studies that seem promising there's one study showing that bright white light would buffer the development of fatigue in women undergoing chemotherapy so those who had bright light therapy during chemotherapy they they sort of maintain a certain level of fatigue but those who did not haven't had an increase in fatigue here's another study of chronically fatigued survivors of mixed cancers had sort of a very large effect of a bright white light compared to a placebo of dim red light and here we have a Canadian study which the effects are not really that great in the third study and there's a Dutch study that has been published recently I think where the effects are not really great either but you know we never know it seems promising but what about behavioral sleep interventions well we know that a lot of sort of non pharmacological interventions have been developed over the years we know relaxation in itself has some effect on insomnia we know that our sleep restriction where you tell people you know to change their sleep habits to for instance if you sleep six hours but spend ten hours in bed you have a sleep efficiency of 60% then you tell people to go four hours later to bed that means they become very tired they have trouble keeping awake but and that's sort of a different problem than trying to fall asleep right and then when the you know finally are allowed to go to bed they fall asleep faster and maintain their sleep better and then they can gradually sort of increase the number of minutes or hours in bed until they reach sort of the the sort of the desired number of hours so it's kind of resetting this whole sort of sleep pattern we know stimulus control is really telling people do not do anything that is associated with activity being awake and so forth in bed the only thing that is allowed in bed is sleeping and sex and that's it if you are awake more than 15 minutes you have to leave the bedroom and go into your to another room and read a book listen to music or something do not go to bed until you're sleepy again and then we have the whole sleep hygiene sort of education that really looks at all the factors that will influence sleep like stimulants caffeine and so forth and and you make sure that people tell people that they should be physically active and and so forth and so forth and finally there's the cognitive therapy aspect addressing all the maladaptive cognitions about sleep like the catastrophizing for instance and when you sort of group all these different approaches together it's usually called cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia and is this effective five minutes more oh shit sorry sorry here's I'm just collected sort of a number of meta-analysis here and in general when you look at the individual components you see that they are effective but even more effective when you look at them as combined CBT eyes and what is interesting is it's not only effective in patients who have insomnia as a primary problem but also in patients with comorbid insomnia so if you have chronic pain and insomnia it works if you have cancer and insomnia it works and finally also I'll just talk a bit about the problem here because while cbt-i is recommended as first choice there's a huge challenge meeting the needs there's a limited availability of trained therapists there are costs associated with face-to-face therapy and there's limited accessibility so one approach could be to provide this over the internet and first of all we looked at some years ago a couple years ago we looked at the different studies there were 11 studies like 2 years ago that looked at different internet delivered programs delivering cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia and we found some really really good effects these are huge effect sizes they're like very large effect sizes so we tried a program for women treated for breast cancer with insomnia and we used an American program called shut-eye at the time and we developed it into a Danish version and we we had a an RCT with 255 breast cancer survivors randomized to a waitlist or to this program which is a fully automated program there's no therapist involvement at all it's fully automated and it's based on feedback so you you you fill out a sleep Diaries and based on your sleep Diaries you're instructed to restrict your sleep and it addresses the cognitive issues and so forth and we find some really nice effects not only at post intervention but also at follow-up and what is really interesting in this in this instance is that it also we also measured cancer related fatigue in these women and had really nice effects really prominent effects on on fatigue finally there's exercise could one treat fatigue with exercise here's a meta-analysis of 72 studies looking at the effect of exercise on cancer related fatigue and it does suggest that there's some some some decent effects here it seems like a relevant intervention it also has effects on depression and there's also some effect on sleep disturbance so but what what types of exercises some exercise forms better than others well not really there are no differences between the different exercise types so in general it seems that you know regardless of delivery method and so forth there seems to be a good affair really some decent effects of exercise what about pharmacological interventions for fatigue well there aren't that many studies but there are some trials in cancer in and transplantation and Transplant studies looking for instance at Ipoh and there seems to be a nice effect of Ipoh but that of course relates to that you need to have sort of anemia or something like that they need to you need to have some certain problems that explain your fatigue so here's another study just looking generally at pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for fatigue cancer related fatigue and we see that exercise and psychological interventions have similar effects but the pharmacological effects sort of in general when you look across cancer ah seems to be relatively poor so this is my last slide so I think to take-home messages late effects of cancer and cancer treatments are really we need to look at them as clusters and inflammation is really sort of an underlying mechanism we need to be thinking about all the time and the late effect should be understood in terms of directories over time and and I think the model describing the biobehavioral sort of predisposing precipitating and perpetuating factors is a really good model for thinking about how to deal with late effects so targeting key symptoms may have positive effects and I think there's a really good argument for behavioral interventions as promising candidates yes that was what I had in mind today thank you so much Bobby and please if you have any question please expand your intent re-mose intra todos there are a conclusion isn't a chef a a Cinco minutos C 15 minutes for questions and I'll be available afterwards questions Leticia is coming ha t okay thank you so much it's a pleasure to hear to you and thank you so much for say today with us sorry because my English is not so try to make the question in English sure sure great you can't cure me oh yeah I understand you you come across clearly it's very interested conference and I think sometimes cognitive impairment and fatigue is present and when the patient have a central nervous system more than when the term is not very of the same time is judgment limitation patience Excel treat an hour with us all day fatigue attention this you in your experience do you think we can be now in a chain and we are chained treatments to attain the target we have now results and dates to talk about the new charger capital of intervation interface sorry target of treatments and we can take this take-home message now and in future late future change the treatments of quality patients yeah what I hear you're saying well first of all you mentioned of course that brain tumors will affect cognition and we do have some studies also looking at that but I was sort of talking about general sort of cognitive impairment not related to tumors but so in those studies we just exclude those patients but we have other studies we just started a proton sort of radiation Center in OHS and we're trying to compare the effects on sort of cognition broadly from the old radiation therapy and proton therapy to see if it sort of is will induce a fewer cognitive problems and it seems it will well anyway but what I hear you're saying is that we know a lot about effects of various interventions there's much to be learned I think there's a lot to be learned about how we can optimize our treatments so we can be more cost effective because I think cost-effectiveness is necessary for these interventions to be implemented in healthcare and that's the next big big big hurdle is how I mean knowing that a lot of these interventions actually work how can we make sure that they're implemented that patients actually who are in need are actually treated and that's a political question economical and political question and it needs pressure groups so and I don't think psychologists are necessarily the best pressure groups or most powerful pressure groups but cancer patients could be so I think we need to Alan you know align ourselves with the cancer patients and the cancer societies in Denmark the Danish Cancer Society's a pretty powerful organization and it has large influence on the politicians so yeah I think it's a political discussion yeah okay I hope I answered your question or comments in cognition my question is about the information how my question is why the light effects on cognition are related to inflammation it's because all of these factors that oh it's related also with the cancer yes yeah what you're saying is how much of it is related to the cancer as such and how much is related to other factors secondary factors and of course that's always not you know easy to tell apart but if we look at for instance we have have a large cohort of women a national court of women treated for breast cancer and we've been following these women for like almost 10 years and a lot of them still have fatigue or have some have cognitive problems not too many though but some have cognitive problems like 9 years 10 years after and then these are other factors right so you see some of these this inflammation for instance that's been induced during cancer it should actually drop when there's no cancer anymore right but other issues like sleep problems and obesity etc etc may contribute to maintain high levels of of inflammation so it might not necessarily be related directly to the cancer anymore but that be something that has been maintained over time so we've looked we did a meta-analysis recently where we looked at do psychotherapy does psychotherapy have any effect on inflammatory parameters and I how many studies I think I don't remember maybe 16 studies something like that and we looked at any study where they had measured pro-inflammatory cytokines and there was any type of psychological intervention and it could be for depression or whatever and we found some effect on CRP and which is a very general measure and some effect on aisle six which is correlated with CRP so there were small effects but they were statistically significant service I think that we should think of therapy also as something we should you know try to target inflammation there were there very few studies so we couldn't really do any sort of meta analysis of that parameter okay so thank you very much and now the closing remarks from our detectors dos minutos creo que es necesario
