 [Music] [Music] [Applause] welcome to the advanced power electronics and control today we will have an introductory sessions on it in the due course of time we shall discuss about the application of the control in the power electronics and its utilities so this is our course content we shall discuss today actually introduction of the course and what would be covered here in this content thereafter power electronics concepts why power electronics is one of the fundamental courses in electrical engineering and where its finest applications and what is this future scope and advantages then of course you know power electronics is it can be visualized as a few switches so first of course we have to take it out the power electronic switches you know the electronic switches and there will be a difference of the power electronic switches mainly based on the rating and the control then accordingly we have to go for selection of the switches depending on the various consideration in a particular applications or particular topology we have to choose a particular switch that selection of switching also will be learned here there are two classification of the switching and generic switching converter and we will discuss different kind of switches followed by a matrix converter that will be a bi-directional AC to AC converter now why power electronics problem of Electrical Engineering is that you require a variable voltage DC for our various applications unfortunately you do not have a DC transformer thus to get a different voltage level from a fixed DC voltage you require to have a power electronics utilities same way when you are actually running and AC motor or Drive it is a constant frequency operations so it will be run close to its synchronous speed depending on the pole and the frequency as long as a frequency is constant so machine will run to me at 2 this synchronous speed so it is not possible to have a variable speed operation in white within a white French with keeping the load torque constant and there also it finds a huge application for this is and you can see that actually it takes input for physics so all the devices wide bandgap devices now it is coming we shall see of course we require the input from the maths we record of inputs from the circuit theory we required inputs from the basic electronics we regard to taking inputs from the power system and control is a very important features of it and this route is quite strong and of course the computer applications and ultimately these are the symbols of the few power electronic switches and output of the applications will be the power quality the power quality issues come because of the power electronics and ultimately power quality deteriorated by use use of the power electronics only thereafter we will find solution in the power relations that is the beauty of it and also nowadays actually we have a distributed generation of the solar and the wind and the other things so renewable energy since you have a variable speed applications or a variable output voltage application Renault energy one of the application of the power electronics most of the energy consumed in the world around 70% of the energy consumed in the world electrical energy can even do the motor drive so here also it spines is huge applications because we require a variable speed motor drive for the different applications and also it is picking up and that is hybrid electric vehicles because of the pollution on all those things hybrid electric vehicle or normal electric vehicles both we'd find a huge application of the power electronics so these are the actually the basis or roots of the power electronics and these are the outcome of the power electronics and these are all advanced applications now toilet-cleaning essentially processes the image it is it does the cooking you have a raw power which your utility cannot take like raw vegetable we cannot take we have a raw power which we cannot take we require to process the power according to the order requirements and so that it can fit to the right kind of application and right kind of utility and gives us the desired results so what essentially it does it does efficiently it does fix ibly it gives a wide range of control and other variations typically it involves change of voltage and current or frequency or power and generally conversion we wish to achieve in an around 90 percent that is one of the biggest channels we have a non power electronic waste solutions their efficiency is mechanical square system their efficiency is quite low and it is quite slow in operation for this reason you know we required to see these aspects sustainability environmental footprint so you should have actually all the pollution to be controlled energy efficiency energy shaped is energy earned and available flexibility so that same machine can be operated in a different more different zone of operations you may not require multiple machines to do the different kind of job and the modern living that is we require modern living so and we are getting shortage of the energy so this is an quality of life comes into the picture that is greatly enhanced with the use of the power electronics so let us see the chronological advancement of the power electronics so it is not new Tesla and this actually famous debate on AC and DC transmissions and you know we unfortunately had our DC machines and we found that you know generations of AC is bettered and transmission distribution of AC is better because of this actually use of the transformer and thus we required to use because we produce IC and we consume DC to mismatch to actually to fit the gap initially we had mercury arc rectifier so we required to rectify it and feed it to the DC Lord or disobey Sheen's or DC light so gradually it has deceivers been phased out but in older Calcutta days actually we had DC connections for quite long time now this has a prolonged life span you know till actually 50 years this was the only sole process of converting a seed AC to DC but efficiency level was quite low and required a huge maintenance and thereafter so forth this is we are writing is a prehistory or it is a pre historical age for politics not of course for the human being though thereafter powered ID and thyristors were invented that is a huge jump in the technology and it was invented around 1957 so and that continued to middle of this actually 1970 and Paul electronics finds his application most of the AC to DC conversion thereafter we will fine you discuss little later that thyristor base types are basically hop control devices it's you can control its turn on but turn off it is not actually very easy we require a external circuit to turn it off so for the season actually we are looking for a full control devices and thus from the middle of the 70s and this is a actual research starts in power electronics and his application and his devices that was a middle of 70s there we had a different devices like GTO ba MOSFET thyristors and also digital control comes into the pictures and that actually reduces the basically the uncertainty issues of the analog control and so this is micro processors DSP all those things gradually incorporated now we have IGBT mosfet thyristors IG cities now we are going for the silicon carbide based devices so that will be the other fourth phase rather so and here we are using FPGA DSP and all those actually programming logic and thus control and the device go hand-in-hand to give a better quality of life now what are the challenges why we require to use challenge is we have to take a device which can handle more amount of the power in less volume so we talked about the power densities we want the megawatt level power handling capability for per per CC something like that and also highly reliable in extreme environmental conditions so we should see that you know it can be usable like you know we can use a Pau electronics device sub-saharan actually in Siberia or sub-saharan Africa so in Siberia it has to operate minus 50 degree centigrade in sub-saharan Africa and also it will heat up and temperature can go as high as 200 degree centigrade so within a whole range whether it is possible to operate if it is a military application that recalled more stringent condition if it is a space application that require more stringent conditions all those application power Tronics fights is play suitably and thereafter lower magnetic emissions this is one of the challenge nowadays actually what happened we have a EMI EMC problems that is called electromagnetic interference and integrity compatibility we will see that we will use actually huge we use twine lot of application of the electromagnetism and that will generate a considerable amount of electromagnetic noises that require to suppress because it will otherwise interface with the communication and also it is hazardous for the human being a life so we required to find it out that lower magnetic emission and we require to something like modular turnkey system it will be a compact you fit into them before a motor something a box of very small size and that will do everything that is the concept so focuses and modular turnkey systems we are looking for and higher level of integration many devices can be compacted in a single single entity and also lower cost throughout the life and we will have a large mean breakdown time these are the actually that's challenges that power electronic devices and devices required to achieve and that will be effectively controlled by a control system so see that this is a motivation of the power like training for the future researcher so this is the renewable energies avionics and high speed train like bullet trends and there actually we have a critical issues we have to harvest most of the power from renewable energy sources and also you require a very effective every ace and nowadays actually the people flies we expect that every 10 year the number of passenger is going to be doubled so I we required to make our sky more safer cheaper for added value to the system and power electronics required to do that and there lies a challenge same way we require to a fast transport system and the modern transport system there we will find a lot of applications of the power electronics and also we have a environmental Hirsch nish so you may have a actually thunderstorm we may have something one line has been collapsed so powered equal to submit so we can use the flexible AC transmission system to deal with that thing even if there is a damaged with on damaged line we can have for timing we can handle a huge amount of power so these are the actually the motivations where you can work and power electronics can give a very effective solution to this problem so from there we are gradually looking to the paradigm shift of the research so you have to do the since we are engineer we require to do the application Pacific research we will take a problem gradually we will never have a top-down approach and we will go to the devices so you'll see that in a courses will see that how we designer actually power election is converter or inverter and so so paradigms if falesha's hand woke up calculation there after it has to qualify different testing condition then only we have to find it a logic behind it and apart from that physics of failure and design and reliability this is something we require to test it we required to design a system that is quite reliable so we require to take the main breakdown time to some level that is also a challenge it is not that it is working today it required to walk another 10 years at least because if you talk about let us say solid state transformer on lifespan of the transformer is 40 years so same way we can expect when we talk about the solid stage transformer that transfer also lasts for the during this period that is a huge challenge and the huge scope of research for the future researcher for more reliable cost-effective power electronic system can those conditions now these are actually the devices of course today's 2018 and this data has been taken on 2015 so these are called high band gap devices high band gap devices can handle huge voltages and power so for this is you can see that now actually all the research shifted to the silicon carbide waste devices gradually we may be after 10 year we will be frequently using those devices and let's take a look of this matrix you know silicon IGBT is a solutions of the lower range solutions and we have a super junction MOSFET and these are the actually the voltage ranges that is still available now and you know these are the high end solution ultimately this is actually the current can be put into the y-axis that should break a power so you can see that the silicon can write you know actually it taking our whole shot up actually sets for high end solutions and which can handle which amount of the voltage this future lies on this guy this silicon carbide based device gan based device for high switching frequencies for low voltage applications and also super junction MOSFETs so which can be suitably preferred on the lower or middle level voltages now we're fine boy electronics finds his application we already discussed let us put into the perspectives we for electronics since why I require power electronics because you know we don't have a DC transformer so for this reason high frequency power conversion DC to DC conversion there is a transformer but that is high frequency transformer autism it will be quite compact and there are two inverters since you have a solar panel or you have a DC source from their adjustable DC drive or adjustable speed AC drive so for this is a new require inverter there after low frequency power conversion mostly basically the line rectifiers and there we still uses mostly the thyristors because till now power rating of the thyristors is quite highest and it will be naturally commuted it with that but problem lies the power quality is a criticality when you use actually line rectifiers for this we are gradually looking for the active filters distributed power system nowadays actually with the advent of the distributed generations we have a high penetration of the solar in different rooftops or different solar cells been placed in different locations as well as wind so distributed power system is one of the area and where we require to handle and monitor power to it and so there is a huge application of the power electronics and power devices also one of the area of power electronics which suitable use of the power electronics devices and research on it because we are not researching on basically we using from the application point of view but someone required to do this research otherwise our requirement will not be fulfilled because they will do their design from their fundamentals but our requirement is something else so we have to match that bridge again we require HVDC transmissions a high voltage or extra voltage DC transmissions there also we find lot of power electronics application also HVAC applications for way we use high voltage high power rated inverters and one aspect is the power quality because of we require to have adjustable speed drive and other issues that will corrupt the power for power quality problem has pops in and that required to be actually modified or mitigated and thus power quality problem also actually solution lies with the power electronics um the cause of this power quality is power electronics and solution of the power quality is also the power electronics and definitely the power factor connections harmonic reductions and it can be done in active and passive filtering and passive filtering is done by the combination of LC filters and there are a lot of disadvantage of it it may actually interact with the lines frequency and may cause a resonance and also actually did direct itself with the time because of the capacitor value gradually decreases due to that actually nowadays actually trend towards is through the active filtering with STATCOM so that solution also provided by the power electronics so power lecturing has a huge scope and applications for the modern days and for giving a better quality of life to the human being we have seen that Polytechnic takes input from the mast our electron it takes an input for the physics if you combine maths and physics its control ultimately device required to be control and they're all all the control techniques which you have studied will be applied one of the greatest application of the control system is the power electronics so power electronics researcher or the practitioner has to have a very sound knowledge in control and for this and we Club these two entities together we don't want to teach power electronics and the control in other entity it is basically application of the control system in power electronics so switching power converter must be suitably designed and controlled in order to supply the required voltage current another requirement and for this reason we require to be effectively control it and it is a feedback control and different kind of control technique is possible and we will find that actually they can be design and service a clean interface between the load and the electrical utility therefore there must be a switching power converter pulse behaves almost as a pure electrical utility for the resistive load is one of the application of it control is required to smoothening the cheetah is because you may have some kind of problem environmental problem any hazards that has to come into it and power electronics devices has to overcome it ultimately brain will be the control to mitigate that problem so this is actually the device rating that we can this we can talk about today you can see that a seer has huge voltage rating and it is available and it can operate actually 12 kV and 1.5 kilo ampere of current thus you've multiplied this power rating goes as high as actually ma or mega watt rating so you can see gradually you know so thereafter but it is a hop control device you can turn it on but turn off has to have a complicated process so for this reason we have GTO and that is basically that both turn on and turn off can be controlled but problem lies you know written till GTO is half of the rating of the thyristors thereafter same way we have IGBT if you wish to choose a higher voltage rating then current rating required to be low so either we requite for the higher a plasmatic are two parallel of the IGBTs or we require to use IGBT with high current rating we have to put it to the multi level inverter format so this is the power diagram of this devices still now available of course we expect that this situation will change drastically once we will have a silicon carbide based devices now let us very briefly tell you that what I are going to cover in this course so this is the introduction classes next class actually I'll take it out that comes basic and set of the switches thereafter I'll devote some time on the device physics is you have you might have stood those who have done the basic power electronics courses they have already done this course but we require to little actually brush above this courses and characteristics of the switches and switch application then we'll go to the single phase converter three phase converter and thereafter we will go to the multiple converter effect of the source impedance and then we will see that this is all our DC conversion mainly so PWM converter thereafter you see that selective harmonic eliminations power factor improvement and the power quality issues and then from this point onward we shall go for the DC to DC converter till now it was AC to DC now from this onward it will be DC to DC converter so we will have a different kind of isolated and non isolated DC to DC converter cube converter flyback converter thereafter we will give an introduction to the SMPS according to its application so you'll find that what kind of topologies will be suitable for the what kinda applications then we shall go for the inverter application that is basically DC to AC application from this point onward so they will have a voltage source inverter credit source inverter then pwm technique and we will have a different topologies of the inverter that is multi level inverters jet source inverter now we will come to the control aspect of it that is space vector-based modulation technique introduction to the AC to AC converter then we will see that mattress converter zips us converter and then at last we will discuss about the poor quality of mitigation device passive filter active filter hybrid filter you pick you see and then actually we shall discuss about the control part of it so linear control of the power electronics it that will be introduction of it no there after only devote much time on the nonlinear and control of the power electronics application of the power electronics in renewable energy and drive power electronics converter for the renewable and alternative energy get interaction islanding protection EMI and poor control power electronics for the energy storage for ultra capacitors like wills batteries these are will be discussed now these are the actually the books that you can refer you make student may be allowed to contact me for any further discussions or any further queries we shall continue with the next class with the devices and from the next class onwards we shall go to that deep into the power electronics control and its devices thank you so much for your kind attention [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]
