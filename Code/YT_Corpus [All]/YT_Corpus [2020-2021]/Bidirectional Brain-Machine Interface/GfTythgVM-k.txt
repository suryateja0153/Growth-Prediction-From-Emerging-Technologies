 so it's great to have Steve Collins he is from Stanford but he originally a graduate from Michigan and then did post I adult and he spent seven years in CMU and then he recently moved to stand for how many years three years so he's been like exper and the world leader in exoskeleton and like prosthetic ankle he developed like one of the best efficiency ankle for prosthetics and published punch of science in nature we're gonna see what is up to recently so let's get started thanks great to be here and and thanks thanks song BAE and Alberto for organized this visit it's been really nice to catch up with people it's been a few years since I've been to MIT so the the central societal problem that has preoccupied me for the last 17 years or so is this there are hundreds of millions of people who are unable to get around effectively whether it be as a result of disabilities arising from amputation or stroke or just aging or people who operate under very arduous conditions like these aid workers in Africa and so what I want to do is design robots that you can wear on your leg to improve major functional outcomes and mobility like energy economy speed balance and comfort and especially for folks like this now when I was a younger researcher I thought that because I was good at designing these passive dynamic walking robots and I armed with a little bit of knowledge of human gait biomechanics I would be able to make exoskeletons that gave people superhuman performance and I was wrong this problem is way harder than I recognized and as an illustration of that of the thousands of devices that have been designed for these purposes still only ten or so have demonstrated an improved performance for the person using them and I think that the the problem has been at its core that we do not know what the device should do to assist the user and this is because people are highly complex in our bodies and in our brains each one of us is unique so what helps me might make things harder for you and we're all constantly changing especially when we're learning to use some new device and so these things severely limit our ability to predict a person's response to some new device based just on our intuition or observations from biomechanics or the available models and slowing us further we have typically tested our ideas using specialized prototypes that are product like and each one takes a couple of years to develop and then because it's so hard to predict a person's response mostly they haven't worked so in the last few years an alternate approach to this problem has been emerging and I think it shows very positive signs of being more efficient and effective and basically the idea is that if our predictive tools are ineffective for design then we're really in an iterative and evolutionary process and so we should focus on speeding and systematizing our search for effective designs and so we've been developing two sets of tools to try to do just that one are versatile Hardware systems that we call universal device emulators and the other are algorithms for human-in-the-loop optimization which are intended to allow efficient navigation of this vast space of potential assistance strategies this is a schematic of a typical Universal device emulator the person who wears a lightweight instrumented end effector that is tethered to very powerful off-board motors and computers and that means that we're almost never constrained by the power or responsiveness of our hardware and test anything we want and this allows the user to experience a wide range of devices without the overhead of building a physical prototype this is sort of like virtual reality for your leg you can program any hypothetical design into the emulator and have an experimental test of what you care about which is the person's response in days or even minutes rather than years and then once you know what your device should do your your cool product should do you can make that autonomous device armed with the knowledge of how the person is going to respond another cool thing is that once you've got this off board motor control stuff figured out it's relatively easy to make new high-performance end effectors like this ankle foot prosthesis that has independent control of plantar flexion and inversion e-version torque which we're using to study balance and this hip knee ankle exoskeleton that were using to study assistants under a variety of very challenging conditions now there are limitations of course did this approach primarily that you're confined to the laboratory space and the main implications of that are a limitation on the exposure you can give people to your device and the kinds of environmental variations that you can apply but I think that we're still in a phase in these types of devices where there are lots of questions that we need to answer even in a controlled environment like walking on a treadmill in a laboratory and under those circumstances this emulation type approach is it gives you a very high versatility and fortunately there these devices are getting more accessible so one of my former PhD students Josh Caputo has started a company human motion technologies and they are commercializing all the emulator technology we develop in the lab and right now selling it to research groups and so far there in about 12 laboratories around the country and this is allowing people who have really good ideas about what assistive devices should do but maybe not a robotics background to try their hand at designing new devices which is exciting for me and in the long term the vision of the company and we're collaborating a little bit to try to achieve this is to put these systems in a clinical setting so they could be used to improve the prescription process so people can physically trial different devices before they're made and prescribe to the the person okay so now we have these hardware tools we can try lots of things but there are so many different functionalities that might be helpful so how do we how do we navigate that space well I think what we really want are methods for automatically discovering generically effective assistant strategies and customizing them to an individual person's needs and continuously adapting with a person as they grow and change and one way to do that that we're promoting these days and I think it's quite effective is human-in-the-loop optimization the basic idea is that you have a person interacting with some device and while they're interacting you measure their performance and then you feed that information back to an optimizer that then systematically buries device behavior and this you know when you look at a diagram it might sound kind of obvious but actually almost all traditional designs of this class of devices has operated on the left hand side of this diagram given some desired change in human behavior there's an implicit assumption that we know what the device should do to achieve it and unfortunately that's usually been wrong you usually haven't known and and that's been a problem and just to be really clear about this when I talk about this approach I'm I don't mean kind of tinkering or hand tuning which we found to be a lot less effective in our experiments than a systematic approach and I'm not talking about optimizing some intermediate or device level outcome like mechanical work or kinematics or something I'm talking about the thing that we really care about for the user like at an energy economy or joint load or comfort or something so optimized the thing you care about now this is not itself I'm easy to ask right these measurements are noisy they're time varying and each one is very expensive in human time and and money too and so we can only get a few objective function evaluations before the person gets tired and so most of the optimization techniques that work really well in simulation don't translate well to this domain but we have recently made some progress and it's specific I wanna talk about this approach for identifying the exoskeleton characteristics that minimize metabolic energy consumption during walking and what happens is you have a person use this awesome I feel like I'm in the 50s an exoskeleton worn by the person and it applies assistance defined by a control law which periodically changes we then estimate steady-state metabolic rate in the person by fitting a first-order dynamical model to a few minutes of transient respiratory data after we've evaluated several control laws that form a generation we use an evolutionary strategy in this case see ma es covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy popular in the graphics community to generate a new set of control laws to evaluate and a new estimate of the optimal parameters we go through this whole process a few times until we feel we've converged to the best parameters in our recent experiment we optimized ankle assistance that was characterized by four parameters so we have ankle to work as a function of time this is normalized to stride periods so this is heel strike through back to he'll strike and we set that peak time the time that a peak occurs the rise time and the fall time of the torque which allows a wide variety of different patterns we applied torque using one of our emulator systems worn on one ankle by 11 participants as they walked on a treadmill at a typical speed about 1.25 m/s and then after we had identified our estimate of optimal assistance we performed a separate validation trial in which we presented the optimized assistance pattern a zero torque mode where the exoskeleton does nothing and a few other things and in a double reversal to get a good measurement of the effect of assistance and that the main outcome of the study was metabolic rate and what we found is that optimized assistance improved energy cost for all participants with improvements ranging from 14 percent to 38 percent with an average improvement of about 24 percent which is a very large improvement for these kinds of devices and it's just to put in context this is four times better than the best results we've had from hand tuning assistance with the exact same hardware so that's a really big change in performance through this systematic approach and just to be precise about what this is let me say that this is the we're talking about the benefit of turning on assistance so the gray bar is wearing the device turned off really what you care about is the net benefit of putting the device on and turning it on and of course there's a cost in putting on the device on because if it's mass and interference with normal movements and those are not captured well by our emulator both because the motors aren't on board and because it's over designed for these optimal trajectories so to really understand what the net benefit is you have to make a mobile system that embeds the functionality which is something we're working on right now but however you you know however whatever your desired outcome you still want to try to maximize that benefit and this kind of algorithm is a great way to do that these are the optimized patterns of assistance and you can see that some features were really consistent across participants for example the timing of peak torque occurred over a very narrow range whereas some outcomes were more variable like the rise time and that suggests that you may be able to get a substantial portion of the benefit with a generic controller that captures say those consistent features but there still may be some benefit to customization and I'll tell you a little bit about some ongoing work where we're trying to tease out those contributions in a minute also note that these patterns of assistance are they don't correspond to the best match to biological ankle torque and they don't correspond to the largest positive mechanical work or power from the device and that means that you would not be able to guess these based on biomimicry or simple thermodynamic interpretations of the task of walking this the optimization approaches if necessary to get there okay so just to summarize this design philosophy people are really complicated so most things we try in this space are going to fail and so we should use versatile hardware so that we can fail quickly and move on to the next thing and we should use a systematic searching approach so that we can search that space efficiently and I think you know our groups doing this Connor Walsh's group is doing david reme and if I hear other people talking about incorporating these kinds of methods and I'm really excited I think that this is going to speed the development of devices that truly enhance performance for the users and I think it's exciting time to be in this area so that's we're like maybe 15 minutes into the talk and ours a very long time to stand here and just talk at you so why don't I pause here and answer some questions yeah yes yes doing some sort of derivative free optimization so you had a really nice really low dimensional hand design sort of controller space that you were searching over here with only four parameters yeah so I guess my question is like how many so in the upper right you have like six points you measure how many do you need to do before you're gonna take a step and measure the next ones and then you know that involves each one of those you have to run the person and then how does that relate to sort of how low dimensional with your sort of knowledge you designed to the policy yeah that's a great question and I can tell you a little bit about the theory here and but but we shouldn't put too much weight behind it until we have borne this out experimentally and that's something we're working on so first of all and this so the number of control laws per generation that you that you're recommended to use scales with the log of the dimension of the parameter space so which is good scaling for these kinds of problems and I'll tell you a little bit more about some of our ongoing work later but we're seeing that that time to convergence which depends both on the number of control laws per generation and the number of generations that you need to evaluate seems to scale more or less linearly in the number of parameters and the tests we've performed so far but very early and then I just want to also say it yes it's derivative free which is nice because the data is really noisy another nice feature of this approach is that it the main component of this which is updating your estimate of the optimal parameter values is memory less memory less so that estimate is made after each generation independently and this helps because the person is changing so that first generation their response to a really good control off might be really bad and if you're doing something like trying to characterize the landscape using say a Bayesian approach and you don't modify the method to down wait old data then you would you get these conflicting signals and you may quickly eliminate something that would actually get really good is better yeah yeah oh sorry some days in charge so yeah so Steve a quick question you said that when you look to the biological data it doesn't fit do you think it's because the emulator doesn't represent well that is general enough or how do you attribute that why are you finding gains that do not match what humans had by evolution found yeah that's a great question so I and this is that's a great it sort of applies this philosophical question right and so let's only let me launch into that real so when you change the plant as you do when you add an exoskeleton to the person's body you might naturally assume that the optimal trajectories for that plant have changed as well and especially if you change like the relationship between movement and cost or you know it costs in a very broad sense right when the eggs and skeleton does mechanical work on your leg you don't pay for it in metabolic energy for example right and and there are some other important differences between the human body and the exoskeleton for example at this phase of the gait cycle your ankle is plantar flexing with high velocity and when muscle is contracting at high velocity its efficiency decreases greatly so there's this force velocity relationship that's on for the given amount of activation you get a much smaller force when the muscle is contracting fast so we think actually that what we're seeing here is maybe these complementary strengths between the person and the device it's not doesn't cost you too much to produce ankle torque early and the stance phase when you're stretching tendons and maybe slowly lengthening the ankle plantar flexors but late in in the stance phase when the ankle is moving quickly the muscle is not very good at at doing work then but maybe you if if you could get that work for a reasonable cost you would like it and the exoskeleton can do that does that make sense because it doesn't follow that same relationship that was a little bit of a meandering answer but but basically I think whenever we changed the person's body amputation exoskeleton anything else we our default assumption should not be we the best thing to do is to do what the person originally did our assumption should be there's some new thing that's best and we have to find that in our random each controller is from the previous one so it's not super jarring to the user that's a great question so far we have mostly been using vanilla CMA but I think that would be better yeah no III mean it and we see this sometimes you can you can tell when somebody draws a bad generation right it means here and you're only sampling eight points in this parameterization so what if they're all over here oh this is not good and that can set you back and since we're trying we can only go through this I mean in this first experiment we went through four times so that we could have a 1-day protocol and our more recent work we're going through more times but it's still very few generations and so having one bad generation it doesn't matter too much in a computer simulation but in these experiments it's really costly so yes forcing some distribution or you know there's there some trade-off that if you keep it truly stochastic this helps you avoid getting stuck in local minima and things like that but in our case I think yeah we should be embedding some of our knowledge about good directions to search and we haven't done that yet yes so you talked about so that there's some sort of parametric representation of your controller space that you're searching over yeah that's may be dependent on intuition or knowledge yes and yeah that's just what the ankle can do right and so when you get results some of these things have greater effect on metabolic rate others don't kind of you pointed that out and so have you thought about changing the design of the ankle based on this in other a systematic way or more of an intuitive way and I know it's a hard problem but so so first let me just reiterate something you said and slightly different words which is in order to form the parameterization this is where observations from biomechanics and our intuition and simple models come in right so we still need those things and it's for setting up these problems and obviously if you set this problem it's set up the optimization problem badly you're gonna get a poor result right and then you you also noted that perhaps a conclusion we could draw from the result is that some dimensions don't matter and some do and I think that is a possibility but I know we have I don't think we have sufficient information to make a strong statement about that yet it because you can't differentiate between dimensions that don't matter and dimensions that do matter but over which there's large subject variability and so that real way to answer that questions you have to do another experiment in which you pick a reduced dimensionality representation of the assistance matter and then optimize and then see how the optimal assistance result changes or doesn't and if it doesn't change great big when yeah right on and just one other thing about the constraint potential like is it possible that the reason we don't get biological torques is because of hardware limitations the bandwidth of the system is like 15 to 20 Hertz so with the closed loop torque bandwidth which is a bit higher than for a human muscle at the ankle joint so we think that's not a element a shoe in fact we one of the things we find is that we have to place an artificial limit on how late this peak occurs because if because it automated and later and people don't like it when it's late but we can still track really sharp trajectories okay so so that's sort of the philosophy and a very clear coherent story and now we'll go to current work where things are a little Messier and ongoing and I would encourage you to please just jump in with any questions you have or thoughts or disagreement as we go so I want to talk about a few different directions that we're moving in right now one is trying to better understand why this optimization works and how it interacts with learning and we're trying to apply it also to new devices and new activities and new objectives and people who have disabilities and then finally we're trying to translate some of our effective devices outside the lab so going back to our study I mentioned a minute ago one of the things that we realized quickly is that while we initially expected that what we would do is tune device properties to match the person at least equally important was helping the person to learn how to use the device better so here's a participant walking with no eggs of skeleton here's the device in zero torque mode and one of our experiments now we're gonna turn on to work this is a good pattern of assistance but you can see the person looks pretty awkward right there's a lot of upper extremity involvement and then this is this very similar pattern of assistance after optimization during the validation phase so clearly a lot of what's happening during this process is in the human side of the system so to try to better understand the the role of training in these tests we've performed a follow-up experiment this is work led by Katie pokken see who's a PhD student in our group and what she did is to bring in naive participants and expose them to optimization on repeated days and then validation on everyday and so this is days on the on the x axis on the y axis we have the change in metabolic rate compared to the zero torque mode so you can see down is good that's bigger improvements and we applied two different patterns one is this generic assistance pattern that was the average of the best patterns from a different experiment and this red pattern which is the subject specific optimized assistance pattern and what you can see is for many participants energy cost is dropping through you know four or five days of optimization so eight or ten hours of exposure to the device which is a very long time and if we look at the energy cost on the first day we see that if we just give the person the device and measure their immediate response there's almost no benefit but after a complete round of training and there are three different groups that I'll explain in a second so this is the continuing optimization that I described before that generic pattern of assistance after training gives you something like a 30% improvement energy economy and optimized assistance gives you almost a 40 percent improvement in energy economy this is just assisting the ankles bilaterally which is by the way a very big number for us we're very excited about that but we kind of thought that something about the experience of this optimization might help people learn how to use device so we tested a different group they just saw that generic pattern over and over again very very boring protocol for them ten hours walking to this but it turns out that their response was almost the same so we think that their level of expertise at using the exoskeleton was really similar kind of independent of that variation experienced during conversation yes sorry so the static group this is so each of these is five individuals all naive and the static group just experienced the generic pattern of assistance over and over again so it's the same duration of exposure but instead of undergoing this optimization where we try this control law than this one and this one and this one they just get the same thing all the time and it it's closed loop in the sense of the tour controls closely but they're not we're not doing human loop optimization we're not doing any optimization they're just just the same thing all the time it's know it so we're doing closed-loop torque control so they they're getting a consistent pattern of torque and time as parameterised as I described earlier in the parameterization the thing we're trying to tease out here is we know in motor learning literature sometimes variation training is really important to acquiring expertise and so we thought that that variation in device behavior might be helping people to learn how to use it better to help explain some of the differences we see with this optimization compared to our previous experiments but it looks like that's not so important however there's another group this reoptimize ation group and the reoptimize ation group we reset optimization every day they come in so instead of sort of starting with this big noise and funneling into something good you know they start to funnel and then they and it's rough and so they seem to experience interference in their training because of this high variation so the type of training seems to matter you can screw it up but we haven't figured out a way to enhance it yet and also this shows us that in our first experiment that talked about earlier one day was not sufficient to identify the optimal assistance parameters okay so another question that were curious about is how does this scale to larger parameter spaces so this is a hip knee ankle exoskeleton that we've started to optimize and of course defining assistance requires more parameters and so in a first test we've defined it using nine control parameters and optimized and what we're finding is that the we can so this is the the distance between estimates of the optimal parameters over time as we go through the optimization so each one of these is a generation and that decreases over time and it seems like a pretty good measure of convergence in this tasks and we can also simulate very very simple simulations where we approximate the task and person as a bowl in n dimensions with noise and we get really similar convergence rates and with this device we see improvements with optimized assistance of 30% this is all hot off the presses N equals 1 and but it's only 30% so that tells us that we probably didn't parameterize the problem well enough and actually since just in the last couple weeks the students who are leading this project who are Glenn brian and Patrick Franks have completed individual joint optimizations with richer parameter space and found that we can get we can get better than 30% just assisting the hips or just assisting the ankles and we get something like 15 20 % just assisting the knee so that's a strong indicator that we need to free up the constraints here and operated in a higher dimensional control space yes what what's your intuition in terms of individual joint optimization versus when you put all those optimizations together like would you need to do a different optimization for the full joint system that is a great question and that is something that I hope to have a preliminary answer for in the next few weeks so we're we're going to we're going to do just that take those those optimize the controllers and just slam them together and see what happens I don't think it's gonna go well but you know you have to do the test - no my intuition is so just to say something a little more scientific you know if you if you look at estimates of how much say the ankle planner flexures how much energy the ankle plantar flexors are using during walking it's not 40% it's a lot lower than that maybe 20% or something so how can you get 40% energy cost savings when you're only assisting the ankle joint well because the changes are not just happening at the ankle joint the person is changing their whole coordination pattern there's this global change and so you're saving energy not just at the plantar flexors which actually don't turn all the way off they're still quite active you're saving a little bit of energy there and some at the knees and some at the hips and you know what it's more confident but anyways you get the point so it's unlikely that these things will add linearly especially since 40 plus 40 plus 20 is 100 so that's it seems unlikely but okay great we're also quite interested in applying this to new tasks and and then obvious starting point is running so we recently completed an experiment where we optimized the same exoskeletons same parameterization of assistance during running at a slow speed about 10 minute mile pace so like two and half times slower than kept Rogge and what we found is that a gear again optimized assistance substantially improves energy cost compared to zero torque and it also although this is not so meaningful it I think because of the reasons I mentioned earlier it also in energy costs compared to normal running shoes by a 15% but this also the study also illustrates another kind of fun application of human loop optimization which is you can compare the best version of two different design types so here in addition to optimizing the power device we also optimized a spring-like device where the parameter space was the stiffness and whether it's how much it was stiffening our softening and the engagement angle of a spring so that would be something that you could design into an energetically passive product mmm-hmm and in this case we found that the benefits were quite modest compared to our powered device so that that is nice that helps us to know which direction we should pursue for untethered systems we're also in certain other objectives so we you know we spent a lot of time on metabolic and oh yeah please yeah it's the difference between this passive and the active one just that like the torque we're two deflection curve something you couldn't achieve with the spring or like could you still take the power like or they're just a lot of variability in those curves over time or that's true this the pattern of assistance here is cannot be achieved by a passive device it in code so this is a we encode torque over time it's independent of joint state so and what happens is that the person is largely dorsi flexing when the torque is low and plantar flexing when the torque is high so there's a big work loop there's this encodes a lot of mechanical power by device it's a make sense so but the idea here is that you can constrain your optimization in various ways so that whatever you discover can be implemented in different classes of device does that make sense so from passive to semi-active to fully powered or let's say I have an electricity constraint I want to enforce then you can put that into the optimization and operate under that constraint so we don't just care about energy economy of course oh yeah sorry yeah so for for this graph like the optimal spring like tour controller does it have the same number of parameters that you're tuned for the optimum two powered controller it had a fewer parameters three three still really yes in so so we've we've now done a variety of different control dimensions from three up through eleven and yeah eleven sometime in the near future we hope to tackle something more like twenty and that will you know they're all N equals well like so these are n equals ten but the higher dimensional ones are just N equals one but it'll still give us a sense of how things are scaling i i think implicit in the question is is it possible to develop more efficient algorithms for this for this optimization process and i think so and i would love it if some of the people in this room but put their creativity towards that problem because i'd love to use better optimization algorithms especially i thinks an intriguing idea is to try to tease out this these two separate tasks of training the person and efficiently identifying optimal device parameters there maybe once you're trained it may be possible to identify optimal optimal parameters more quickly yes would you say that it would be difficult to create a passive running prosthesis that resides on the ankle so the question is would it be popped difficult to create a passive running prosthesis that resides on the ankle and I would say of the class that we constrained our optimization to I feel confident that there isn't a big benefit to be had from such a device of course there are many different ways you could try to contrive passive running device and we have had more success with other things like tying a rubber band between your feet improves the running energy economy by six percent so that beats our fancy exoskeleton emulator okay so energy cost isn't the only thing that matters we also care about things like speed and so I recently in work led by someone song who's a postdoc in our lab we've tried to tackle it so first we needed to be able to measure speed while you're tethered so we self-paced the Burrtec treadmill using just local force information there's a common filter or estimating your position of velocity blah blah blah and it's nice because you don't have to have a mark a mocap system integrated or other measurement devices and then we validated that self-selected speed on the treadmill matched that over ground in a bigger experiment with different over ground walking distances and different self based conditions and so on and they there's a really strong correlation which is good and then we began performing human loop optimization except instead of optimizing human energy because something's trying to minimize that we're trying to maximize self-selected walking speed and with nine participants through so far we see that optimized assistance leads to about a forty percent improvement or increase I should say in self selected walking speed and this is cost of transport on the y-axis here we see that cost of transport actually decreases a little bit at that speed so we're not just like putting people in a forced march and increase our confidence and I'm not showing these data but we applied a couple of additional conditions including one where we just applied the generic assistance pattern that we know reduces energy cost and it did increase walking speed but just a little bit about 10% and we also applied a condition that we expected to make to annoy people basically when they're walking and that decreased self-selected walking speed so we think we're we're finding something that's real here and I'm very excited about this and it's I think a future direction for us is to move on to multi objective optimization and try to capture all the things that you care about in one cost function with appropriate weights on each for the population and the task okay now that you know I told you I got into this because I want to help people with disabilities so what happens when we try these techniques on people who've had a stroke so we recently applied the same exact optimization process with an exoskeleton worn on the Preta Klim of a few participants that have hemiparesis following stroke as a chronic participants and unfortunately what we find is a much smaller improvement in energy economy about 5% without demise assistance and observing the the participants behavior in using the exoskeleton we have a couple of guesses as to what's going on and the first is just that they you know all the changes we care about are our changes elsewhere in the body right that they need to coordinate with the device to get a benefit so it seems like participants are not making those adjustments to their control pattern that are needed to get a benefit and so we're trying things like training with biofeedback setting target joint angles ground reaction forces muscle activity to help improve the training process so far that's not working very well with it again very small sample size piloting stuff another way to try to address this is by enforcing some of that inner limb or inner joint coordination with multi joint assistance and that's something we're about to start on and I feel more hopeful about success strike suckers do you think that's more likely to do with the consequences of the stroke itself will perhaps just due to the population that usually some difficulty loading that's a good way so the question is is this a observed effect and again pilot data and all that but is it is it about the stroke or about older people were more sedentary or something and I you know I I don't know but I think my strong intuition is that it's about the stroke it's so right just III think I said this and maybe slightly different words a minute ago but the benefits of these devices are derived from changes in the person and if a person can't change or if they're strong constraints on how the person can change where the person can't change quickly like there's a slow learning rate say very slow learning rate then that limits the advocacy of the intervention so I think what we're trying to do now is change the architecture of the intervention in ways that enable improve performance with less or with the right dimensions of change in the participant does that make sense yeah yes please oh oh good lots of hands okay good yes when you accept the cost function tablets metabolic rate that it always from feedback from the participants that they always correspond to know so the question is does minimum metabolic rate correspond to most comfort and answers No first of all people are very bad at estimating their effort and so a classic example is have a person walk with exoskeleton systems for a while and accommodate and ask them if the device is helping them they say and they turn it off and they say oh this sucks so this is a very common observation in this field and there's also some more careful studies of like greater perceived effort using with assistance that's really changing people are just not very good at that psychological task yes can you speak relative to this lie that we're seeing the difference between that you observed between stroke patients walking on a treadmill rather than over ground and if they had any if they use Walker's canes or daily use devices and we we limited ourselves the inclusion criteria where you have to be able to walk without an assistive device and I don't think that the overground versus treadmill makes much difference in this we give people lots of training on the treadmill and based on some other experiments I think we're in weird safe territory there yeah do you know if these patients have any sensory deficits that would perhaps also hinder their ability to learn the controller of the device so the question is - oh yeah you had the microphone that's perfect yes they probably do have sensory deficits and yes that's probably in part responsible for inhibiting lote motor learning I mean I I how to quantify it so so they're like a basic scientific question here that you could dig into you could say okay good people with stroke don't respond well to these devices now let's show why but I am a different ilk and I I just want them to work better I want it I want to increase performance so so instead of I think it's it would be very valuable to the field but we're kind of seeing this and and and saying let's try something different let's see if we can find something that works okay so how about amputation this has been an area of research and I grew for a long time and unfortunately what we're finding is that strategies for powering the prosthetic limb and you know like changing the average device characteristics in ways that are expected to affect propulsion are failing and we have tried 14 different literally 14 different architectures human loop optimization approaches giving people more time less time it forced exploration all kinds of things with this and I'm quite confident that it's not working we've also seen in our lab that if we just sweep we have a we have different levels of average prosthesis power this is not mechanical power from the device versus metabolic rate and the person we see a flatline in other extremes so we're trying to figure out why that's happening now I think very likely this relates to these constraints and motor learning maybe we're talking about a minute ago for example you don't have perceptive information from the foot and you don't have direct control of it either now I think the most promising intervention or the most promising technology along this path to solve this problem is osseointegration with a direct neural interface bidirectional that's that's where we have to go I think and I know that there are I spoke with a couple of people earlier today of Tony's here but that are working on exactly that technology and in 10 or 20 years I think that'll be really exciting and when we get those interfaces I'd love to pull people into our emulator and see you know what they can do with it but of course that takes a long time and it's a little invasive so one way of trying to answer this basic question scientific questions is partially restore those pathways by tele operating an ankle with a wrist exoskeleton and this is working in collaboration with Allison Okamura so this the prosthesis is following the angle of the wrist and the wrist is giving you a haptic rendering of the torque at the ankle joint there's very early-stage stuff but we're excited to see if that helps people learn how to use device and another test here is to see if we put an exoskeleton on the sound limb of people with amputation can they learn how to use it well and if they cannot that might be an indication of a more global limit on motor learning or the available coordination strategies after adaptation yes socket mechanics in fact selected hard to make it stiff and then whenever change that you know socket like skin actually react on it so basically what you meant to do is doesn't really affect I you know I so I think that's so the question yeah so I think that we consider that as a possibility and so in this experiment we actually did a careful analysis of the flow of mechanical work through the system and we see that actually this the work is getting to the center of mass and it's getting to the swing leg and it's not all just being damped out in the socket and it's a it's probably not obvious from this figure but it's a very large amount of work that we're doing with it it would be hard to absorb it all in the soft tissue like this is normal okay this is old biome data and this our max so I don't think that's responsible but of course the socket does cause all these other problems like pain the pinch over pain you got to avoid that and and and true there is a movement and yes I'm trying to understand this part here because the the amputee he still has proprioception for the socket so I'm trying to understand why would you get a good result using an exoskeletal on a healthy subject and not get the same result in an amputee and the sensory part I'm not this confused look on your face it just I feel you man no this is like it reflects that's my inner face about this problem for like a decade so yeah I mean I would not have guessed this going in right we at like Matt Hanford here is some nice simulation models that show that theoretically you should be able to get big improvements in energy economy by appropriately powering a prosthetic device and it just doesn't happen in in humans and it's true that there's some sensory information coming from inside the socket I mean but of course you know there's a reason that our bodies are just full of distributed sensors we could theoretically infer all sorts of information by remote sensors or low fidelity but it helps to actually have sensors at the joint and at that contact with the ground and it helps to have some connection between sensing and control and apparently that's important here it seems like and the other evidence of this is that here where we apply assistance to the unaffected LEM we do the Z is the exact same optimization and instead of getting say 40% improvements in energy economy we get 5% so that suggests a more global constraint on either learning rate or the available coordination strategies now I see song bass standing up and I see that there's three three minutes remaining and I have like 20 slides so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to very quickly I'm going to give you the highlight reel here really quickly we're looking at balance and we've made a new prosthesis to try to study it that has control of the center pressure through these independently actually chosen you can do fun things with that Center pressure control including we're trying different ways of assisting people on uneven terrain which is a very common complaint among people with amputations right so that the one the one success story in this area is the biome and I think maybe it has to do with balance as opposed to propulsion and so we're targeting balance and we're also looking at trying to improve balance in response to big disturbances like big pushes so we've made this thing push bot we're open sourcing it and so it's like a couple thousand bucks to build one for yourself and you can really show people around on treadmill and then try to make devices that help them recover now of course as we find things we want to translate them to mobile systems we want to keep things lightweight and cheap so using as little energy as possible would be nice this is a device that uses no energy itself but reduces the metabolic energy cost if you've been walking by about 7% and it has a clutch spring and I won't walk you through all the details but with the right stiffness it works but it has no electrical control no computer control so we're making new clutches that combine this very low energy consumption like less than a millon electrical control ability based on electrostatic adhesion and they have these great properties you know for a contact patch like this you get 200 Newtons a mass of a couple grams for the actual electrode they use less than mil water power they have a low low voltage of 300 volts which for electrostatics is actually pretty good and you can use conventional electronics and they switch on and off in about 20 milliseconds which is quite fast for these kind of systems I was put him through millions of cycles without fatiguing out my former student Stuart Diller has started a company I have no role in the company or the other company I talked about and they are now selling development kits so if you want to play around with electrostatic clutches for your application you can buy one for hundred bucks or something and we think that these can be used in cool new robotic systems lots of them blah blah blah and there's some hard control problems that we solved and in the right conditions you can get energy savings and these net zero work cyclic robotics tasks of 50 percent on average 80 90 percent in the best cases so we could use these to really improve energy economy in mobile robot actually thank you to my students and thank you to my sponsors especially the NSF and I recently joined science robotics so much cool work going on here at MIT and robotics I hope you'll smell your work we need awesome stuff so please send it our way thank you maybe it will give you one lucky guy to give the last question because we have a lot of questions in the mail anybody and I'll hang around and answer any take all converses so like I guess like all of the way all of your works worst or to minimize the energy expenditure metabolic energy expenditure basically or increase speed or improve down so increment and some ways some on some work I didn't talk about about improving comfort sorry I I totally agree I totally agree it's not just energy cost you care about lots of stuff and that's where we want to get you my questions may be in the same vein so everything you showed is for like periodic motions how do we like obviously the world is not periodic so how do we go beyond that totally we can and we will and so we start with periodic because it's the easiest and if you count up the the distance walked in a day most of that distance is covered in steady gait so that's the first thing to do but most of the bouts are sort and mostly transient so the way you do that is you repeatedly over and over again stop and start up and stop and then syrup and stop and you do that back and forth long enough that you can get a reasonable estimate of that that you care about like energy costs speed or balance and then you can apply the same kinds of optimization techniques by it maybe thank you [Applause]
