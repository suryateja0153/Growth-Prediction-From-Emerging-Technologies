you will find this to be true so welcome bill sullivan thank you very much uh thank everyone for watching it is and i i thank you for the wonderful invitation to speak at the nnlm reading club and i thank all of us as well uh this is a amazing um reading club and i am just delighted uh to be here speaking with you today uh about you and why you do some of the things that you do and i hope that after this presentation we leave with a greater understanding as to why we do some of the things we do and just as importantly why why others do things we wouldn't dream of doing so that is the crux of what my book is about it's called please to meet me and it describes jeans germs and other curious forces that make us who we are today we're going to cover four of these forces and describe them in a little greater detail in order to enlighten ourselves about our personality and behavior so the primary message that is communicated through this work is i want people to realize that we're not who we think we are we're under the influence of hidden forces hidden biological forces but exposing these hidden forces are going to help us all live a better life and it's also going to help guide precision medicine the book is divided into 10 chapters each exploring a different facet of our behavior and then the last chapter tries to pull all this knowledge together and envision a way forward how we can use it for our benefit the first hidden force i want to talk about today are genes a topic that is quite familiar to most people we are all well aware that the genes in our dna and code for physical traits like eye color and hair color but what i found that was very surprising in my research is that genes have much more far-reaching effects on our personality and behavior than we have appreciated for example if we take a light-hearted example and this is one that's a little bit personal to me because i grew up and to this day still can't stand the taste of broccoli or other cruciferous vegetables and i've always wondered why because it seemed like most people that i encountered either enjoyed or at least tolerated this vile weed of a vegetable so in the first chapter meet your taste i explore why people have different affinities for certain food and beverage so the broccoli is a fun one that you know answers personal questions in my life why do i have such a distaste for this vegetable much like newman uh in that famous episode of seinfeld and it turns out that our tastes can be dictated by factors in our genetic code for example there's a gene called taster tas 2r and it encodes a taste bud receptor that carpets our tongue and binds to various chemicals that are found in our foods so there's a chemical on the screen here that i'm not going to try to pronounce but it's abundant in vegetables like broccoli and it happens to have a very bitter flavor now in most people this chemical will just kind of float right over the tongue it won't bind to the taster receptor very tightly okay but in about 25 percent of people like myself and newman here who can't stand broccoli this bitter chemical binds to the taste buds on their tongue with much greater affinity which means it binds much tighter and it signals to our brain that what we just put in our mouth could potentially be a poison you better spit it out and that reminds me of this famous uh quote from ancient greek uh lucretius once said what is food to one is to others bitter poison and he might have been referring to the differences in um taste um affinities between people so newman and i are categorized in this class of people called super tasters because we are super sensitive to the bitter flavors in some of these vegetables that we eat and i found that to be vindicating you know it's not necessarily my fault that i couldn't stomach this vegetable but it's also a little unsettling if you think about it because there's just one simple genetic mutation that has basically taken certain foods off the menu for me and what this implies is that the variations in our genetic code can literally dictate some of the things that we like or dislike in life and it subtracts some of the freedom that we credit to our decision making so i found that quite fascinating all and it all stems from broccoli so another thing let's get a little more serious about some of the human behavior we explore in this book let's talk about drug and alcohol addiction many people are well aware of ozzy osbourne's struggle with drug and alcohol addiction uh this famous rocker has struggled with substance abuse for the majority of his life and many people don't realize that about 10 years ago scientists actively sought out ozzy osbourne's dna and they did this he was actually one of the very first people to get his full genome sequenced and analyzed by scientists and scientists did this because they wanted to figure out why ozzy osbourne was still alive they uh wanted to see if his genetic code would reveal any insights into drug and alcohol addiction because we appreciate these d these days that substance abuse is a bona fide disease that definitely has a genetic component and that's in fact what ozzy osbourne's dna revealed for one of the studies that were performed on his genetic code he had a variation in a gene called adh4 which encodes an alcohol dehydrogenase this is an enzyme that works in the liver to detoxify alcohol and the mutation in ozzy osbourne's dna would suggest that he expresses very high levels of this adh4 detoxifying uh gene which implies that he may be able to tolerate a much greater volume of alcohol than the average person other mutations that they found in aussies dna and many other people who struggle with substance abuse relate to neurochemistry one pathway that comes up time and time again centers on a neurotransmitter called gaba and in many people who struggle with addiction they have a gaba deficiency gaba is a calming neurotransmitter we call it an inhibitory neurotransmitter and what it does is it quiets the brain it calms things down it allows people to focus it allows people to get to sleep at night and what we see is that people who have a deficiency in producing gaba or the gaba receptors needed to make it work have a hyperactive brain now it so happens that at a molecular level alcohol resembles the structure of gaba and can mimic its effects in the brain so alcohol can quiet the brain and inhibit neurons just as gaba does so with someone who has a hyperactive brain because of these genetic variations alcohol can be looked upon as kind of a medication that quiets the brain down so this is really helpful information that is guiding science uh people who study addiction in trying to come up with gaba substitutes that are non-addictive uh and and utilize those as a medication that can quiet down the brain without the addictive side effects another very serious facet of behavior that has a potential genetic origin is violence and aggression some of the demons that plague uh some human beings so about 10 years ago bradley woldroot pictured here was the first person to be spared the death penalty for murder because of his genes his lawyers successfully argued that because he had a variation in a gene called maoa this predisposed him to violent behavior and rage disorder and there's there are multiple scientific studies that back this up especially if the individual was abused as a child so what is the science behind this how does this all work it turns out that this gene encodes an enzyme that is essential for breaking down neurotransmitters in the brain and people who are born with a certain variation in this gene do not break those neurotransmitters down and they get a toxic buildup of them which can lead to a loss of impulse control and violent outbursts so there are suggestive studies out there that people might be uh suffering from aggression uh or rage disorder because of genetic variations combined uh with some of the environmental effects that they're exposed to such as child abuse so you might be thinking by now given these studies that if scientists had your dna they could use it as kind of like a crystal ball and by looking at that genetic code we might be able to predict someone's behavior now for a small tiny subset of genes that actually is true mostly diseased genes like sickle cell or huntington's if you have that variation we are 99.9 sure you will get that disease but when we're talking about complex behaviors and personality or even certain physical traits like height you cannot look at the genetic code alone the environment has effects on this genetic code that make looking at the sequence alone pretty useless in terms of prediction and this leads me to the second force i want to talk about epigenetics which literally means beyond the gene or above the gene so these are effects that have a have a consequence on the genetic code that we inherit from our parents but what drives these effects are factors from our environment and this will become clear as i outline a few examples there are many different epigenetic mechanisms we don't have time to go into all of them today i circled one on the screen called dna methylation just to illustrate how this works and how it differs from a genetic variation so in contrast to a mutation that occurs in dna which is a change in the genetic sequence that can actually be passed on from parent to child epigenetics refers to a chemical change taking place on the dna molecule itself or proteins that associate with the dna and the bottom line is these chemical modifications which are reversible can change whether that gene is turned on off or somewhere in between and that's why i have a dimmer switch pictured on the slide jeans are not like a light switch that are just turned on and off we have a great deal more flexibility than that and that the gene can actually be turned on in any in any range it's more like a volume knob than a simple on off switch and dna methylation can control some of this this is a chemical modification that when it occurs to a gene it starts to repress it it starts to turn it off and if these dna methylation marks are removed the gene comes back on so we have about 22 000 genes in our genome so you can imagine if we have all these different epigenetic modifying machinery we have an incredible amount of flexibility in our dna code to have different traits and this may explain why people can change over time as well so epigenetics actually solves a long-standing mystery in the field of genetics and it centers on the question why identical twins can change over time so this can happen we see changes in identical twins which is puzzling because they have the exact same genetic code they are literal clones of one another okay but if you look at some of these twins one of these twins looks a little older maybe angrier than the other these twins are discordant for obesity one of the twins is lean one of the twins is obese the property brothers famous from tv they have quite different personalities and what they like to do as their occupation and one is taller than the other and i'm not quite sure what's going on with these identical twins down here we'll leave that discussion for another time what i want to draw your attention to is the solution to this mystery when scientists looked at dna methylation this modification that represses genes when they look at three-year-old twins and they compare homologous chromosomes between these twins everywhere you see yellow is where the dna methylation is the same so in very young twins they not only have identical genes they have virtually identical epigenetic marks that's not the case in older twins so when scientists look at 50 year old twins you see there's virtually no similarity in terms of that yellow okay the dna methylation is very different which means that even though they have the same genetic code some of the genes are turned on or off more than others and this can account for the differences that we see in some of these identical twins so the analogy that i think is useful to draw here is that genes are the piano keys but the environment plays the song we really can't consider the genetic code outside of the context of the environment that the person is in which really puts a dent in the theory of genetic pre-determinism there's a there's a lot the interesting way to think about this is that there's a lot of different versions of you in the genetic code that you possess okay if you grew up in a very different environment you would be a different person despite the fact that you still have the same genes so there's a there's a great deal of flexibility here now let's look at some examples that have some clinical uh relevance here so if you're looking at this picture you might think these are two completely um different mice okay but they're in fact genetically identical um they're like identical twins they have the same exact genes so how can one be yellow and obese and the other one be a normal brown and healthy mouse turns out the yellow mouse is expressing a gene called a gooty and the normal brown mouse is not a guti is a gene that is normally turned on very early in the life of a mouse and it puts little yellow highlights in the hair and drives appetite to increase and it gets shut off at a very early age but that didn't happen in the yellow mouse in the yellow mouse the aguti jeans stayed on all the time okay and that's why instead of brown hair with yellow highlights it has completely yellow hair and that's why the mouse couldn't stop eating because aguti would normally um aguti is driving the appetite here it would normally be science silenced by that epigenetic mark called dna methylation that i described earlier so here's where here's where things really gets interesting once scientists realized this they tried to feed extra folate to these obese yellow mice when they were pregnant now folate is an excellent source for a chemical called methylation okay so when these pregnant mice were fed extra folate they had additional means to methylate and silence the aguti gene and in fact all of their pups were born lean and brown despite the fact that their parents were yellow and obese so just by that simple dietary change and modifying the epigenetics that takes place they were able to treat this obesity in the mice another striking example comes from shelly burger's lab at university of pennsylvania all of the ants in a colony are genetic twins of one another however some of them are foragers and they're small and the other ones are large and those are the guards okay they never leave the colony these two ants not only look different but they behave very differently yet they have the exact same genetic makeup so this is an indication to scientists that there is an epigenetic mechanism here that dictates the fate of these ants why some remain small and become foragers and the others get larger and become guards so get this this is the incredible experiment they did they injected an epigenetic drug into the brain of these young major ants which is a feat in and of itself but what hap what's really striking is the result when they injected this drug that can change the epigenetic code on the dna these young major hands became foragers instead of soldiers so by manipulating the epigenetics she basically changed the job that was going to be the destiny of those ants reprogramming the ants behavior pretty remarkable finding now this is a busy slide but introduces a very interesting concept that um again relates to epigenetics and some of the strange behaviors that people may exhibit and i call this epigenetic ghosts so let's go through this mouse experiment to illustrate what's going on here in terms of what scientists call transgenerational epigenetic inheritance now mice normally love the smell of almonds but not if scientists deliver a shock as they whiff that scent so these mice that get shocked actually develop a fear of almonds and if they are mated they produce children who are born afraid of the almond scent which is amazing because these children were never shocked when they smelled almonds and they never saw their parents got get shocked so they were born with a new fear they were born with a new instinct and the children of these children still had that fear so this is remarkable it is the inheritance of a behavior the inheritance of a fear and if you go and read the study you can see how the epigenetics plays into this mechanism so this is a very striking finding and suggests to us that there are certain behaviors that might be inherited through epigenetic mechanisms is there any evidence of this happening in humans well as you can imagine we can't do these types of studies to humans but we can look at historical records and try to infer whether this might be taking place and some of the best evidence comes from the dutch famine of world war ii the children and grandchildren of starved mothers were born with a thrifty genotype that is maladaptive in today's world so basically the children of these starved mothers were born with a genetic code that was epigenetically modified to extract the maximum amount of calories from their food now as you can imagine if you're born into a famine that would be a good thing but if you're born into today's world that is calorie rich that's a bad thing and in fact many of these children and grandchildren now struggle with obesity and diabetes because of this thrifty genotype that they receive through this potentially epigenetic inheritance mechanism a final example i want to talk to you about is adverse childhood experiences everyone knows that bullying and neglect and abuse is going to leave psychological scars on a child that are incredibly difficult to overcome with age but scientists are also finding that these adverse childhood experiences leave epigenetic scars on the dna as well and it might explain why some of these children as they grow up have such a difficult time um getting over some of these tragic events that have happened earlier in their lives it turns out that these these adverse childhood experiences induce dna methylation on a gene that encodes a glucocorticoid receptor that's going to shut this receptor off and that's a bad thing because it is really important to clean up stress hormones like cortisol which floods the blood and brains of children who are subject to abuse and neglect so they have no means to clear this stress hormone from the body and that may be one of the contributors to the higher rates of violence depression and suicide that are seen in these abused children as they get older and if that is true it's actually a really profound discovery because it's kind of going to guide where medication might be able to go if we can reverse this epigenetic change there may be hope for treating these children so everything i told you about genes and epigenetics you might find agreeable to a certain extent but many of you are probably thinking i have this big wonderful brain in my cranium and that's what really makes me me that's what governs my choices my free will and what i want to do with my life it's all about my brain okay that's a good point so we're going to check out the big brain on you and we're going to talk about that as a third force called our subconscious so the first thing we need to appreciate about the brain as marvelous as it is it's built by genes and it's built for genes so there are there's no shortage of studies where there have been found genetic components associated with a variety of neurological conditions from suicide to schizophrenia to ocd even memory and learning so we have to appreciate that there certainly is a genetic component to the brain and just like we didn't go shopping for our genes we don't get to choose what genes we have at birth we don't get to choose what kind of brain is built from those genes so as marvelous as this organ is we have to appreciate those limitations you also have to be aware that your brain makes a lot of assumptions it's an energy hog it consumes about 20 percent of your daily caloric intake just to just to run on a basal level so it takes a lot of mental shortcuts it likes to assume things it generalizes its stereotypes and it does that to save energy so you may think this gentleman is suffering from a migraine headache because his he's holding his temples when in fact he may have actually super glued his fingers there unlikely but we can't dismiss that possibility but our brain just to illustrate the point is going to jump to an assumption and we need to stay vigilant of that there's also no shortage of studies that suggest how the environment may be priming our brain in ways that we're not aware of for example you're more likely to be denied parole if a judge hears your case before lunch you're more likely to be greedy in a fiscal game like monopoly after reading business magazines people who are shown an apple logo are more creative at doing puzzles and you're more likely to buy italian wine if italian music is playing in the shop even if you're not paying attention to the music per se so when you reach the end of the day and wonder why you did or said a certain thing it could have been because you were exposed at a subconscious level to something that happened to you during the day that caused you to do or say that activity and this usually happens underneath the radar there's also no shortage of things that can affect the brain sometimes in obvious ways but sometimes much more subtly the brain is subject to injury surgery tumors toxins infection old age and medication the classic case is phineas gage the railroad worker in the 1800s who suffered an accident on the job whereby a spike blew through his brain and damaged a significant part of his thermal cortex miraculously he survived this accident but he according to accounts was not the same person afterwards he went from a reliable polite person to being a rather rude and unreliable person because of this brain damage we're seeing similar things with the concussion disease known as cte this has been getting a lot of press in recent years people engaged in contact sports who suffer concussions over time seems to be linked to dramatic changes in behavior and usually very dark changes in behavior that can lead to violence and suicide the clock tower shooter many of you are aware of this story this heinous act where this all-american kid an eagle scout suddenly snapped one day and started shooting random people from the top of a clock tower on a college campus turns out upon autopsy it was revealed he had a tumor pressing up against the amygdala in his brain which is the fear center of the brain and is attributed to this horrible behavior change that was exhibited in his case similar case in 1982 this fellow committed a horrible mass shooting at a mcdonald's in san diego and upon autopsy it was revealed that he had some of the highest levels of cadmium and lead in his brain that have ever been recorded he was a welder for 15 years before this um this heinous act that he committed and it is thought that the toxins that were permeating his brain contributed to this horrible act that of violence that he committed one of the other very interesting experiments done by dr mark levine illustrates how evolutionary ghosts may haunt our brain today so for those of you who aren't familiar with this example um these are two soccer teams liverpool and manchester and they're arch rivals the fans really don't like one another a lot so he did a priming experiment where he questioned fans feeding them very specific types of questions and then put them into an experiment where people pretended to have an accident so in the first experiment the manchester fans were questioned about their team when they were questioned about their team they were more likely to help people wearing a manchester jersey but they did not help people wearing the arch rivals jersey okay speaks to something rather dark about how we form uh tribes very quickly and us them divisions in our brain so the interesting part was he repeated this experiment but asked manchester fans about the camaraderie of soccer fans in general regardless of the team just we all love soccer now when he did that the uh the manchester fans were willing to help people regardless of the team jersey they wore but if they weren't wearing a soccer jersey they were less inclined to help so this really illustrates how you can manipulate someone's thinking patterns to um get on the us them side of the fence that you want them to so we need to be vigilant of this bad habit that the brain has and it does it to conserve energy i like this quote here from coddling of the american mind we should be doing everything we can to turn down the tribalism and turn up the sense of common humanity if we do that i think we can get around this shortcoming that haunts our brain the final force i want to talk to you about today are the microbes that live on and inside of us so we're going to pull up a stool for a moment and talk about the microbiome you probably heard this term before it refers to the three pounds of bacteria that live inside your gut or on your skin or other places in the body scientists have appreciated in very recent years that these bacteria in our guts are doing a lot more than just helping us digest food they are producing 90 of our serotonin which is a critical neurotransmitter in the brain that governs our mood they also produce chemicals that can affect our immune system and they produce molecules like butyrate which affects the epigenetic machinery so think about that the bacteria in your gut are making molecules that can change how your genes are expressed pretty profound stuff so how does this relate to disease and behaviors there's some fascinating studies that have been pioneered by jeffrey gordon at washu using germ free mice these are mice that are born sterily through a c-section so they don't have any microbes on them and they haven't been exposed to any microbes at any point in their life this allows scientists to then transplant microbes into that germ-free mouse and see what effects arise so we talked about identical twins that are discordant for obesity earlier on where identical twins one is lean and one is obese so here we have some germ-free mice who received intestinal bacteria from a lean identical twin and nothing really happens the mouth stays lean and healthy but if that germ-free mouse received intestinal bacteria from the obese twin check it out that mouth starts to overeat and become obese these mice i remind you they're genetically identical the only difference between them is the intestinal bacteria that they received from the donors so this tells us that in addition to genetics epigenetics there may be a microbial component that is driving obesity another example relates to depression so just like human beings mice generally are happy creatures they are social they enjoy treats and if you threaten their life they will make an attempt to save their own lives however if you deplete their microbiome and then substitute you give them a microbiome that came from a depressed person that mouse will now exhibit symptoms of depression it will lose interest in interacting with its its littermates it will lose interest in treats and if you drop it in a bucket of water it won't try to swim out so it exhibits these symptoms of depression and again all that happened was a change in the bacteria that inhabit its gut so this is telling us that depression may also have a microbial component there's also microbes that infect many people's bodies that are not bacterial in origin but maybe parasitic so this is the one that we study in my laboratory at i um the iu school of medicine toxoplasma gondii here's a little picture of the parasite it is a single-celled organism and this is what it does to the brain it goes to the brain and sets up these little lesions where it has done some minor tissue damage and stays there for the rest of your life the immune system can't clear this parasite once you're infected and the disturbing part of all of this is that one-third of human beings on the planet we're talking billions and billions of people carry this parasite in their head and they don't even know it and that's because the parasite doesn't cause overt symptoms unless you're immune compromised and then it can be life-threatening but in normal healthy adults and children this parasite really doesn't register it doesn't really cause a sickness it's so common because we can get it from a cat and we can also get it from undercooked meat or unwashed vegetables anywhere a cat might have gone to the bathroom like a sandbox or something like that so that leads up that explains why so many people are infected now do we need to worry about it well that's a good question emerging studies are suggesting that people who are positive for toxoplasma have a higher chance of developing schizophrenia rage disorder risk taking or anxiety issues and they're three times more likely to be involved in a car accident so these are just correlation studies at the moment and um you know we can't say anything with definitive proof at the time but it definitely warrants further investigation given how many people around the world are carrying this parasite it could be affecting them or at least a subset of them at a neurological level that has yet to be appreciated so just to conclude here i basically explained four different hidden biological forces that are conspiring to shape our behavior and personality and if you read between the lines of this talk i basically extracted a lot of the free will and agency out of your lives and said that all of your behavior and personality has a biological basis how is all that good news so knowledge is always power and as i illustrate in the last chapter of the book meet your future we are on the cusp of developing gene editing tools like crispr and cast 9 to go in and repair genes that have variations so one day maybe my grandchildren we can fix that taster gene and make broccoli great again for those children we're also developing epigenetic drugs like the one shelly burger is using in her laboratory to change an ants behavior these can have a vast amount of clinical usage once we can get specificity to certain genes that we want to turn on or off environmental engineering is a concept that is very simple and usually extremely cost effective and it's usually the humanitarian thing to do we know that children who are neglected or abused for example who suffer these adverse experiences not only have psychological scars but dna scars as well so we need to try to ensure environments where that simply doesn't happen if we can get together and eradicate poverty and childhood disease institute better programs for bullying and neglect we can address some of these issues in a very significant manner a very exciting frontier in medicine is remodeling the microbiome as i told you there seems to be a intestinal bacterial component to diseases such as obesity depression there's also studies to suggest the microbiomes involved in addiction and aging as well so we can try to find ways to remodel the microbiome for better health outcomes and a topic i didn't have time to explain today is brain computer interfaces where we can help repair damaged brains or even enhance fully functional ones with just some mind-blowing advances in how we're being able to merge um computers uh with with um with our brain so just some really exciting things on the horizon so with that i just like to remind everybody that's the thesis of the book if you're interested in these sorts of topics i want to assure you that i tried to treat the topics um with uh with the understanding that they are complex but i try to break them down into very digestible units so i hope i didn't scare anyone off but rather and rolled out the carpet for you to to come in and see what this is all about i think you'll be very impressed um with how you're really working once you once you learn the truths behind uh our behavior and personality and with that uh i would again like to thank the organizers uh for this opportunity to speak and would love to hear some of the questions that people might have well thank you bill that was a great presentation and i really really enjoyed your book i was at times thrilled and other times frightened and then uh came to the conclusion that maybe i could control it by my behaviors um as a psychologist so i have a couple of questions for you while we're waiting for other questions to come in and one is um you touched on the topic of precision medicine and i think it was actually woven through your presentations so what do you think the most promising areas for precision medicine are from your perspective i think the um most immediate thing that's on the horizon is probably reshaping the microbiome that is much more within our reach than some of the other technologies which we're tantalizingly close to like gene editing for example so um as soon as gene editing becomes a thing then we can really get in there and make precision medicine work we can eliminate and repair things like sickle cell or huntington's disease congenital blindness uh even certain cancer mutations that predispose people to developing tumors if we have that technology and it's specific enough without side effects we can go in there and repair those genes crispr cast 9 is the system that recently won a nobel prize that is the most promising technique that has been devised to date and um as soon as that gets perfected which may be within the next 40 50 years that will revolutionize how we approach genetics and it's also going to open up a bunch of ethical worms as well you know it can of worms with regard to bioethics because the next step in addressing disease genes is what about genes for other qualities like memory or learning or things like that so remodeling the microbiome is probably the closest there's already a cure for a disease called c diff which is clostridium difficile this is usually a super infection that occurs in people for a variety of reasons but once it takes root it's extremely difficult to get rid of with therapeutics but if we do what's called a a fecal transplantation which sounds gross but it's really just bacteria in a pill you can think of it that way they swallow these bacteria and they repopulate the gut with the endogenous bacteria that should be living there rather than the c diff it is it's got like a 95 cure rate which is just astonishing and much better than any of the therapeutics that have been devised today so bill we have a question from someone about genetic testing and she wants to know why genetic testing is it more common and more affordable very good question i think it's improving so if we go back to the ozzy osbourne example which was just 10 years ago just one decade it was extremely expensive to sequence a genome and it took weeks to do that and it took even longer to analyze this avalanche of data and extract some sort of biological meaning from it so in just 10 years we've reduced that cost to probably just several hundred dollars maybe a thousand dollars and we can sequence a genome in a weekend i mean it's just phenomenal progress so within the next five to ten years it's really hard to imagine how much more this is going to be accelerated so i think we're on the cusp of watching this technology explode and i wouldn't be surprised if genomic sequencing might be part of a physical down the road assuming that people can get over the privacy and ethical issues related to that but based on what i'm seeing with the explosion of commercial kits out there that invite people to send in their saliva for genetic testing it seems that people are most people are less concerned about the privacy and more curious about what their dna says and what it could imply for their future and i think utilizing those companies is is useful to a degree but you should discuss those results with a physician or a trained genetic counselor so that you get an expert eye to interpret them with you thank you um we have another question about alzheimer's disease one of our listeners said that his mother his or her mother was a really sweet person and then developed alzheimer's disease and became quite difficult and and mean um so can you speak a little bit to brain changes associated with a progressive degenerative disease like alzheimer's disease sure and my heart goes out to individuals who are affected by these these neurological conditions alzheimer's is just one subset of a variety of different forms of dementia uh that unfortunately uh uh you know cause horrible things to happen to individuals and obviously affect their friends and loved ones so um there's a we really don't know the the the biological basis of things like alzheimer's what we do know is that there are changes taking place in the brain these are neurodegenerative diseases so over time and the speed of it varies from one person to the other there are changes taking place that destroy the neurons that make up the brain and once we disrupt that network it basically destroys who we are and what this tells me as a scientist who's interested in the biological basis of the self is that we really are a product of our neurophysiology we really are our brains and once those are damaged whether it be through alzheimer's or an injury or a tumor this impinges on behavior sometimes in subtle ways but sometimes in very dramatic ways and i really do hope that we continue to invest large sums of money that go towards research for trying to find the root cause of these dementia diseases so that we will be in a better position to prevent them or develop a medication and and that's where we really need to go because once the neurodegeneration occurs that at least at present is an irreversible road there's no way to to recapitulate the the brain cells that have been destroyed we have another great question about a gaba deficiency this uh person sending in the question um has restless leg syndrome and um also notice that alcoholism often is a common co-occurrence with a gaba deficiency and wants to know um first of all whether this may be an epigenetic phenomena the restless leg syndrome and what can be done in the absence of an effective treatment to um address things like restless leg syndromes or other behaviors that are associated with gaba deficiencies yes um i i wish i i wish i had a better answer for this i don't think there's any better treatment than what the physician can already offer i wouldn't be surprised you know restless leg syndrome strikes me as a subset of ocd it's a it's a motor activity that the person cannot control very easily and i wouldn't be surprised at all if it's related to gaba deficiency in the brain the gaba system is extremely complex much more so than i let on the presentation and it involves a lot of other moving parts so there are enzymes that make gaba there's enzymes that break gaba down there's receptors that bind to the gaba and allow it to function properly and there's competitive chemicals that are made as well so in addition to inhibitory neurotransmitters we have excitatory neurotransmitters like like glutamate and some people gaba might be fine but glutamine glutamate may be an overdrive so exactly what's going on there's multiple possibilities and that's what makes it so hard um to develop uh medications against this because at the present there's just too many possibilities and not enough ways to discern which one is the root cause one of the people who i met at a book signing actually was diagnosed with a gaba deficiency and apparently is taking a medication i don't know if this is experimental or not but this person basically said they were in insomniacs pretty much all of their life and once they got on this medication and they didn't know what the name of it was uh they were finally able to sleep at night so there are some inroads being made and i hope research continues so that we can better understand the gaba system because once we do then we'll be in position to develop new medications as to the epigenetic component of that question i'm not aware of any evidence to suggest that in humans just yet but i wouldn't be surprised in the least if there is an epigenetic component at least in a subset of some people so we can see this activity arise from a genetic variation but epigenetics can certainly come into play so um before i ask the next question i'm going to put in a plug for the all of us program which is trying to recruit a million people to answer these kinds of questions by asking people to provide blood samples and um they're all going to undergo genetic analysis and the participants will get their own genetic information back but these are the kinds of questions that all of us is designed to answer but we have another question and it really um speaks to your very interesting presentation on the microbiome and it's about taking probiotics so one of our listeners wanted to know if um taking probiotics is a good idea your book sort of provoked that thought that um maybe taking probiotics might make her feel better um and maybe less anxious what do you think about that there are certainly some studies that suggest that there are some studies that contradict it so i would say at the at the moment we don't know for certain so what i generally advise people when they ask me that question and i get that question every time uh so it's a good one uh if it works for you great stick with it i i think that would be wonderful there really are not a lot of adverse effects that i've seen associated with taking probiotics there were one or two small studies that suggested that maybe over time they could produce a brain fog but those studies are few and far between there don't seem to be any um significant side effects with taking probiotics you should be aware however if you're not already that probiotics currently doesn't fall under government regulation so there's no regulatory process in place to inspect these products or do quality control on what they might actually contain some of them may be fine but there are studies that have pulled random probiotics off the shelves and they either don't have the bacteria that they proclaim to have or they don't have the colony forming units that they suggest is in their product and that could be storage issues as well so most people who go down the probiotic road should be aware of that they should also be aware that the refrigerated probiotics are probably better they will they will stay fresher and the colony forming units are probably more accurate what most physicians would suggest is a healthy diet rather than the probiotic route this is a concept called prebiotics and i explain more about this in the book prebiotics is the notion that you're going to cultivate your own garden of bacteria in your gut okay and you're not going to try to force bacteria to get down there because there are studies to suggest that probiotics don't survive the stomach but if you ingest prebiotics which are fermented foods and fiber which are like a fertile soil for the good bacteria to grow then you can kind of heal your microbiome in a more natural way so things like sauerkraut kimchi yogurts these are prebiotic foods that have ingredients that allow healthy bacteria to flourish in your gut fiber is a really important one and it is not a lot it is an ingredient that a lot of people do not get from the american diet and it cultivates bacteria that help build a strong mucous layer in in the intestine which is really important for preventing what's called leaky gut syndrome which sounds as awful as it is so if you if you intake a lot of fiber you grow these bacteria that can build a better intestinal wall and guard against things like leaky gut syndrome so long story short the approach that i would personally favor is to have a better diet rather than attempting experiments with probiotics so um bill we have another question and it's about your mice in the almond study so um the person wrote in and wants to know if that behavior those behaviors were reversible in other words can you reverse the aversion to the smell of almonds it goes away after several generations it reverts on its own so so in these behavioral studies and a lot of other model organisms this has been recapitulated there's a round worm called c elegans where a lot of these studies are done too because they have very short generation times and when you see this learned behavior inherited in the children or the grandchildren it usually sticks around for several generations but then gets diluted out it goes it goes away as long as the stimulation is not reapplied so what this is telling us if we're interpreting the results correctly is that this is kind of a short-term evolutionary advantage you're basically pre-programming the fetus while it's still in the womb to be prepared for the parents environment okay so if the parents are experiencing some sort of stress or starvation the fetus is being pre-programmed to be born into that environment okay and if subsequent generations don't experience that environment this effect seems to go away it seems to revert back to the the normal condition so bill i'm sorry to say that our time is about over for the questions but i understand that you're willing to stay around we've got a couple of other questions that have come in that are really good but right now i'm going to turn this back over to darlene caskey from the national library of medicine thank you thank you dorothy thank you bill this was very enlightening and very engaging and we've had several questions come in and so there are a few more so bill thank you for your generosity um yeah if you'll stick around for another 10 minutes or so after this presentation maybe more questions can get answered but i encourage people who have not read your book to borrow it from their public library or pick up a copy from their favorite bookstore and thank you once again to the all of us research program for its support of the nnlm reading club

surgeon you can learn more about his book and find a discussion guide on the n and lm reading club website so thank you if you could stick around please do so otherwise thank you for joining us and this does conclude today's nnlm reading club presents [Music] do [Music] [Music] so thank you bill for sticking around a little bit longer to ask to answer a couple more questions that came in and if people are still with us please feel free to continue to ask your questions or add your comments one of the questions that came in is you talked about the changes so is it safe to assume that viruses can also cause similar changes yes they absolutely can and i'd like to break the answer down into two different parts that relates to viruses so the the first one is viruses that affect our body uh there's evidence out there for those who don't know viruses are intracellular parasites so they get inside of our cells and viruses are nothing more than a little bit of nucleic acid a little dna or a little rna they don't have much more than that so they have to get inside of one of our cells in order to replicate themselves because they pilfer our cellular machinery to do so and then they either blow out of that cell and infect neighboring ones or stay in there for a longer period of time and these epigenetic changes can take place inside of that cell now these are usually changes that manipulate the immune system in ways that give the virus an edge so that it can persist for a longer period of time so that's one aspect of it the other aspect that's related to this question is something called phage and these are not viruses that affect our bodies per se phage are viruses that affect bacteria and they they infect and destroy bacteria very specifically so one sort of phage that destroys one species of bacteria will probably have no effect on a different type of bacteria and you probably know where i'm going with this this has significance when we talk about the microbiome or illnesses of pathogenic bacteria in our guts we could use phage viruses that only infect certain types of bacteria as a way to eradicate bacterial infections in the gut or a way to possibly remodel the microbiome so those are two aspects of the virus question that i wanted to get across thank you one other question how do people get tested for the toxoplasmosis with the lesions on the brain toxoplasmosis is tested by blood so when you are infected with toxoplasma you make antibodies to the parasite and those will stay with you for life like in any other infection so there are blood tests available for toxoplasma in many countries around the world where toxoplasmosis is more commonly seen in congenital infections there's actually screening of pregnant women one of the things i didn't get time to mention during the talk is that one of the more serious clinical manifestations of toxoplasma is that if a woman who is pregnant uh becomes infected for the first time during that pregnancy it can lead to uh miscarriage or uh rather catastrophic birth defects depending on when the parasite crossed the placenta during the pregnancy and that doesn't happen too often in the united states but in other countries around the world it's more of a problem and those women are screened periodically during their pregnancy to ensure that they haven't become infected with toxoplasma so a blood test is the short answer it usually is not diagnosed um with a brain scan because if you need such a diagnostic tool you're already usually exhibiting some sort of neurological effects and a neurologist would be equipped to discern whether that's the case and i should stress that most normal healthy people do not exhibit symptoms of toxoplasmosis it usually only occurs at a symptomatic level uh in immune immune compromised individuals i do remember it when i was pregnant reading it in books you know not to clean the cat litter you know things like that and and that's precisely why it's it's to minimize the possibility of becoming infected with toxoplasma while the person is pregnant yeah exposure well we don't seem to have any more questions that have come in so i think we could wrap this up but i hope people do read your book i loved it you're a very good writer can we anticipate a new book coming out anytime well first i'm very flattered to hear that and i i thank you and everyone else who is watching and for the excellent questions uh yes i'm contemplating a new book i don't have any definitive news on it at the moment we'll have to see if anyone's willing to buy it good well thank you thank you for being joining us and being willing to participate and um we learned a lot thank you very much so that concludes the q a [Music] [Music] [Music] you
