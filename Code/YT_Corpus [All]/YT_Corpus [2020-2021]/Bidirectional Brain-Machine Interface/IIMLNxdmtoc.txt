Before begin we begin, I have some housekeeping items You can submit questions during the webinar by clicking on the question mark in the WebEx toolbar Please direct your questions to all panelists We will open the floor to questions that have been submitted via WebEx at the conclusion of today's talk The slides and video recording will be posted on our website: prevention. NIH.gov/mindthegap in approximately one week. You'll receive an email when they are available Lastly we would appreciate your feedback about today's webinar. Upon closing the WebEx meeting, you'll be prompted to complete an evaluation We would appreciate your feedback as it will help us improve this webinar series. At this time, I'd like to introduce Dr. David M. Murray Associate Director for Prevention and the Director of the Office of Disease Prevention. Thank You, Marie, Today's speaker is Dr. Siobhan Phillips. Dr. Phillips is an associate professor in the Department of Preventive Medicine at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine and the Director of Physical Activity Promotion at the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center Her interdisciplinary research is focused on understanding the determinants and outcomes of physical activity; designing, testing, and optimizing innovative and effective behavior change interventions; and disseminating and implementing this research to practice for the primary focus on cancer survivors Dr. Phillips' work has been funded by the National Institute on Aging and the National Cancer Institute She has an M.P.H. from Harvard and a Ph.D. in kinesiology from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign She completed her postdoctoral training in the cancer prevention fellowship at the National Cancer Institute It's my pleasure to welcome Dr. Phillips. Thank you for the introduction and I'm excited to talk today about using technology to understand and promote physical activity behavior and Just to note I don't have any conflicts of interest to disclose So I'm sure this is not a surprise to most of the audience, you know, there are many benefits of physical activity participation including a reduced risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, many cancers, dementia, anxiety and depression falls and falls-related injuries, and also improved quality of life, cognition, sleep, bone health, physical function, and also can aid in maintaining a weight or losing weight and preventing weight regain following initial weight loss and because of all of these recommendations or all of these benefits of physical activity, There are actually federal guidelines the first out of that were developed in 2008 and they just updated them in 2018 and the physical activity guidelines suggest that Individuals should engage in moderate intensity aerobic activity for 150 minutes per week. And Muscle strengthening activities two times per week for the entire body and in general the new addition in the 2018 guidelines is to address sedentary behavior and the idea that moving more and sitting less throughout the day is important and some physical activity and Some activity is better than none because adults who do any amount of moderate to vigorous physical activity gain some health benefits So, why does physical activity matter in addition to kind of all of these benefits there are also high costs associated with inadequate physical activity. These data are from the physical activity guidelines committee. There is 117 billion dollars in annual health care costs because of inadequate physical activity and ten percent of premature mortality can actually be attributed to inactive to inadequate physical activity. Despite all of the benefits of physical activity and the potential costs of physical inactivity only about a quarter of Americans meet both the aerobic and muscle strengthening guidelines that are proposed in the 2018 guidelines So obviously Despite all these benefits, we are not doing a very good job getting people to be active And so, you know kind of trying to think about you know why this is the case and kind of understanding physical activity behavior is important and technology, especially smartphones and wearables, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous and they may offer a useful tool for understanding and promoting physical activity behavior and helping to increase the number of people meeting the physical activity guidelines The latest data indicate that 96 percent of Americans own cell phones and 81 percent of these own a smartphone and That about 22 percent of Americans own wearables. So this is things like fit bits or other types of accessories that Monitor activity or monitor heart rate to be other types of wearables as well so this is particularly important because what we know about physical activity right now is primarily based on infrequent self reports because what has kind of been even the gold standard of measurement right now in a free-living measurement and using accelerometers or even direct observation, we don't know that much about physical activity outside of these discrete time points and so technology could actually help us to understand physical activity behavior better because it provides an opportunity to collect a high volume of data both actively and passively from participants at a greater frequency and lower cost and it may also help us engage individuals who we might not get to come into a research lab Or who might not show up to a community center where a lot of our work, you know, a lot of research is conducted It can also allow for collection of many data streams at many levels unobtrusively And it can allow us to incorporate To more easily integrate physical activity data with other important data streams so we can integrate physical activity data with self-reported Surveys or feedback from participants. We compare with other sensors like heartrate monitors or glucose monitors. We can look at GIS or GPS data We could even potentially link it to medical records data and you know medical and actual health and disease outcomes from those data we could also link it to publicly available data on crime on weather and Also even potentially get more information on contacts by having people upload videos or pictures of where they're being active and even connect to social media and kind of see how people are talking about physical activity or you know, or engaging with content related to physical activity on social media And all of this data I could potentially help us get at more information about physical activity including Synchronicities to the extent to which explanatory factors co-occur in time and space with physical activity Instability so patterns or fluctuations and changes in factor in physical activity and the factors that influence physical activity and Sequentiality, so this is kind of the temporal sequence of antecedents and outcomes of physical activity behaviors and ultimately, all of these data could potentially help us understand physical activity behavior better, which could lead to the ability to design more effective physical activity interventions and so we know what might this look like in terms of the application in the real world. So you could essentially gather information on where a person is located if they have a smartphone From their smartphone. You could collect information on you know what they're doing right now where they're at So get some additional context besides just geographic location. You can also collect information on Motivational factors or symptoms and be able to Understand how those are impacting a physical activity behavior You can have them wear a monitor and there's research grade monitors like accelerometers But there's also now consumer wearables have much longer battery life so we can actually get a physical activity for you know Actually objectively monitor physical activity for longer and longer periods of times without having to necessarily worry about battery life And you can collect information on weather, crime, and medical records data. You can get a more complete picture of not just you know What physical activity they're doing but kind of the context in which they're doing it and better understand What is influencing physical activity on a day to day basis to get a more complete picture of You know what's influencing physical activity behavior And so in terms of thinking about how all of this information or how these tools can help us promote physical activity Tech-supported interventions generally have a greater reach and are more scalable than traditional face-to-face Interventions because they require fewer resources and are generally less burdensome on participants They don't have to come to a facility to exercise with us they can do it, you know in the comfort of their own home and their neighborhood and Technology also allows us to more easily remotely monitor patients. So during, you know a traditional home-based trials you may have people fill out paper logs and mail them back to you or you know You wouldn't actually assess their activity until kind of the beginning and the end but with technology you might actually be able to monitor them remotely and kind of see when they're falling off the wagon, and ultimately we can integrate physical activity with data streams to allow us to better understand physical activity and improve and tailor our Interventions and get our interventions out to the people who need them the most And so you know the question then of course is well do technology supported interventions work? And meta-analyses from the general population Have been conducted. There's been a lot of different types of meta analyses that have looked at different types of technology interventions and Overall, I would say that most indicate technologies supported interventions have a moderate effect on physical activity However, some reviews have actually found that there is no effect on physical activity um It is important to note that very few of these interventions tested technology alone Many included some human elements such as support calls or coaching calls and this could enhance the effectiveness of the technology So we really don't necessarily know if it's you know if it's the technology alone or the technology in combination with some of these other more traditional intervention approaches So I'm going to go through some examples of how we are using technology in our lab to understand physical activity behavior and then I'll go through some examples on how we're using it to actually try to promote physical activity and so the first example I'm going to go through is the impact study and the this study was funded by the Lindsay's Cancer Research Foundation and The goal is to explore the relationship between the physical activity; clinical, motivational, and patient reported outcomes, using ecological momentary assessment or EMA and EMA involves repeated sampling of subject's current behaviors and experiences in real-time in subject's natural environments EMA aims to minimize recall bias, maximize ecological validity, and allow on the study of micro processes that influence Behavior in real-world contexts and so as Dr. Murray mentioned, most of my research focuses on cancer survivors, so we were actually looking at physical activity during chemotherapy Because the data suggests that physical activity tends to decline during treatment. But again, most of these data are based on Snapshots or recalls and so we were kind of interested in looking at objectively what's happening during Chemotherapy and we recruited participants from oncology clinics to participate in three bursts of data collection At the beginning, middle, and end of chemotherapy each burst was 10 days Long and ideally we had participants and we'll prior to their first is at chemo But they could enroll after they had received one dose of chemo And then each of these 10-day bursts included a three-day pre chemo Three days pre chemotherapy, the day after chemotherapy, and then the seven days following chemotherapy or the whole week of chemotherapy and During each burst of data collection, they wore an actigraph 24/7 on a hip during the day and the wrist at night and they completed four text message prompts They were kind of like the beginning, mid to late morning, late afternoon and then evening At all for prompts we assessed symptoms including physical and cognitive functioning, pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and Overall affect. At the first prompt, we assessed motivational factors for physical activity that day including self-advocacy Goal-setting and outcome expectations and at the end of the day we assessed these same motivational factors for moderate and vigorous physical activity for the next day Additionally everyone completed a traditional online questionnaire battery at each time point And then at the end, they also did a process evaluation to get some information on acceptability of the procedures We also collected medical record data, on treatment, pathology reports, body weight, and immune response at the end of the study for all participants and then about half of the sample also wore a Fitbit from this time of study enrollment until two weeks after the last cycle of chemotherapy We had a lot of data and we had 75 women who consented and were eligible to participate and of those 84% completed all three time points. You can see the reasons for withdrawal a lot of them had discontinuation of chemotherapy or Health complications. There were some people who did withdraw because they thought that the study was too burdensome Which we did anticipate some of that in general our sample looks pretty similar to the breast cancer the typical breast cancer survivor population or breast cancer patient population They were about they were 48 and a half years old on average Mostly early stage disease. About half reported very good/excellent status. Most were on average overweight We had about 23% of our sample was non-white and 13% was Hispanic/Latino Most were highly educated working at least part-time and about half were pretty high income and so this graph and I don't expect you to really be able to read this. That's kind of the point to it. This graph represents moderate to vigorous physical activity Over the 30 days in a study for each participant overall, they engage in approximately 20 minutes per day of moderate and vigorous physical activity, which is comparable if not a bit higher than most breast cancer survivor studies what we found was daily physical activity moderate vigorous physical activity declined across chemotherapy and Physical activity was higher on the days preceding chemotherapy than on days following chemotherapy and About 75 percent of the difference in moderate and vigorous physical activity was actually attributed to in person variation Which you can see by how much these lines are going up and down in this graph So some days are really active some days are not there's a lot of variation in people's behavior Although here at the bottom are those are the people that are not active at all They're consistently not active And so we used a mixed model controlling for relevant covariates to examine the relationship between daily symptoms and moderate and vigorous physical activity Looking at both between subjects effects Which we defined as the association between overall Average daily symptom measurements across the 30 days and then within subjects effects Which we were defined as an individual's daily deviation from their own 30 day average overall higher average functional limitations for walking were associated with less moderate and vigorous physical activity While increased overall average cognitive functioning was associated with increased physical activity and then on days when participants reported better affect and cognitive functioning than their average then gave to engaged in more moderate and vigorous physical activity in contrast on days when they Experienced worse than average anxiety, fatigue, pain, and physical functioning for everyday activities as walking they reported less moderate and vigorous physical activity Which is, you know, kind of what you would expect that days that they're feeling worse they're less active And then we also conducted another mixed model controlling for relevant co-variates to examine the relationship between Social cognitive theory variables and MVPA, so this is looking at that the current days so the morning measurements and Then activity day achieved throughout the day to examine the role of motivational factors on moderate and vigorous physical activity in this population What we found was no between person effects were significant However on days when participants reported better than, higher than average self-efficacy physical and psychological outcome expectations and goal-setting They engaged in more moderate and vigorous physical activity that day. Again, this is kind of what we see in These snapshot literature when we're looking at kind of average self-efficacy and average physical activity but when we're seeing this also at the day level so that Some of the variation in daily activity is actually due to variation potentially and motivational factors And so This is just one example of how you could potentially use technology to collect more data to understand physical activity These more granular data can help us better understand fluctuations and activity And I mean we were looking more at the day level but you can get even more granular Than that so you could look at you know, the 30 minutes before a prompt, you could look at Their activity 30 minutes before a prompt, 30 minutes after a prompt, you know an hour You could look at lag effects of previous day symptoms on next day symptoms. There's a lot of different ways you could look at these data to understand physical activity behavior and you know, so in summary kind of thinking about how Technology might help us better understand physical activity. I think there's a lot of opportunities Technology is relatively easy to use. Overall our patients found they really didn't have any excuse using their technology They you know use their own smartphones So they were really familiar with it There really were not, you know too many issues with that It gives us, you know, there's widespread adoption of technology so we could potentially look at these relationships in Various groups of individuals. It was relatively unobtrusive except for us prompting them four times a day That part was not unobtrusive, but it only took them about two minutes to actually answer The prompts. I knew these data may be more accurate at least these daily level data in front of these in the moment data may be more accurate and recalls and you know we were able to collect a lot of information to help us better understand what may influence the Influencing physical activity during chemotherapy and this could be applied to many other contexts and settings But of course there's a lot of challenges it can be burdensome. We had I believe it was about an 80% response rate to our prompts, but and we did not actually incentivize them to answer the prompts. In some studies you do get incentives for every prompt you answer But you know it was it could be burdensome like the prompts can come at times when people don't want them or if you're wearing all of these different monitoring devices It can get a little overwhelming and burdensome among participants to remember to wear them and charge them And answer all these prompts or turn on different features of their phones. There's also tech challenges So, you know, it's technology's not perfect. There can be issues with battery Data not transmitting, people not carrying their phone  Lot of different issues that can come up with the technology And then in thinking about EMA kind of monitoring these even just monitoring people at this high level of like that's high Intensity level it could actually be an intervention in and of itself, you know They feel there could be some kind of Hawthorne effect. And so what we're observing is, you know, actually not true It's kind of in response to this heavy level of monitoring but at least, you know, there are many devices that don't give feedback. So you hope that that's not the case You know and when you're sending prompts to people over and over again It can start to get mindless and people just kind of you know are always continuously picking the same response And not actually reading your questions. So that's of course a concern. And then you know, I think these are getting people there's always privacy concerns You know on the information on the data you're collecting and some people might be without sensitive or not want to share information and especially when you start getting into like GPS data or even you know, now you can even potentially Get it social contacts and they can cooperate on like other people's phones and who you're next to and so there can be issues with privacy concerns and Then you know what I'm talking about here with all aerobic physical activity. There's pretty good ways to measure Aerobic activity remotely and using technology But there aren't as many there aren't those tools for strength training or resistance training exercises And so, you know that presents a challenge in and of itself To try to figure out how we might monitor those activities because they also are important and then of course, the amount of data you get from doing a study like this is very large and we really need some advanced methods for making sense of these large volumes of data and you need only And they scratched the surface on what we could potentially do with these data. There's tons of different questions we could ask and I think you know as more and more data comes become available our ability to handle these data are going to get better and better and We'll be able to make even more sensitive and understand physical activity at an even more detailed level So now switching gears a bit to the intervention phase and how we can use technology and interventions I'm going to talk a little bit about some of the real-world examples in our lab And you know looking at how we're actually using Technology to promote physical activity and actually in our case, we are working on trying to optimize technology supported interventions So in considering the technology-supported intervention, starting off with physical activity promotion for a technology-supported physical activity promotion intervention, there is a long list of different potential options. You could consider Including in your intervention, so there's educational information, you could have a coach, you could have teams, you could give people buddies, fitbits, you could have incentives, there's extra games. There's online group webinars Fit bits, you could give them an app, they could have a variety of different features, kind of text messages, exercise videos, and you know the list goes on and on and so In thinking about well, you know, where do you start or what is kind of the most the optimal Pieces or the you know, really the components that matter. If I was using the classical treatment package approach, which I have done in, you know several interventions I would pick my favorites from that list Roll them all together into the intervention black box and test them in a randomized control trial Comparing my intervention to a control. Um, I want to know there's absolutely Nothing wrong with this approach. However, there are some limitations with this approach at the best case scenario You'll have a significant effect, you know your intervention worked However, you won't know which components are contributing to the effects, whether the inclusion of one component impacts the effect of another Whether a component's contribution offsets its cost but that all components are really needed how to make interventions more effective, efficient, and scalable and then on the flip side you could also end up with a non significant effect and you won't know whether any component is worth retaining, whether one component had a negative effect that offset the positive effect of another, and specifically what went wrong and how to do it better next time and you know You would have thrown this all together without actually including your target population in the process and So this is where MOST or the multi-phase optimization strategy Kind of comes into play. MOST is an engineering and inspired framework for optimizing and evaluating interventions to efficiently and systematically identify the most promising intervention components or Component levels. A component is anything that can be reasonably separated out for study and can include things like specific attention strategies or an intervention feature like a Fitbit, a coach or Anything like that And typically most studies that use the MOST framework use two levels which can be on/off or some type of variable intensities, so like six vs twelve coaching calls and You know this framework has really been You know promoted and really been Developed by Linda Collins at Penn State and MOST involves four phases The first thing is the preparation phase which involves development of a conceptual model Identifying candidate intervention components and identifying an optimization criteria you're basing decisions on. The second thing is the optimization phase in which you actually estimate the individual contributions of intervention components and the interactions between components Decide which to retain at what levels or settings and then finally you ideally assemble these Components into an intervention and evaluate in a randomized control trial. However if you do not Have enough effective components, you might go back to the preparation phase and repeat you can see there's this reciprocal arrow or bi-directional arrow and this suggests that you're continuously trying to optimize an intervention and MOST lends itself Particularly well to technology based interventions because many components are easy to turn on or off So, you know, it may just be as simple as clicking a button So, you know to give a participant a component or not and so I'm gonna talk about how we're kind of applying most in our ongoing studies within our lab And so I was funded by an NCI Career Development Award to use MOST in breast cancer survivors to design an optimized physical activity intervention for this population This is a two phase study that is trying to answer the questions of if we build it Will they come and then will it work. The goal of phase one was really to understand survivor's interests and preferences use this data to develop the interventions to component to test in Phase two and Then and really engage them in the development of the intervention and then phase two the goal was to apply MOST using a factorial experiment to identify which components or component levels significantly Increase average daily minutes of moderate and vigorous physical activity and then to hopefully build a more scalable intervention made up of only components that have a detectable effect of moderate and vigorous physical activity and cost less than $550 and we decided on that because that's what's covered by and by clinic rehab it's kind of the average of what's covered by cardiac rehab and the DPM and so we actually recruited nationally for this study using the Army of Women and We were really trying to consider real-world implementation from the start. So we required no On-site study visits. Everything was done completely remotely, and we finished data collection for Phase two Just about a year ago and are Getting pretty close to being able to Start getting some of those manuscripts out and in the interest of time today, I'm just mostly going to be discussing our Phase two Data, but I'm happy to answer any questions about these one if people have them at the end So ultimately based on our work from phase one These were the components that were deemed the highest rated and most feasible Our core intervention includes a self monitoring app and the Fitbit, and the components We were testing were a Fitbit buddy where a person picked a buddy from their life. They were sent a Fitbit Deluxe app which had some additional app modules including a survivor spotlight when we highlighted someone who had been active and then a Newsfeed where we posted research related to physical activity and cancer on a weekly basis app notifications progress and kind of just general behavior change tips bi-weekly coaching calls and then an online gym where they had access to online videos and were sent a weekly schedule on how to use them This is a full Factorial experiment and participants are randomly assigned to each component which means they can get anywhere from zero to five other components and The ultimate goal of the intervention is to gradually increase survivor's moderate and vigorous physical activity to reach that 150 minutes per week over a 12 week period with a 12 week follow-up and Participants complete online patient reported outcome assessments, and wear an accelerometer for seven consecutive days At baseline week 12 and week 24 and it also completed an optional dried blood spots at baseline twelve weeks and 24 weeks and then a process evaluation at 12 and 24 weeks and So this is what the 32 condition experiment looks like. I want to emphasize This should not be considered the 32 arm randomized control trial and now they're actually comparing individual conditions instead We're comparing everyone who has a component shaded in purple to everyone who does not have the component shaded For example for coaching calls, we're comparing everyone in conditions 1 through 16 to everyone in conditions 17 to 32 This means everyone is used in our analyses. So our sample size is equivalent to what we would need in a traditional RCT And so I will briefly go over how these components implemented since we never actually see these people so we've now all We mailed all participates a Fitbit with instructions for downloading the Fitbit app and instructions for downloading the Fit2Thrive app Which they can do through the App Store and using a QR code that we provide them and they are automatically when they scan that code Given either the standard app or the deluxe app depending on which condition they are assigned to And like I said the standard app is really self monitoring where this deluxe app has some additional features that you may help facilitate behavior change And then participants who are assigned to coaching calls are scheduled to receive a biweekly call to discuss their progress and submitting their change technique and techniques the coaches are able to actually see their progress through the app database in real time and then persons signed to the tailor text messages get two to three messages per day Focused on social cognitive theory constructs and feedback on progress Individuals in the online gym get weekly automated emails with a schedule only two workouts and then for the Fitbit buddy They were able to choose a buddy from their personal life we sent that person an email to screen and consent and agree to share their Fitbit data with us and then they were sent an instruction packet and Fitbit through the mail and then we set both the Participant and the buddy an email with strategies for how they could support each other to increase physical activity and so we screened 419 women and we had 269 actually be randomized and 265 received the intervention. We retained about 94 percent at five weeks and 91% at 24 weeks and I have about 80% of the sample with no physical activity data at all three time points And our demographics are a little bit younger than you would see in a typical breast cancer survivor study Which is probably a result of the fact that we're using technology But we did have a wide range from 24 to 75 Otherwise, they look pretty similar to the general survivor population. We had 46 states represented most early stage disease and an average for three years since diagnosis And so in terms of our preliminary data when we looked at overall change and moderate and vigorous physical activity We find that MVPA significantly increased by 59.3 minutes per week and eight and a half minutes per day and we saw 21.5 percent increase in the number of women who were reaching the Physical Activity Guidelines which is Actually, these effects are really similar to a study Of an another study that was actually tapered on site to home-based 12-week intervention behavior change intervention for breast cancer survivors that included six group sessions 12 supervised sessions In the first nine weeks followed by three weekly one-on-one coaching sessions They observed the 68-minute increase in accelerometer measured MVPA. I should mention this is the accelerometer data And a 22 percent increase in the number of women meeting the guidelines So overall this was encouraging and very promising considering we never saw these people They just used our app or whatever other components they got and everything was kind of our individual was relatively low touch compared to that but when we looked at the main effects and interaction effects of the five intervention components using an intention-to-treat Inova Controlling accelerometer wear at times None of the on levels of the components are superior to the off levels When you look at the actual means you see a small positive effect for support calls Fitbit buddy and app notifications But interesting, you know, you actually see that having the deluxe app on Having the deluxe app offs It seems to be better than on when you just look at the means and the same with the online gym And somebody first looked at these data I thought oh my gosh, you know, this is my K award, my career is over before it started but I've had you know some time to process that something about it and I think there's a lot to the story here and that Will hopefully be able to understand these data better We've collected a ton of other data to help, you know, help us figure out why these components are working or not and You know when you look at other interventions that have used MOST you see something similar that You know, there's only one maybe two components that have a main effect Which you know from a public health perspective is actually not a bad story And I think that you know when we dig a bit deeper we're going to see some heterogeneity and response or intervention where some people Will increase them will stay the same or even decrease in that, you know is what's driving our mean changes and so I think kind of understanding this is going to be important to help us make sense of these data and just kind of like, you know, Obviously, the first thing that comes to mind is well, maybe our intervention just people just really didn't like it They didn't use it when we're looking at those data and the fact that we know in fact But what we see is that most people were actually satisfied with the app and the intervention delivery And the overall study experience which was encouraging because I'd never done a study where we literally never saw people And so in general it seemed like they felt like the study, you know, they they positively rated the study overall And then, you know we looked at when you look at adherence we do see the variability based on the component Which I think could be an indication to us You know thinking about whether that is the right component or you know gives us an opportunity to see that if it did work for people, you know if it did work for some people is this really because they use it and it didn't work for other people because they didn't use it And we had 67% of people report that they used our app five to six times a week We had really good it adherence to the Fitbit.They wore them 95 percent on study days. We had 99% of support calls complete The buddy people 88 percent reported discussing the study with their buddy or exercising one time a week 60% reported at least some support from the buddy for exercise each week When you look at the online gym, this is where we see some variability only 54% report using it more than one time a week 42% report that they never use the online gym And this was a relatively though touch component we gave them the information, but we didn't really, you know We gave them these schedules we gave them the resources, but we didn't really push them to use it It was kind of like they could use it if they wanted to And then we had 57 percent of our app notifications marked as read. But this means that they actually clicked on it We just we you know, we assumed that more people saw them than just that  And then so we used some of our preliminary data to done feasibility and acceptability Of from phase one and two of Fit2Thrive and then also our data from the first observational study was talking about the impact study and Two additional grants from NCI. The first is an R21 That we spend it about a year ago. It's a pilot RCT. So I using the RCT to test feasibility and acceptability All the tech supported physical activity intervention in Metastatic breast cancer patients. This is a population where not a lot of interventions have been developed because I think the feeling before was you know they had a really short life their diagnosis was is terminal. Now they're living a lot longer and so it's kind of a good opportunity to start thinking about health promotion for these women and This is a 12-week intervention unlike the original Fit2Thrive it is We're not focusing on the 150 minutes. We're actually focusing on daily steps and we are tailoring their daily set goal Based on their progress from the previous day and their symptom rating for the current day And then we actually give them options to choose their goal for that day and Then we'll also we also added a social component where participants can see each other's relative progress and communicate with each other and then they also get weekly coaching calls and then we're looking at Moderate and vigorous physical activity measured by the accelerometer, patient reported outcomes, feasibility, acceptability, And functional performance at baseline and in 12 weeks And then our control group is a waitlist group where a waitlist attention control so they get we have them download a commercially available app and then they also Get weekly coaching calls about healthy lifestyles topics and so you're really trying to establish feasibility acceptability here with kind of the endgame of trying to figure out how to optimize an Intervention for this population because you know, there are fewer of these survivors And so I think something that was remote we could reach more of them and you know help promote their health But we actually just started our first cohort of 25 women three weeks ago And this is about half of our target so so far so good, you know, of course working out the early-stage tech issues, but so far it seems to be received pretty well and Then the other study is R-O1 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison This study was also founded about a year ago and we plan to start recruiting in the next month It's actually a non-responders trial or a single randomized trial And the purpose of the study is to determine the optimal augmentation tactics to a minimal MVPA promotion intervention for increasing physical activity and then also some burden and functional performance and in active breast and endometrial cancer survivors it's a six-month study with a six-month follow-up and our ultimate goal is to get to that 150 minutes of MVPA again similar to the Fit2Thrive, and we'll be measuring very similar outcomes to Fit2Thrive and be looking at physical activities and functional performance at six and 12 months and then Everybody so everybody in this study actually starts off getting the minimal intervention. So there was no randomization At the beginning and this minimal intervention consists of a Fitbit that's actually integrated into the electronic health record So at both sites we use epic And then they get weekly emails through their the patient facing portal, which is my chart From the study team that's endorsed by their oncologist as well That gives them feedback on their progress and healthy tips on behavior change and then it's pretty minimal It's all automated And then if they actually have a visit with their oncologist during the study an oncologist gets an alert in their inbox The day of the patient's appointment and it gives we give them some talking points to discuss with the patient An idea is that by integrating the Fitbit into the EHR it's elevated the importance of physical activity for patients and you know in kind of elevating it to part of their clinical care and during the intervention we're going to be evaluating for non-response every four weeks if they fail to meet at less than 80% of their physical activity goal over the previous four weeks then is actually when they get randomized and there they get randomized to either get my weekly coaching calls or the online gym for the remainder of the six month study period. And if they keep responding they just keep going so hopefully we'll be able to kind of tell You know just in the middle of the intervention work and if not kind of what is the next best, you know What's next step up strategy? So again, these are just some examples of how we're using You know how you can use technology to promote and understand physical activity And you know again, there's lots of opportunities and challenges here with using it for interventions easy to use You can reach a large number of people where they are you get rich data in real time You can monitor them in real time It's lower costs and having them come there, you know can use it easily allow for turning on or off components But there's challenges again and there's burden and you know, they have to wear their Fitbits. They have to check their feed They have to answer their daily symptom Survey and tech issues, you know, and then I think the issue, you know There's always an issue of sustained engagement on how do we keep people using this? and then you know, how do we actually kind of implement these interventions at a larger scale and keep up with changes in technology and like With the measurements are kind of monitoring. We don't Looking at aerobic activity and you know, there's challenges with doing this for non aerobic activity And then I think there's also an issue of how we use social networks for support or like how we engage people in this. If it needs to be calls or video chats or if there's a way to kind of make Technology do that work for us do some of that work for us. So Just kind of wrapping up here. This is one of my favorite quotes. The significant problems we face cannot be solved by the same level of thinking that created them I think you know it's important to get these aspects considering what we're dealing with here. Physical activity is complex There, you know unlike in mice and we turn off the lights now people don't to start running on their wheel There's been many interventions that have demonstrated efficacy promoting for promoting physical activity yet the majority of the US population is inactive and I think we need to start thinking about doing something different and you know getting more creative and technology is one tool that may Allow us to better integrate multiple data sources to understand and promote physical activity Develop effective interventions and it more easily answer the questions of like, what's the vast minimal intervention for which outcome, how much physical activity is needed For which outcomes, you know what works for who, when, under what conditions and you know How much should be tailored to hopefully ultimately close the gap between research and practice and ultimately You know improve to physical activity and participation population level and in turn disease outcomes So i'm happy to take questions But I first want to acknowledge all the participants, my collaborators, and the funding agencies who supported my work, especially the NIH Thank you, Dr. Phillips. very interesting lots of material Yeah, we have more questions from the audience than I can possibly get through in the time that remains I'll jump into them and then we'll try to touch on some of them An initial question about outcome measures in the first project that you mentioned to you we're using moderate to vigorous physical activity is the outcome either minutes or number of folks had met some target Was that measured with an accelerometer or similar device? So that was objectively measured using the accelerometer, but we do also have in all of our studies We also collect self-report data and then and and now all of our interventions We also have Fitbit data throughout the course of the intervention. So it sounds like then on the basis of that answer that you favor Accelerometers for your major outcome if when you're looking at physical activity As opposed to a Fitbit or something else. I Do when we're looking at it as an outcome because they are they don't provide feedback, you know their research grade and so I do think that it does I Do prefer that as an actual outcome measure but we do use... I kind use Fitbits as more Tools but I do think you know as we start to get into kind of this observational space that they could potentially be used to monitor more closely in that space and you know being supplemented with some accelerometers You mentioned that we need advanced methods for making use of large volumes of data and in all of the projects that you described there certainly were large volumes of data What are the analytic methods that you are currently using? And do you have thoughts about what you might like to be able to use beyond what you have available today? Yeah, I mean quite honestly, I think that we are Definitely not making the most use out of our data right now So we're using you know, multi-level modeling traditional kind of more traditional statistical techniques, but I do think you know, There's an opportunity potential opportunity for using things like machine learning and you predict more predictive analytics To better not only understand behavior but kind of to use that within our interventions to to make them more even more personalized and so I think that that Is a really interesting direction to head and you know, we're interested in going that route at some point You described a couple of projects that include intervention activities The The first one I think was more of an observational study, but the the others included intervention activities Did you do any sort of tailoring for individuals of any of the intervention components or did everybody get the same Online gym, the same phone coaching, the same, you know version of each of the components So in Fit2Thrive study the MOST design that initial one I talked about everybody got the same version. We didn't do any any tailoring. Um Because you know, we really wanted I think you know One of the benefits of MOST is to some extent you can kind of figure out what component might work for most people Because I always struggle a little bit with like how much to tailor and With the Fit2Thrive MB study We are doing some tailoring and that their goal is kind of changing to meet them where they are But still trying to help, you know promote activity But for the most part we kind of we do deliver that we've delivered our components a little bit more standard In the first project you Reported some significant effects for within-subject analyses, but not between-subject analyses What what do you make of that? So people I interpret that to mean that people who have different levels of self-efficacy or whatever didn't show significant differences in the physical activity, but people whose self-efficacy changed did show some effect on physical activity What do you make of the finding for within-subject but not for between-subject? I think part of it is probably Power so we were really powered for the within-subjects analysis, but looked at the between-subjects So I think that could be some of it but I do think that you know taking it at face value. It does indicate that it's there is potentially, you know, if you're deviating from your normal and not my Like looking at people's, you know deviations from their normal may actually be even more important than necessarily looking at these between-person differences But again, we weren't powered really for those between-differences So if we had a larger sample size we might have actually seen some of those become significant. Did you look at combinations of the intervention components in the MOST trial or just the main effects? We looked at the combinations and none of them were significant either. I realize power is lower for those. Yeah How do you think the environment might be better incorporated into studies that involve technological interventions? I definitely think we can so I definitely think we can do more with that So you could in my mind, you know, the idea is like we send these text messages that are like oh You know go for a walk We try to not make them like, oh, it's a beautiful day you go for a walk because they're not actually context aware But I think you could make more you know context aware messages like oh you're By a car go for a walk or it's going to a great day to get outside you know think about going for a walk and I definitely think there's room for that. One of the things we are doing with our Fit2Thrive data is we are actually pulling all the data on we're geocoding it and then we're actually looking at some of the data from The weather the National Weather Service to see in relation to Fitbit So kind of see how these things might be impact like might influence physical activity during the intervention looking at the Fitbit data So I definitely think there's room to make you know Make our interventions more context aware based on data on like physical location and weather and factors like that I have two questions related to engagement One, how do you keep the participants engaged and two how did you get the health care providers engaged? The second question, we're hoping they will be engaged. The first question, you know getting participants engaged. You know, I do think for you know, it's with any kind of research you do kind of you know We get that people who are probably a little bit more motivated than you know, we're not probably reaching the people who have no interest in technology or physical activity but I think you know one of the things we do and even in the MOST study our initial study we do kind of monitor their activity data and if we don't if someone stops transmitting data for a week Like if we have no Fitbit data from them for a week We would give them a quick call and and email them and just say hey just checking in and making sure everything's okay So just to kind of make sure that like in you that you know We were I guess watching them to some extent and so that probably helped But you can see like with some of our other data from like the online gym like we didn't do a very good job potentially engaging them in that strategy and it might have just been too low touch and if I had to like what we're using the online GMNR the EHR integration study and that is a much more enhanced version that is fueled by a a little bit of a better budget and RO1 but I think it's you know, I it's kind of hard, you know it's hard to engage people and it'll be interesting to see because they had access to the app what happens in that follow-up period If they were still engaged when we kind of just let them do their thing. I imagine it's probably going to go down And then in terms of engaging health care providers You know, we're still struggling with this we've gotten we've cut. You know, we have that we have oncologists from both institutions on the grant as co-investigators and You know, we've gotten various buy-in from other local clinicians kind of in their clinics But we we go to their disease team meetings. We really like talk to them about it. We work with the nurse practitioners And you know just kind of put a lot of energy into Building those relationships and making sure that they don't forget about us You used you're using randomized trial methods and Whenever someone gives a presentation on this webinar about using a randomized trial somebody always ask gee, is there an alternative to a randomized design do I have to use a randomized trial? I have my own thoughts about that, but I thought I would give you the first shot um That is a good question um You know I was trained in randomized trials and I still probably drink the kool-aid that you know I like to have I think you know having a comparison group allows us to make conclusions about the efficacy of the different components I mean like in our Fit2Thrive intervention you know we are we don't have any true comparison group. Everyone gets something but we are comparing the different conditions on or off in our You know our non-responders trial we actually are not randomizing to start but we are randomizing at the end So I do think you know, it still gives us it is still considered like the gold standard for comparison. But I don't I think that you know as our methods develop it it is something to consider about how we might evaluate trials differently My regular answer to that question is that the randomized trial is the gold standard. It gives the strongest evidence about causal inference and that all of the alternatives that are out there and I've looked at many of them Either cost more to do well provide Less rigorous data on the question. They just don't work as well. And so we're always looking for Something that's less expensive and easier to do But using non randomized methods isn't necessarily good. Yes. I would agree with that. last question In I think one of your studies and maybe I didn't hear this correctly It sounded like the participants were going to interact with one another either online or On the phone or something and we've had presentations on this webinar series about Studies that randomize individuals but then allow the individuals to interact with one another post randomization and that creates problems If it's not accounted for in the power calculations in the analysis And I wonder if that's something that you're familiar with or if that's something that we should talk more about yes, so I'm definitely familiar with it because actually in my mind, I originally thought that we would have some interaction between participants and Then you know quickly realized that that was going to get very very messy very very fast And we were going to be severely underpowered and so in our trial that we're currently doing it that is our feasibility acceptability trial and so we are allowing participants to communicate with one another online or within the app and To see I mean really the point about is to see like if they like it if they use it If it's even worth trying to pursue to be honest And I think you know in later stages we would definitely if we do continue on to keep group participants together We would need to consider that in our power analysis Yeah, okay. So the initial effort is more into feasibility rather than testing intervention Okay, so that sounds like a good plan. I Dr. Phillips, I want to thank you very much. We've reached the end of our time terrific webinar lots of questions we did not get to them all we will send you questions that we didn't get to and Hope that you'd be willing to take a little time to jot down answers and post that on the website when we post the recording Yes, I'm definitely happy to do that Thank you Dr. Murray. Thank you for having me. Thank you, Dr. Murray, and thank you to everyone who participated in today's webinar. As I mentioned at the beginning of the webinar, We will be posting the slides and a recording of today's session on our website next week You'll receive an email with a link to the recording when it's available. Thank you
