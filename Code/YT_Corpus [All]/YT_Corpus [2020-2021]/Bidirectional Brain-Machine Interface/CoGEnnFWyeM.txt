 okay yeah thank you yeah good afternoon uh everyone uh thank you thank you all for uh joining us today uh this is the even khaldoon uh fellowship seminar series uh maybe some of you know already but this is this program is a highly competitive uh fellowship program uh for uh saudi arabian women with a doctoral degree the program is designed for the development of saudi arabian women to be leaders in their in their field it was launched about 10 11 years ago 2009 that was in collaboration with kfupn there was a substantial expansion of the program in 2013 uh that was supported by saudi aranco for five years and now we have a a 10-year collaboration with caxt so we've been very very impressed by our fellows over the years for their continued uh scientific contributions and their leadership back in saudi arabia the fellowship is hosted in our department in mechanical engineering at mit and i'd like to thank our program manager theresa worth and program administrator dorothy hannah and also our administrative assistant nadia shaheed so our speaker today is dr shiruk and she will speak for about 45 minutes or so and she is working with professor maria yang in our department and maria would you like to introduce shirok yes i would love to thank you come on thank you um or i just learned professor kyt so that's good um so um so it's been fantastic to work with sharok this past year she is deeply committed to using her scientific and technical gifts to make positive social impact for others in particular working on assistive technologies for individuals with disabilities using cutting-edge participatory design techniques and i think you'll be hearing more about that today i will also say that sherok's intellectual influence on my own research group has been wonderful this past year she's an intensely creative person with an imaginative spirit and she's been a mentor to the junior researchers in my group in a way that i could not have imagined before um she also introduced my group to powerpoint karaoke so if you don't know what that is i suggest you look it up it's really good so i just want to thank shirok and i'd like to um welcome everyone to listen to her talk yeah thank you thank you thank you maria yeah yeah dr sharok whenever you're ready yeah thank you so much uh thank you professor command and approve yang as well maria i'm going to start sharing my screen now uh with the slides and everything um can you see it well yes okay let me just do this thing from start all right thank you both again for your kind introductions i am um truly privileged really to be um uh to be part of the urban hordone fellowship and i look forward to share part of what i've done with maria maria has been fantastic allowing me to explore all these curious questions that i had about this and that and you'll see what i mean in a bit um i've titled my presentation as understanding and designing for the overlooked as i have primarily focused on user research and in particular research that is applied to understand marginalized populations that are often overlooked if not ignored such as informal caregivers and persons with disabilities so i'm going to jump right away to the outline i'll talk a bit uh i'll just to give a quick overview of the two primary research works that i've done with maria at the ideation lab i will then focus on one of those products and present the background research study results and design considerations that has resulted from the study i will then talk about the experience i've had co-designing with persons with disabilities in india with the humanistic co-design initiative with dr kyle keane and anna massa and then in the end i'll talk about what i've been doing post fellowship and surprise it's another fellowship so um as someone with a computer science background i'm often asked actually why i've decided to go with the ideation lab and well the iodation labs research aim deepens the theoretical foundation of early stage design processes across product design system design and system design and service design as well that is to develop new products and systems that address challenges of global competitiveness and emerging markets and the labs approach to interdisciplinary research and user-centered design was my primary attraction um and the culture of the lab was so beautifully invigorating and it made for a lovely home for my research and education the past year i made long term friends i hope and um i was very lucky to be part of the of the lab so um uh so i wanted to one of the projects that i wanted to look into was bit emoji itself so i wanted to investigate the relationship particularly the relationship between bit emojis and the self since the interactivity of many virtual environments is supported by the user use avatars and this explains why avatars play an important role in increasing media outcomes such as character identification also flow however less is known about how individuals engage with avatars particularly with how avatars are chosen are customized and how these decisions relate to self-representation identity and the satisfaction of psychological needs as well it is quite interesting i um i think because we can view the relationship between avatars and the users as being bi-directional so individuals will select and customize avatar to communicate identity and controlling these avatars ultimately influence identity and time and um why but emojis it's because it's completely immersed within snapchat right now and if you haven't heard this yet saudi arabia is actually the number one users of snapchat and bit emojis uh from around the world and uh so i wanted to go down that path i was really curious about it the other project is the main topic of this seminar and it is mainly concerned with understanding family caregivers and deriving design consideration for a future product or platform uh this actually extends on work i've done prior to the fellowship with the epilepsy patients with epilepsy and caregivers as well and of course before i start i wanted to give a quick shout out to the people i got to work with on both projects obviously maria yang and then we have in the bitmoji project i was lucky to work with doctor nigel andy and we worked closely with the brilliant mit europe rebecca slater for the caregiver project i was privileged to have access to wonderful brains such as uh and also on the research team so the number of americans aged 65 and older is projected to nearly double from 55 million in 2018 to 95 million by 2060. and the 65 and older age groups share of the total population will actually rise from 16 to 23. this global phenomena affects most countries worldwide for instance the proportion of people aged 65 years and older is actually expected to grow to an average of 28 percent in the oecd countries in 2050 while in some countries such as japan and south korea a share of 40 percent is forecasted obviously higher higher age is associated with higher morbidity as well which in turn affects care dependency and the increasing number of care dependent people leads to a high economic burden for most healthcare systems and i think the pandemic makes it quite uh clear as well and the principle of outpatient before inpatient also applies to the nursing of older people in need of care in fact institutional care is the primary cost driver in elderly long-term care and costs for long-term care in nursing home exceeds those of home-based care a prognosis regarding the number of people in need of care in the us is expected to double from 13 million in 2000 to 27 million in 2050 and generally elderly care can be organized in inpatient and outpatient care structures as i mentioned earlier however according to 2015 estimates from the national alliance for caregiving during the past year 65.7 million americans served as family caregivers for an ill or disabled relative and just to add even more importance to this subject let's look at the cost of care the value of services that are provided by informal care give us have steadily increased over the last decade with an estimated economic value of 470 70 billion and that actually matches the value of the sale of walmart in 2013. sorry um so it is becoming clear that care provision in many nations increasingly relies on the work of informal or non-professional carers hence enabling care-dependent people to stay in a home-based care setting as long as possible is an efficient cutting uh cost cutting strategy informal caregivers sometimes referred to as family or unpaid carers and i'll be using these stands interchangeably can be defined as those who care unpaid for family or friends on a full-time basis carers would provide ongoing assistance with activities of daily living such as toileting feeding bathing walking clothing or even instrumental activities such as daily living such as shopping meal preparation house cleaning and managing finances as a result of the demands of the care rule caregivers can experience disruptions to their life due to changes in contact with family friends and peers related to this it has been noted that family caregivers are tightened risk of experiencing social isolation and loneliness and i think it's such a uh for me personally it is a personal matter and that's where the interest in caregivers and epilepsy started and i decided to continue it on here in boston uh in this study we focused on the lives of family caregivers that care for loved ones suffering from dementia so we now discovered a bit unlike other patient-centered research that aims to assist in the care of patients we aim to uncover the challenges that are facing family caregivers and explore how to go about supporting their well-being by examining their daily practices and technology use more specifically this work is driven by three research questions what are the key challenges faced by family caregivers caring for loved ones with dementia how do various technologies and social media participation mitigate problems faced by family caregivers and what are the design opportunities and recommendations for a product or platform that can support family caregivers and improve their well-being as well as the level of care so self-care not only will provide care for the person with a caregiver but also for the active care to the other person the patient recent work in human computer interaction has highlighted many of the above issues that we recalled with a review to understanding the role technology might have in mitigating them and we can roughly classify technologies that support family caregivers found in the literature and in market research as well are technologies to reduce physical burden technologies to reduce mental burdens and technologies to stay in touch and stay strong one area of research has developed ways to reduce some of the burdens of care work for instance remind our information systems to keep track of daily schedules other areas include the design and development of tools to share information between care receivers and network of caregivers remote monitoring and awareness systems have also seen their share of research others have identified how technology as well can support family caregivers in seeking emotional and informational support i'll just give a few examples here of some of these researches and products for instance as astra was designed to provide and evaluate awareness connecting household and family members supported with mobile systems so it allows the caregiving unit to work together and schedule the care for the patient aurora is another prototype in a mobile device to promote emotional awareness awareness its main objective was to share emotions drawing on the work of effective computing indicating that systems must act as a medium to convey emotions and while there is a growing literature on the benefits of online communities and social networks for caregivers uh i've found that there have been relatively few study few studies of the specific ways that pee support can be expressed additionally there are a few examples of what they might look like so this work is actually part of a larger um interdisciplinary and cross-cultural project that is examining the experience of family caregivers across a range of different populations so uh the majority of projects can easily be transferable uh and applied to a different culture such as saudi arabia so that's why it was important for me to evolve from the beginning researchers from saudi arabia so they'll be able to replicate these studies in a different culture the work employs a qualitative lens to explore support seeking behaviors of family care give us with the aid to develop a rich and detailed examination and to achieve this comprehensive examination multiple sources of evidence were planned so we had interviews with informal caregivers or family caregivers we also sat down with case managers and social workers which often work as intermediary between the um between the pair between the hospitals and also the clinics and such with the caregivers we also have workshop activities hopefully plan for the future in order to co-design the platform in this specific study we are examining the experience of family caregivers in regards to social connectivity technology use and also the openness of the shared caregiving experience in the greater boston area we focus on interviewing family caregivers as well as case managers and social workers so i have in this image here just an example of what um what a caregiver task would be so we have sarah she lives with her father john uh susan is also a daughter of john but she doesn't reside with him so the full-time carer in this image is sarah there's also the case managers and social workers and we're talking about the doctors as well different doctors you've got the primary care physician urologist and so on that uh the caregiver will have to communicate with and of course this is even simplified it gets even more complex when there's more family members involved more scheduling more doctors and so on so just to differentiate between case managers and social workers so um case managers they have training in the causes risk factors and stages of dementia and they can provide support uh to the patient and the family for instance they can assist families with finding short-term in-home care to track their loved ones or to provide assistance when family members are at work social workers on the other hand can help people with dementia and their families navigate all of the different challenges more holistically and of course the challenges that come with the prognosis and then provide them with a thorough toolkit and how to live life fully with the disease so this is how we understand the ima the the culture of how caregiving is provided what kind of support was provided to the caregivers and the patients as well uh so our focus was an interview so far we interviewed informal caregivers case managers and social workers uh recruitment participants was recruited via various means including facebook groups twitter announcement and advertisement be the family caregiver alliance research registry page and also newsletter we also have physical advertisements which were distributed at aging centers around the boston area uh the informal caregivers so the participants either informed caregiver or case manager social worker reached out to one of the two qualitative researchers to arrange a suitable time location for the interviews we were able to recruit 15 and formal caregivers as participants through 13 of which were female and two were male with an average age of 57 years old and all participants were able to identify as family caregivers and that's something we're going to tap on a bit later on why it's important that uh for someone to identify as a caregiver the sample of family caregivers was intended to be diverse in order to represent a heterogeneous family caregiver population that provided care to an aging spouse sibling or parent nine of the participants provided care to their mothers two of those also provided care to their fathers one participant cared for her father and three participants provided care to their spouse and the last two participants provided care to their sibling and we i found that these um uh reflect statistics provided by the national alliance for caregiving in the institute of aging where upwards of 75 of all caregivers are female and may spend as much as 50 percent more time providing care than than males so i should repeat here that i am focusing here on full-time caregivers i understand that with the family dynamics the work can be a bit divided across siblings and such uh the participants also represented a diverse set of experience with digital technologies and social media as well as exposure to support and peer network um so uh as i mentioned we recruited case managers and social workers uh to lend a glimpse into their role in their caregiver experience and the type of support that is often formally or informally presented to family caregivers and like i mentioned earlier we wanted to narrow this quote to adequately address the problem associated with long-term care of a person's diagnosed with a continually worsening disease such as alzheimer's or als and for the study we focused on alzheimer's disease and dementia uh alzheimer's is and i i think there's a good justification for that other than fact that it is a worsening disease it is an ongoing um problem uh public health crisis in fact there are currently 5.3 million people some suffer from alzheimer's disease and in fact if no cure or prevention for for alzheimer's disease is found the prevalence is estimated to more than triple by 2050. and ironically uh alzheimer's can be profoundly effect not only individuals with the disease but also the caregivers which can lead to um loneliness and self-isolation which can lead to depression in itself so we carried out semi-structured interviews with each participants from both groups of family caregivers case managers and social broadcast these types of interviews are one of the most dominant and widely used methods of data collection within the social sciences and user-centered research it allowed us to carry the interviews with a more with a a more natural flow to the to our conversations and doesn't it we didn't want it to be too structured or too regimented and it allowed us to explore subjective viewpoints and also to gather in-depth accounts of people's experiences all interviews were audio recorded and then transcribed i then applied thematic analysis the qualitative researchers myself and rahad applied the thematic analysis approach for the analysis it is actually one of the most used qualitative approach to analyzing interviews and we applied three main stages to it we familiarized ourselves with the data which was internalized through transcription of the interviews the audio recordings of the interviews were listened to a number of times for their accurate transcription we then transcribed it the transcripts were then coded while listening to recordings as and when necessary the third stage was the theme development where at this stage codes were read and re-read to identify significant border patterns of meaning fourth these categories were aggregated and reduced into the categories that we'll share in the next slides so um so i've decided to uh throughout the categories i've had several quotes from the participants just to reflect their actual view on the subject and i'll be discussing this so taking on the role from the outset of our interviews participants explained how they often drifted into their caregiving role without necessarily realizing it and thus failed to identify themselves as caregivers for some time many reported that the nature of the dementia meant that their responsibilities were initially relatively small but grew as the illness progress despite the fact that the caregivers interviews were aware of the deteriorating state of their loved ones there was still a deeply felt unpreparedness to what the role would entail for some family caregivers this role felt more like a duty than an option uh for instance uh one of the caregivers says i was a caregiver for a lot longer than i identified as one and she mentions that because she was taking care of her mother who had schizophrania before getting alzheimer's and she wasn't aware of the fact that she would be classified as a caregiver and this is this point is quite important because how do we um uh how do we how do we reach out to these caregivers themselves if they cannot identify as one how do we develop for a group that don't even identify as for the product that we want to develop many of the caregivers voiced a lack of model to follow be it from society healthcare professionals or other caregivers the role of caregiving was often thrust upon them without much guidance on how to navigate its logistical financial and emotional intricities and i think this is why it was important for me to include case managers and social worker in this work because i wanted to see what kind of guidance there was obviously a disconnect because this was uh this was these were reported despite the fact that social workers and case managers were involved in the care however they the caregivers did not feel like they were being helped in fact most of the interviewed caregivers voiced their panic and stress at having to take over these rules without any guidance that's how they felt that there was no guidance no model to follow one family caregiver voiced his constant need to recalibrate emotionally on a daily basis to overcome the sense of overwhelmness which is an obvious um sign of depression a few family caregivers felt cheated to take and enrolled with blindfolds on and how how if given the chance they might have strongly considered other options such as assisted living and technically this is the task of a care because it's such an overwhelming experience to provide to provide a patient with this diagnosis and having the caregiver there the whole experience is quite overwhelming and uh comprehension can be quite low so it is the role of the care manager and social worker to make sure that this information is actually being retained and that caregivers actually have options uh many caregivers also express their frustration about failing to meet their own expectations about caring for their loved ones a few regressed back to the lack of model or list abide by so they did feel a bit lost frustrated by not getting any help loss of personal identity caregivers often described negative changes in their lives after becoming carers and that was the overarching theme the theme of loss incorporates many of these changes it includes loss of freedom and leisure activities reduced choices and also financial losses it was clear that the experience of becoming a caregiver was one where the needs of the cared for were felt to be prioritized the caregiver's focus was on helping the person the person that they cared for the part is a lot of participants had started to feel as though they had lost things in their lives that were important to them they had stopped working lost contact with old friends and given up past times and hobbies some participants did voice of frustration to this loss of identity as well as the halting of careers nevertheless rarely were these frustrations or loss of opportunities were rarely held against those that they cared for social isolation and loneliness is one of the major aspect of an informal caregiver's life often times caregivers spoke about the reduced opportunity to socialize and be around other people on a regular basis but also go beyond socializing but being able to connect with others that are in the same situation this is largely due to their increased isolation where to become more difficult to share experiences and identify common problems and solution with others there's clearly a gap where a network of supportive peers should be this is also despite the support that we recall in a few with one of the themes endless studies show that vast negative effect of isolation loneliness associated with social isolation is one of the main contributors to these negative outcomes lack of social contact and the resulting loneliness increases grass and one's chance of depression according to a study published by the american health association it can also double the risk of dementia so stress depression and dementia increase social isolation thus creating a continuous cycle i recall actually from one of the interviews where one of the um uh one of the caregivers was talking about a simple pleasure of going out for a cone of ice cream with her husband was something that is completely not possible because she couldn't leave her mother alone she had to uh essentially um call up somebody to take care of it either family member or a carer of sorts or paid cara so all these simple pleasures were eliminated from home life because of the caregiving role depression and grief many feelings come up when you were caring for someone day in and day out so this theme was anticipated and expected uh many caregivers were often reluctant to express these negative feelings for free they will be judged by others or them judging themselves too oh they didn't want to bother others with their problems uh and this was the case mostly for people that felt like this was a duty uh for example a daughter caring for a parent uh family caregivers are obviously at risk for depression and they interviewed caregivers sometimes express this as feeling of hopelessness of helplessness and inability to sleep or at times trouble in getting up and facing the care day ahead grief was also reported as one factor for caregivers depression particularly the constant loss encountered whilst caring for a parent or spouse so this is somewhat unique as well for for dementia because you see that you're witnessing the deteriorating person in front of you you're losing them continuously for instance one of the carers uh talked about the grief for about for a whole two minutes she was talking about how she felt about losing hearing her father staying in the kitchen so she got used to hearing it but then he lost the the um the ability to communicate anymore which included singing as well and she described this as a small death that robbed her of him what i thought was really interesting was uh how much shame and self-stigma actually was expressed by the interviewees so um stigma is defined as mark of shame when we stigmatize people we obviously engage in discrimination against them and the same type of stigmatation has occurred with dementia and also transferable to the act of caring for a person that is ailed by the dementia most of the interviewed caregivers found themselves ashamed of their loved ones behavior this of course contributed to their feeling of self-isolation as well and obviously this would send signals that only strengthen the inclination of to friends and family to shy away so for instance one of the quotes i have here is that one caregiver was saying it's almost like being a stay-at-home mom which has its own stigma unfortunately it's there's full time it's full-time work and much much like caregiving it's stigmatized by society healthcare support so the family caregivers not only expressed frustration about their sufferers unexpected behaviors that were caused by the disease but also surprisingly there are often disappointment with the primary doctors who confirmed their diagnosis of dementia many of the interviewed family caregivers felt they were being offered a terrible diagnosis with little to no support or information on how to get support the family caregivers often found the diagnosis to be overwhelming and the incentivity of the healthcare provider was often jarring for instance one case one case uh manager who actually said that there's a whole diagnosis and adios phenomena that happens with primary doctors and neurologists for instance where it's just a matter of dropping a diagnosis in someone's lab on someone's lap and then assuming that they'll know how to navigate around it so so far the overarching theme was that there was a lot of negative feelings there's a lot of suppressed feelings that kind of came out throughout the interview and um and of course i wanted to explore that further and understand what kind of support network that they surrounded themselves with so obviously one way to do that is sharing the caring experience and uh it will interestingly uh when we got into this point it led to a clear division of course the caregivers interviewed in one side the caregivers felt that there were no point to sharing due to lack of content or desire this side of the argument felt that they should display a level of independence to succeed in their roles at times they found their situation to be too unique to be replicated for instance one of the interviewed caregivers had to take care of both her parents that were diagnosed with alzheimer's however they both presented their diseases and progressed with it in different manners she found the diagnosis and care were both too unique to share or explore answers about her experience and of course shame plays a role in that as well so you don't want to share something you don't want to share an antidote about your parent that can be embarrassing to them in in the other instance opportunities to talk with other carers was greatly appreciated though many of the participants had rather different caregiving roles and responsibilities they identified and empathized with the stories of others having opportunities to be with other carers was also found to be valuable for very practical reasons it was acknowledged by each participants while there was that there was an abundance information available online about the types of support and services care can access understanding what this information means in practice was very challenging uh caregiver support networks were often found via social media or caregiver alliances at the state or federal level nevertheless it seemed there was a clear preference for online communication as it better supported asynchronous communication caregiving is such a full-time job that and what happens typically with a caregiver is that they will take a chunk of time for instance one of the caregivers was taking care of his wife and he dedicated three hours on wednesday morning to do uh to run errands and and he realized that the support group that he wanted to join only met during the afternoon where he had to be home with his wife so uh it was quite important that support should be provided communication and support should be provided in an asynchronous manner there was always a desire to share but there's also this uh this um this desire to conceal at the same time and particularly to protect privacy so the interview and the interviews caregivers gave several reasons why they did not want to tell others about their sufferers disease first um they considered the person they are caring uh caring for and did not want to help them by telling others uh this is despite some cases where the dementia is so advanced that the cared for will not even realize that it has been reported but there is this this drive to protect the person that they're caring for even when they're technically uh emotionally and mentally uh withdrawn another concern that actually discussed discouraged the caregivers from talking to others was the fear of being looked down upon for being disgruntled caregivers they felt that by sharing their experiences they will sound like they're uh they're complaining about it overall even though that the caregivers had the desire to share their caregiving experiences with others and they did have such opportunities their pride as well as their concern about affecting their sufferers worked as a break because of these conflicting demands caregivers were unlikely to talk about the subject much uh the majority of caregivers mentioned utilizing social media for various reasons either personal or for caregiving social media platforms such as facebook instagram and twitter were often mentioned by the caregivers some also utilize more professional platforms such as linkedin they interviewed caregivers often fell into two main camps those that felt empowered by sharing on social media platforms while the other group found social media content to be frivolous and is not the place to share information about caregiving other caregivers found social media to be appealing because it widened their universe enabling them to interact with people who share their carers and concerns a few reported that being online lowered their inhibitions allowing them a place to say what they really mean without fear of angering someone overhurting their feelings akira also reported that social networks has helped caregivers maintain a relationship with their family and friends while foraging new alliances with their peers for some caregivers social media's greatest gift lies in its ability to show caregivers that they are not alone even though every caregiver's journey is unique it can be comforting to know that there are times when you will be in the same stressed out confused boat as everyone else was taking care of an elderly loved one one thing i've noted as well is that different social medias were used for different purposes for instance twitter was often used to find information quickly about something the caregiver would share a question on there and likely receive an answer from her network soon enough facebook was often utilized for their groups private groups that offered a private space for caregivers to share their experience instagram also proved a valuable resource to link to other caregivers via hashtags ukubers have stated some of the caregivers actually stated the fact that they would often share pictures of warm moments with the person that they cared for on there a few can give us support and at times share their caregiving tricks on blogs or podcasts as well so what are the design and recommendation for a platform or a product that can help caregivers so family can give us ways to improve the care of their loved ones as well as maintaining their own well-beings and to lighten the stress of caregiving they engaged in various strategies by exploiting technologies and social media here i suggest specific design consideration for these technologies to improve the well-being of caregivers while we cannot design a support system to support every context of a user group we can design to support a defined subset of users one such way would be via user personas so there's a particular need for personal developers to understand the various educational and social needs of family caregivers the experience of taking on the role of caring is not always easily realized by the participants the process of self-realization and later self-identification as a caregiver was always an ongoing process from the as as derived from the interviews self-realization if to often became apparent with the regimented daily routine routines and significant changes to personal and social life identifying as a caregiver is not always realized particularly when the act of care is seen as helping and supporting a relative of our friend the lack of identification can prove detrimental as it isolates the caregivers from reaching resources and services that are provided to carers this is particularly difficult challenge when designing as how can we reach groups of carers that do not identify as family caregivers additionally identifying as a caregiver is often marred with conflicting emotions some of which is shame and embarrassment normalizing the experience of caregiving and the act of caring is important to ensure the destigmatizes the stigmatization of the acts themselves and as our um as i've shown in the themes family caregivers and huge endures endure more a lot of stress due to the large changes caused by dementia suffered by the loved ones understandably the importance of social connection increases for stress and frustrated caregivers however regardless of the need to vent the caregivers rarely sought help for relatives or peers in fact most tightened their social networks and became isolated a significant issue for caregivers in transition to caregiving was access to practical advice and information this actually echoes prior work and informational support for family caregivers since it is not simply the provision information that is important it is the exchange of practicals hand-on know-how experiences for example one of the examples they were giving by a caregiver is that she said that her mom had a hard time um using the facilities and uh and she had to take her to uh to adopt her constantly because of her constipation and she realized uh she needed to um find a working around that so she would um add um add pills to her food uh but she couldn't swallow any more so she had to crush them in order with her applesauce or with her breakfast to make sure that her bowel movements were regulated much better uh and and i think it's um these small things these uh windows that are so private to someone to someone and then having you uh having a caregiver look looking um into these windows can be quite jarring understandably so um so i can imagine for example a parent that has such a presence in one's life and suddenly you have to keep an eye on their power movements for instance it is uh it is a traumatizing experience uh one thing we didn't realize as well is that many of the carers wanted to give back to the caregiving community it would be vital to offer this opportunity as mentorship um in order to grow and to learn uh understandably as well the development of models or rubric for care may support a richer and easier to interpret information that would be welcome to novice caregivers our criminalities among caregivers is their restriction on their time as well as location and thus a chance to converse in real time with other caregivers can be quite difficult in fact it was one of the reasons why most of the caregivers we've met were not able to join local support groups so asynchronous communication can help navigate conversations in accommodation in an accommodating manner so these are just some of the design recommendations i keep going back to the interviews so does rahat to make sure that we're we're making making sure that we're covering all of the aspect of the care and of course there is what's next with this work specifically um so hopefully the next step is to carry out workshops uh probing workshops uh evidently we'll have to carry the conduct them uh remotely nowadays uh but hopefully that can be manageable and you wanna be able to kind of prop the caregivers to also invite the less outspoken carers and this is something that is a limitation of my study here is the fact that most of the recruited participants reached out to us based on our advertisements someone that does not identify as a carer would not have reached out so hopefully that's the next stop on top of that after we get a better understanding and crystallize the design recommendations even more i want to be able to co-design directly with the caregivers so that was the caregiver portion of things as i've mentioned in the title i was looking at caregivers but also persons with disabilities and that felt like natural transition so um i've always been interesting in the process of co-design particularly with those that are marginalized and thus reached out to one of the lecturers for the principles and practice of the assistive technology group which is ppat which is a popular course there and i wanted to inquire about joining as a listener or perhaps mentoring luckily i was able to partake in the class as well as joined the humanistic co-design initiative that was led by kyle keane and anna massa a humanistic co-design initiative is a cooperative of individuals organizations and institutions working together to increase awareness about how designers makers and engineers can apply their skills in collaboration with people who have disabilities through the humanistic co-design process um so this is a workshop that was carried out that was carried out over a period of three days in chennai india students from mit and it was part of the api course so students from mit and indian universities formed small teams during the workshop and worked closely with an individual with a physical disability together the teams identified a limitation um that a co-designer who was a person with disability with a disability faced because because of that disability and created a well-specified undocumented project plan for an assistive technology device that could increase the co-designers independence if it were to be made and i wanted to join i um it's an exciting initiative and i really wanted to be part of it because it's um it's co-designing in with marginalized communities in a completely different culture as well so i do have a few images here from the workshops so on the first day indian mit students attended a short lecture series about disabilities assistive technology market research building client relationships and product design and mit staff and students brought indian students through a disability simulation where the students through the use of various artifacts such as blindfolds and goggles designed to allow for various degrees of vision try to accomplish a series of tasks while experiencing a number of physical impairments so essentially putting the designers in their co-designers shoes on the second day of the workshop clients uh as we refer to the code designers were invited to the workshop so this um in some instances this is in fact the first time that a designer would meet someone with a visual impairment or a hearing impairment and that is due to the culture that surrounds disabilities back in india but it's also very familiar similar in saudi arabia so what happened in day two is that we invited co-designers and we allowed the students and the mentors to form small teams and each team individually met the client to learn about the client's daily life interest strength and challenges so how it worked it was a lot like speed dating where we had the teams go around the different co-designers and then at the end they can decide on which code designer they want to attach to so they identified someone that they wanted to work with for the rest of the workshop and through this course the team identified the limitation that the client faces and collectively an id was created of an assistive technology device that would remove that limitation each team then shared their assistive technology id to the entire workshop and received written and all feedback about their id from other teams and facilitators for the third day the teams presented their completed projects plan to a panel composed of professionals that have worked within the field of assistive technologies where each team was given constructive feedback to refine and pursue development so the workshop was more of an idea-thon but it also put it put designers and co-designers together to work towards towards an assistive technology device that will hopefully uh mitigate um the environment's limitations to that person with disability and a large part of my role during the workshop was advising and mentoring that was by helping students and researchers develop well-scoped ideas and the reality was that many projects in india are not well funded so helping the participant design on a budget was an exciting experience in itself it also became clear and clear or early on that the market for assistive technology is relatively underdeveloped in india in most cases when pieces of assistive technology existed it is likely to be too expensive or turned unreliable which leaves much room for improvement so i'm nearing the end of uh of my talk here i promise i just wanted to talk a bit about my life post-ipk uh so that's how that's the last two months uh so what i did i was really inspired by the humanistic co-design workshop and we decided to go ahead and do something similar back in saudi arabia however we wanted to frame it um in a way that provided more structure and we actually refer to it as a fellowship now since it's a year-long commitment for the for the teams so co-create ksa is a year-long interdisciplinary innovation fellowship program in collaboration with a group of scientists and engineers from mit as well as local universities and institutes it is an initiative that is run by individuals dedicated to empowering local communities to learn to support their citizens with disabilities the fellowship is focused on empowering local designers makers and engineers we refer to them as citizen inventors to collaboratively develop new assistive technologies alongside local people living with disabilities and these are the co-designers i am currently a program director for co for co-create ksa and working with 12 teams to bring so we now have 12 teams they're developing an assistive technology which is which i am so proud of and we're working i think we have some of them joined us today i hope so hi co-create um we are already two months in and the teams are progressing very well under the mentorship of academic and entrepreneurial colleagues as well and we've been lucky in having many more people wanting to join this initiative as well as contributing time and effort and this is clear because i i don't think i've met a person that has not been touched by a disability of sorts either being due to old age or um degenerative diseases and so on so i'm personally touched by it so i can understand the interest in being part of it so thank you all for listening and i am open for questions i want to be able to see the chat so bear with me there for a second so please feel free to uh participate via the chat if you have any questions i'll open up the window so if you guys can see me thank you thank you for the presence thank you thank you so much we have some time for questions or comments so i i think this is maybe a comment or a question you know my uh my mother uh took care of my aunt you know who was uh you could say maybe paralyzed uh i mean she can't even speak she can't you know even at night when she's asleep you know my mother had to turn her you know in her sleep and i remember you know talking with my brothers and sisters and none of us heard her complain you know about taking care of her or her sister and this was not for like a week or a month this was like for i would say maybe close to 20 years until until she passed away uh i mean you know in the presentation you were mentioning about uh you know the caregivers uh you know or family caregivers that uh you know get affected you know uh uh maybe depression and other kinds of yeah yeah and uh but in somehow in my mother's case you know every day she was you know taking care of her washing you know doing everything and day after day after day and it's uh so i don't know maybe it's truly inspiring it's truly inspiring and i can um and i can understand it because i'm really this is why i'm really interested to take this project and conduct some similar interviews in saudi arabia um because it's it's quite a different culture i don't think anybody identifies as caregivers my mother was a caregiver she's actually locked on i think but she never identified as a caregiver they see it as a duty there is no place to complain there's no place to be um anything then be there so i'm really interested because i do want to this platform that i envision i wanted to be able to help caregivers that don't even identify as carers but the question is how to reach them and how to make it okay to talk about things these these frustrations and of course some people i remember one of the one of the quotes that i had actually was one of the uh participants saying that this is a duty this is she is blood and i have to be there for her so there is this pride in her work of being a caregiver thank you yeah sure do you um dr yang has a question if you could say something about these projects that co-create ksa are working on of course um we actually actually have oh should i put them in the spot we have some of the co-creators from ksa here shout out to helya afterlook um so so it's different array of projects it's been wonderful really uh so one of the teams is working with social robotics uh for uh for autism uh one other team is looking to add peripherals to wheelchairs to allow it to go above curves others are introducing simply just a table or even a battery adjustment uh to uh to work uh there was also uh some work in the area of um of uh providing a platform uh similar to the caregivers that was directed to um a person's disabilities in order to find um facilities that have accessible um entrances for instance which is actually quite ironic because one of the co-designers that i bought to the saudi arabian workshop he was telling me we were supposed to meet together and i remember calling up um different cafes looking for one that was that had an accessible entrance and the funny thing was uh when i called up this cafe they told me yes of course yes uh it's completely accessible so i go there and i realize that there's this huge cup that was not even considered in um so i thought that was really interesting and he was um and he's such a wonderful person uh his uh his name is fahad he was one of the co-designers that we actually working with right now and he was saying that uh he he actually gives workshops now on how to to navigate inaccessible uh environments so he gives that gives people tricks and how to go about um you know climb a curb on a wheelchair for instance so i thought that was interesting uh we have a group uh so alia is actually working on a product that will hopefully help people that have problems with their grip such as children with the down syndrome to hold on to the benefit better and not to be fatigued for too long so they're thinking about using electromyography to measure fatigue and such to make sure that um that the these measure this fatigue is objectively measured and to ensure that they'll be able to join in joint classmates and such in the speed and efficiency of writing and drawing and such so yes honestly multiple projects beautiful projects i'm getting jealous myself i'm like i want to get some my hands on some of those damn it and we're actually so we're actually trying to push towards um so the idea is not to have them um do this do this project as a research but also to have them um be out there be available to people we're talking about intellectual property we're talking about publications we're talking about getting them involved in competition uh just to you know get them excited get them committed uh because unfortunately the um the market versus the technologies it is there but nobody is willing to uh fund them so um yeah so i was just going to add something so you know one of the uh you know you're focused on dementia so what are some of the let's say let's call it the design or technologies that could be developed you know either to help the patient or to help the care the caregiver make it easy to make it maybe a more uh yeah so you know for either one of them or football yes it's actually i've mentioned some of them like esther and aurora or some of these applications that not only supported caregivers but also the patients in order to get them uh to have them essentially to slow the progression of dementia such as more mental exercises that is that are more fun than taxing that allow the caregiver to join the dementia patient and work together in that game as well so there has been a lot of work there uh but because of um i do prefer to um um you know provide to bring those two um uh two people together in in a way that can simplify the process of understanding and hopefully accepting the diagnosis which i don't even know if it's even possible to be accepting of uh of such an illness so easily especially by the patient or the caregiver as well but at least to ease this process in itself but yes there are current applications uh this is what i'm hoping i'm hoping to provide this platform hopefully based on the understanding that i've collected so i want to hopefully normalize this in some way and this is why it's important for me to sit down with the caregivers but also with dementia patients at different levels of progression because we want this platform to be available to the caregivers throughout the patient's uh prognosis so even dealing with um aftercare so after the person passes passes away how does the caregiver deal with this type of grief and so on so we want to be able to pass through all the different stats inshallah it is a great undertaking but i'm willing to take it thank you thank you for that sherok another one of our participants shares that participants pence mom passed away from alzheimer's two years ago the participants shares that one of the biggest challenges was financial considerations and options for mom cap as to whether either of those challenges were addressed in your interviews oh most definitely the financial problems were always the case but i have to mention that i uh most of the caregivers i actually interviewed were well off they were able to pay for caregivers to come by and relieve them from time to time so i think that was unique about the greater boston area where most people were financially more stable than if i went to a bit in a more rural area in the us for instance so they did mention financials but it wasn't the focus they were they were essentially well-off because this was one of the questions demographic questions that we shared with them yeah and the other the other issue was from me uh mark um so hey um because my mom one of the big things that we found especially in south florida and boca raton area was there a lot of resources too for for her um to give the care my brother was a caregiver but a lot of resources that he could take her a day to the f4 atlantic university and she did art projects and she did little things to keep her busy which which helped a lot not only give her something to do but also for the caregiver my brother to get a break um so it'd be i mean it's that's really great um thing is to make sure these caregivers know the resources that are available to them in their in their area because there are start there's more um there's more continuing especially universities and centers and all that so um that helped us a lot oh i bet and that's the thing these uh there is the information is out there but for some reason they're not being not able to reach it either because they're um always completely overwhelmed with the situation that they're not even searching for it and um i realized that the role of the social worker and the case manager was often different from time to time so i interviewed both sides i wanted to understand why there is this disconnect between these two groups are supposed to be working together for the health of the patient uh and i realized that um case managers and social workers were actually frustrated with caregivers because they were not reaching out so the caregivers felt that they were being moored whereas the case managers were saying we're there you're just not reaching out so um so hopefully we'll be able to this will be taken into consideration with what we're doing yeah great i think mark is one of the wonderful one mentors that we have uh with co-create ksa so it's a family affair today huh so maybe one last question from uh um i actually have two questions so you need to choose one i um one of the questions is you listed the themes or the the interview findings which include the social media the use the emotions and and so on so i was my question is maybe um does these themes come from the questions of the interview or this is these are the themes that are coming out of the interview and it is a yes a really good question that's actually the themes that came out of the analysis so um uh the focus of the interview questions was asking them what they found challenging talking about their uh whether it's whether it's mental physical and so on we did actually ask specific questions about their use of technology in general and that's where they tapped into social media and such but yes most of the emotions that they shared were like i was telling maria i remember when every time i left an interview i felt so exhausted because there was a lot of sharing and like i said it's such an intense emotions and they found it as an opportunity to share it and um and unfortunately most of these emotions were negative but i think it was a place for them to vent so they felt comfortable uh but i think it is my role as hopefully a designer of this platform to also acknowledge the fact that i need to resolve these negative feelings nobody should be going through them so even if it's um it doesn't happen all the time it's still something that we hope to mitigate uh so so we did the uh how many annotators for the interviews and how much it was how was the integrator uh reliability on high i don't have the numbers but actually the the uh research i don't have the intuitive uh with me right now but we did actually annotate with so she was one of the qualitative researchers that i worked with i mentioned uh at the beginning so yes we both annotated the tran uh we transcribed and annotated the the uh transcripts sorry this is two technical details because we've done in interviews and we're struggling with the irritation several iterations for to improve oh yes yes it is a headache i know my last questions that's i promise um i i want to see so once you have this analysis it's beautiful and it shows there's a lot of paths that we could do or create in technology to help them out so if there is a one takeaway message that we need to focus on a specific technology that would help caregivers to uh have a better uh day-to-day life what would it be um i think definitely a platform that is private but also allow communication uh between the different caregivers and like i said i want to be able to tap into carers that are not even aware that they are carers so even a clear one person of that facility which is logged on right now is actually my mother she never realized that she's a caregiver so whenever i'm thinking about when i was having these interviews i was thinking about her like she wouldn't reach out she wouldn't use this platform so i'm still working towards how do i attract them how do i identify this group that is not even identical how do i bring them in to the fold of caregiving and make it not as stigmatized as it is unfortunately but yes a platform for communication for information sharing for hand-holding between more advanced mentors essentially essentially it would be something similar to co-create i would suppose i would suppose where we have mentors uh people that are experienced with caregivers that went through the loops like like dr mark mentioned of finding financial help finding support from different people finding organizations based on the state or federal level and being able to link all this information together make it accessible provide a model that they can go back to so dementia so your parent is no longer able to communicate here are the different things you can do your parent is constipated these are different tricks and methods that you can utilize to uh make the life easier so i think this kind of division will um make it easier and make it accessible hopefully i hope thank you very much this is wonderful of course and sharif is actually one of the mentors as well and co-create like you mentioned um tell me excellent here thank you dr shirok thank you professor maria for being with us today and thank you everyone for participating and uh we'll see you again in another uh seminar of the series thank you thank you thank you maria thank you for thank you man that was wonderful thank you everybody nadia teresa dorothy thank you all thank you mom thank you yeah shut up
