 a hierarchy from the Greek hierarchy our rule of a high priest from high rockers president of sacred rites is an arrangement of items objects names values categories etc in which the items are represented as being above below or at the same level as one another hierarchy is an important concept in a wide variety of fields such as philosophy mathematics computer science organizational theory systems theory and the social sciences especially political philosophy a hierarchy can link entities either directly or indirectly and either vertically or diagonally the only direct links in a hierarchy in so far as they are hierarchical are to one's immediate superior or to one of one subordinates although a system that is largely hierarchical can also incorporate alternative hierarchies hierarchical links can extend vertically upwards or downwards via multiple links in the same direction following a path all parts of the hierarchy which are not linked vertically to one another nevertheless can be horizontally linked through a path by traveling up the hierarchy to find a common direct or indirect superior and then down again this is akin to to coworkers or colleagues each reports to a common superior but they have the same relative amount of authority organizational forms exist that are both alternative and complementary to hierarchy header our key is one such form topic nomenclature hierarchies have their own special vocabulary these terms are easiest to understand when a hierarchy is diagrammed see below in an organizational context the following terms are often used related to hierarchies object one entity eg a person department or concept or element of arrangement or member of a set system the entire set of objects that are being arranged hierarchically eg and administration dimension another word for system from online analytical processing eg cubes member an element or object at any level or rank in a class system taxonomy or dimension terms about positioning rank the relative value worth complexity power importance Authority level etc of an object level or tier a set of objects with the same rank Oh our importance ordering the arrangement of the ranks or levels hierarchy the arrangement of a particular set of members into ranks or levels multiple hierarchies are possible per dimension taxonomy or classification system in which selected levels of the dimension are emitted to flatten the structure terms about placement hierarch the apex of the hierarchy consisting of one single orphan object or member in the top level of the dimension the root of an inverted tree structure member up member or node in any level of a hierarchy in a dimension to which superior and subordinate members are attached often a member in any level of a dimension without a parent member often the apex of a disconnected branch orphans can be grafted back into the hierarchy by creating a relationship interaction with a parent in the immediately superior level leaf a member in any level of a dimension without subordinates in the hierarchy neighbor a member adjacent to another member in the same level or rank always appear superior a higher level or an object ranked at a higher level a parent or an ancestor subordinate a lower level or an object ranked at a lower level a child or a descendant collection all of the objects at one level IEP is peer an object with the same rank and therefore at the same level interaction the relationship between an object and its direct superior or subordinate ie a superior inferior pair a direct interaction occurs when one object is on a level exactly one higher or one lower than the other ie on a tree the two objects have a line between them distance the minimum number of connections between two objects ie one less than the number of objects that need to be crossed to trace a path from one object to another span a qualitative description of the width of a level when diagrammed ie the number of subordinates an object has terms about nature attribute a heritable characteristic of members and their subordinates in a level eg hair color attribute value the specific value of a heritable characteristic eg Auburn in a mathematical context in graph theory the general terminology used is different most hierarchies use a more specific vocabulary pertaining to their subject but the idea behind them is the same for example with data structures objects are known as nodes superiors are called parents and subordinates are called children in a business setting a superior is a supervisor boss and appear as a colleague topic degree of branching degree of branching refers to the number of direct subordinates or children an object has in graph theory equivalent to the number of other vertices connected to via outgoing arcs in a directed graph a node has hierarchies can be categorized based on the maximum degree the highest degree present in the system as a whole categorization in this way yields two broad classes linear and branching in a linear hierarchy the maximum degree is 1 in other words all of the objects can be visualized in a lineup and each object excluding the top and bottom ones has exactly one direct subordinate and one direct superior note that this is referring to the objects and not the levels every hierarchy has this property with respect to levels but normally each level can have an infinite number of objects an example of a linear hierarchy is the hierarchy of life in a branching hierarchy one or more objects has a degree of two or more and therefore the minimum degree is 2 or higher for many people the word hierarchy automatically evokes an image of a branching hierarchy branching hierarchies are present within numerous systems including organizations and classification schemes the broad category of branching hierarchies can be further subdivided based on the degree a flat hierarchy is a branching hierarchy in which the maximum degree approaches infinity ie that has a wide span most often intuitively regarded as hierarchical have at most a moderate span therefore a flat hierarchy is often not viewed as a hierarchy at all for example diamonds and graphite are flat hierarchies of numerous carbon atoms which can be further decomposed into subatomic particles an overlapping hierarchy is a branching hierarchy in which at least one object has two parent objects for example a graduate student can have two Co supervisors to whom the student reports directly and equally and who have the same level of authority within the university hierarchy ie they have the same position or tenure status topic history of the term possibly the first use of the English word hierarchy cited by the Oxford English Dictionary was in 1881 when it was used in reference to the three orders of three angels as depicted by pseudo-dionysius the areopagite v 6 centuries pseudo-dionysius used the related Greek word hierarchy a hierarchy are both in reference to the celestial hierarchy and the ecclesiastical hierarchy the Greek term hierarchy amines rule of a high priest from hierarchies hierarchies meaning president of sacred rites high priests and that from high rias high rias priests and are Shosh amongst others first place or power rule and Dionysius is credited with first use of it as an abstract noun since hierarchical churches such as the Roman Catholic see Catholic Church hierarchy and Eastern Orthodox churches had tables of organization that were hierarchical in the modern sense of the word traditionally with God as the pinnacle or head of the hierarchy the term came to refer to similar organizational methods in secular settings topic visually representing hierarchies a hierarchy is typically depicted as a pyramid where the height of a level represents that levels status and width of a level represents the quantity of items at that level relative to the whole for example few directors of a company could be at the apex and the base could be thousands of people who have no subordinates these pyramids are typically diagrammed with a tree or triangle diagram but note that not all triangle pyramid diagrams are hierarchical for example the 1992 USDA food guide pyramid both of which serve to emphasize the size differences between the levels an example of a triangle diagram appears to the right an organizational chart is the diagram of a hierarchy within an organization and is depicted in tree form in section organizations below more recently as computers have allowed the storage and navigation of ever larger datasets various methods have been developed to represent hierarchies in a manner that makes more efficient use of the available space on a computer screen examples include fractal maps tree maps and radial trees topic visual hierarchy in the design field mainly graphic design successful layouts and formatting of the content on documents are heavily dependent on the rules of visual hierarchy visual hierarchy is also important for proper organization of files on computers an example of visually representing hierarchy is through the nested clusters the nested clusters represents hierarchical relationships by using layers of information the child element is within the parent element such as in a Venn diagram this structure of representing hierarchy is most effective in representing simple relationships for example when directing someone to open a file on a computer desktop one may first direct them towards the main folder then the subfolders within the main folder they will keep opening files within the folders until the designated file is located for more complicated hierarchies the stare structure represents hierarchical relationships through the use of visual stacking visually imagine the top of a downward staircase beginning at the left and descending on the right the child elements are towards the bottom of the stairs and the parent elements are at the top this structure is effective when representing more complicated hierarchies where steps are not placed in obvious further steps are concealed unless all of the steps are revealed in sequence in the computer desktop example a file that is being sought after can only be found once another file is opened the link for the desired file is within another document all the steps must be completed until the final destination is reached topic in formal representation in plain English a hierarchy can be thought of as a set in which no element is superior to itself and one element the hierarchy is superior to all of the other elements in the set the first requirement is also interpreted to mean that a hierarchy can have no circular relationships the association between two objects is always transitive the second requirement asserts that a hierarchy must have a leader or root that is common to all of the objects topic mathematical representation mathematically in its most general form a hierarchy is a partially ordered set or posed a the system in this case is the entire pose a which is constituted of elements within this system each element shares a particular unambiguous property objects with the same property value are grouped together and each of those resulting levels is referred to as a class hierarchy is particularly used to refer to a pose a in which the classes are organized in terms of increasing complexity operations such as addition subtraction multiplication and division are often performed in a certain sequence or order usually addition and subtraction are performed after multiplication and division has already been applied to a problem the use of parentheses is also a representation of hierarchy for they show which operation is to be done prior to the following ones for example two plus five times seven to four in this problem typically one would multiply five by seven first based on the rules of mathematical hierarchy but when the parentheses are placed one will know to do the operations within parentheses first before continuing on with the problem these rules are largely dominant in algebraic problems ones that include several steps in order to solve the use of hierarchy in mathematics is beneficial in order to quickly and efficiently solve a problem without having to go through the process of slowly dissecting the problem most of these rules are now known as the proper way into solving certain equations topic subtypes topic nested hierarchy a nested hierarchy or inclusion hierarchy is a hierarchical ordering of nested sets the concept of nesting is exemplified in Russian matryoshka dolls each doll is encompassed by another doll all the way to the outer doll the outer doll holds all of the inner dolls the next outer doll holds all the remaining inner dolls and so on matryoshka is represent a nested hierarchy where each level contains only one object ie there is only one of each size of doll a generalized nested hierarchy allows for multiple objects within levels but with each object having only one parent at each level the general concept is both demonstrated and mathematically formulated in the following example square quadrilateral polygon shape display style text square subset text quadrilateral subset text polygon subset text shape a square can always also be referred to as a quadrilateral polygon or shape in this way it is a hierarchy however consider the set of polygons using this classification a square can only be a quadrilateral it can never be a triangle hexagon etc nested hierarchies are the organizational schemes behind taxonomy z' and systematic classifications for example using the original Linnaean taxonomy the version he laid out in the 10th edition of Systema naturae a human can be formulated as H sapiens Homo primates Mammalia amalia display style text H sapiens subset text homo subset text primates subset text Mammalia subset text Animalia taxonomies may change frequently as seen in biological taxonomy but the underlying concept of nested hierarchies is always the same in many programming taxonomies and syntax models as well as fractals in mathematics nested hierarchies including Russian dolls are also used to illustrate the properties of self-similarity in recursion recursion itself is included as a subset of hierarchical programming and recursive thinking can be synonymous with a form of hierarchical thinking and logic topic containment hierarchy a containment hierarchy is a direct extrapolation of the nested hierarchy concept all of the ordered sets are still nested but every set must be strict no two sets can be identical the shapes example above can be modified to demonstrate this Square quadrilateral polygon shape display style text Square subsets McCue text quadrilateral subsets nakute text polygon subset nakute text shape the notation X Y display style X subset nikki y means X is a subset of Y but is not equal to Y a general example of a containment hierarchy is demonstrated in class inheritance in object-oriented programming two types of containment hierarchies are the subjunctive containment hierarchy in the compositional containment hierarchy a sub symptom fire are key subsumes it's children and a compositional hierarchy is composed of its children a hierarchy can also be both substantive and compositional topic subtalar are key a subsonic containment hierarchy is a classification of object classes from the general to the specific other names for this type of hierarchy are taxonomic hierarchy and is a hierarchy the last term describes the relationship between each level a low level object is a member of the higher class the taxonomical structure outlined above is a subsonic and hierarchy using again the example of Linnaean taxonomy it can be seen that an object that is part of the level Mammalia is a member of the level and Amalia more specifically a human is a primate a primate is a mammal and so on a substantive hierarchy can also be defined abstractly as a hierarchy of concepts for example with the Linnaean hierarchy outlined above an entity name like Animalia is a way to group all the species that fit the conceptualization of an animal topic compositional containment hierarchy a compositional containment hierarchy is an ordering of the parts that make up a system the system is composed of these parts most engineered structures whether natural or artificial can be broken down in this manner the compositional hierarchy that every person encounters at every moment is the hierarchy of life every person can be reduced to organ systems which are composed of organs which are composed of tissues which are composed of cells which are composed of molecules which are composed of atoms in fact the last two levels apply to all matter at least at the macroscopic scale moreover each of these levels inherit all the properties of their children in this particular example there are also emergent properties functions that are not seen at the lower level eg cognition is not a property of neurons but is of the brain and a scalar quality molecules are bigger than atoms cells are bigger than molecules etc both of these concepts commonly exist in compositional hierarchies but they are not a required general property these level hierarchies are characterized by bi-directional causation upward causation involves lower level entities causing some property of a higher level entity children entities may interact to yield parent entities and parents are composed at partly by their children downward causation refers to the effect that the incorporation of entity X into a higher-level entity can have on excess properties and interactions furthermore the entities found at each level are autonomous topic contexts and applications according to kulish V V 2002 almost every system of organization applied to the world is arranged hierarchically by their common definitions every nation has a government and every government is hierarchical socio-economic systems are stratified into a social hierarchy the social stratification of societies and all systematic classification schemes taxonomies are hierarchical most organized religions regardless of their internal governance structures operate as a hierarchy under God many Christian denominations have an autocephalous ecclesiastical hierarchy of leadership families are viewed as a hierarchical structure in terms of cousinship eg first cousin once removed second cousin etc ancestry as depicted in a family tree and inheritance succession an airship all the requisites of a well-rounded life and lifestyle can be organized using Maslow's hierarchy of human needs learning must often follow a hierarchical scheme to learn differential equations one must first learn calculus to learn calculus one must first learn elementary algebra and so on even nature itself has its own hierarchies as numerous schemes such as Linnaean taxonomy the organization of life and biomass pyramids attempt to document hierarchies are so infused into daily life that they are viewed as trivial while the above examples are often clearly depicted in a hierarchical form in a classic examples hierarchies exist in numerous systems where this branching structure is not immediately apparent for example most postal code systems are hierarchical using the Canadian postal code system as an example the top levels binding concept is the postal district and consists of 18 objects letters the next level down is the zone where the objects are the digits 0 to 9 this is an example of an overlapping higher because each of these ten objects has 18 parents the hierarchy continues downward to generate in theory seven million 200,000 unique codes of the format AO AO AO the second and third letter position allowed 20 objects each most library classification systems are also hierarchical the Dewey Decimal System is regarded as infinitely hierarchical because there is no finite bound on the number of digits can be used after the decimal point topic organizations organizations can be structured as a dominance hierarchy in an organizational hierarchy there is a single person or group with the most power in authority and each subsequent level represents a lesser Authority most organizations are structured in this manner including governments companies militia and organized religions the units or persons within an organization are depicted hierarchically in an organizational chart in a reverse hierarchy the conceptual pyramid of authority is turned upside down so that the apex is at the bottom and the base is at the top this mode represents the idea that members of the higher rankings are responsible for the members of the lower rankings topic life empirically we observe in nature a large proportion of the complex biological systems they exhibit hierarchic structure on theoretical grounds we could expect complex systems to be hierarchies in a world in which complexity had to evolve from simplicity system hierarchies analysis performed in the 1950s laid the empirical foundations for a field that would be from the 1980s hierarchical ecology the theoretical foundations are summarized by thermodynamics when biological systems are modelled as physical systems in its most general abstraction they are thermodynamic open systems that exhibit self-organized behavior and the set subset relations between dissipative structures can be characterized in a hierarchy topic computer graphic imaging CGI and computer animation programs mostly use hierarchies for models on a 3d model of a human for example the chest is a parent of the upper left arm which is a parent of the lower left arm which is a parent of the hand this is used in modeling and animation for almost everything built as a 3d digital model topic linguistics many grammatical theories such as phrase structure grammar involve hierarchy direct inverse languages such as Korean mapu Duncan distinguish subject and object on both snot by different subject and object markers but fire a hierarchy of persons in this system the three or four with Algonquian languages persons are placed in a hierarchy of salience to distinguish which is subject and which object inverse markers are used if the object outranks the subject on the other hand languages include a variety of phenomena that are not hierarchical for example the relationship between a pronoun and a prior noun phrase to which it refers commonly crosses grammatical boundaries in non hierarchical ways topic music the structure of a musical composition is often understood hierarchically for example by heinrich Schenker 1768 - 1835 see Sheng carrion analysis and in the 1985 generative theory of tonal music by composer Fred Laurel and linguist ray jackendoff the sum of all notes in a piece is understood to be an all-inclusive surface which can be reduced to successively more sparse and more fundamental types of motion the levels of structure that operate in Schenker's theory are the foreground which is seen in all the details of the musical score the middle ground which is roughly a summary of an essential contraband to progression and voice leading and the background or assets which is one of only a few basic long-range counterpoint structures that are shared in the gamut of tonal music literature the pictures in form tonal music are organized hierarchically all pictures deriving their importance from their relationship to a tonic key and secondary themes in other keys are brought back to the tonic in a recapitulation of the primary theme susan McCleary connects this specifically in the Sonata Allegro form to the feminist hierarchy of gender see above in her book feminine endings even pointing out that primary themes were often previously called masculine and secondary themes feminine topic criticisms of views concerning distinctions of type and categories well as distinguishability in the work of diverse theorists such as William James 1842 to 1910 Mitchell Foucault 1926 to 1984 and Hayden white important critiques of hierarchical epistemology are advanced James famously asserts in his work radical empiricism that clear distinctions of type and category are a constant but unwritten goal of scientific reasoning so that when they are discovered success is declared but if aspects of the world are organized differently involving inherent and intractable ambiguities then scientific questions are often considered unresolved hierarchy and ethics emerged in Western Europe West Asia and North Africa around the 1600s in this aspect the term hierarchy refers to how distinguishable they are from real to unreal feminists Marxists anarchists communists critical theorists and others all of whom have multiple interpretations criticize the hierarchies commonly found within human society especially in social relationships hierarchies are present in all parts of society in businesses schools families etc these relationships are often viewed as necessary entities that stand in hierarchical arrangements are animals humans plants etc in some cultures God can also be in addition to this hierarchy however feminists Marxists critical theorists and others analyze hierarchy in terms of the values and power that it arbitrarily assigns to one group over another hierarchical ethics offers a way of logical reasoning that is compatible with religious commitments in some cultures there is hierarchy within humanity the man in a family is above the woman and children are after and in social classes there might be a hierarchy as follows king civic officials craftsmen unskilled workers topic ethics behavioral psychology philosophies of identity in ethics various virtues are enumerated and sometimes organized hierarchically according to certain brands of virtue theory in some of these random examples there is an asymmetry of compositional significance between levels of structure so that small parts of the whole hierarchical array depend for their meaning on their membership in larger parts there is a hierarchy of activities in human life productive activity serves or is guided by the moral life the moral life is guided by practical reason practical reason used in moral and political life serves contemplative reason whereby we contemplate God practical reason sets aside time and resources for contemplative reason topic
