 [Music] [Music] good morning everyone and welcome to another episode of learn with Jason today we've got Giovanni Briggs from err table how you doing at Giovanni I'm doing all right how are you Jason I I'm doing great I as we were getting prepped here I tried to knock over everything on my desk and so feeling very fortunate that I didn't actually do that so today we are gonna be talking about air table right yes I hope so I hope that's why you have here surprised it's gonna be mad alright so what I am really excited about so I actually I this is one of the rare cases where I've actually used the thing that we're about to talk about so on my my personal site I have this speaking page and I think that's right URL yeah and down here I have this whole setup of like my talks and all this stuff and this is all pulled from air table so right really love this as a as a like feature it's like it's such a cool powerful tool for that and today what I was hoping we could do is just walk through the process of doing that and so what I'm gonna do is actually sign up for a brand new air table account so you're gonna step through that process and I'm hoping that that's not gonna trip me up in any way but let's give it a shot and while I'm doing that do you want to talk for a minute about what air table is yeah absolutely so air table it's a web-based application the goal of allowing anyone to construct robust collaborative software applications that are optimized for their unique workflows and processes and so what that looks like to a lot of people when they first jump in is excel on rocket boosters so it's got a lot of the familiarity that you see within an excel spreadsheet but without but with some additional functionality that makes it more akin to a relational database and so when you look at a lot of web apps whether they're full-fledged SAS applications or internal tools or a personal project like your personal website you can really break those down into three layers right so you have your data layer were you to find the different objects that make up that application the relationships between them your application layer that allows you to create read update or delete items out of that data layer and then your presentation layer which lets you which allows end-users to then interact with that data and so air table allows you to customize and configure all three aspects of that application again which allows you to really optimize your workloads and processes so rather than using an application where you have to pigeonhole what you do into the confines of that application you get to build your own so excited to hop in and show sort of a lightweight example of what that can look like and how you can use our API and gatsby to then build new presentation layers on top of air table awesome so that timing could not have been better because right as you were wrapping up I finished signing up so we're ready to rock and roll here it's like I timed it or something yeah yeah I guess the the cats out of the bag we do practice runs of this whole thing I'm kidding this is complete chaos so so what were we gonna build what do you think is a good example to build for kind of showing off what air table and gatsby can do yeah so one project that I have always wanted to do but have never quite had the time to do is build my own personal portfolio website right so where you list out you know my work experience my education different projects that I'm working on open-source projects that I've contributed to my Stack Overflow profile you know having that all in one place you know I have LinkedIn for that today but I don't necessarily always like the way LinkedIn presents that information I'm so having my own personal space in the web there's something that I think a lot of people like to build and have and I think it would be so it's a cool way I think to merge air table and Gatsby mmm-hmm okay so how should we do that what's the what's the process like I I noticed when I hit at a base got some options here yeah so within air table right so right now you're looking at your workspace and a workspace is a collection of bases and we call them a base because they're again akin to a database when you first sign up for air table we pre fill it with some template basis of common use cases that we see people use air table for and whether it's product planning project tracking a sales CRM air table our own CRM is actually all built-in air table so there's a lot of different use cases that you can leverage air table for and so we just want to pre-populate with some of the more common ones but we can go ahead and just start from start from scratch and there are a plethora of templates out there that you could use yeah let's go ahead and and start from scratch I think it's more fun yeah let's do it ooh and we can choose all these fun things okay so let's make it purple because it's gatsby brand then it's a portfolio so we're going to choose ooh this one yeah that's excellent okay we did it so now we have our portfolio base okay right and I don't need a guide because I have one all right so what should we do yeah so now that you're in air table again what you would you see when you first start is very akin to a spreadsheet we've got some rows we have some columns when you're thinking about designing something within air table you should really think about it similar to how you would build a sequel database what are the objects that I want to store what are the relationships between those objects let's let's hypothetically say I've never designed a sequel database what how how should we think about that so objects objects we want to store right the attributes that those objects have okay and then the relationships between them okay so when we think about what makes up a resume write a resume has items right it just has line items so I think for our our table we can go ahead and rename it okay let's just call it items items we always eat when we say when we say resume like this is actually a good question what what type of portfolio are we building are these is this like a job portfolio like this is where I've worked or is this going to be a collection of projects is it going to be a collection of jobs and the projects I did for that how much time do we have so I think when I was thinking about this I think it can be all of those and then we we can sort of grow and expand in different directions right because even if it's you know projects that I've worked on and places I've worked they share a certain amount of attributes right they have a title they have a time frame that you were working on them okay you had a certain role there there was a platform that you were working on so I think that you know all of those items share a common set of attributes that we can begin working with first and then we can sort of look at how to build relationships if we need to grow and expand that okay so we'll call it items to start yeah and I assume we probably want to keep a name um but we need to add more things so how does how does the portfolio work in your mind yeah so I think each item has a has a name or a title it then has a start and an end date so we can have a start date I mean it was yeah if you click on that err tables got pre-loaded a ton of different field types that you can pick from so we probably want a date for this one who do we want to Oh duration is time and minutes or seconds cool right I think Kate was up towards the yeah I was actually just like scrolling to see what was over you we we constantly try and add new field types is we get feedback from people but date has been one that has been around for quite some time cool and and we we can choose a date format we're gonna use ISO because we're nerds and I'm gonna assume we don't need time so I'm gonna I'm gonna save without it does that feel right to you yeah unless you know the exact time that we started a project I feel like that's not super important that's very all right I'm gonna create an end date and while we're doing that there is a question from Smashbox can we populate these records in air table from an external data source yeah it's a good question so when we first created the base there was an option there to import from a spreadsheet so if you have an existing excel spreadsheet or CSV file you can create a base directly off of that but we'll see in a little bit is air table also offers a public API and so using that API you can create read update and delete records in an air table base so that's another common way that we see people you know pull data out of an existing data source and and upload it into air table cool let's see so we can I lost my train of thought where we okay we've got a name I've got a start date we've got an end date what else should we what else should we track I think you normally have a title right or a role so you know from from an educational standpoint you know your role was student bachelor's or master's I met at a job it's you know whatever your title is so I think that can just be freeform freeform text yeah okay I also think that there are there are categories right we've kind of talked about some of them jobs education project and so that we probably want to use a single select which is basically in rights you define all of the different options that you want to allow in that field and then you can select those options as you create new records and we add fancy colors to it to make it easier to discern you know what group something belongs didn't do okay and so we what do we say we said it's too or no this is categories so we probably just make do we need to define these now or should we make these up as we go along I think we can make them up as we go along that's gonna be another nice part to this is once we sort of define the high level scheme oh we can go in and quickly add new features or new new values as necessary okay anything else I would add platform right so is this a project that's on github you could also think of the platform as you know the educational institution that you went to the company that you worked for and that one I would probably also do that one is a single select because you're probably gonna want to reuse platforms if I'm thinking about you Jason the number of github projects that you have and may want to show is there are likely multiple of them and so you want to be able to reuse that value you could do it as single text right but then if you fat-finger something github with a capital H becomes different than getting all right yeah okay yeah that makes sense right and so this again is gonna be an area where air table is gonna be different than than a spreadsheet is you do get to sort of and you get to start enforcing some of those data validation rules by using things like single select nice and yeah because I have definitely tried that in Excel and well it is possible it has not always been well it relies on me being good at my job which i think is usually not the right thing when I'm in Excel for most developers relying on them to be consistent I find is a big ask yeah okay so let's uh let's let's see we said this is gonna be your portfolio so do you want to give me some either some made-up or actual items to add into this thing yeah sure so we can I was day well we can start with my my err table job okay so I'm a sales engineer let's see I started in started November 15th 2018 November 15th I don't know why I started on a Thursday but I did and I guess we'll just we'll leave it blank as a John yeah oh wait hold on so this is I did the wrong thing you know you're fine air table and the role is sales engineer okay it's a job right so we can go ahead and add we don't have any categories in there now so as you're as you type into the field right we've now added that as a new enum that we can pre-populate at a later point in time yeah and so now it's actually here which is really nice right and then if you click on categories yeah and do customized field type it looks like it broke it I added like a blank one somehow or did I do that no so it'll always give you the option to add new options which was an odd sentence but yeah and then you can change the colors so that it's whatever color scheme you best okay so we've got it green right gonna say I didn't save now we've got a green job and writes the platform let's do err table again okay I think this will make sense in a minute but yes all right I'm glad that you got a plan are we getting notes in a or should I delete these so I think for notes you can give if you think about you know when you're adding items on to your portfolio and you know you you want to give a little bit of a description so we can leave it blank for now because I don't necessarily want to keep bore you with my my long job description nice that way you've got something and then attachments probably not probably not unless you want to add an image for that item but I don't think we would necessarily have to or you can grab our logo that works why not let's let's show how it works I feel like this app let's go yeah I'm gonna save the air table logo and we'll put it in downloads and we can drop it in here nah this is something that I really enjoyed about about air table in general as like the how easy it was to stick an image in there versus like when you're in Excel you're doing like URL references or something so just being able to drag and drop is really nice alright so let's go ahead yeah I was gonna say those images are also accessible in the API so as we start using the API and we're querying these records you can get a link to that attachment and use it very cool all right so let's where am I going here I want this one and what's next I worked at worked at we pay prior to to air table like that or is it like one word one word camel case camel case there you go I guessed right yeah and that will also eventually be a job description oh nice copy and paste I started there in June of 2016 yeah and if you just keep typing in the date it'll it'll figure out what you mean yeah just a June first I don't remember the exact day close enough for government work and I stopped working at the end of October of 2018 October's to 10:00 yeah 10:31 and I was also a sales engineer there as well okay and that was a job it was and we can say the platform was was we pay okay and then we can add oh yeah you want to add a logo go for it it's gonna be that this with that oh no you gotta get the a chase company we were acquired so uh huh I do do you want a paver pay my respects yeah and you can't add multiple attachments to each record as well it's often times that people just have a one attachment per record but sometimes if you have you know if you're managing a project and that project has a collection of documents associated with it you can upload multiple attachments to it okay and so do you think this is this is maybe good enough yeah I think we can start here we can add more projects and things in as as we go along okay so now we we have records do you need to do things are we gonna like are we gonna create relationships are there other I think we can we can start with a nice flat table for now relationships one nice thing is when we get into sort of the the Gatsby side of it with the graph QL managing those relationships becomes really easy but it does take a little setup and work so I think I think we can we can start from here okay yeah one thing I do want to call out if you go up to the the help in the top right and then click on API documentation okay one so air table dynamically creates an API for every base so this API is going to be unique to your base schema so as you change fields as you add fields remove field to add tables modify relationships that is all immediately reflected in the API and so it really is building that for a lot of people you know if you set up a traditional sequel database one of the first things you end up having to do is figure out how do I create read update and delete records out of that you database and so we've taken that boilerplate for you and generate that API so those fields have different types associated with them that have different rules so you're single selects are gonna look different than a single line text and that's all enforced at the API so this I think is one of the coolest parts of aver table especially for our more developer inclined users we're really again creating that boilerplate API for you so that you can just start extending it building things on top of it without having to worry about that underlying API yeah very cool and it's got all the all the set up so like if we wanted to create a record we can just go through and do you know just use the air table library and rather these steps that's that's pretty slick that's that's really nice that the documentation will modify dynamically as well sometimes you have to refresh the page but again as you make changes into that base everything in this documentation will update as well yeah I'm diggin it so alright from here we'd go a handful of directions like well on the one hand we can just go to straight to Gatsby and we can start putting something on the page on the other hand we could go deeper into what air tables capable of cuz you know I know we haven't touched even a fraction of what is actually possible with the tool so what would you say is the the best like next step for us I think we can go into Gatsby okay let's hop on it yeah alright here we go so let me get to wait where am I I I don't know that would be your machine I can't help you with this one okay so we have an empty an empty folder here so let's go ahead and we'll do Gatsby new and we will just put it right here and I'm gonna use the hello world starter yeah it's my favorite one to start with yeah my I've also just been having with sharp lately because I I upgraded to node 12 and upon doing that have just opened up a handful of problems that I like they're they're easy enough to deal with but nobody wants to watch me struggle through it that's fair my own developer environment is a there's a mess so I'm glad that you're responsible for this party yeah yup okay so we now have a site here and I believe when I head over to my editor I have our hello world site is now in place right so we've got you know nothing is configured here we were sitting on a blank got to be install we've got Gatsby react and react Dom and that's it so from here we need to do a couple things the the first thing we're gonna do is we're going to use the air table source right let's see here something odd is happening in the chat and I don't know what it is but hey whatever oh we're being raided I've never actually seen that happen before welcome to everyone coming over that's that's super fun alright cool so we've got a Gatsby source err table and in this we're going to effectively set it up we need our API key and so this this API key I'll have to like grab off-screen and and set up as a an environment variable and then we set up our tables and we're not gonna get into any of the advanced stuff just yet right we're basically doing this this very simple approach yeah we can just start with one table and then look at how to add relationships later yeah cool so let's just go ahead and do this step here we're going to add gatsby source err table and once we get that I can head over in here and in the config we're gonna set it up to use plugins and the plug-in that I want to use is going to be gatsby source air table and for the options we want to use let's go back to the docks I need an API key yeah and that's going to be air table API key haven't set that up yet but I will and then for the tables I need a base ID mm-hm and a table name and that's it the view a bell alright the view we can leave out we can talk about views we talk about views later and so this is my base ID right yes it's also in the URL of the documentation whichever way you want to pull it there's a couple different places to 2rl of the documentation yeah so were you seeing your table calm yep that one too okay that's normally how I get to it okay so I can drop them a base ID and then my table is called gatsby portfolio or items the table is called items items got it yeah and I believe the gatsby source plug-in does care about capitalization so okay we are case sensitive okay so then I need to create a dot m dot actually I'm just gonna do a dot n wait yeah that's what I want so I'm gonna do a dot N and I'm going to also install dot N and this is going to be err table API key and that value needs to be there so for now we're not going to have that and then up here I'm going to require dot M and then we just call config with no options and that's gonna pull in this dot end file um so let me take this off screen or did I just do I did nothing is what I did let me take that off screen and let me take this off screen for just a second and I'm gonna grab my API key which I will find oh no under your account okay so if you top there should be a little me let me come about the top for a second so I have my avatar here I'm doing to account all right and I can generate an API key so I'm going to click that button but I'm gonna pull off screen first so that I don't every time that I do these things I end up getting myself into trouble or somebody very helpfully will will show me why security is important right yes especially with the raid party here I don't yeah every everybody's favorite okay so we've got I have the dot M is now saved with that API key in it we have our our everything is set up so if this works the way that we want it to work what should happen here is when I do a yarn develop it should tell us that it's pulling air table fields let's see it didn't like it cannot find module gatsby source file system is that a requirement it might be a requirement on the air table I think I ran into this error a long time ago when I was first setting it up specifying a file node does oh if you were using the attachment type you need to include gatsby source file system otherwise it will fall back to a non mapped field does that mean that it worked or that it no okay so we should fix that documentation because it just straight up doesn't work all right so let's add and Gatsby source file system system and what do I do I think it should I bet if we looked at the source plugin it's just requiring it and the Gatsby node okay so I but I don't have to actually let's see all right let's J try it yarn develop okay oh all right so here's the part that we were looking for it fetched all the air table rows so all tools all two of them and now if I grab this URL and open up a table here then what I should be able look at that we've got some fancy nude gatsby features everyone so this is the graphical explorer and this is a really cool thing that the one graph team has been working on that shows you your your whole like graph QL setup and so instead of having to build these queries by hand we can just click buttons and this is really really cool so I'm just gonna click buttons to get the stuff that I want I've got my table and then what else what else do I need I don't know my name there are all of our our fields okay so this is super cool because we have wait why aren't you opening there we go so yeah it just pulls in our items and it gives us air table and it's a little weird that it is oh I get it so it pulls from air table and then gets the table data it's a little confusing that it's shouldn't it maybe I'm just overthinking this but yeah so it's pulling in the the table and then so oh I get it if we were going to do like multiple tables we were just right filter to get just the table that we wanted so we would come up here and we can type filter and then we want the table to equal height oh my god I love this Explorer how nice is that so instead of having to remember how to type out this query right we just check those boxes it's so good okay then when I come back over here we can see we still get the same result but now if we had multiple tables we would only be getting that result which is which is pretty slick all right so let me close that so that we can actually see what's going on but really nice work by the really nice work by the team at one graph and Shawn Grove over there has been really really helpful in making that happen so thanks to them all right so we've got data at this point we can do something like let's grab this and we'll go to our index page and I'm going to import graph QL from Gatsby and we're gonna export a Const called query and that is going to use this graph QL thing and I'm just gonna paste in the query that we wrote in the Explorer and that'll give us what we need okay so your table nodes data name once this executes it's gonna give us a new prop on the the component called data and we can use that however we want so let's do something like this we'll create a div in that div we can say what is this right now it's like my resume and or do an unordered list and we can say data dot all air table dot nodes map and this would be node and then in here we can put in a list item with a key let's add yeah certainly in here yeah there will be a record ID or an ID either one the record ideas actually comes from the air table API got it okay yeah so that one might be it'll be unique for each record yeah that's gonna be node dot record ID and then we can do i guess just like the name so node data name capital name yep all right let's take a look at what happened so if I go to localhost 8,000 and so if if we want to flush that out just a little bit more we can go back in here and let's open up the Explorer again and in addition to the name we also want the role yeah and I think that's probably enough for now so let's verify that that's what we need role good ok so I'm just gonna add that role and then down here we can do something like no dot data dot role at that go back out here and now we've got it so this is cool like this is this is pretty slick we've got a lot of data coming in very quickly you know we were able to let's see we are thirty five minutes into the stream and even with all the the chatter we're still able to very quickly get something up and running right I mean granted we have a long ways to go in terms of making this look nice but getting the data in took very very little effort so that being said what's next what what else can we do here yeah so if we want to go back into air table right so there's a couple things we we could do we could add more rows and then watch guess we pull those in and update them the the other we can do it's just play around within even with an air table a little bit let's do that because I feel like I I spend a lot of time putting data on the screen in Gatsby and well that's very cool I think the this is this is like a powerful tool so it'd be interesting to see what else we can do and then let's come back to Gatsby at the end and show how we can use that so I'd love to see like how do we create relationships between tables how do we you know if I want to if I want to say like I don't know what let's think of something that we can do if we wanted to do maybe we split this out and we make records for companies right and and that's where I was I was setting us up for often tables when you have people who do single selects right they're meant to represent different objects but they don't necessarily have enough attributes on them to create a new table as soon as you look at those single selects and say you know I really want this platform or company to have additional attributes associated with it like a name or a description or a location that's gonna be a prime opportunity to create a new table and start managing that relationship because right now for example say I had multiple roles at air table I would have two different air table records and I would have to copy the logo into each and since companies like to change their logo so frequently if air table were to change its logo I would have to go and modify that in both places what we can do instead is have like you said a company's table okay so let me create a new table yep and I'm gonna call it companies and while I'm setting this up there's a question yeah are we able to do markdown in a field so the short answer is yes the long answer is a little more nuanced the within the the long text field you can go ahead and write markdown we won't necessarily format it as markdown but you could feel free to write as if it is if or markdown and then via the API you would just pull that out as a raw string and then you could use Gatsby's for matters to then render that markdown we also have a rich text field in air table that allows for some of that more specific formatting like you would see in markdown but the way that the API returns it does not look like markdown so the answer is a little bit of yes and no on that one so when you say rich text where is that oh so rich text is a is a I spoke too soon it is a feature we currently have in in beta but that's that's the long-term goal of it sorry I I have all the betas enabled on my account so what is it is it in beta that line gets blurry for me on a day-to-day basis it's not gonna lie that's a weird flex okay so I have created err table and we pay and now I've got their logos attached so let's refactor this table and fix it so how would how would we go about doing such a thing so this is gonna be super easy scroll over to where we had platform mm-hmm let's go ahead and we're gonna change this field type to customize the field type okay instead of a single select we want it to be a link to another record okay and we want to link to the company's table okay so here again when you talk about a relational database right you can have one-to-one relationships or one-to-many relationships or many to many relationships right so when you create these links between tables we let you configure which type of a relationship you want to have okay so for this one I think we want it to be one to one too many so each one is like you could have weight so in each item can only be associated with one platform but platfor or a company but I could work multiple items at one company right but I hold on so let me think through this because the way that I'm reading this is that with this this particular field we only want to allow linking to a single company correct and so if I uncheck this box that's that's what my brain tells me would make that happen you you are right I may have described that poorly Oh Gary intuition is absolutely crap okay all right so I'm gonna do that and then I'm gonna rename this to company so that my brain can process what's happening yeah okay convert convert wait did it just find those it did so when you when you convert linked records when you convert between any field types air table tries to be as helpful as it possibly can be and inferring what you are attempting to do and so we saw those single selects you had already pre-populated the company's table with air table and we pay so it went ahead and created those links even if you hadn't created those links or those items in the company's table when you did that conversion it would have automatically created those records for you cool okay and so now we can also get rid of this because that's part of the company field right so we have the company is linked and then I think what will happen over here is if I look at this it shows that it's working right and so one so here's another thing that I thought might be kind of interesting what if we refactor this to be you and me okay because then we can show kind of how the the many-to-many would work so I'm gonna I'm gonna change this over Briggs not rigs that's okay it happens and this is also you and we should probably as I K if we want to go to hard mode we can create a third table for this yeah or you can make it again it might be a good single select option where you say where you associate who the owner of that item is and then you could use formulas with an air table then take multiple components and make a unique item out of them okay all right so I'm adding a new record for gatsby Diane this is cool because it means it just created it for me automatically but I don't know why I created extra record it's movies Oh when when you first create a table we always pre fill it with three blank rows that that blank row is in there okay so I've got this I'm going to save image as and in downloads good come back over here and we will add this logo okay and then I'm also going to be let's copy this and I will say let's see I started using air table in like 2018 around will say October ish so we'll just pick a day and I will say that I am an enthusiast and will just say this is a it could be a hobby call it a state of mind I'm about it all right so now we have air table is being used at both right and if I look at this it shows here that like my person record is now linked to this air table record which is pretty slick so if I go back over to the API and refresh the page it now shows us the company's table right which is really cool yeah you'll also see now that our items table has changed in the fields that are available to it have also changed so we've got all of the things names note start date role categories and then company down here okay so this is kind of an interesting one so the company it shows it shows record IDs right and so that's like that's all well and good but if I stop and start my server it's gonna put us in a little bit of a dilemma because when I get in here and I say I want my company I got to refresh the page my company it gives me this and that's not super useful right so what I would like to do is make that more like what how do I fix this how do I get it to actually give me the company name yes so that's that's gonna be back in the Gatsby source air table source plugin and so if we if we look again at the at the documentation right the tables is a list for a reason because you can have multiple tables and the source plugin will also let you define the relationships between those tables so that is the tables link table links yep okay and I do that by what now yeah so if we go back to the the gatsby config file okay we're gonna add a table links there's gonna be an array and you named the so this is gonna be the field in the items table that links to another table and I think you called it a company this one and I so I just write company yep and then we we also need to tell the plug-in where the the definition for company as well and so that's gonna be I think we call that companies and this one does and the table links right or or I guess it does it does so you can choose to define that if you want to I mean have it be a bi-directional link or you can just define it once let's actually let's do it without so that we can sing and then alright so we've got that set up and while this is running it looks like we got a couple more questions coming in so would you recommend to use Gatsby in air table to create a simple ecommerce application I get that managing a product portfolio is a great use case but what if you want to connect it to handle orders and sync stock levels and similar things yeah I think you you could look I don't think there's anything preventing you but it does kind of bleed into the next question about the API rate limits if you're running an e-commerce store I mean you're expecting to have hundreds of connections and orders coming through and each of those is going to require a API call to air tables back-end you're likely going to run into our API rate limits and so for that reason it may not be a great fit for that we could use at your table for in conjunction with your ecommerce site is managing and tracking those those orders over time so you could have a you know you have another system that your e-commerce is is dumping into that manages that performance to make sure that your site's always working you then use our API to pipe that data in the air table and then manage that workflow with an air table so be able to change the status of an order to sense you know cancel refunded and be able to track and manage that all with an air table is definitely something that you could do but air table isn't trying to necessarily be a full replacement for some of the sequel databases that are already out there okay and then a follow-up question there that you actually touched on for a minute is around the API request limits so the tax Doc's state five requests per second and thirty seconds before subsequent requests if you exceed that and then the the specific question is are those request fields records basis something else yeah so it's at the base level so if I have one database I can make five requests per second to it okay and so if I have to I can make five to each five to each okay and if I if I would like to get all records that doesn't matter how many records there are it's the one request yeah and the get all records we paginate so we return pages of a hundred records at a time okay okay so let's take a look at the updated set here oh and I'm getting an error let's open the Explorer the company requires now yep cool so now we've got an actual link so we can write something like this and that gives us our company name so we can now look and hey look at that company name so this is really cool and there's a follow-up question I think you already touched on this does air table provide tools for formatting rich text and the answer was soon soon yeah one define time line but yes it is something we're working on it comment feedback that we've we've received and spewed is something the team is working on cool very cool all right so let's let's play with this for a minute and get it into the actual code that we wrote so if I want to get my company I can just come over here grab this and now we have a slightly different setup because it's it's now showing both of our info so I guess maybe we want to sort this too and make sure that we're getting the right info so I'm going to sort and I want to sort by well you probably want to sort by the naída name yeah okay so we're gonna sort by name and I don't particularly care about the order but that's what we want so that's gonna give me I came our stuff alright your stuff and then my stuff and so what we can do is we can just grab this out okay and so that just adds the the sort so that way we're gonna make sure that it groups our stuff and now it's our resumes and we can say we gotta we gotta fix this so it's gonna be work as a or I guess because it's not always gonna be a job and then it's going to be no dot theta dot company dot data dot name all right this is a little messy I think we would probably end up cleaning this up if if this was gonna be the like the full app but for Oh No can I read property name of undefined undefined I might need to stop and start again or it might be that I just did something silly let's take a look enthusiast air table company data name oh that I type oh no no so linked records are always gonna be an array so even if you have so we can we can cheat and it will be company zero in Oh God okay please don't think about it too hard yeah okay all right these are the terrible things that we're doing alright so and there we go so now we've got names it's still linked across and if we want to actually let's look at the at the company image stuff because that was a very cool set up so let's look at the company and the logo and the logo is going to give us a URL and so this is not optimized like we're not installing sharp or any of the Gatsby image optimization stuff we're just straight up pulling in the unoptimized logo which means that this is not going to be the most like performant way of solving this problem right but it will be very convenient for the purposes of Canada showing off what's possible here so then I can do an inline image and we'll do image source equals and images again are gonna be an array oh god this is gonna get so bad company zero data it feels so bad and then we're gonna go with the URL and the alt is going to be I hate it I hate so much of what we're doing right now yeah all right that's atrocious so we'll set a quick style tag and say you know the width is gonna be 50 pixels something right something manageable and that's gonna be a string string okay all right look I absolutely hate this code this is this is the grossest thing that I've written in a long time in a an ideal scenario we would have a way to kind of loop through that because theoretically there's a possibility that you know we could be showing multiple companies that we could be showing like if we were to clean this up and say group all of the sales engineers you know like geo as a sales engineer we pay then at air tables that kind of thing then we would be looping through but you know we we don't really have clearly defined goals for this we're just shooting from the hip here's the other way you could do it too as if you know if you want to break it down by these are the companies that I worked for that may be a better way of structuring that query of issuing the query to the company's table and then having a list of jobs that were associated with that yeah company whereas we're doing that the inverse where we started with the items and then pulled in the the the company info right and if we were to switch this up like we could you know we could bounce out of here and instead of getting let's see we could go with what would we get we would get the how would we do this we would limit it to companies mm-hmm and then once we limit to companies we could get the name and that would give us just the the companies and then we could get like the it was the items items wait is that right we have it we haven't designed the link in the Gatsby config yet that's right we didn't set this up so if we add this items link and stop and restart then we'll be able to see these these links so let's get so we'll just demo this we're not gonna actually change the code so we've got the items now that we've got the items we would pull out the data and the name and that would give us now we've got kind of a right reverse lookup so at air table both geo and I have been there yeah so that's that's kind of a you can you can set up all the relationships gatsby makes it the the source plugin makes it easy to to get the the references going by directionally air table makes it easy to track that data in the first place um anything else you wanna you want to look at there can I start peppering you with questions you [Music] can start peppering me with questions okay curious what questions you have well I have many because there are all these buttons that we haven't clicked like what what are these and what are what are these and I can I can give the the grand spiel ago and so earlier I was talking about you know when you can decompose an application right the presentation layer is how you manage how your end users interact with your data and so it go back to the views so where it says grid view and there's that little down triangle next to it so you can add additional views on top of your data so right now we're using the grid view which renders it in columns and rows depending on what you want to do so if you're like an order tracking system where state is something that's extremely important to you you may want to render as a Kanban board and be able to see all of the orders that are in the different states and that may be beneficial to how you want to run that process is there one of these is this yeah is this set up to show this yeah so you can go ahead and do project tracking so we've we've pre prefilled a project tracker for you and you can see that there are a ton of if you go back to the design projects one got it and go up to all projects there's a there's several different views that allow you to look at the data and so this one makes heavy use of our calendar of you because we're tracking dates and time frames and so those are it's all of the same underlying record data it's now just visualizing it in a calendar rather than rows on a spreadsheet ooh due dates only that's nice right and the other nice thing about views is you can think of them similar to what a database of you would be right so you can say I only want to see X number of fields or I only want to see fields within this date range or grouped in a certain way and so air tables meant to be inherently collaborative so you can invite a ton of different users into your base right like as a project tracker you probably aren't doing this all on your own and then each user can create a view specific to them so if so for example internally we have a project tracker and people get assigned tasks so I have a view in there that's just tasks assigned to me and because I don't I don't necessarily care what everyone else is working on I really just want to know what I am immediately responsible for of you that limit suggests that data cool and then there's this form view which is really cool right do you have an example of the Kanban because I haven't actually looked at this yeah let's check products here yeah there it is here's the Kanban so this is a sort of Trello ish right like oh it sure is look at that it's beautiful and so as you drag across the states the state value on that record changes to reflect it right we're only changing the presentation of that data and how you interact I don't like Kanban boards I prefer to have a grid where I group by state and then manually change the state down so when you say group by state you're talking about something like this yeah so we can we can try it so if you click back on roadmap prioritization and go to add a new view down there at the bottom and click grid okay I'm gonna create a new grid view we can name it Gio's of you okay okay and then we can go to group up there on the top bar nice and now we can pick fields to group by so I want to group by feature status okay you can choose how you want to sort it first the last up to you but here it is right so I can just scroll through and see where everything is I like to keep all of my views mmm collapsed and then just jump into the one that that's most important to me but okay so this is right so this is my view this is this is optimized to how I work not necessarily optimized to how Jason works and now so a question for this what like when you create this does everybody on the this is a question that I've had because I think we ran into this Gatsby because we use our table for a couple things when when you when I'm in here and so I've just changed this and moved it over to this view well everybody else coming into this base be looking at this view when they open it and then like if they change it it changes my view it it depends when you first load a bass it'll load to whoever's last view was open but you can change the view at the same time that somebody else in and view it differently it's only on that first entry where you may get pulled into someone else's view got it okay cool so use private if you want by default they're they're visible by everyone but if we go back you see the the three people there so you can click on that and make it a locked view or a personal view so locked means that everyone can see it but they can't make changes to it and then personal means that it's similar it just won't pop up in that list unless other people there's a little button at the bottom that you can check to say show everyone's personal view so that's those are ways to again sort of create a personalized view okay cool with that being said we've got a question that are getting echoed about notifications that we can pull from air table to automatically trigger a new gatsby build yeah so air table doesn't have web hooks today that's another thing that we're we're working on so as states change in air table we don't we don't necessarily send out to a let me take that a step back web hooks right you say ping me when something changes at this URL so we don't we don't have that today I have seen examples in the wild of people using tools with Gatsby an air table that adds things in air table change it can trigger a Gatsby build but I'd have to look more at how those work I think so like zapier I think has a way to do that like if we go here we might be able to do a web hook yeah so you can use so we do have an integration with zapier that allows you to manage some of this but it is another tool that you have to go set up which is here's why i I normally save that as a last resort sure yeah I mean that so the this like you know somebody saying in the the chat that like this is kind of a top priority for for using it with the jam stack and I would agree with that I think it's it's kind of one of the things that is really powerful with with a lot of headless CMS's is the the web configuration see are you saying that's is that in beta or is that in planning it's it's in planning at this time so it's some of the teams working on but we don't have an active beta for it so rich text is beta people are testing it web hooks we're just trying to be a little bit more thoughtful about what that means for the API what events do we want to surface I mean how do we how do we effectively manage those so it's it's taking a little bit more thought right now okay and so the the way that we would ultimately have to solve this for ourselves like if this was what we wanted to do we could look at I guess putting like there are websites that do a cron job where you would you would be able to do something like pull the table and mm-hmm and then hash the content of the table and then compare that to the last hash and if they were different you could fire off a web book which is I imagine what zapier is doing but if you wanted to set up your own like serverless instance you could totally do that right I'm saying this in response to a question about using serverless functions and so if if you were to do that like that would totally work it's gonna be manual you're gonna be managing it yourself I think it would be it would like are there requests like they should just put everything inside and do Web books now yeah I mean I would not be upset about that honestly web hooks will be a really exciting time once we get that launched because I think it opens up a ton of use cases not just triggering builds right the ability to capture that web hook and then ping other downstream systems and let them know that something changing their table you know having web hooks stem out of air table I think is really important for users who want to make air table their central source of truth for everything and have everything Drive out of air table so it's definitely top of mind again we're just trying to make sure that we're building it in a way that's thoughtful and scalable and really built for the long term totally that totally makes sense cool so with that being said we are running a little short on time and I haven't had a chance to ask you about blocks at all and so I want to know what these are because it seems like something that we it's worth looking at yeah so blocks are an extension of the presentation layer with an air table so it is a it is a paid feature but you can access it now cuz you're on a on a free two week trial since you've created a new account everything else that we've seen today is free so you can sign up for air table and start using that sort of core functionality that we just showed right off the bat so so everything that we've done thus far is is something that you do not have to pay to use correct oh that's kind of a nice view I just clicked a button and oh the the gallery view yeah the cards I enjoyed the parts quite a bit that seems like a good one for like companies for example right so this yeah this is cool all right so with a block though i assuming that we are willing to pay for an air table account okay this is your chance sell us on why we would why blocks are good enough to make him worth paying for yeah so blocks again they're just adding additional capabilities and logic on top of the data in your base so if you click on add a block you can add as many blocks as you want okay but there are helpful tools within within blocks some of them will actually manipulate the data so like the deegeu block we see oftentimes that users accidentally duplicate information and you know they've been doing it for months and they want to be able to go through and clean so the d dupe block helps with that the chart block allows you to render bar charts graphs pie charts really important for your project tracking what how many tasks do I have in a certain status page designer if we want to click on that one's kind of fun this allows you to basically build templates in air table and then on each record it will pull the data out of that record and render it in that template so as you can answer this social media posts right yes social media posts what do you mean social media posts so so we have some teams that will manage their marketing calendars in air table so they're playing all of their posts on it on a number of different platforms most of those have you can decompose a lot of those posts into images and text and so using the page designer block what they can do is they can template what they want those posts to look like and then the page designer for each record in their base will take an image and the the image and text that they want and lay it out in accordance with the template that they built you can also use it to generate invoices right invoices are almost always the same but the data elements in them are going to be different in the Pacific a record yeah and so so if I build this like if I add this block for an invoice is this now a public URL like I can send this page to someone you can make it public if you want so like I guess the reason I'm asking for this is like if I if I were to use this and let's say I had clients and I hooked up like the invoice data could I also hook that up to like a payment button for stripe or something and send somebody a link from our table to say here's your invoice click this button to pay it potentially it just depends on how you're creating the the links to stripe well yeah I mean I guess you'd have to figure out that like how to get template data into that stripe link right but yeah but but yes in theory and you know what eventually I think what we'll be able to do is you know have something more akin to like a stripe block right we're that stripe functionality is natively embedded within air table and gives you that ability to add a to generate that dynamic payment link and be able to send that to someone so we have integrations so send SMS integrates with Twilio so if you're managing an event and you have all of the attendees for that event you have their their phone numbers and you want to be able to text them a message on the day of the event you can use the the send em SMS block to send that information out to them so that's the power of blocks is its gonna right now with air table what you're looking at is it's awesome to be able to modify that presentation layer and be able to you again optimize it specifically for what you want to do what blocks allow you to do is take that a step further and actually take actions on that data programmatic actions on that data without needing to write or develop any software yourself cool yeah so this looks this looks pretty powerful I feel like this would be this is the sort of thing that you start looking into when you've got like a team when you know you as the developer are you know either accessing or feeding data to air table and then you've got someone who needs to like manage or interact with that data in a non developer II way this would the ability to kind of show it off yeah exactly we have teams that use it again for project management it's become super powerful to have those blocks and be able to show you know this is how many tasks we had over time and this is how many are completed or in flight having that level of granularity into your data is extremely important that's what blocks provides the map blocks also a lot of fun there's an example you can go to air table dot-com slash universe to get our it's sort of our collection of clients and it's just a collection templates that people opt to share with the world and so you can copy those templates one interesting one I don't have the link for it but someone uses air table to track cattle on their farm because they're getting GPS data it may not be in universe oh there it is I think it's ultra scan scanning cows yes everything everything that I've ever wanted to see oh I'll see if I can find it and send it to you but it's just it's one of those wild examples of what people are using air table for and because they're tagging all of that GPS data for their cows are they can use the map block to render location markers for those groups this is a this is pretty cool like I I did not know that universe existed so this is this is pretty fun yeah yeah I like this a lot yeah again like air tables more with when I'm working with clients they oftentimes get a little stuck they're like I want a project tracker how does air table do that the answer is it does it however you want it to so I think universe is a really great way of showcasing that if you typed in project tracker you'd get you know 15 to 20 different ways that people have managed projects within air table mm-hmm three why I think that's I used very specific terminology talking and so I think there's a there's there's so many different ways to manage that data mm-hmm within air table again it's it's meant to be specific and optimized to your workflows because how you want to manage your projects gonna be very different than how someone else does well cool so I mean we are kind of coming up on the end of it is there anything that we didn't cover that you think is important to cover I do like the the form view if we want to go back to that form view is kind of fun okay so let's do this let's say we want to add a new thing and I want to do a form view so forms allow you to welcome to create a form not the best sentence I've ever said but it's going to allow you to insert new records into your table base so that can be really helpful when you're sharing with a team so like air table uses forms for bug and issue tracking so customer comes to us with a bug we submit it into an air table form and then that the bug is tracked and managed through its life cycle within the air table after that point in time so yeah so you can use this to submit a new role you can also use it to create like a contact form so if you want someone to be able to say hey you know give me a call I want to talk about setting up a live stream with Jason you could create a forum and have those funnel into an air table base where you manage again those contact forms through their life cycle yeah so all right so I just did that filled out the form it is and it's now in the database so this is like if we were looking for something along the lines of like I actually I have an example of this Gatsby has a an events page wait where is it contributing events I think yeah and so we have this list of upcoming community run events about like Gatsby stuff so this is a great place to look to see what what the Gatsby community is up to but if you want to submit your event we have an air table form for that and so look at you you're able to go in and put in your information and request support and so this is like if you're doing a Gatsby talk at your local meetup you want some stickers to give away whatever that is you can go request that here and this gets put into an air table form that notifies our marketing team and then the marketing team goes in and in air table they can like select approved or not and once they approve it it will go it doesn't trigger a bill but the next time the Gatsby site rebuilds which in our case is multiple times a day it will pull all the new approved events and that that events page so these are already approved events that we have right and and under the hood you're likely using the graph QL query to say only Paul approved events exactly yeah it's a common workflow that we see people leveraging your table for yeah exactly I mean it's it's a very very powerful way to do it you know we also did some cool stuff with that if you're interested that this is all open source code you can find the the events page in the Gatsby j/s org got to be jeaious Gatsby here it's gonna be in the this page ww which is our website and it's somewhere in whoa boy can I do this let's see components events yeah this is this is how we load it and so there is a query here that allows us to mmm use chemo use community events I wrote this is a react hook everyone so I wrote a react hope to just use the community events and this pulls out like the the name organizer and then it has to be approved for posting on the event page and that's that's kind of how we we check that but yeah so this is a this is a really powerful way to kind of deal with that data it makes it really really easy for us to manage that data and let's say I'll just link to this in case anyone is interested and then that I think brings us to the end of our time so geo where should people find you we have a couple different contact forms on our website again err tables free to use so if you want to hop in and start playing around with it feel free and then if you go to err table comm slash pricing there's a couple different ways to contact our team if you want to talk about a larger plan for your business that goes to my lovely sales team and then they'll loop me in as appropriate okay and what if somebody wants to civically follow you around oh if you specifically want to follow me around I'm available on run most of my stuff out of LinkedIn I'm Giovanni Briggs it's the the photo of me slightly frowning and then also on Twitter at Oh God Oh God LinkedIn did that was the first search result on that javonni Briggs oh come on oh well there you can find me on there there's not too many I'm just let me I don't I'm not logged into LinkedIn on this thing but I think that should that should work posted it posted it in the chat and then sorry you said LinkedIn and what was the other one and then I'm on Twitter is kind of a silent observer of the Twitter universe that's the first pancake with a one yeah cuz somebody what's the story so I'm the eldest of three and back in my youthful teenage years my parents mandated Sunday brunch we go do whatever we wanted ring the week but Sunday brunch was sacred time we all had to show up my mom would make enough food to feed a small village and I would sit in the kitchen and just sort of you know you I would have pre breakfast basically and she was one of these brunches one day she's making pancakes the first batch comes out little burned not her best work she hands them over to me and says you know you are my first pancake the first one's never come out quite right and is it it is it is like said that turned around a way back to cooking disgusted sense so I have I have embraced that I am the the first pancake so that is the that is stone-cold again useful teenage I can take on in the world getting told that I was the first pancake and I didn't come out quite right I assume this is this started your spiral into listening to like the Smiths in the Cure and and you know wearing like the the black eyeliner and I never gotten to the black eyeliner but it was you know hood up not really talking to anyone they shattered brutal mama-mama Briggs in for the kill alright so Joe this was so much fun I really appreciate you coming on and teaching us about air table today I've posted all of your links into the chat and thank you everyone for watching make sure that you head over to the the twitch channel and subscribe so that you are able to see upcoming events you can just hit that follow button right up at the top and then if you click over to events you can see we've got a whole sorts of good stuff coming up soon we're gonna do Kenda go cloud next week with Andre we're going to build a Gatsby podcast scene with Henry Jew from Babel which I'm super excited about we're gonna learn more about Hazara we've had Vlad on the the the stream before but it's always a blast having him around he'll we'll see where he's broadcasting from this time last time it was the International Space Station and all sort you know all sorts of good things coming up so please hit that follow button and we will see you next Thursday at 9 a.m. Pacific thanks everyone thanks for having me Jason
