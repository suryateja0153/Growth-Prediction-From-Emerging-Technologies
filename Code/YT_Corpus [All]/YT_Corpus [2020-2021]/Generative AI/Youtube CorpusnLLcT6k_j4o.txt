 [Music] with us today we have omar tacklewall is the vice president general manager of cisco's contact center business unit he is responsible for the development and execution of the cisco context on our strategy and portfolio prior to his role omar was the co-founder and ceo of voice voicia a voice-based ai assistant company which he led into tell the acquisition by cisco in august of 2019. we also are joined by anthony passimard who leads conversational ai product team here at google cloud he is responsible for the overall execution and automating the communication and create exceptional personalized and customer experiences he has proven leadership and transformative technologies and has spent 20 years in various cloud cloud companies such as salesforce aws and now google cloud [Music] there's actually a lot of research showing the impact of ai in contact center but the way the way we're seeing it is that until now contact center always had to balance their operational cost with their customer satisfaction and that's been always the challenge you increase your cost you can get better csa if you decrease your cost you get lower csat it was almost directly linked and that's what ai really is transforming today you can actually achieve both get a better csat and lower your operating cost that's the revolution of ai in contact center and that's fairly recent that you're able to achieve that if you think a little bit about you know where ai impacts contact center it's really about the first thing is helping human agent do their better do their job better be super agent i know access to information in real time etc and we'll talk about that but it's really about making them the center of the contact center and making them very good at their job so they can provide stellar customer experience the other area is to help the customers when they need it at any time 24 7 service get their answers right there without having to talk to a human agent sometimes and really get things done quickly efficiently and in a personalized way and the last area where ai has strong impact contact center is understanding the data understanding what happens in your contact center what kind of information do you have access to what are your customers asking of you what are your agents doing well or not as well and how do you how do you find that all of that ai helps you do that and really optimize your contact center operation very well so if you think about the partnership with cisco here and quantify it's really around a lot of the technology that google has developed over the years particularly with technology around google assistant and the google home and uh how google has invested you know millions and millions of dollars and hundreds of people trying to understand better what people say the content of the conversation and be able to react to that so from the first hello in your call to you know the analytics at the end of the conversation ai is they are all the way listening into the conversation helping customers and agents do their job better so really uh mai has that impact it's transformative the advent of voice technology is is fairly recent two three years i would say where it's at at a level where you can really really feel impact and you see idc here with 1.5 x better net promoter score 2025 i think they're actually sandbagging a little bit here to be honest i think it's going to happen sooner than that that's my that's my personal take yeah i totally agree i mean let's take this back to people so that so we can understand what's what's the ai really trying to achieve i mean each of us have been consumers who have been on the call with a contact center or chatting uh with a contact center and what is it we want it's real basic i want to wait less right you're on that call and you're hearing music you're chatting and you see the bubbles on the screen you want to wait less second thing is identify me faster and don't be so rigid in identifying me right like we want to get past that really quick so we get down to the problem and don't make me repeat myself you want to hear people frustrated ask and repeat themselves the fifth time uh and then at the end of all of that really you just want to get your problem solved so that's where the ai is going to come in in terms of you know reducing the wait times getting you identified not making you repeat yourself so the context is preserved and then helping uh solve the problem from the perspective of the agent it's a it's a really different profile you know um we were talking to some of our partners who had done these extensive interviews of agents and they were surprised at a certain learning they had they were surprised that a lot of the agents came back and they weren't getting burnt out because of the customer conversations they're getting burned out because the difficulty of the system interactions i mean they took the job of customer success because they want to speak with customers at the end of the day and so if you can do the the tools that basically the software that learns and do does some of these interactions for them at least the easy ones the repeatable ones the agent experience is happier and we all know happy agents make happy customers so the ai can impact both sides of this equation [Music] we're all very familiar with the idea of flattening the curve because of the pandemic and just to refresh everybody's memory there the whole issue here and why so many people are at home and social distancing or wearing masks is that at a certain infection rate we overwhelm the hospital beds and if that happens any particular local society is in big big danger and so um and so we've put in all these incredibly impactful painful uh solutions to protect us from the pandemic well the contact center pretty much has the exact same problem uh and it's also exacerbated by a pandemic because now all of a sudden you're not able to go into retail outlets as much and you're you're you're on the phone or you're chatting um and the volumes are somewhat overwhelming and so this is accelerating people's adoption of ai because the ai specifically can help with the situation if you deploy uh a chat bot and a voice bot instead of all those calls piling up and more and more people you know experiencing what gorav was saying you know your call is important to us but you know hear this great music um and they're getting really frustrated and and and so on what's and it's piling up above the capacity of the human agents to process the calls in a reasonable amount of time ai chatbots come in there and some of them you know if you look at like the 80 20 rule you're going to find that some easy problems are very repeatable like you know resetting a password or asking for a location or did my my shipment did my packet shift some of these are like repeatable and easy to handle and a voice bot can process it and they can get the answer to the customer and they can get them off and what that'll do is cut off a huge percentage of the volume and the customer will be dealt with immediately they won't be sitting through these wait times and you bring that volume down so all of a sudden it is below the capacity of the human agents now they're on the phone they're taking calls and people aren't waiting uh and so it is a super impactful type of technology kind of to what anthony was saying you know it gets us out of this trap of you know spend a lot to make people happy be efficient and all of a sudden people are unhappy here you're you're able to get over that because the ai is handling the stuff that can be handling people are out of weight times people are happy the contact center didn't spend too much so it's it's very effective anthony can you talk about some of the things that google cloud has done and focused our efforts when it comes to this pandemic when this happened earlier this year uh everybody at google was very what we call googly they all wanted to help all of a sudden and uh so we all came together and it was it was a massive collaborative effort but first internally at google with different organizations so our team partnered with verily for example which is a healthcare entity of of the alphabet group also worked with our healthcare vertical team focused on healthcare first um so the idea was really to to get something out to market to answer questions from from people think you know am i sick like how do i how do i know how do i self-diagnose myself so in healthcare was pretty obvious uh for citizens you know if they do their their job how do they get their unemployment benefit are they gonna be covered somehow uh in financial services people couldn't pay their mortgage like how do i do that do i can kind of push that out like is there an option for me there or uh you know in uh in uh in health insurance you know if they go do a test or if they're sick they spend days in the hospital are they gonna be covered all those questions just piled on all of a sudden and uh we had to be able to deliver self-service experience very fast and let's let's be realistic if you deploy a full contact center experience you're probably going to take a few months we didn't have that luxury we couldn't wait that long so we had to come up with something new and we did that we collaborated very strongly with internally to get a product out that was able to deploy but in two weeks but you can't do it alone in two weeks you could deploy but you need to you need a partner and cisco was there reacted very very quickly to be able to deploy those bots on an infrastructure telephone infrastructure and contacts and infrastructure but also having an si partner like quantify to help creating those bots for those companies so we've done that uh it's been it's been really successful hopefully helping a lot of people i think we'll talk about some of the use cases here but it's uh it's been a fantastic collaborative effort internally and externally with our partners to deliver this in in record time and uh we're really happy about the results the state of illinois was actually one of the first to launch and actually the governor you know he went and went on on stage to talk about this in his collaboration with google so that that was that was really great what happened there is in the first two months uh they received more queries than the entire year the entire prior year for their unemployment benefit uh it's uh it was a catastrophe literally for the constituent of the state but also for the contact center of the state that just couldn't handle this so they got completely overloaded uh with um with requests the partnership with cisco and quantify and google were able to deploy a quick um a but there a set of bots that handle all those requests uh you know track status etc of the unemployment requests and really got a very very good results out of this uh you know all the all the requests are now handled in a proper manner uh i think they're inserting about 40 000 calls a day right now on both chat and voice channels so it's both channels which is a really really impressive and if you think about a success story here this was really a way to have strong strong impact on people who had lost their job and needed help and could not wait and there was no way without ai that this should have happened to be honest and uh that's a for us you know the fast implementation the really good quality of the bot the great implementation and infrastructure to support that all came together to help people in this really tough time especially at the beginning of handbank but it's still continuing right now if you think about uh if you've worked in enterprise you know that uh public sector is one of those sectors where it takes forever to deploy anything this was the one of the fastest deployment i've seen and and we've seen many other states now doing it uh with that rapid response va so it's it's it's fantastic to see that uh that impact happening this was a really impactful i was so so proud to be able to work with the the the team here with google and quantify and one of the things that we've seen uh since the pandemic happened is we had to create rapid response offers across a whole bunch of our product sets and um we ended up seeing you know situations with uh governments and states having to set you know nurses uh on health lines we've seen situations where people had to over weekend set up a new contact center um then we started moving on to like economic uh con contact centers around jobs and claims and then after that um it started moving on to contact tracing there's a whole bunch of that so as we watch this pandemic progress lots of new volumes as anthony mentioned you know people are seeing situations where one or two months uh saw the whole volume of a year uh right and so that just got all of us it it really uh to move fast to give support and really make a difference it's you're stuck at home but you're impacting people's lives in a pretty big way google is very very strong at ai we know natural language processing we know speech to text we know text to speech uh we have very very strong technology there and we wanted to partner with the leaders in contact center and cisco is a leader in contact center and you can't you can't do one without the other you need both to deliver the solution and so having that strong partnership with the leader was a way to you know leverage first an install base that cisco has and you know if you have a cisco contact center solution today you can benefit from google's ai very very quickly but also leverage the knowledge and the expertise that cisco had in the space to make sure that we're delivering the right solution the right features that is needed in contact center so where that partnership is is very natural uh and we're really trying to meet the customers where they are if they have those cisco or they want to look at a leader leading contact center solution they look at cisco then we want to be there with them and deliver what we do best which is ai it's been a lot of fun to work in this partnership and very impactful uh because when we kind of look at our footprint we have the largest footprint of agents on contact center systems of any player in the world in the united states and were number two and in some cases tied for number one in the international market so we have a great footprint and the beauty of what we're doing with google it meant that we could activate that footprint very quickly for this partnership so that if i'm some customer or some government sitting on a cisco system very quickly you could launch a voicebot and a chat bot uh that's integrated that's why this partnership made so much sense because google took a very thoughtful approach about saying what can we do better than anybody else in the world and bring that to market rapidly they didn't rebuild the entire contact center system they partnered so it just made this very natural [Music] so at the end of the day when a customer gets off an interaction there is really just three high-level impacts to them the first and the most important of course is did you solve the problem but the way they think that through is how easy did you make it like are they you know going to the next room and complaining about the interaction they're like hey i got it solved i'm i'm ha i'm i'm happy um and then and then uh that ease of course impacts their feelings how do they feel about it and of course that gets reflected in stuff like nps and so on so at the end of all this technology talk that's all that matters is solving it solving it in a way that's easy making feel good about it so the specifics about how we do that are first off you know you're doing the voicebots and chat bots to get them fast answers where it's an easy problem but what that does is it changes the profile of the kind of problems that get through to the humans right because you've taken off the easy stuff now the humans are getting involved or they can really add value and there the ai plays a different role it basically is there to make the agent smarter and faster by not interrupting the conversation of the human but by bubbling up answers saying hey try this here's a knowledge-based article here's how we solved it last time and that's really helpful contact centers because as you know in many contact centers the people the agents on the call some of them are new because there's like churn in the industry and so particularly in their in their first few weeks and months that ai is just really hand-holding them and getting them to answers faster and then when the agent gets off the call the ai can come in and provide analytics and coaching and and so the whole process is impacted and at the end of the day what it does solves more problems in an easier fashion in a way that makes the customer happier omar this is this is this is exactly right and i i think uh you know even though google is seen as a technology company and we think about technology all day the way we're looking at contact center ai is all about business outcome everything we're we're looking at every product every feature is all about how do i improve that business outcome for the customers and keeping that in mind allows us to deliver the right products ideally we would deploy that and you wouldn't even know it's ai it's it's just natural conversation in the self-service channel it's it's very efficient agents it's great insights on what's happening for your contact center you do you care what what model you're using do you care what algorithm is there or this and it doesn't matter really let us do the job in the back end that does provide the best possible but what matters is what are we solving for with this solution and hopefully we're really solving those business problems that you described tomorrow i think that that's that's the key and as long as we're focused on that customers will benefit on both mdn customers and our customers so that that that has to be the key message how do you solve a business problem you
