 This is an algorithm dreaming about loudspeakers. Actually it is learning. It is using a technology called Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create approximate pictures of what it sees and identifies as a loudspeaker. Before this we have shown a computer thousands of pictures of loudspeakers. Now two competing algorithms work together. One is creating a picture, the other discriminates it. The creator one is trying to fool the discriminator which is trying to tell apart the real from the fake. Both get better over time. The quality of the pictures is getting better over time. The algorithms learn from each other. To create infinite possibilities of loudspeakers. We used a regular computer CPU for this. No fancy graphics card or cloud service. Only time and a little effort. Soon you may virtualize any idea instantly. At the press of a button. How do you think about that? Leave a comment! Skip forward to minute 17:00 to see the process!
