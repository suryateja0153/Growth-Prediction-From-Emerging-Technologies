 The architecture that we put on the floor in Frontier is as equally capable of solving a big modeling and simulation program as it is at solving a big artificial intelligence program. So what does this allow you to do? Well, you can write down equations and you can do the modeling and simulation to actually predict all kinds of physical phenomena that you see in the world around you. You can predict climate change. You can predict the path of hurricanes. You can build more lightweight cars. You can build models from first principles, equations, and you can solve them to high accuracy. Or you can build models from data, okay? And we've got lots of data around here at the laboratory. We've got atmospheric radiation monitoring data. We've got neutron science data. We've got electronic microscopy data. We've got bioenergy data. We've got genomic data. So now we can use artificial intelligence to actually interrogate and inquire within those models and find predictive capabilities. This convergence of modeling and simulation and big data or AI, that's the exciting part because now they're on equal footing. (calm music)
