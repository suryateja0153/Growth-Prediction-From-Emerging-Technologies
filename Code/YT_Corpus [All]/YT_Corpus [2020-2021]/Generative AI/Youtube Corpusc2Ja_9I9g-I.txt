 all right I guess we'll go ahead and get started welcome to this morning's panel this will be a true panel we're not gonna give any talk so I want it to be conversational there will be time for audience questions after we run through our questions and so please if you do have questions for any of the individual panelists just hold them till the end and then I can run around with a mic we are being recorded so I don't want to have to you know interact with you know break things up to get a mic out to you during the presentations so my name is Harrison Decker I'm associate professor and data librarian at the university of rhode island and i'm the director of the library AI lab I'm gonna introduce our panelists and then just get started right away with asking them questions so the the the gist of this this morning's panel is that I wanted to address and this is sort of prompted by a comment someone made to me who works at a library that is fairly heavily invested in and offers great and extensive programming training you know in languages like R and Python and a variety of other and GIS and variety of other techniques and they said despite their reputation despite everything they're doing and all their success stories they still get questions from the University Provost about you know why is the library actually doing this so that got me thinking well maybe this CNI be a good venue to have a conversation by for practitioners who are very heavily involved in in just doing this sort of thing so to my right I'll start with our first panelist and he's matt burton he's mad as a lecturer in the Department of Information culture and data stewardship at the University of Pittsburgh School of Computing and information his research focuses on digital humanities scholar scholarly communication and competing education he teaches design data science and web technologies in the master of Library and Information science program and he has a PhD from the School of Information University of Minnesota oh sorry just like let's make that University of Michigan yeah yeah he does have a PhD okay I see seated to his right is Vicki Steves Vicki is the librarian for research data management and reproducibility a dual appointment between the NYU division of libraries and the Center for data science and her research centers on integrating reproducible practices into the research workflow advocating openness and all facets of research and building contributing to open infrastructure and she's the co-founder of the lis scholarship archive an open source open access repository for lis and allied fields she also works on the reprozip repro zip project an open-source tool that enables full computational reproducibility of research and Tagget a free and open source qualitative analysis tool then we have my colleague from URI Indrani Mandel she's a lecturer for the department of computer science and statistics at the University of Rhode Island and she's the education coordinator for the URI library AI lab the library AI lab is only a year old but has already been in the headlines for its undergraduate research and outreach programs and indrani's interests our machine learning data science and AI education k-12 students and then our final panelist is Tim Dennis Tim is the director of the data Science Center a research and education support unit at the UCLA library is an instructor an instructor trainer with the the carpenter ease an instructor community that teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide he recently worked to establish the library carpentry as a lesson organization within carpentry and serves on its curriculum Advisory Committee Tim's interests include research transparency and reproducibility open data and inclusive pedagogy so to get started I'm just going to go across the panel and we'll just I guess start we'll start with at the far end and work our way this way I just want you to briefly talk about your own educational background and the work you've been involved with and what sort of specific programming topics you've taught or computation related topics you've taught so start with Tim and work our way down so my my educational I guess background I have a master's of information management and systems from UC Berkeley which is called AI school now and it's part of the data science division relatively new there as well and then I consider myself really a data librarian and I'm self-taught as far as programming I learned a lot I worked with Harrison or moderator at UC Berkeley and learned a lot from him since he has a programming background and at Berkeley I learned a lot because there was this data science kind of Renaissance that happened there as part of this Sloane more funding for data science environments and is really highly generative and I've been taking what I've learned there and applying it to other places like UCSD and now you see la the programming topics I've taught our Python get bash at all taught like data visualization and those tools we've recently I've taught text data mining and our so we try to cover a wide gamut of things and I'm actively involved in developing the carpentry program at UCLA we're a member of the carbon trees it's like a member organization like CNI itself and we're developing you know you know more trying to scale up our number of instructors on campus and teach more of the workshops so I think that's kind of so my journey started in India I an engineer by training and I'm an electronics engineer when I moved to the United States I joined University of Rhode Island and that's where I went to grad school that's when I switched to computer science and got interested in machine learning and data science currently I'm working there as a lecturer and I teach computer science core computer science courses additionally I also teach programming languages at the library I teach are Python machine learning and I also work with undergraduate students interested in research at the AI lab which is located in the library which is a nice thing because we get students from from very diverse backgrounds as for me I also came in to my higher education thinking like English or the classics would be the best thing to do before library school and shout out to Nanette Bay or my old advisor was like oh you should actually do computer science and just try it see if you like it and so I was actually sort of coerced into starting this journey that way although very happily so that was where a lot of my background came in with learning the basics and then when I started I actually thought I was gonna be a corporate librarian and that was totally disrupted again by nds are the national digital stewardship residency where I got like a really deep dive into working with different types of of data and computational processes and that got me really interested in the way that we are teaching new researchers how to conduct their work so as a part of my role I teach all of the programming languages and concepts that my colleagues here teach I would say one of the things that I am also teaching are things like how to ask questions of data for machine learning or AI purposes I have a lot of consultations with folks who are like how do I make sure that when I'm fitting a dick some data for a model that I'm not completely biased it's a hard thing to answer but so alongside of sort of the computational literacy stuff that I think is really important we're also seeing a sort of niche data literacy on the rise as a part of supporting data science as well all right so I have a very long kind of circuitous journey so I'll try to keep it concise I have a undergraduate Bachelor of Arts in bioinformatics and you know so I had some kind of formal computing training but also kind of situated in kind of you know science context scientific computing you know worked in industry for a while information security and actually kind of wasn't really out of path towards libraries at all and then my office mate was like this information we were talking about the challenge of information security and it's like this is really actually a library science problem and I kind of pivoted and ended up going to Michigan at the School of Information which kind of introduced me to the information schools world where I am today and getting PhD in information and doing a lot of work around you know a lot of my dissertation work with some kind of Science and Technology studies and actually not computational at all I didn't even tell people I knew how to code initially because one of the things that happens is if you know how to code as a grad student you very quickly get grabbed by a thesis advisor because they need they desperately need people who can code because they don't know how to do that work and I saw so that I saw that happen over and over again and I've seen that happen one of the things I started doing it at Michigan is trying to address this issue so I I started working with some faculty on developing kind of a computing education workshop you know kind of similar to the carbon trees although developed a little bit independently evolved with some of the carpet trees movement and then since moving and then I moved to the University of Pittsburgh initially I was actually jointly appointed between the library and the school at the time it was the School of Information science I helped launch a digital scholarship unit and we actually created a workshop series that was a joint workshop series between the School of Information science or what was school of information science and the libraries on kind of running workshops on technical topics like web scraping and data visualization formed the School of Computing and information I'm full time so I'm teaching faculty there and I teach a bunch of different computing you know computing is you know I teach in a bunch of different programs so I teach in the undergraduate computer science program I I teach in the Masters of information science so it's like kind of big ideas in computing and information which is kind of a conceptual course for the undergrads but also has a skills component to it which is like you know teaching undergraduates how to do Python and command line and get and this is computer science undergraduates who actually never learned that they're just kind of expected to know it by the faculty so there's never they're happy you know they're like well why should we teach them in the command line they should already know how to do that which is a very non inclusive approach to some of these kind of very basic skills which I think that attitude and that need for the kind of the big addressing the basic skills in a semi-formal setting and his requirements as a necessary step so I've also developed and work on this research computing education initiative running an eight part workshop series called data basics and that's actually for graduate students in the disciplines who don't have an opportunity you know because the the basics so we teach Python and pandas which is a data analysis tool we teach Jupiter notebooks and the command line and get so kind of a lot of the similar similar tapas to suffer carpentry in this kind of eight part series that's open and it's free and open to anyone in the university wants to take it you know graduate students faculty and staff and the goal here is to kind of give it's mainly graduate students doctoral students and master students in the disciplines and Sciences and Social Sciences and and some of the humanities to to kind of learn those basic things that they wouldn't necessarily have an opportunity to learn because it's not taught in their formal coursework so I teach that and then the other final piece on computing education that we are working on as we've appeared we've recently redesigned our our masters of Library and Information science and one of the core components of this redesign that you know that we're trying you know we're still working on it is I'm putting an embedding computing education for the library science students and you know we're still that this is going to be a multi-year journey but one of the things that I want to see the library science program is kind of a an alternative path to learning computing for people who the path the traditional path in computer science or information science that door gets closed they feel that they're not able to participate issue so we're trying to kind of and one of the key components for the library science program I haven't really figured out you know we haven't figured out how to do this but the you know there's a huge demand for computing education and computing needs broadly in in higher education in k-12 and in generally and so part of what I would I what we're trying to do is not only teach the library science students computing topics but also equip them and teach them how to so kind of a train the trainer's thing because um you know the Pew had a study that people are looking to their librarians to help them with computing education topics especially in public libraries so Kenny if we can kind of equip the students with these skills then they can kind of go for them and help address these attorneys kind of jump right into the to ensure that we actually addressed the topic of the panel I would like to just toss out the question to the panel from your experience what what are the pros and or cons of teaching these types of topics in a library just quick thoughts on that and I don't know I'll just someone want to start we'll start with Vicki but just jump in yeah so teaching data science topics in the libraries the pros and the cons so the pros I think that Ajani was was mentioning is that people feel like the library is a space where they can come and fail if they need to so a lot of a lot of folks who are coming saying I don't really know the basics of AI or machine learning topics or predictive learning whatever natural language processing text mining I don't want to go to this workshop in the Center for data science because they're going to assume that I know every like all the toolkits walking in and I really don't so the library becomes a space where they can try and fail at these new topics which is a key part of the learning process so there I think there's sort of a safety net and knowing that like I'm here to provide you this service and I'm not judging your computational ability and in fact I'm here to scaffold you so that you can reach that one of the cons is like the opposite where people are like why does the library nowhere care about this which is what prompted the panel so like how with walking into the library and seeing me like they don't equate that with data science expertise for lots of reasons being in a library being a woman so that sort of cultural is yet to be addressed I think across the board for computing education but especially in data science where the demographics are so homogeneous and badly skewed I would like to add a few more things when we run our data science or machine learning our natural language processing workshops we have professors graduate students and undergraduate students all taking the rushes at the same time all of them have similar questions again how would fakey has mentioned it's a safe place everyone is treated equally and they feel that I'm not an expert I'm here to learn something and it's okay to ask any kind of kind of questions we including myself when I go to an workshop I don't feel like I'm a faculty I feel like I'm going there as a student to learn something and it's a great opportunity because the libraries are really providing this neutral ground where we can all go as students as as someone who is interested in learning a topic - I concur that I remember I saw a talk by a Fernando Perez who's kind of the guy who started Jupiter notebooks and he had a big slide why they chose the library at Berkeley to put the data Science Center data science initiative in he says the library is like Switzerland so it has like neutrality like Gianni was saying that is more welcoming it also I think for me there's a virtuous cycle of so data services have been part of libraries for a long time now it's the neol ism is data science right but it's been doing a lot of this service and consulting for a long time in libraries and there's a virtuous cycle that happens when you consult with people over time you see all these use cases across the disciplines oh people are doing text data mining across many different departments so those use cases kind of can formulate and become a a curriculum right so you know what to teach you know people are struggling getting beyond the their laptop if they open a dataset with a million rows and it doesn't open so what are the kind of heuristics with that when do they need to move to kind of cluster computing when do they need to do some refactoring of their code so I think that's a rich ground bed for for addressing common problems in academia and then you can develop lessons and teach and include you know a diverse set of people that you know are cross-disciplinary so I think that's a real strength of libraries I think there's a credibility issue there might be the con so like who how to you know I don't have a CS degree so why anybody listen to me when I'm telling them you know how to code or whatever but I think it through kind of a reflective practice when you work with people they you develop a good word of mouth and they'll come back to you so I think libraries are a great place for the for teaching this stuff one of the things that you know so I'm mostly teaching you know I teach and I'm a faculty member so my like incentive structure and my organizational life is kind of governed around terms and teaching classes and and and the needs however don't necessarily conform to that that structure and so one of the things I'm trying to do is when it's collaborate and work with the library but also and and also work with our high performance computing center and try to like kind of create this triangulation of people with you know HPC as a computing infrastructure at the School of Computing and information we have some expertise and the library has kind of physical infrastructure and also temporal a different temporal rhythm that I think because one of the things is after the classes and there's always that okay I need you know so I loved your workshop how do i do Python package management and it's like you know and how do I use this or how do I install this specific package for this because I'm a biologist or I'm a you know elec Euler and biophysics graduate student which I just had a whole bunch of in my workshop and I don't have I don't have the ability to kind of do that support work just there's not enough hours in the day and so but that's where I think the library can help because I think the key component of this is to build a learning community with them versity and I think that's a universal you know the library cannot is that's what they're structurally set up to do and so they can't no we can kind of the hard part though the con you know that's the the benefit and the the power and the potential the hard part though is just trying to figure out the organizational configuration like you know how who's gonna pay for whose time how are they and library to their credit spends a ton of time thinking about the the organizational sustainability of a service to the ran of some of the grad students and faculty we're trying to work on this and they just want to do it the librarians are like well it'll slow down let's think about it so there's a balance there but I think when it you know when when it does come when everything can come together I think it can be extremely powerful so to pick up on that idea of Learning Communities one of the I think one of the limitations of this mode of instruction that we were kind of talking about for the most part though being the workshop format is inherently problematic with these technical topics that so because you don't become a Python programmer in a two hour workshop so I would like to ask like a very practical follow-up question and that would be what have you done to address some of the limitations of the work shop format for example dealing with prerequisites scaffolding finding times just scheduling is very hard in the in a university setting because everybody has their regular course schedule students might want to take something at night but grad students and faculty might have you know outside lives that require them to go home so can you talk a little bit did I say that wrong anyway so do you want to go home now so anyway what have you done to address some of these limitations I have taught the workshops in the in the evening actually the grad students really wanted in the evenings or some of them do and then some of them can so I teach sometimes I do the workshop series in the in the during the day and sometimes in the evenings kind of depends on if I have other evening classes in terms of like scaffolding I you know the the workshop is very much a basics and I upfront I tell people like you know I mean we've extended it so it's like eight three hour sessions so that's a little bit of a longer engagement so the you know I say I kind of do set expectations up front one is that you know I don't have any expectation that you're you have experience with this I have everything set up like they don't they just need to show up with a laptop that has a web browser and then everything is running better hub in the cloud all the materials are on git and automatically get loaded you know so that's kind of a technical answer to some of this which is you know they don't have there's not this like getting everything installed and setup stuff so I kind of scaffold them that way and but I do set expectations and you're not gonna leave this workshop like an expert Python programmer one of the benefits I have is the students are super motivated because they're opting in to take this this is a required class per se it's an open free workshop so they are personally motivated which I you know is not always the case in a teaching context but I do have that but again I think the next step is how to how do I give them the ability to continue and I haven't really figured that out I've had conversations because one of the things is like faculty will be like we want all of our doctoral students to take your workshop and it's like okay that's great do it and then what changes are you making in your curriculum to then reinforce what they learn and they're like well we don't we can't do that we our curriculum is that we can't change it so like it's like well then you know it's not gonna work like I can't do this that there there has to be substitute in the Disciplinary curriculum and classes have to kind of you know okay they'll have basic Python but you need to teach them the methodologies because I'm not teaching them the methods and you need to use them with the computing that they know you can kind of assume that they have yeah well I wrote down Jupiter have an expectation management so pull that thread a little the thing I would add to that is in dealing with the workshop format something that's really important to me is to build out open educational resources that they can always come back to after the fact so all of my sort of data science focus classes our applications based so I'm not in I don't teach like this is what a variable is in Python I say like this is what a variable is and you're gonna put your part of your data set into it and so everything that I teach is is has the pedagogical underpinning of like you're gonna you could modify this code lightly with a different data set and be able to work with it and that relies really heavily on me creating a larger scale open educational resource to point them to after the fact to walk them through some of the other projects I would also say distributing the the actual teaching like I collaborate with some assistant faculty at the Center for data science who come in and teach some of these intro workshops as well and we co teach a lot of them and I think that also signals to the students something that that there's a lot of support for in the university so they could come to me they could come to this faculty member and I think that's really powerful and empowering to them when they're in the middle of like an intro ml workshop and they don't understand probability and etc I have noticed stunning the same workshop twice is often at different times of the week it's beneficial to a lot of students because scheduling is a problem when I have the time the graduate student might not have the time or the undergraduate might not have the time at this so running it twice once you may be during the work hours one maybe after five o'clock is a good idea or running it on Fridays between 2:00 and 5:00 has worked well for with our undergrads for me as far as prerequisites are concerned I have it uploaded on github so they have access to previous lessons I always like to teach them in in in in a series of workshop that means you don't walk out of the workshop after two hours feeling like you are an expert so you have to keep coming back that is an expectation I said in the beginning of the workshops and I have had great success with students returning for the entire series yes there's a number of different things you can do to help with like pre wax or text setup you can have install fests I've done that before like in libraries I like to get our systems people involved you know if they can become helpers at your workshop get people set up and configured I taught a an African American Studies class it's on the mass incarceration phenomena this last quarter and because it's for undergrads I didn't want to have all the set up stuff and I taught it completely in our studio cloud which is a you know cloud base our tool and that worked pretty well because I could you know distribute the notebooks to them and they could work through it with me I always teach live coding style and I have a bunch of exercises within the class so people have points where they have to work through a challenge or you know stretch themselves or apply what they've learned I think that's very effective the last thing I've done it's like is partner with specific departments you know so we have a good relationship with the Masters of Social Science and the Masters our urban planning and we we teach these workshops we get you know because you want to encourage kind of peer learning and peer teaching so if you get people to come from the same department together and you reserve some seats for them then you can kind of get that happening because they know each other and I feel more welcome they build confidence and then lastly you know you on the feedback loop you want to have them come seek you out for consulting or to get help because they're invariably gonna want to do their research and then they they've learned some basics and our Python but then what is the next step you know oh I want to apply this and I'm having problem with this package in our and then they'll come get help from you so you so you want to see it as a whole cycle teach your workshop you get consulting teach another workshop you do it try to encourage like peerage and that works kind of well one thing super briefly is that I always show how to debug in my classes like I will often intentionally put ours into my code to be like oh no I have no idea what happened let's go to the internet and find a solution and I think that approach also really helps students after the workshop to be like oh I saw someone like who is my instructor run into a problem and solve it and follow the same steps and they can probably figure a lot out after the fact - yeah that's an excellent I mean basically I we are like in the carbon trees do now courage people if you're really good typer which I'm not or a speller which I'm not so I have air all the time but if you are that we encourage people to introduce error because you know getting over error the fear of having errors is the real big thing and having kind of persistence so they can see what that is something you really want to come out of a workshop definitely so let's shift gears a little bit because I suspect some people in the audience say they sound like great things but you know we have we don't have the staff to do that so let's talk about the staffing side for a little so one is I mean we could probably spend a lot of time talking about you know what's missing from the MLS curriculum so I don't really want to go down that path although if anyone wants to bring up any ideas or if you know of new curriculum that's being introduced but since we have a couple people here that are doing things kind of on the margins of libraries or between in the intersection of libraries and computer science maybe you know addresses this - Indrani first talk specifically about what like libraries and librarians can do to attract more computer and data scientists like you to come and work with us I think the initiative needs to come from above like the administrators learning and encourage libraries to units are spaces providing I was at another talk yesterday and they just created this the space which attracted lots of students which would not have happened if that space did not exist so URI has been proactive with it and our provost and librarian who is here has been very supportive I am among the three faculty who who are associated with computer science and libraries what would attract us is providing us this environment and this opportunity to work with diverse set of students it really helps us we don't usually have access to this diverse set of students when we are tucked away in the computer science department or in the engineering department library really helps us to find the students and describers projects we have had great success with students from nutrition biology Social Sciences to name a few yeah so it just provides us with this with this incredible amount of wealth where the students are our resources and where we can helpful and useful to the to the community Matt would you like to add anything to that this is something that we are very yeah so actually when I first started at the University of Pittsburgh I was in a joint the appointed position across the library and information science as kind of a an explicit effort that's similar to kind of connect the department the academic department with there's a couple of us you know and that's kind of we worked on developing the digital scholarship services library we don't currently have anyone in that position but it's know I'm really interested in these kind of joint appointments and kind of you know kind of creating that creating that space I mean this is something that we are trying to do I mean this is that relationship is also working itself out in the School of Computing and information because we're you know computer science information science and library science altogether in one academic unit and we're all very different and so we're all kind of sorting out you know and building up those relationships and then this is a new school that's just years we are also hiring teaching stream faculty tenure stream faculty we are looking for graduate students so if you know ya anyway come see me we are we because like you know the we're doing this we're I'm all this stuff I'm kind of doing on my own on a you know very lean I get one course released kind of work on all these workshops and stuff I get somebody you know and a lot of it is just personal connections I have somebody from the high-performance computing unit who is a friend of mine who like helped me bend up the Jupiter instance and then I you know have connections and people in the library who are and it's like a lot of it is like personal favors and just personal relationships and you know and I think now it's now where this place of like how do we institutionalize this and that's kind of where we're at right now and taking that you know I'm really good at like finding the people who are on the ground who are gonna do the work but now it's we got to socialize up to the administrators I forgot to mention another thing we also have John I come here with us who is a she she is a professor in computer science department and also works with us at the library yes it's another approach you could um at least has been effective for me is that you know UCLA is a big big library so we were like you know a lot of programmers one of which has a master's in machine learning and computer science who works in our our software development team and so he's become a carpentry instructor so he teaches with us and he also consults and I have in my unit have two programmers who are now kind of being refashioned into data science specialist and part of that as we provide you know training and support for that so look within if you have a big organization look within to kind of fill some of these roles and if you have a digital library like we do that are doing kind of machine learning on their collections that's a perfect way you can kind of externalize that as a service and get those folks to help consult for your unit or a building unit right so this can be research facing and not just internally facing so that's what that's what we're trying to do okay I know we've been talking about the Carpenters a lot and I want to make sure we talk a little bit more about that in case people aren't familiar with it I I can't remember when I first learned about the Carpenters but I think it's safe to say is probably one of the early librarians to go through instructor training six or seven years ago and at the time I this was at UC Davis and at the time there was one other librarian involved and she was unique in that she was a former research scientist with a PhD Amy Hodge from Stanford and I thought you know this is great this is like this would be ideal for librarians but the cynical part of me thought it ain't gonna happen you know librarians are busy they were skeptical about some of this stuff but then they proved me wrong and now it's really taken off so many like I think I was just at a meeting where they were telling me they had like 20 certified carpenters instructors or something at their library so it's it's really kind of exploded so tim has been really involved with the carpentry so maybe just a few words about the carpenters movement and their their pedagogy and you know a few thoughts on the importance that plays for especially for those who aren't familiar with it and maybe what what sorts of things librarians have been doing in that program so as you mentioned I think librarians been involved in the carpentry for a good good while but um and various roles but so the carbon trees is a global it's a volunteer network of instructors and we teach like basic and computing and data skills to typically researchers but now information professionals librarians research staff on how to do their research better how to automate you know tasks how to be more reproducible in their work so all these are kind of wrapped up into the carpentry and there's three carpentry is a software carpentry which teaches best practice in software development development techniques because a lot of researchers get into you know doing their research and they have no background in CS they don't have to write scripts and so it's you know teaching some of those best practices data carpentry is geared it more domain-based so there's data carbon for genomics and social science and geospatial and it's more it's geared to the methodologies for those specific domains and dealing with too much data that researchers don't how to handle it right how to manage it hadn't analyzed how to do data visualization and the library carbon tree which I've been involved with on the government governance committee and now we're the latest carpentry so there's three carpentry x' and then that's more geared at teaching librarians how to code and deal with data how to kind of automate their own work processes and then be better be able to better engage and communicate with technical staff in their libraries and also be able to engage better with cutting-edge research right so those are kind of the three carbon trees and if you want to become an instructor you go through a training program that is really not about technology it's about how people learn and how to teach and we use kind of education psychology best practices on you know on those kind of facets and you go through a two-day workshop and then you become certified as an instructor I think that's and then libraries yes so the librarian well the library carbon tree has been like three or four years old and weird you know I think there's a lot of also members of because carbon trees is a membership organization a lot of libraries that are members of our members of the carbon trees so it's kind of taken off and like within the UC system I think we have like probably 20 librarians who are certified and we chat teach workshops together so it's kind of an active environment one of the cool things about the library's collaboration with the CTS Center for data science at NYU is that we actually split our carpentry so it's supported by both organizations which has been great for me because I don't have to do all the administrative work I can share that too but also just those deep understanding that like it's a great place for learning to happen in both of these multidisciplinary spaces which has been very cool to see I'm sorry I should I forgot something but one of the big components of the carbon trees is we really want to have and it it's called inclusive pedagogy really have a warm welcoming environment where people can come in regardless of their background and build confidence and have a positive mind mindset so they can learn and grow right so you know we have a really serious we're serious about our code of conduct and we do have a real like it's been pretty successful in and in this mission so now we have we're translating lessons into multiple languages we have an African task force has been really incredibly active and wonderful like the work that they've done in the continent of Africa we've have workshops in all seven continents so we really have a global reach and it's it's really premise stone being inclusive and to try to improve the the representativeness of people in computing and in data science as well so yeah anyway so before I open it up for audience questions I wanted to just go through the panel once and give you an opportunity to mention maybe just pick one sort of new and upcoming program service training offering that's code related that you are that you have in the works for the near future so if that's relevant for you just just to give you a chance to promote something you know what it is your what it is you're up to Matt you want to start I mean your jobs a little different I mean trying to what actually I'd say it's not a it's an infrastructural thing I'm working on so it's not an educational but it's one of the things I'm trying to do deploy you know get a university wide Jupiter hub deployment you know love Jupiter and it's the one of the things that brings people like I heard about this Jupiter thing and I need to learn it and then they learn it changed my life wow that's nice feeling and you know so trying to you know I've been working on kind of getting in a large-scale deployment so that we can do teaching you know because as a platform for teaching it's just it's really fantastic the computer scientists don't understand it or like it but everybody else the scientists and you know the social scientists just a no-brainer you know that's you know they're the ones trying you know building and and so part I would say one of the things that I've been the thing that I've been looking at and kind of using as inspiration is all of the work coming out of UC Berkeley both on kind of infrastructural Jupiter hub deployment stuff that they've done but also they are developing curriculum materials you know in and also talking about how to teach folks all of that stuff so everything that's coming out of Berkeley it's not something I'm doing but it's it's something I draw on so yeah um I'm also I want to address like one major challenge of supporting data science if I may which is something I want to have a conversation about the hardest part for me in supporting data science is collecting like actually providing data a lot of the data sets that students email me how like a Google site with a million images of a face and the person who runs it needs a signature from a department head but we might want to collect it and give people access to it in the library and it's one researcher maintaining that and they're not equipped to deal with like library's collection stuff or even like be willing to have a librarian broker that agreement so for me the thing I really want to work on moving forward is almost less on the pedagogy side and more on sort of the maintenance and infrastructure for collection to support data science so that's like my major challenge that I'm hoping to address so we add the URI AI lab are interested in K through 12 programs especially in machine learning and artificial intelligence we have just hosted our first AI summer camp for kids ranging in age from 7 to 17 it was a huge success and one of the one of the summer camps was absolutely free and we we identified there was a need for AI education among this this group of students who belong to the underserved communities we definitely identified a need there and we are working on a couple of projects one of them is an after-school program where the students would come to the URI library and have this two-hour session instructed by one of us on artificial intelligence and machine learning apart from that we also reach out to just you to schools we do talks and just raise awareness about artificial intelligence and try to break some of the myths about artificial intelligence and machine learning yeah I was trying to think the one of the this class that I mentioned on mass incarceration they're going to be doing a second a quarter which will they'll have their projects so we're gonna do some more teaching and I really enjoy teaching our and mapping which is I'm gonna formulate that into regular workshop because I like getting away from proprietary tools like ESRI he's you know grip bone geospatial and the other thing I'm talking with some colleagues is about like data ethics and you know at the ethical concerns around machine learning and these kind of black black box systems of of algorithms and you know we're gonna we're talking about having like a workshop series around that okay so are there questions from the audience I need to bring the mic out because we're being recorded so great thank you again there was an awesome presentation quick question on how you entice students I know you said they sort of come to you but do you and you're talking about outreaches are there ways that you reach the students in nan saying the non-computer science non engineering students some like hackathons those kinds of things and how do you physically do it do you actually go to the college's go to the classes sit in the breezeway and wait for people to come to you that way so standing in the breezeway is not a bad choice I actually mainly seen on engineering and non computer science students in my like intro machine learning and intro to get in things classes a lot of times it's the students outside of those disciplines who feel like they're behind and want to catch up even though it's not the case in reality I'm sure the computer science students would benefit quite a bit from coming so I actually think that when I'm looking at sort of my metrics of who's attending it's mostly master students by far and mostly in non engineering Peter science disciplines or people doing computational research but not in comps I or like computer engineering I have a few things to add to that we do actively contact professors across campus and try to advocate data science and machine learning to be integrated into their course curriculum or at least talk to their students about this this workshop that are available so that they can attend this workshops and we advertise them heavily through our university newsletter on every digital media that's present across the campus as far as our outreach programs are concerned we work with Office of Diversity and we do by now we have several contacts with schools directly and they they have approached us to coordinate with them and then we also attend events all across Rhode Island all right I am just the Dean of graduate students I'll just the deans will you know whenever I run off for the workshop it's a you know there's a just a form to sign up so I'll just email the various deans and say hey distribute this to the grad students and then it it just fills up and actually last term I sent it to a waiting list and it filled up and I like after a day and I actually have no idea how they found it I think that there's you know the demand for the computing like the Python computing stuff is so great that like I just put it out there and it fills up which you know I actually don't know some of the under like I think it's just like you know every every year or every term it'll be a different like it'll be engineering heavy or business heavy and I think it just it gets circulated amongst the graduate students but you know the the place I the the way that I've started is by emailing like the Dean of grad students or like a you know the Dean of research at a different school and they'll distribute it usually can you distribute this to the grad students and and that's how that's how I've been reaching graduate students at least who have been the primary so let's take one more question because I think we're just about thank you for an excellent excellent Jayne Greenberg I'm a nice cool professor too and we have you know we've incorporated data science and I lead a program called Leeds library education and the area so we're really into this little self-promotion spread the joy right but my question to you and anybody in this room is dealing not everyone here is a librarian but we are seeing these services needed in libraries and how do you get this into things like the ala these conversations need to happen we just got through our accreditation and it's a process and we you know for people who have an accredited ala degree it's still very important I know some schools don't do it anymore there's a long debate there but how do we this is really important for future librarians and so I would be interested in any comments thank you so much so we're doing that we're going through accreditation right now and so we'll see how ala responds to some of the changes that we've made to our curriculum but I think this you know for ala the standards you know there's the set of standards and you can you you you can describe how you meet those standards and what evidence you you marshal to do that so I think part of it is you know there's interpretation that happens in what those standards mean and I think you know we'll see how they respond to the changes that we've made but I think it you know you just have to I mean I think I personally think there is some flexibility in that accrediting process I don't think it's an ala s best interest in not a credit previously accredited institution I mean like so I think maybe there needs to be a little bit more this is being recorded but a little bit more risk taking on the part of the faculty who are now doing that accreditation process but it is I mean that the problem with that is the process is so incredibly it's not you know it's very involved too there are some aspects of it to that to the credit but there's some of it that it seems like it's just a lot of paperwork and so like maybe you know I mean I this is a been a reoccurring conversation in the high schools about how to streamline that process and make it more flexible but there's a lot of programs that are accredited by ala that have that are you know have this data science I mean Michigan is a good example they are the whole program is accredited by ala and you know you can go through that program and take only data science classes so you know I think there is the space there but it is a it's a hard process I that's a little scary but there's only they can go through to get a library degree with only data that is it's a Lea credit reference it's a li accredited they don't typically go to libraries they go to that's a structural configuration have to take Pitt though you have to take a break good morning my name is Teresa bird I'm Dean of the university library at the University of San Diego I am on the board their Accreditation Board for a la for library schools so I certainly enjoy hearing your comments this morning not sure you can we only accredit the MLS programs there is no MLS program I Michigan well MSI then there has to be a track or something because I really wouldn't credit a program that is not the Jews over the tracks yeah so but your comment from the library school faculty member I think whatever you would like I can you can share your information with me you can give it to Karen O'Brien we are looking at the process I have to tell you I read all of those documents and there's a lot of stuff to read so I am certainly in favor of streamlining the process and we are looking at that right now so thank you I just wanted to share that you had an accreditation person listening to your comments all right everyone thanks for coming to play around and feel free to chat with us if you like [Applause] you
