 Hello - my name is Markus Buehler i'm the McAfee  professor of engineering at MIT, and today i'll   be talking about ai and machine learning and  materials design and manufacturing materials   have multiple scales if you think about materials  like sand you can see that at the macro scale they   look like a pail of sand which we all see all the  time if we look closer we can see the individual   sand grains and if we look even closer we can see  each grain actually looks like a little rock and   even closer with a very high fidelity microscope  we can actually see the internal structure of   the sand and ultimately see the molecular  arrangement of atoms in the silica structure   what we see is that materials have multiple  scales and we can utilize these multiple scales   as a new engineering design paradigm called  meteoromics where we can design materials   at multiple scales at all scales from the nano to  the macro and the other way around we see these   multi-scale design paradigms actually in nature  if we think about a spider web we can think about   muscle adhesion muscle threats we can see cells  in the human body on animals or in plants or we   can look at bone which is a very tough material  that's very hard to break all these materials have   alcohol structures and the reason why they perform  so well like bowen being a very tough material   is because they have internal defect they have  internal structures which make these materials   very resilient and very strong and very tough it's  all about hierarchical structures and patterns and   so the idea was when we thought about creating a  new design paradigm creating paradigms to actually   optimize these materials is to use convolutional  neural networks to perhaps characterize   relationships between structure and function as  we know cnns are very good in picking out features   in an image for classification for instance we  can use the same idea in relating these features   at different scales as you can see in the slide  to material properties which is basically a very   similar idea we can also use machine learning very  effectively to create models of materials that   are more effective and more efficient and more  accurate think about a spider web as shown on the   left hand side we can encode critical information  using variational autoencoders for instance in   a reduced set of variables and then use the  other way around by decoding the information   in a design paradigm we can design new kinds of  spider webs new kinds of bone microstructures   these are very powerful ideas and you can  think about a family of different machine   learning methods that are now emerging in  materials design and manufacturing design   which really range from traditional neural  networks artificial neural networks to deep   convolutional neural networks to having gans  which are generative adversarial models that   have multiple neural networks playing games with  each other to having multiple gans playing games   games with each other so sort of the sky's the  limit here and sort of imagining what kind of   neural network formulations we can use in modeling  materials and modeling manufacturing processes   so cnns are very powerful in characterizing  material properties especially fracture properties   i'm going to walk you through a case study we've  done so we know that hierarchical structures   like seen in bone and naked and seashells which  are really one of the toughest materials known   on this planet these materials derive their  addition their exceptional functionality   from these hierarchical structures we can model  that using physics simulations now these physics   simulations can tell us that the more hierarchy we  add the more structure we add the more complexity   we add we get better material performance the  challenge is to identifying what exactly are   the optimal microstructures so the way nature  solves this problem is by using a combination   of dispersed properties like a very stiff material  or a very soft material and it creates patterns of   stiff and soft materials one bone for instance we  have a protein called collagen which is very soft   and we have a very brittle very stiff  material which is the hydroxyapatite and   this contrasting property by distributing these  materials and patterns over space and time   we can create advanced material properties like  very high toughness so the problem is how do we   find these optimal distributions now nature does  it through evolutions but it takes millions and   billions of years we don't have as much time so  the problem that we have posed now is to think   about this as a game and couple years ago there  was some amazing work published on uh human-made   ai algorithms that are better than human players  of games like go with chess and these games are   very similar to the kind of design problem we  have in materials design we have a distribution   of particles that have to be optimally arranged  to create an optimal function a desired function   so these methods can replace what we currently  use on the left hand side you can see that which   are finite element methods phenomena methods  are great methods but they're very expensive   they basically solve newton's laws very accurately  but they take extended period of time to actually   conduct so it's not very efficient to do design  problems because optimization requires us to solve   these phenomena problems hundreds thousands maybe  millions of times so we have used this idea to   create a machine learning model that really works  with the patterns we see in materials and relating   these patterns to functions the way this works  essentially we run fine element simulation and   or an experimental paradigm where we test for  various microstructures what the performance   looks like we then train a cnn a convolutional  network to relate these patterns to function   and once the model has learned this we can  then use it as an optimization paradigm and   we can validate the model of course for a small  enough system we can actually conduct simulations   in what we call brute force in other words we  can solve the full problem for our possible   design solutions explicitly using a file element  model and we can relate that also to the machine   learning mode and we've shown that this works  really well in other words the machine learning   model has really truly captured the physics of the  relationships between microstructure and function   and this paradigm is very exciting because  now we can go to much bigger systems like here   we've looked at hierarchical designs in  other words we have many many different   stiff and soft particles which in turn make  new kinds of building blocks like shown here   so this is exactly the paradigm we see in bone and  spider silk you can kind of see a zoomed in view   on these microstructures so instead of having just  stiff and soft now we make new kinds of building   blocks out of stiff and soft kind of imagining  hierarchy of lego building blocks which then make   new building blocks which then make new building  blocks and this is a problem obviously that using   phenomena simulation is basically intractable  design to solve but with machine learning we can   actually solve this problem very effectively and  moreover we can use combine this very very well   with advanced manufacturing techniques like  additive manufacturing or 3d printing we can   actually then make in the laboratory within just  a couple hours design paradigms we have created   design solutions we've created and then test them  in the lab we've done this close loop simulation   optimization and experimental testing paradigm  and confirmed in the laboratory that in fact the   predictions the optimizations we've done using the  machine learning model can actually be validated   and confirmed in the lab using 3d printing another  way to do the optimization is to use genetic   algorithms of course genetic algorithms are  sort of a model for nature's paradigm of solving   iterations of design solutions and again as i said  earlier in nature this takes hundreds of millions   of years a lot of times very long time engineers  we don't have as much time and so genetic   algorithms provide a really powerful way of doing  that very quickly and again we can use this method   very effectively to come up with design solutions  for say very fracture resistant materials   or materials certain optical properties or  mechanical properties or electronic properties and   this allows us then to come up with solutions that  are very difficult to imagine for the human brain   or other computational methods and a very very  quick way of coming up solutions for practice   and we can again make this in in 3d printing  and test these kind of design solutions as well   so not only can we look at static properties like  relating a microstructure to a to a property like   fracture toughness or strength or elasticity we  can also relate the dynamics the evolution of   cracks and of course many times in engineering  we're interested in how things break what is   the dynamical evolution of fractures how things  actually snap apart which that is important for   designing materials that are resisting fracture  like needed an airplane or construction materials   for roads or buildings and other things like this  so what we do here is we use a combination of high   fidelity experimental work this is some work i've  done with jamie warner where we can actually watch   adam the atom materials break in a simulation we  can use quantum mechanical simulations to very   accurately capture the dynamical evolution of  cracks and we can combine these things in this   multi-scale description of fracture and really go  from the nano to the macro scale and this gives us   not only a single frame a picture but actually a  movie of the fracture evolution which we can then   get give to a machine learning algorithm  which then records the history of fracture   and learns the relationship between a previous  frame a previous microstructure set and the   next prediction of the microstructure which  continuously changes so this is very exciting   and of course cannot only be applied to  fracture but potentially could be applied   to many other engineering and science problems  we have the evolution of dynamical fields it   works really well we can build training sets using  molecular dynamic simulations from the ground up   we can then validate these using the machine  learning model and we've actually shown that   the model can not only predict what it has  learned very well but can also predict scenarios   that has never been exposed to like gradients  of misorientations of crystalline structures   changes in the microstructure and even very  unusual grain boundaries like we call twin   grain boundary which are very prominent design  tool engineering so this is a grain boundary type   an internal defect in a material that the machine  learning model has actually never seen in the   training set but yet it has learned has captured  the information so it can actually predict   like in a molecular dynamic simulation like in  a physics simulation how a crack would interact   with this type of green boundary so now we're  going to shift gears and not only describe static   materials or angina terms but actually go back to  the very beginning of the talk when i talked about   the biological systems which are materials like  spider silk muscles or cells which really speak   the language of life and use proteins and dna  to build themselves so we have discovered that   to describe the language of life there's a very  very important relationship really between the   the way sound is generated and the way  materials are generated so you think about   materials as we talked about they have these  multiple structural levels from the nano scale   to the macro scale um you know starting from  the dna sequence and the protein microstructure   all the way to the um to the structure of  fibers and the spider web ultimately or the bone   structure and in sound or in music we follow a  very similar paradigm begin with simple sine waves   which are then modulated in time and space these  sine waves combined give rise to different timers   of instruments which then can play different  melodies different tones and these can be overlaid   and create an orchestral sound just like the  one you've heard in the background and this idea   of generating sound relates very very closely  very intimately to the way materials are made   let's think about how sound is generated  conventionally well conventionally the way sound   is generated really is using strings like here in  the harp on a piano we have a hammer hitting the   piano um or we can have drums which are membranes  and these membranes vibrating so no matter what we   do we have some macroscopic objects that vibrate  and they create excitations in the air and then   it creates beautiful tones like shown in the in a  guitar here and the reason why these tones sound   beautiful is because these strings are usually  tuned according to some sort of harmonic tuning   which allows tones to be played against each  other and sound nice to the human ear so this   kind of process is actually a very powerful way  of getting information directly into our brain you   think about it like this sound waves are generated  by these vibrating strings create pressure waves   in the air which then connect to our ear and then  the ear inside has a membrane that then connects   to nerve cells which then ultimately connect  directly to our brain so this is a very direct   way of getting data into our brain and you can see  where i'm heading now because we can use natural   systems like the spider web as a way of exploring  how their vibrations might sound like or look like   and use it as a new type of microscope a new type  of design paradigm to actually come up with new   engineering designs so you think about insects and  insects actually are brilliant musicians brilliant   sound inspectors because they use vibrations in  the air in the environment as a way to communicate   and interact with the environment you think about  a wasp like shown here they have antenna in the   front of their head these are used as a way of  detecting very very fine details of vibrations   you can think about stink bugs shown here  in this picture they have antenna as well   and these have very fine hair structures which  are vibration sensors similar thing happens for   spiders and so you can see that these universality  vibrations and waves are very very fundamental to   understanding the world around us in fact we'll  take a step back you can see that molecules have   what's called the wave particle duality we  know that from quantum mechanics we have sound   of course which we've already talked about is a  hierarchical assembly of sine waves and of course   we have the insect world and even the human world  which really relies very strongly on vibrations   humans um of course have ears but insects have  these multi-scale sensors and antenna that really   provide them with the ability to very accurately  sense vibrations so vibrations and waves can be   described mathematically in the simplest way in  the most most fundamental way using sine waves and   that's the way we're using it as you can imagine  now building models of materials instead of taking   a look at a picture we actually transform  these structural informations into a sound   wave collection that changes over time describing  the evolution of the material the structure of the   material and we can then translate material  into sound and then manipulate the sound to   create new sounds compose new sound compose  new melodies and then creating these melodies   translating them back into the material provides  us with an opportunity to design materials using   a very unconventional way now how do we do  that well if you think about the structure   of benzene for instance you open a chemistry  textbook what you're going to see are pictures   of graphene which are really static pictures  they're basically drawings of the molecule   and that really hasn't fundamentally changed from  1800 so on to today where basically these are   cartoon structures now this is not how molecules  actually look like we know that molecules are   continuously moving and vibrating in fact these  vibrations kind of remind you probably of the   vibrations in a string right so in this violin for  instance you can see about these strings actually   is vibrating very very rapidly which creates the  pressure waves which we can then hear in our ears   and so very similar to the molecular aberrations  we have string vibrations except they happen in   different scales and what we have done developing  the algorithm to actually use these molecular   vibrations compute them very accurately  compute their spectra and transposing them   into the audible range for the human ear so we  can make them audible and this way we have created   sound models of many different kinds of biological  systems from spider webs to proteins and cells to   proteins and viruses and this um can be done  systematically using algorithmic approach   actually to compute not only this kind of sound  spectrum of music for individual proteins but   actually for all known proteins that are  currently known to the human to the human   community um and nia's are all stored in what's  called the protein data bank we've may have used   the poor data bank as a data source to compute  the vibrational spectrum for every known protein   we have done this for the process of folding the  protein so we can understand how the mechanics   of protein actually works and how that can be  expressed in a musical sense and by doing this   we now have a library available of the fundamental  building blocks of life which are ultimately the   amino acids which are encoded by dna and so each  amino acid actually has a unique fingerprint   audible fingerprint that makes it uniquely audible  each fingerprint of dna of proteins can be seen as   a note in a complex musical composition which then  ultimately translates into complex arrangements of   musical structure so what you see on this slide  here is a picture of lysozyme expressed as an   audible spectrum changing over time basically  creating a musical score that reflects that   protein structure in musical space you can hear  that instead of looking at the structure or   looking at data you can now hear the structure  of this protein we can also use this method   to synthesize sounds in an app we've created an  app called the amino acid synthesizer it's a free   app you can get it on google play and this app  allows you to play music and actually compose your   own dna sequence your own proteins by translating  the music you've created back into dna sequences   these kind of relationships between material  and sound and sound and material allow us to   solve this design pattern of materials in a very  different way in fact we can not only do that by   hand by the human brain like in the app we can  actually do this using artificial intelligence   methods as well by basically creating sounds of  proteins for hundreds of thousands of different   proteins and then feeding this as a training  set into an algorithm that then creates new   music based on what it has learned to design new  proteins and this is a very very powerful way to   basically understand the language of life which is  very difficult for the human brain to comprehend   but ai methods of course are very powerful  and they can understand these relationships   between structure function and folding very  well so this is a method that allowed us to   basically compose new music which then allowed  us to make new proteins these new proteins   are quite interesting because these are proteins  that nature has not yet invented but we have made   them using this ai method and we haven't just  come up with the sequence but writing on a piece   of paper we actually have created music through  the algorithm which then we have translated back   into the protein structure and these new  protein structures can be analyzed further   with quantum mechanical methods with uh we call  simulated them using molecular dynamics which is   a very awkward way of describing the equilibrium  structure of a protein we've also looked at the   sequence analyze the sequence and show that this  sequence that we have come up with through music   is a sequence that nature has not yet invented  so it's a really new protein we've made different   families of these proteins and we've also made in  a laboratory so you can see on this picture here   we've made this particular protein in the lab to  actually have a physical manifestation of sound so   this is the first time i think we've gone from  proteins to sound and then back from sound to   protein but using ai as a method to creating  new sound and thereby creating new material   this method has also been applied to predicting  the sound spectrum of the coronavirus pathogen   of covert 19 and we've all seen the pictures  of this virus of course which looks like this   has the spike protein sticking out on the outside  which gives its name the crown the crowns and this   virus we have created a musical reflection musical  representation of these crown proteins by looking   at the structure of the folding and this is  very exciting because it allows us to access the   information stored in the dna in a different way  so if you conventionally look at the dna sequence   you can have pages and pages of dna ladders which  really don't make any sense to the human brain we   can look at them but they don't really make  any sense but by listening to the score you   can actually make sense of this and you have  another way of studying this protein structure   so what we found with this method  with this research is that music is   everywhere and matters sound and also  sound is matter and so we've created   a way using artificial intelligence to  design new materials so recapping this   essentially we have gone in the beginning from  starting to look at patterns by using deep neural   deep convolutional neural networks to  understand how patterns relate to structure   and function and properties we've used  it optimized materials we've also used   a method to use at that look at the history  of patterns and how they evolved to describe   field evolutions of materials like in fracturing  so we can not only see how a one structure relates   to function but also see how structures evolve in  nature and that method obviously has applications   very widely in engineering in engineering  beyond just looking at fracture you can imagine   applying this corrosion applying it to fields  in nature modeling weather and climate and many   other things like this and we've also used  a very unconventional way of translating   the molecular vibrations the structures  of molecules at a very elementary scale   to sound and then using sound as a way of creating  new music either by human composition or by using   ai and machine learning methods to then design  new materials that nature has not yet invented you
