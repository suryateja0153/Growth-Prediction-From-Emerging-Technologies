 [Music] this video will present a hybrid approach that integrates machine learning with a rule-based model from therapists as an explainable AI technique for quantitative assessment of strawberry habilitation exercise rehabilitation as man is critical to the determined intervention for patient with neurological n was skeletal problems such as stroke however it is infrequently performed due to the limited availability of therapists to address this problem researchers have explored the readability of automatically monitoring and assessing patient's exercise using computational models these computational model can be categorised into either rule base or machine learning approach rule-based approach involves domain experts to review sensor data and derive assets of monitoring rules these robust approach is interpretable and flexible to develop a customized model however it is difficult to articulate expert decision-making into a set of rule and time-consuming to review a large amount of sensor measurements alternative approach is to utilize machine learning algorithm with a label sensor data this machine learning approach has a benefit of automatically learning of function with good performance however it is approach with complex algorithm cannot provide explanation on its prediction to support therapists decision-making which can impact the adoption of this technology in practice in this paper we presented hybrid approach that combined the benefit of machine learning Andrew Bates model to assess the quality of rehabilitation exercises to demonstrate our approach we specify a test domain as a stroke which is the second leading cause of the deaths and the third was contributed to disability based on iterative discussion with Ritter apiece we specify three epilim exercise and three performance components for stroke rehabilitation assessment poor implementation we represent an exercise motion with sequential joint position from connect to sensor and extract various kinematic features for instance this feature included during angle the euclidean distance between two joints and speed related features for modeling patience exercise discipline applies supervised learning algorithm with label sensor data for algorithms we explore a decision tree linear regression support vector machine and neural network for the development of the rule based model we interview two therapist to derive 15 independent rules for assessment for example even up bringing a cop to the mud exercise where patient has to raise patients risk to demas there are P simply check whether the position of the wrist exists at the spine to assess the range of motions does such feature based rules are generated during the interview for a hybrid model we apply a weighted average to combine machine learning and rule based model from therapist poor evaluation we the data set of three appalling exercise from 15 poster and eleven healthy subjects to Terrapin asana thieriot is data set to implement our approach and computer appease agreement level we evaluate model with leave on subject out cross validation and compare them in terms of performance to replicate therapy's assessment and their interpretability first this orange dotted line indicate the therapies are very vulnerable or machine learning model we found that performance of model is inversely proportional to the interpreter ability of model machine learning model with complex algorithm the child support vector machine and neural network performs better than machine learning model with interpretable algorithms a child's decision tree and linear regression while sacrificing their interpreter ability of the model we're all neural network of perform other algorithm and therapies every Monday in contrast a rule-based model has the lowest performance as it involves assets of rule that are not tuned for individuals but it has the highest interpretability by directly involving the end-user for hybrid model we combine a machine learning model with a neural network and rule base photo as a rule base model has the lowest performance combining these two model does not lead to performance improvement however hybrid model still performs better than therapist agreement level and machine learning model with other algorithms except neural network even if a hybrid model has a slightly lower performance than neural network it provides a potential benefit of analyzing rules and fine-tuning your model with patient specific rules does it has a higher interpret ability than neural network or support vector machine would represent a hybrid model that combined machine learning and rule based model and demonstrate its potential in terms of high performance which is comparable to neural network and therapist agreement level and partial interpretability in future we will explore the feasibility of tuning this partially interpretable hybrid model for personalized assessment thank you for your attention you
