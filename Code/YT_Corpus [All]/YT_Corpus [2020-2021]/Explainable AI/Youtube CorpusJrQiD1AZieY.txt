 it could be a game changer new covert 19 tests that's cheaper faster than the rest cbs 2's jim williams reports it's artificial intelligence making the diagnosis this is such a unique collaborative experience an engineering professor a physician two men joining forces at northwestern university leading a team of researchers who created a new way to detect covet 19. we used a form of artificial intelligence called deep learning agles catagolis and ramsey waby and their northwestern colleagues created an artificial intelligence program to spot covet 19 in lung x-rays training and testing the computer program using 17 000 x-rays so the same way a little child learns to distinguish between a cat and the dog the parents say oh here's a cat here's another cat and after a few times the child can distinguish cats and dogs it's a very similar process imitating at some level how humans learn this was a system that performed as well as a a team of very experienced thoracic radiologists specialized radiologists and so not every institution has that level of expertise available and here's the other advantage the ai program detects covet in the lungs quickly very quickly the artificial intelligence can tell you within seconds whether or not covet has been detected that's correct ten times faster than even specialized radiologists looking at the same x-ray the researchers insist and there's no comparison between the speed of the ai detection and the time it takes to get a result from the covet test we've come to know the problem is those tests can take hours or days even to come back and so a system that's able to detect kova 19 in a matter of seconds could be very helpful for triage and infection control in a hospital still the man emphasized the ai test is not designed to replace the covet 19 test many of us have taken because not all sides of the coronavirus will show up on an x-ray this is subject to approval from the food and drug administration we're live jim williams cbs 2 news
