 hello everyone the topic of this presentation is very exciting artificial general intelligence how to build it and how far are we from it but before we will start let me introduce myself my name is marcin Volsky I'm the founder of AGI cortex neuroscience enthusiast independent IG a researcher a book author and futurist first I will explain the fundamental difference between narrow AI and general AI then I will show the key attributes of the human and digital brain then I will present key insights from neuroscience that can help us build advanced artificial intelligence next I will show two possible paths for explainable AI I will describe differences between two-dimensional and three-dimensional neural networks what does it mean to have autonomous intelligence and how can we achieve a positive future with the help of AGI before we try to build anything it's crucial to understand the difference between what exists now and what we would like to achieve there is a fundamental difference between a technology that has a single purpose versus the technology that has unlimited possibilities you can imagine narrow AI as a route to just a single goal incapable to help with any other task in contrast general AI is like a reusable map to any destination you can start and finish anywhere depending on your goal this is why narrow AI can be efficiently optimized with gradient based algorithms but generally needs to be grown not trained taught how to learn and build its own cognitive maps of useful knowledge and skills so is it realistic to transform one into another I don't think so and I will present more arguments on the next slides the secret of good research is to look in the right direction sometimes you need to make a step back to be able to move forward one of my favorite quotes is you waste years by not being able to waste hours by almost fair-skinned during my research I found over 20 arguments why current deep learning technology is a dead end for artificial general intelligence please click the link if you are interested in reading article about that despite popular view that neural networks are inspired by the human brain in reality they are very different in the brain we can see a clear structure of care Kika organizational units assigned with specific tasks neocortex is a long-term memory that stores all our semantic the brain is equipped with short-term memory realized by connections from thalamus to various parts of the neocortex subcortical component called hippocampus stores our memories by binding together sensory spatial and temporal information in the frontal lobe we have executive control center that allows us to initiate actions make complex plans and decisions but at the top of the hierarchy lies salience network it is able to switch our focus immediately whenever it detects something important our brain can react in various ways to the same input it is based on our mental state modulated by neural chemicals sometimes we feel happy motivated and sometimes we lack willpower to do anything emotions are created by neural chemicals and the difference between fight and flight it's just a different level of them finally consciousness can be described as an experience rendered from predicted recalled and perceived information it serves the most important function in the brain allowing us to understand constantly changing and unpredictable world what's interesting the neocortex the part that separates us from the animals has quite uniform architecture of repeated organizational units serving different purposes depending on their location can the single fact lead to the invention of the master algorithm let's examine some information about the possible digital brain three-dimensional modular architecture of the digital brain could allow us to build the equivalent of the human neocortex it would be a massive memory bank with the same very effective learning algorithm the digital brain can be equipped with short-term memory for temporal awareness of the environment so it can start to use common sense knowledge like the fact that humans and objects are not teleporting themselves anywhere so even if they cannot be recognized with currently observed features the separate threat of position tracking allows to update their attributes in the memory we have very poor memory and we often cannot remember what we have done two weeks ago digital brains can have potentially unlimited episodic memory allowing them to remember hundreds thousands or even millions of events that happen during their lifetimes we can even build equivalent of large scale networks that can be turned on and off to save energy but also make data processing more effective now imagine a robot or a drone that has a low battery level and should limit energy expenditure by using digital neurochemical you can signal that good enough answer is what we are looking for and it doesn't make sense to spend more time and energy on finding the most optimal one finally the mental simulator as a mechanism of unified experience that leads to imagination extended prediction causal reasoning and intuition this is how machines can make similar progress as human beings and become the second creative force in our world neuroscience is a vast discipline but even if we don't understand how exactly the brain works it's good to know what it does I've already said that human brain has a clear and visible structure we can see it in the anatomy and functional areas of the brain where each region has a different purpose also organizational units of the neocortex called cortical columns has six layers of different sizes depending on the region they are placed in but the most interesting thing here is the fact that synaptic connection is not composed of two parts but besides synapses we also have an astrocyte the type of glial cell that according to some research is even more abundant than neurons you may wonder what Albert Einstein's face does here well after his death some scientists saw his brain and examined in details and the result was that his brain was not very different in terms of neurons but he had much more astrocytes than the average person you must admit that it's at least interesting and it's weird that most of the AI research is currently completely ignored the fact that astrocytes control the synaptic activity of neurons in the human brain especially if understanding of how astrocytes work form networks of connections among themselves can lead to the invention of a new set of incremental machine learning algorithms that allow neural architectures to adapt in the real time many people believe that explainable AI is the factor that will unlock a fifteen trillion dollar opportunity that is related to the development of the advanced artificial intelligence and honestly there are two possible paths for developing explainable AI first is to use energy-hungry architectures that are completely apart and no one knows how data exactly affects them and then to introduce even more computations reveal at least small part of the secret the second one is to introduce some structure just like human brain and then allow low-level adaptation so both the system and the users know where specific data is processed and stored and in that way all processes can be explained all new information can be learned in real time without a separate training session the structure allows energy efficient selective sub Network utilization and effortless knowledge transfer and I cannot stress enough how important is energy efficiency for the AGI architectures they need to do multiple things at the same time and when human brain is very energy efficient the cost of single training session of one of the largest models in existence can cost even hundreds of thousands of dollars and it's not good both for the financial and environmental reasons in my opinion a switch from traditional two-dimensional deep neural networks to new innovative three-dimensional neural architectures is a significant step in the development of AGI there are multiple types of neural networks available but all they do is just an associative memory between input and output the intelligence is much more than reactive response to the incoming information the additional third dimension can be used to alter the neural network operation in real time and the reason to do that can be seen as an extension to the potential related to reinforcement learning it is possible to not only reward the machine but also increase its curiosity to build more accurate world model but also to collect real-time feedback from other cortical regions and these are not only options possible by introducing the third dimension the Machine can react to the input data according to goals set by human beings itself the current context information the state of the environment the presence of other autonomous agents the energy level or power of its own imagination and this is a crucial part have you ever thought what makes you an autonomous being gifted with creativity and free will you are not only driven by your instincts automatic responses but you are able to recall any memory and information at will you can imagine things that do not yet exist because you have the ability to excite the right neurons at will without any input data just by using your mind and high-level structure existing in your brain you can use words visualizations sounds and especially music affect your emotions and a smell can bring back the memory of the past event because the brain is not mathematically optimized random structure you are able to do much more than any animal or machine that ever existed and it may happen sooner than you think that we will be able to give the same opportunity to the AI agents of the new generation and this is the source of fear for many people they are afraid that AGI will enslave humanity it will take their jobs and treat us like we often treat animals but as the creators of digital brains I have clear structure and our food transparent we will be able to have access to each smallest fragment of them we will be able to set their basic and higher goals and we believe that the existence of the advanced AI will allow us to reach previously unreachable places and a very positive future the future with a better understanding of intelligence brain mind our own personalities and therefore Society in the whole world the future with increased mental capacity of mankind as we will be able to evade the wall together living the monotonous and repetitive work two simple machines we believe in a future in which the collective human brain power may and should be used to do amazing things and solve the biggest problems of our world
