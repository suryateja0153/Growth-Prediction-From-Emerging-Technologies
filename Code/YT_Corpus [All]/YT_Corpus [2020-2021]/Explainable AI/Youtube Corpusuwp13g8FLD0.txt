 In the modern world, artificial intelligence is used almost everywhere. Banks use AI to decide whether to grant you a loan. A medical algorithm might use machine learning to recommend further invasive tests. So how does artificial intelligence work? Can I found out why I was denied a loan? For that, we have ‘Explainable artificial intelligence’. It’s possible to pick apart a machine learning model in clever ways and understand why it made a certain decision. For example, you can change the gender that is fed into the bank’s loan approval AI. If the AI now grants you the loan, this gives you a picture of how gender was used inside the model. You can do this even if you have no idea how the model was made. Explainable artificial intelligence is important because it helps us understand how machine learning models work, and allows us to avoid discrimination.
