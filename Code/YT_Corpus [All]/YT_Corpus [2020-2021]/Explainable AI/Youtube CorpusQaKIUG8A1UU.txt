and natural language which were featured on good morning america he has authored 10 u.s patents and more than a hundred journals for conference papers his book ai superpowers china silicon valley and the new world order was on the bestseller list of both the new york times and the wall street journal now please join me in welcoming dr kaifu lee thank you very much uh it's an honor to have a chance uh to talk to such a large group of young people entrepreneurs so uh to fit in with the event i'm giving a talk i've not given before things that i wish i'd known when i was 20. so i will chronicle my career things that i learned and talk a bit about entrepreneurship technology and family values and in the closing i'll be happy to take questions about any of these topics so starting when i was 20 this this was a long time ago i was at columbia a liberal arts major in the humanities this was something i really was glad that i did because i didn't know the difference between a liberal arts college and an engineering school and being an engineer i ended up in the liberal arts school but it was a happy mistake because it was there that i got to read really a lot of the classics and taken a lot of courses that would not have been possible in engineering and absorbing all this human wisdom and literature made it possible for me to speak and to write and i think to the extent that i've been somewhat successful as an author and a speaker a lot of it was due to this decision at the time since i was in liberal arts i thought i would be a pre-law because at the time being a doctor and a lawyer were the two most desirable professions however after about uh two a year and a half to two years i found that pre-law was just not for me i was a political science major and uh i was following a sleeping class and not not really doing very well and really not appreciating all the wonderful things that i knew my classmates enjoyed so at the time i was 20 i made a change and became a computer science major and sorry um let me make sure i'm still presenting okay um all right yeah so so when i was 20 i found that something that i really loved and it was computer science and artificial intelligence i was very lucky that at columbia i had an excellent professor in natural language and in computer vision and in classical artificial intelligence and these really fascinated me because as a young engineer and scientist i wanted to understand how human cognition worked and i thought this pursuit would allow me to do that and i also found that i was quite good at computer science unlike political science where i struggled to get these at computer science i hardly had to study and i was getting a's probably the only small regret moving on from computer science was i transferred out of political science into computer science in my junior year and that was the year barack obama uh transferred to colombia and became a computer sorry political science major so i just barely missed getting to know president obama but computer science was wonderful artificial intelligence was wonderful it became the cornerstone of my career and that leads to the first thing that i want to share with you and it's a common saying in the west do what you love and you'll never have to work another day in your life many people attributed to confucius many other people say there's no way confucius would say something like that for those of you who are chinese this is the closest thing from confucius that i think matches it and i think there's a lot of wisdom in that because if you're doing what you love you will be thinking about it when you're sleeping showering eating and you can't help but be successful and if you do something you love you'll be good at it and if you're good at it you'll love it this kind of virtual cycle continues and beyond artificial intelligence and computer science i found that to be true uh for many many other things that that were dear to me then moving on to from colombia i went to carnegie mellon and studied um speech recognition and artificial intelligence and there's my father trying the system that i built and i was there at a very uh critical time it was a time when expert systems were about to go out of favor but my phd advisor raj reddy a very well-known expert who was very much strongly in belief that expert systems were the way to solve speech recognition and ai problems he was a wonderful man tremendous mentor but i really did not agree that expert systems are extensible i wanted to pursue machine learning that is teaching the computer using what it's good at crunching numbers to to exhibit intelligent behavior rather than follow step by step how humans thought um so for the first year he gave me directions i wrote the paper on expert systems it got accepted it became clear that i could graduate with my phd and get it over with and be done with it and move on to the what do i love but i thought uh deeply about doing things that i love and i did not love doing expert systems my intuition was that this was not scalable this would be fragile and only technologies that scale with the power of computing that scale with moore's law that scale with more data can be powerful enough to change the world so one day i drummed up enough courage and went to my professor and said i love you as my advisor i want to study with you you're wise and give me great directions but on this expert systems i just don't want to do it anymore here's the approach i want to take and i proceeded to explain hidden markov models which are a variant of neural networks and why i think it was a better approach and the thing that he said to me will stay with me forever he listened carefully asked me questions and then he said i don't agree with you but i support you and and that was um tremendous feedback from me that i did not expect i would convince him and i was prepared for the worst outcome that either he would force me to do what he wants or force me to go get a new advisor but he actually supported me and and this was not just an act of generosity it was not just a respect of individual thoughts but that he really saw me as a scientific equal and that i should pursue what i believe in and that he not only verbally supported me but he gave me resources he actually had millions of dollars of funding from darpa it was a lot of money back then and he let me use all the machines of the people who were doing expert systems as for those of you who are computer scientists you know expert systems don't take any cycles so i wrote programs that took over all of their computers and ran all night and achieved great results database for ai to work and he proceeded to persuade darpa to collect what was then the largest database for speech which was also critical to making my phd thesis work so i dedicated my book to him and i called him my mentor in ai and life because of what he said that i don't agree with you but i support you is not just an act of generosity it is a management style it is a leadership style it's something that i hold dear to myself and whenever one of my employees tells me something i don't agree with this is my default answer and i truly support them to try what they want um very likely they're right if they're wrong if they love it and there's still time well spent and if they learn they're not right then they move on having felt had the support so this is really an amazing leadership style and as i was lucky enough to work at apple microsoft google full of smart people this is the way to lead smart people not to be smarter than them that's never possible but to let them know that you understand and support them there's nothing more important than that about leadership fortunately my phd thesis did work out we built the first working speech recognition system and i then went to apple and the technologies became a part of apple computer siri that you use today is now managed by the team that i then recruited i did quite well at apple it was a lot of fun but then apple got in trouble so i went to a company called sgi no probably no longer that famous nowadays but then it was the hottest company to work at in silicon valley it was the equivalent of google at its height in fact google's building was bought from sgi that's how cool sgi was and i had a group of smartest engineers work with me on very exciting new technologies the technology we worked on was called 3d browser you're probably thinking i've never heard of that you talked about siri i heard that speech recognition i know that in the neural networks okay but what is a 3d browser well it was an idea that a bunch of engineers had that wouldn't be great if we had a virtual reality inside the browser and we were in inside virtual 3d worlds we can navigate we can move objects we can build wonderful ads and we proceeded to build it it was amazing how how how well the system worked given how slow the computers were at the time and we believe strongly that if we build it they will come they being the customers and what actually happened was we built it and nobody came we hardly sold the products we couldn't we got a bundle with netscape browser but people didn't use it there was not much content and ultimately a new ceo came into sgi and and he was very uh upset at me for um starting this project and spending so much of the company's resources on it and and i told him look this is the world's best technology in virtual reality uh you know if you don't want to keep it we should figure out how to how to create value out of it so he gave me a deadline to sell the company and we originally thought we sell it for a decent amount of money we eventually settle for a much less amount we did get it sold but unfortunately after it was sold the company that bought it got into financial trouble so they laid off all of the hundred engineers who worked on this project with me and and i felt extremely guilty and also extremely stupid that uh why would i have started the project like this without thinking about utility only thinking about coolness this is a mistake that i think a lot of young people make when they want to go into entrepreneurship so i would urge all of you listening to be thinking about innovation uh not not what matters about innovation is not innovation itself but useful innovation that something looks really cool like this picture is actually not only useless but counterproductive and that has been my model in developing both my research and technology now of course researchers in universities should not be bound to thinking about utility at the time of doing innovative work but if you're thinking about a company a technology a product then the utility must come ahead of innovation in fact when you start meeting with venture capitalists you'll realize that venture capitalists are taking huge risks by invest by investing in you they're taking people risk market risk competition risk and execution risk they don't want to take a technology risk so you want to go to them with the proven technology that already works and and you want their money to make it useful and valuable and that's something that's is very obvious today i'm sure most of you already know but i did not and i think someone with a phd coming from academia may fall into the same mistake so i thought i list that as my third lesson that i would share after sgi i moved to china and started microsoft research china which later became microsoft research asia it was a huge success mit technology review called it the world's hottest computer lab many of the founders by the way i'm having a reunion with them this weekend uh became ceos and ctos of some of the biggest and hottest and most exciting technology companies in china i was very lucky that i had a big brand like microsoft and the funding to attract great people like that uh year 2000 i repatriated back to microsoft headquarters had the fortune and opportunity to work with bill gates on a number of projects and it became uh boring for me after a while as i saw internet emerge and microsoft at the time was slow to catch on internet the hottest company everybody wanted to work for at that time was of course google that people would joke that if they didn't get invited to an interview they must not be very smart so i i thought i had to get myself an interview so i emailed eric schmidt many of you may think while you're already doing pretty well shouldn't that shouldn't they have poached you or called you or something wouldn't it be beneath you to to contact them and promote yourself but actually that's an interesting small lesson i want to share also as it turns out google and microsoft at the time were negotiating an unsolicited non-hire that agreement never came to fruition and that agreement would have been illegal had it come to fruition but they were nevertheless negotiating for months so they were forbidden from contacting microsoft people in hopes that maybe a an interesting agreement could be reached so as it turns out had i not written eric schmidt indicating my fascination respect and interest in working for google i would never have gotten the job so don't let your own so-called self-esteem get ahead of you if you want something go for it be proactive that's what i learned but what i also learned was a very rude surprise which was that microsoft decided to sue me over uh trying to go work for google it was over something called non-compete won't go into the details in here i would just say that many of the accusations made at the time sometimes by microsoft sometimes by various people and sometimes just by speculative press uh were incredibly inaccurate and damaging there were many many headlines that talked about um is it possible that i might have taken intellectual property of course i did not is it possible that i may have been compensated to not leave microsoft of course i was not there were talks about did i try to bring people into google from microsoft before i left microsoft of course i did not but those speculations persisted and it became really the darkest moment of my life during the two months that we were pending for the judge to make a decision it became so stressful that i could not sleep anymore that i was frustrated and unhappy and i could not eat lost a lot of weight for the first few weeks and one time i was so sick and tired of hearing seeing myself on tv and on newspapers that i thought i would on the on the trip from seattle to uh to new york i thought i would finally get a rest by going to my my seats opening up a magazine and there was i was again on the cover because this was the lawsuit of the century the corporate lawsuit of the century because it's too giant it's david versus goliath and it's a very um something that news people love to write about but it resulted in incredible frustration for me but what got me out of it was that about two weeks into it my wife told me look you gotta calm down and don't be this frustrated think about what makes you peaceful and serene and what occurred to me was when i went to catholic middle school in tennessee uh i learned the serenity prayer and the israeli prayer is such a three sentences of wisdom it says god grant me the serenity to accept the things that i cannot change the courage to change the things that i can and the wisdom to know the difference and when applied to my lawsuit it became very clear that the fact that reporters will write what they write is something i cannot change and what i needed was to have the courage to change the things i can and the wisdom to pick the right ones so with that i went into the lawsuit thinking about what are some ways to fight back what what are some things that i can change i can change the way the judge sees things there are all these things terrible things in the press why don't i get him to see the truth i of course cannot talk to him and my lawyer and my company won't let me talk to the press but i thought i'd take a chance there was this reporter i knew from seattle times i know that everyone seen in seattle including the judge reads the seattle times so i called her and asked if she could write my side of the story and and she did and i think that was a very influential piece and then i was energized by small things like that and still faced huge challenges for example during the discovery process i asked for some emails that would prove my innocence of course microsoft was obliged to send me the emails but they were not prevented from sending more than i asked for so they sent me 300 000 emails that i had to sift through and they not only sent 300 000 emails but they were not in text formats there were pictures because that's what legal law allowed them to do fortunately i was at google so we had very good ocr technology we scanned everything and we used google search and we found all the things i needed to find so things really changed around when i realized that our time is limited and we can only focus on things where we can make a difference if we allow things that we cannot change to frustrate us to slow us down even to stop us then we're destined for a bad outcome so this was something that was very helpful to get me out of the a big big difficult situation i spent four good years at google i learned a lot we built a lot of great products and then google asked me to say stay four more years beyond my original commitment and at the time i saw that mobile internet was was a blossoming in china and many of my smartest people had already left from google they went to start their own companies some started vcs and and some of them started very successful companies um some of the companies you hear about today were started by my my employees back then for example kwai sho is a company valued at about 20 billion dollars uh it's kind of the tick tock competitor in china that was by one of our engineers and pindodo over 100 billion dollars also by one of our engineers so i saw people like these left one by one and and very successful in raising money so what became clear to me was this is going to be the silicon valley of china back in the days of early silicon valley back in the days where apple microsoft and many intel and many great companies were founded this is the time to be in entrepreneurial space but it was risky and i didn't have quite the right experience and of course google made me a nice offer to stay so how would i choose between the two and that comes down to another very wise advice you've probably heard steve jobs commencement speech at stanford if you have not i would suggest that you listen to it in it he talks about follow your heart that is your heart knows the answer you just need to introspect introspectively look in and get that answer and not over rationalize and explain and um and debate and believe that if you know your heart and follow your heart what happens in your life will be like connecting the dots but he also warns not to plan your life by connecting the dots forward because you cannot know what will happen in the future if you plan your career by doing job a job b job c and then starting company x company y company z that's just fantasy you cannot connect them going forward just make the one decision you need to make based on what your heart tells you years later you will look back knowing that you your heart made the right decision because these dots connected so as it relates to my decision about whether to leave google and start sign ovation which is a tech vc i can show you the thoughts that i drew at the time so at the time i was at google at crossroads i realized that in my life because i loved computer science i picked it it wasn't like it was very good for getting a job back in 1980 there were almost no computer science jobs doctor and lawyer was the way to go if you're a computer science major you got to go work for ibm or bell labs but i chose it anyway because my heart tells me that's what i wanted to do then i went to microsoft and microsoft china above all things something that many people would not do but i thought this was the company that knew how to build software and i wanted to learn that then i tried then i i tried to go to sgi and we tried to sell the company and raise money and i failed at the feet of silicon valley venture capitalists so i learned my lessons and how they think and what they do then i went to google which taught me the hottest things about internet mobile e-commerce and so on so i then realized well i now have just what it takes to become a tech investor not any investor i wasn't ready to build a you know softbank or a sequoia but as a tech investor investing in early stage companies i know technology i can relate to them i understand what vcs are looking for and my thoughts were being connected so this would be my final thoughts relating to steve jobs speech i also realized something else i did over the past 20 years at the time i did this maybe the past five or six years i had written seven letters to the chinese students because i felt at the time this was the year 2000 that the chinese students were not as exposed to a lot of the mentorship and thinking that american students were more privileged to so i felt an obligation that i should do that it was something that my heart told me to do my corporate pr said not to my corporate pr said who are you to write letters you didn't even grow up in mainland china but i thought this would be helpful to people so i did it and then i gave many many speeches to a total of maybe 500 000 students this is face to face before the days of zoom i wrote about nine books in chinese four of which were dedicated for chinese students about they were similar content to this talk so you can imagine this these are efforts to help them and i had a 50 million followers on social media so what better basis and background could one ask for to be to to declare myself now uh the mentor to young entrepreneurs and because i have been sincere in helping young people so this is just the natural next step to close the loop on connecting the dots so in fact the first year we helped about 40 people for the young entrepreneurs and many of them came in as engineers and i taught them entrepreneurship not all 40 became ceos but the numbers are staggering here you see that the recruiting poster that we created after one year and the recruiting we had for campus hires was join your company meaning join as an engineer become a ceo get our funding and become the next great company and these eight people who were more or less randomly picked maybe just picked on their good looks or something out of these eight there are now five ceos of companies valued over 200 million dollars in particular the lower left um is someone who actually runs uh taobao and teemo today so about the 40 billion dollar revenue business and and he runs it inside inside alibaba his name is jung fan and he was one of the engineers we brought in so i'm incredibly proud of the work we have done in nurturing these um young entrepreneurs then finally what about connecting the dots for ai as i told you i started ai early at columbia i applied to cmu to learn ai lower here you see my a clip from my phd application letter i decided ai would be my life fairly early while most people at the time laughed at ai ai was called the thing that things that never work whenever something in ai works it would become engineer engineering product technology if it doesn't work it's called ai so we were laughed at for decades and nevertheless i joined it because i thought this pursuing how people's cognition worked was something that was really dear to me and that i wanted to follow my heart so i went on to lead the ai team at apple at microsoft and also i went to learn modern ai at google this was where distributed computing deep learning and using massive technology and tpus it really elevated ai to a next level and reflecting on all the things i've seen invested i wrote a best-selling book ai superpowers and we invested in at standovation 50 ai companies including five soon to be six unicorns the largest in the world and we also built an ai institute of our own ai people so these thoughts also connected for the age of ai and and in reflecting back my own ai journey i pursued it with total dedication i really loved my work as it relates to technology ai whether it was with apple microsoft or google i felt like the luckiest man on earth and a lot of work was the only thing that mattered to me the picture you see on the left you're probably wondering what it is that was my bedroom after one of my surgeries i had a surgery in late 2000s and i was bedridden not allowed to leave my bed at the time there was no mobile phone to play with i only had a blackberry so i had my company my team my i.t team construct this device that allowed me to lie on my back put the keyboard and mouse on my stomach and continue to work with the monitor over my head so i was that much of an a workaholic i worked alongs and after google i worked alongside the chinese 996 entrepreneurs 996 means 9 a.m to 9 00 p.m six days a week and that's a standard work style some chinese entrepreneurs to double or seven that's noon to midnight seven days a week i wasn't that crazy but i was working incredibly hard and you see all these new york times um you know headline talking about the crazy work work hours that exemplified exemplified china and that's a large extent i think the reason that china has been successful so i believe the work ethic that uh born out of the industrial revolution really brainwashed all of us that working hard was important and that work defined the meaning of our lives and i became a willing victim to this workaholic brainwashing and and that's why i worked so hard starting in corporate and then also into sign ovation and the work has led to many great results i'm quite proud of the accomplishments of my team and the work that i have done it also raised some concerns i was talking to frank earlier he asked about what about ai is getting so mature so good that it can take routine jobs and blue collar job white collar jobs should we all be worried about our jobs being take taken away so hold that thought i'll come back to this point but i want to get back to my life my obsession with with work that obsession ended about six years ago when i was diagnosed with fourth stage lymphoma what you see here was my pet scan and it shows about 20 malignant tumors jumping out in my intestines area melting away my ambition and any desire to work further i was faced with the real likelihood that my life may end in just a matter of a few months and during that time of ultimate uncertainty i did a lot of thinking and i sought a lot of wisdom i read a lot of books and i talked to in particular one very wise person master senuin he's one of the oldest and wisest buddhist monks and priests and he was very approachable and he took the time to see me i spent a weekend uh before my surgery um with him and um he had we had a great conversation about one hour and he he basically asked me what my life was about and all i could say was work work work and he said why do you work so hard and i said because i wanted to maximize my impact make a difference in the world and then he said something that really surprised me he said i don't believe you he said whenever someone says they want to maximize the impact change the world i always doubt are they really doing something altruistically for the world or are they just trying to make themselves more famous trying to get more wealth and fame and i could not tell him that i was fully altruistic and it's the kind of thing that sounds grandiose that we really try to fool ourselves but when in reality it feeds our greed and feeds our desire and he left me with the phrase that remember kaifu he said the richest man is not he who has the most but he who wants the least and whenever i feel overcome again by desire i rethink about this whenever i want to have the urge to change the world again which i do i want to separate am i doing it for the world or am i doing it for me this was one big lesson that was um took too long for me to realize and through his wisdom i saw how foolish it was to base my entire self-worth completely on my accomplishments and my work and i also realized that my life was quite out of the border i had neglected my family in my hard work my father had passed away and i never had the chance to tell him that i loved him my mother had dementia and no longer recognized me and my kids had grown up and i really didn't get to know them and one of the books that i read during my chemotherapy was bronnie ware's book about the regrets of people on their death beds and she found that no one wished that they had worked harder but the single thing they wanted the most and they're five here but the number one thing was to spend more time with their loved ones so fortunately with some um sense coming back to me having learned from master and brownie ware i now um i'm in remission and that's why i can come here and give you this talk i've changed my work style so that i'm spending much more time with my loved ones i was able to move back near my mother for a period of time before she passed away to finally spend with her and i whenever my children want my time i put that as a priority work must take a back seat and i travel with my wife whenever she would go with me so this near life experience really uh changed how i thought and and another thing that master ximen told me was that changing the world was too presumptuous and maybe a cloak of magnanimity for my own greed and that he suggests the thing to do is to care for others from your heart and lead your life by giving unconditional love and it was then that i realized that while i did not give condition unconditional love to others but my family and my friends have done that for me so i'm re i've recommitted myself this is something i would change and i think the last few years i've done a much better job and that also leads us back to the ai taking jobs away because it gave me a new epiphany of epiphany about how to look at ai and humanity that ai will beat us at doing all kinds of repetitive tasks but the the thing that separates us from ai is love also creativity as shown here ai is good at doing routine things ai is good at computing optimizing but ai cannot create has no self-awareness and no love and love is what differentiates us from ai despite what science fiction may portray i can tell you responsibly that ai cannot love alphago does not love to play go it does not feel good that it beat kojie and does not feel sadness that they lost the game in fact it doesn't know why people play go at all so with this idea that uh the two dimensions that people can do that ai cannot do our creativity and love we can rethink about a blueprint of human ai coexistence so if we put creativity on the x-axis jobs that require lots of creativity on the right side jobs that are more routine and optimizing on the left side and then love not needed on the bottom left needed on top we will see that the lower left jobs are destined to be taken by ai but all other three jobs are human ai symbiosis on the lower right we will have tools ai tools helping people to become more creative helping scientists invent new drugs on the upper left we have jobs like doctors and teachers where ai can do the analysis the diagnosis the statistics the root the word the work um about patient statistics whereas the doctor is the human interface making the patient feel better gaining confidence that he or she would recover and then on the upper right jobs that require creativity and love only human can do that so the what's incumbent us upon us in the society is realizing that the largest number of jobs are on the left side after all we all wish everyone in the world can be creative but only a small percentage are but but on the left side we can see that the many people who are on the lower left who might be faced with ai displacement there is a path that they should move up uh to jobs that require greater empathy to give more precise examples talking about people who work in factories assembly lines truckers people who do repetitive jobs bpo paper pushing those jobs will be replaced by ai but jobs that require human touch and love jobs that involve a great tourist guy the great concierge a great nurse a great teacher these are jobs of love that only people can do so migration from lower left to upper left is the path to go give you an example um world health organization estimates that about 18 million more health care services jobs will be needed in the next 15 years to reach sustainability requirements throughout the world so a lot of jobs are available just because ai is taking the routine jobs it does not mean it does not mean that there will be no jobs for people in fact if we look at the longer term i would tend to believe that in 30 years looking back we would feel that this has been a good good thing that ai came about because it did not we would not look at it as ai stealing our jobs but ai liberating us from ever having to do routine job again allowing us to do things that we love and things we're good at so in conclusion these are the seven things that i learned i would add an eighth thing now in having heard my story uh what should become obvious to all of you is that i learned the most when i face the greatest obstacle when i have the greatest failure it was when my sgi company fell apart that i learned the most important thing then and it was when i was facing the lawsuit of the century that i learned a tremendous deal and it was when i was facing death that i learned absolutely the two greatest lessons so please take with you the importance of failure and learning from failure failure is not a punishment on what you didn't do right but a chance to learn a valuable life lesson thank you thank you so much dr lee for this wonderful heartfelt talk and i think i can speak for the entire audience that we have learned a great deal and as you were talking i received a text message that there's about a hundred thousand people listening to you i think all over the world and the number was still climbing we have some wonderful questions in the next few minutes um what ai area can us and china collaborate on now despite the seasonal political tensions between the two countries i believe academically u.s china and europe the three biggest groups in the world working on ai still collaborate a great deal and that has what that is what has propelled the world forward in ai applications so i think that will continue and i hope that can continue um academia is without national boundaries and people are able to make progress only by standing on shoulders of giants um and then specific to um industries i think healthcare would be an excellent one certainly on facing covet 19 um and the issues in dealing with that whether it's social distancing contact tracing or coming up with ai assisted vaccine discovery that would make another area and also climate change and anything i think that's good for the future of humanity would be a good topic for that discussion thank you the next question do you think ai will ever be able to articulate why they make certain decisions um aka verbalizing the black box uh yes i think they will but there's a problem because you know we think of our reason for making decisions as simple if then else and that in some sense is a blessing because of the simplicity but it's also an inaccurate way to make decisions whereas we think of three or five or ten factors in making a decision ai thinks of three thousand so when it has three thousand things intermingled in a mathematical equation it's impossible to articulate it uh with fidelity um i think in some sense ai is just too smart and too complex and even if it could express a three thousand dimensional math equation we can't understand it so i think first we have to accept that rather than criticize the black box now now it is completely reasonable in certain domains such as medical autonomous vehicles to demand an answer of course we as users need an answer and i think the kind of work that needs to happen are working on explainability and interpretability for ai the former approach is take a large neural network that reached a decision going back and finding the most concise way to approximate why i made the decision in a way that makes sense to people that's one field of research the other one is are there learning methodologies that by definition is explainable when decisions are made and i do think there's valid reason to to work on both right now the ai systems are still largely a black box but i think um for ai to become truly pervasive we have to overcome this problem thank you so the next question i think there are two we can combine into one what advice do you have for dealing with professional or personal rejection how does one know rejection the simple roadblock and not a sign of something greater and in concurrence um how to advise asian americans to break the glass ceiling right um i think rejection means that you are pushing the limits it does not mean that you're unqualified if i've been rejected i'm sure many of you have been rejected when you're rejected find out why understand the true reason sometimes people if you're applying for a job sometimes they just give you a form letter sometimes they only give you some nice words or sometimes they even tell white lies like the job has been filled we're no longer hiring when they may or may not be the truth so be personable connect to people whether it's a head hr specialist or your hiring manager that rejected you see if you could sit down with them um have coffee with them understand the true reasons that you were rejected and only then would you learn what are areas that you need to improve on otherwise it's like the black box we're talking about if you're just trying a lot of black box applications some say yes some say no you'll never know what what it is that made you special and what it is that made you unacceptable and when you know the reasons that they rejected you you can decide if that's something you can improve upon or is that the company culture that you don't want to be in so be inquisitive be proactive find out the true reasons and and then uh that becomes the potential basis uh for your self-improvement plan and about the glass ceiling i i think many of the people in this call if you're living in america were probably born in the u.s or moved an earlier age i really think there is not that strong glass ceiling sometimes when you believe in something it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy you know we are seeing many asian americans do quite well in american companies in particular i think indians have done exceptionally well and if you think about why is there less so-called or let me not use the word i don't believe in why is there more success by the indian americans in in their careers i think i find that the indian americans i work with in the u.s they are very personable they are able to connect with people they try to melt into the society and they're articulate i think on the average some of the chinese chinese engineers focus too much on work are not as good as at self-promotion i don't mean self-promotion in exaggerating i just mean letting your boss know you did the work or letting your boss's boss know that you're the person behind the work making sure you get fair credit not excessive credit and make sure that you realize communication is very important i think a very famous a greek philosopher once said that a person who has great ideas but cannot articulate is absolutely not different from someone who has no ideas and i find that some asian american engineers are very quiet and they expect their boss to learn about find out how great they are but it's really your job to let people know uh the successes and the work and the contributions that you have made that's great thank you another question how do you see ai reshape the real estate industry in the next decade i i think real estate is probably one of the not so early industries to be disrupted by ai i think certainly ai can be used as a tool to estimate prices and to find the right piece of land and things like that it's not so fundamentally a part of ai when you think about an industry or on whether it's a fit for ai think about do you have a large amount of data and does that data connect to some very important objective function something that you can learn and get better over time so you know when you think about real estate data uh you know having a couple of apartment complexes or a couple of malls that doesn't help anything the only data that's really large enough is data that's available on you know zillow or companies like that so using that to to make projection i know one company that um is basically uh has an order for let's say they build a software to build a modular building and what they would do is not only find that use ai to find the most suitable and low-priced materials to build a modular building but also identify a site that fits the module considering the price of real estate so those are the kinds of things where this can fit um but i'm not sure anyone thinking about disrupting real estate with ai will will find good entrepreneurial ideas at this time great i have two more questions i know you have to leave sharply at uh your timeline dirty um the question is the scholar who's interested in literary accounts of ai he said right now there's a lot of writing about ai feeling emotions he recount this person recalls accounts about a.i that can stimulate love empathy and he was wondering if this kind of performance of love empathy is a technical technology that you see will continue to advance in ai yes well we should separate empathy emotion love into three different buckets i think one is being able to perceive it second is able to fake it and the third is to be able to feel it okay so today ai's actually made leaps and bounds of progress on perceiving it in fact um i think i would not be surprised if the use of facial expression uh can recognition and conversational agents and recordings of videos becomes an important part of forensic evidence i think it can be a more powerful tool than the light detector because the micro expressions that we um we show on our face when we feel emotion whether it is sincerity or lying or happiness or love or sadness or anger are really captured very very well by ai and and better than most people obviously there are people who are great at it who are better than ai but ai can do that quite well um and and that's kind of one aspect obviously some people will will be spooked by these kinds of applications but i'm just describing the capabilities of reading people's faces and expressions and feelings that's quite advanced so obviously if you can read it you can exhibit it right so there will be good progress in avatars that look like they have feeling mo when you see today animation that looks like they have feeling most of it is still from motion capture that is putting uh sensors on my face and having me say something with emotion and having the avatar do the same but there is now beginning to be true synthesis of emotion um that appears relatively real um but the problem is you know telling a 3d avatar say this with happiness or say this and then cry is not feeling it's not true emotion not true feeling it is really acting think of ai as becoming better and better um watchers of emotion and actors of emotion but there is truly no feeling inside ai it is simply following the instructions of a person to do something and um and i have seen no evidence that software code can have emotion at this time and i personally would like to think that um there's still something special about our humanity and our souls and that lies in the way we feel and that it may very well be the case that ai will never capture that in fact if ai someday truly capture that then i think we also need to question uh what is it that makes us special as humans so i i think progress is being made but have uh do not be overly worried that robots with feelings are coming out anytime soon thank you so time is up there's one question from a gentleman in south africa it's 3 a.m there and i think i just got the number you now have 350 000 people watching this particular talk this question is a little more involved but perhaps we can send it to you later he said he's been writing to you for years and he's in africa hoping you get advice for him to start a relationship with bc such as yours in china to partner with the startups in the ai ecosystem in africa and he would like some advice perhaps i should just send you the email because you probably can't explain all that right now okay i'll be happy to respond to his email thank you well thank you for your talk and we are so appreciative learned so much from you today from the heart um and so in appreciation the new series has a little plaque a marble plaque with your name on it um we will mail it to you um after the talk thank you so much again we've learned so much and thank you for your time thank you and thanks everybody and before everyone else logs up we have a talk by mr davey wong on tencent he's the chief solution architect of tencent and he will be talking at lily on november 4th and we will have the information online for you well thank you everybody for watching i think we all learned a great deal and and this concludes our talk thank you you
