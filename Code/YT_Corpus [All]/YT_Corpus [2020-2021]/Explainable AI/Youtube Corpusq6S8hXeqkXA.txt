 Artificial Intelligence has already proven useful in the fight against the Covid-19 virus. It could detect the onset of the pandemic. It can raise the alarm if people are feverish or don't respect security distances. AI can determine who is most exposed to infection risks based on the position recorded by our smartphones. AI programs already diagnose the Covid based on Lung scans, they find out symptoms that predict future respiratory distress best, and they screen existing drugs to select potentially efficient ones. AI is even used in the search for a synthetic vaccine. Has we reach the point at which artificial intelligence will take over and solve all our problems, including the Covid-19 crisis? Not Quite! Current AI systems are just statistical machines, and as such, are highly conformist. They are designed to interpolate between examples that are given to them. Don't ask them to "see" what they are not designed to "see". AI doesn't see that some countries like South Korea  do much better than others, and it as no way to figure out why. AI can only believe that Lybia has not a single case on its soil. There's no way to communicate to a deep learning system that Lybia is an exception, because there's no State in charge there. Surveillance programs would be blind to a possible polio outbreak, just because the abnormal medical statistics would be lost in the ocean of Covid-19 data. And even texts dealing with polio cases would be overlooked, just because AI systems are unable to interpret texts in their context. Télécom Paris is pursuing research in the direction of Explainable AI. One of our objectives, which lies at the opposite of the statistical paradigm, is to make AI abled to detect the singularity of situations. Hopefully this will help for future crises. telecom-paris.fr/en/ai-ethics
