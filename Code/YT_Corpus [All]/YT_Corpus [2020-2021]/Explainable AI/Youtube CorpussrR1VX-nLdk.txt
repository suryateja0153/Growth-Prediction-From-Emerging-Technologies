 thank you so much welcome everybody it's a great pleasure to have you all with us we have participants from around the globe today and I thank you very much for being with us my name is Frederic well II I am the assistant dean of academic design and innovation at UC Berkeley global and I have the great privilege of co moderating this panel event with my colleague professor Jean Michel hi kovitch of Technology which I'm chair marketing professor glomm and I'm also president of the French Marketing Association we have a partnership between Nam Coursera traditionally ceramic year and Berkeley extension and we we are trying to develop the link between our MBA and the programs as a study track that we are promoting around about project management at Berkeley we were due to being Berkeley in a few weeks but because of the Coheed we postponed our international travels and we decided to create keep on having a link and to create this event series the first one - and the second one took place during the Kobe during the lockdown and the first title we're about marketing the second one was around cows management and the third one after the lockdown in France was about strategy so this event is the number four and I will leave Frederick to present the content of this event about digital transformation e.i and virtual work for theory yes thank you very much so today we have the great opportunity to gain insights from global thought leaders on how to manage this digital transformation out of the crisis and I really want to thank our amazing panelists for having taken the opportunity to be with us having taken the time to be with us today so we have a Jill Finlayson the director of women in technology initiative at the University of California we have Philippe adjunct faculty at the konami vice-president of operational excellence at Trivium packaging we have Michael Wu chief AI strategist at pros and Libra so a senior adviser innovation and technologies at Veolia Water Technologies and we will let you introduce yourselves to the audience with a few individual questions at the beginning and after that we plan to open the discussion to everyone to address these very interesting questions about how we manage this digital transformation out of the crisis to introduce the topic more broadly speaking is we we were wondering how we can help managers take these opportunities that have arisen through the crisis through the shelter in place or confinement what is called in France and see how we can use these opportunities that we were forced into this way of working that we were forced into due to the crisis to actually yeah lead our company is better out of into this new normal to the audience please feel free to share your questions at any time in the Q&A box we have a team of moderators that will structure those questions so that the panel can address them in person in in life as the questions come up and we will try it on Michele myself to weave them into the discussion while we have the discussion with you so thank you very much I will let Joe Michel kick off the introduction of our first panelist so maybe we go for presentation and maybe winds up with Jean thank you yes my name is joel Finlayson and i'm the director of the women in tech initiative at the University of California and our goal is to increase the participation persistence and advancement of women in STEM fields and it's part of citrus which is the Center for IT research in the interest of society and it's also co-funded by the College of Engineering because we want to work together to not only make academic more equitable but the workplaces that the students go into more equitable and fair my background I've worked with a lot of startups and global technology companies and in particular I also mentor with tech women which is a State Department program around how we can help more women come into stem and support them around the globe so very excited to be here today thank you for having me Thank You Julie the next release will be feed good evening everyone so my name is Philippe Jame as was said I'm adjunct faculty at the economic Paris I'm lecturing on digital transformation outside of that VP of operational excellence attribute packaging my background is both from consulting from McKinsey and from the industry of in old values general director positions in two companies and stop being a holding stock manufacturer and impressed a Tkaczyk some time ago thank you feed the next one will be Michael everyone I'm Michael whoo and the chief AI strategist at pros and pros is a company that helped other company monetize more efficiently through pricing and and sales optimization using artificial intelligence and machine learning and I am very fortunate to actually look after all the magic that makes all this work is which is AI and machine learning and I'm very happy to be part in that distinguished panel thank you Michael and live from Normandy I guess we do have every right yes so everybody so I work with via a senior advisor for innovation the OREA is the world leader in environmental management so basically we deal with large physical systems your water treatment plants your wastewater treatment plants which use a lot of people so we have a lot of people that were impacted by we discussed our buyer by the confinement bike ovid but at the same time you will see how this large system we are thinking how can they be more resilient after Khalid and indeed I am in Normandy right now very close to the d-day landing beaches where you know yeah 6th of June many years ago Europe was retaken basically from the Nazis thank you very so it's one more way to make links between Europe and in the States we can at this stage jump into our discussion and I will raise the first question for Jill Jill Morris we are going out of the loop down what did we learn with respect to remote work and to with virtual teams management yeah absolutely well it's it's been really interesting because one thing that we've seen is you know this has been an opportunity for change where you know change is often difficult in the past but we've been forced into this and what we've discovered is that knowledge workers actually prefer to work from home if they can here at Cal they actually did a survey only 10% and want to come back full-time 47% want to be a remote at least three days a week so this is a pretty significant change and there's a lot of I think factors that go into that no commute time savings flexibility you know even casual dress you see a lot of memes about that and then there's the other win which is you know saving carbon and reducing commutes really having a positive effect on the environment there's been one other thing which I think is interesting sort of the humanizing aspect as you see in the zoom call all our heads are the same size we all have a seat at the table and if people walk into the room you see people's family or pets or children and this has been sort of a leveling and humanizing element but it didn't come without a cost so the cost being that we experienced some pretty significant short-term productivity performance challenges as people were drawn into other difficult and stressful innings ancient anxiety-producing events and these have a disproportionate impact on women and people of color especially women of color and single parents basically this this whole double-double which we know women have a disproportionate of childcare elder care and home care which really was exacerbated by the kovat situation so women doing 70 percent of the childcare during the work day and we see this in the academic environment in that the publishing by women academics actually plummeted while the publishing by male academics went up 60% so we see the impacts of this that it has on people's productivity we also saw a huge number of layoffs of course and with this we saw a loss of diversity gains because a lot of times its first height last hired first fired and a lot of the people who have been brought into the workforce have been let go and that has had a really disproportionate impact on people of color and younger people entering the workforce and then we also have the issue of equitable participation right we want everybody to be able to work from home but do they have high-speed internet at home do they even have a quiet room where they can focus and do things and for students we found they were in different time zones because they went home and that became challenging to access classes so you know might kind of take away on that is that you know our near-term learnings from this experience are that only those who need to return to work should return to work we have issues with social distancing only one person riding in an elevator single single direction stairwells and so some people have location specific work and they have to come to work so how do we protect them well we have to exclude those that are location independent the second thing I would say we learned is that you have to level the playing field so given all those concerns that I had about disproportionate impacts how do we make sure people have the tools to work remotely and you know equitably how do we support workers to create work-life boundaries when work and life are in the same space how do we extend childcare benefits and leave options for people who have elders or other concerns that they're dealing with and how do we take the equity lens into consideration when we are layoffs or when we're bringing people back and all of this comes to my third key point which is that we have to lead with integrity that means empathy flexibility being able to provide resources to managers so that they can be more effective right in this new environment because you know microaggressions don't stop because you're in a zoo meeting women still get talked over interrupted and those sort of things so we need to provide more training for our managers and then also for the staff right enable the employee resource groups to do activities and support employees and that ties the you know last thing which is mental health right how do we help people deal with their mental health and anxiety and stress issues that becomes actually an obligation of of the workplace and I'll share in the slack our Center for equity gender and leadership at UC Berkeley has published a dual careers playbook because 62 percent of couples are both working full-time and that has impacts on how employers look at their employees especially in this is this climate of remote in virtual employees it's fascinating thank you so much the the difference between efficiency and effectiveness that you're drawing out here is really very interesting from the from the perspective in the shift of mindset that managers mine and leadership really need to consider and probably have will have to go through I wanted to ask Phillip with kind of the same background of the idea effectiveness efficiency what did we learn with respect to running operations in this time where a lot of things were done remotely or at least if it was in person operations there was need for social distancing what did we learn there well first of all I mean some general comments same language Jeanne said I for people for which for whom the work can be digitized we want to be more efficient to be more coordinated meeting some bit of prepare people more common time that has a better use of the digital tools massive reduction on that but that's not the case for everyone when you comes to operations and managing factories obviously that creates a lot of constrain and much more caution in terms of protecting our workforce implementing the right rules of social distancing food protection testing people limiting contacts between people walking from the offices and what people walking on the floor and that is really deep really fine the way people interact we have seen some factories exciting but so that people could still communicate while in a very noisy on the old mount so all these elements are really new what it brings I mean it brings up some from website in terms of being focused being right on the task as Jesus said I mean there were some drawbacks of that and beyond the Equality question I think it raises the question that short-term we're much better in themselves effect carrying on our processes Toronto processes but the question is what about the medium and long term because in terms of being creative co-constructing some strategy some plan we all realize that with a digital tool that we have today we can be much more limited so it's really that trade-off between the short-term productivity efficiency again the officers preparing for the future what is really first thing is that we start having the point of view from the US and jumping to Europe and actually it's an ongoing discussion because the comments who are making about that far away from from each other and I don't we jump into very close conclusion on many topics about work organization about balance between private and and job situation and so on and of course all the topics about technology and so on are key they are they are in the middle of our discussion and we are very quickly using and learning how to use this new those new technology my next question will be for for Michael because AI was already the winner before before Co vide and just like there is kind of an acceleration a digital boost which is impacting our daily life ai will be will have a brighter future isn't it Michael what is impact on your side from your point of view sure certainly I think kovat the lockdown now created a huge need for digital transformation I think that that is actually the first step and with respect to I would say integrating AI into different corporation or different operations within the company it really depends on where the company is you know on this kind of a maturity curve of AI adoption there there is a maturity curve and it is I would say I would look at it in more like six different phases okay maybe five but the last one is really the when everything is working in there with AI so let's try to go through them quickly I don't want to take too much time but first one this is really I would just say that digitization of work right basically that's just getting the data right if you if you digitize the work then you would have the data to train the AI to mimic how we work right so the first step will be is what we called it's also the first step of zero transformation you know it is digitization right so that's getting the data and once you have the data then basically you can train some AI model to essentially help you automate certain tasks you know basically if I know that every time I come into the office I always you know turn on my light or my laptop and the first thing I do is to check email if you have all those data then you could just automate it write a script to automate right so every time you know that user IOT device - - - you know the motion detector come when you come in the door turn on the light turn on the laptop you know start up your email program so these are what we call the second phase where you start to exchange data for automation my first step is to do the digitization of work second step is basically second phase is you start to exchange this data or automation right now once these AI is able to start to automate some aspects of your work right these models are usually not I would say you know very good no they can't perform at a human level right so then the next phase would be what we call you know teaching the AI to refine its model of how we work okay so so essentially you know we we are basically kind of like the supervisor of this area right where every time you automate something we will come okay great you did a good job here you know like and then we're there too as a kind of a reviewer right the AI would say in this situation I recommend you to do this right and then you will say yes that's right no go ahead and do it or no this I wouldn't do it and then you take over you do it and then while you are doing this right the a actually collects data because now you have digitization of work already right so you collect the data so that it takes these data to refine the model okay so this third phase is basically teaching the AI to refine the model right and if you do this long enough basically you know this AI we eventually become really really good you know you could basically automate a huge part you'll work right I mean so what do you you know what what happens then basically what happens then is basically we have basically we call this a full the fourth phase is that essentially the the full AI automation right so a lot of people would say well if AI is automating or our work and what do we do I mean that like question but I always say that you know like you know it is no different than you know when we have trained our intern to to to to do our work right basically our job shift right we become managers right if we train a new employee you know we have someone recording to us which we train them to essentially mimic our work right and then once they are good enough to do our work then then we become managers we take on more responsibilities right the nature about our work the nature of our job changes and and then but I would say that we we move into something more strategic and more important right so so this is the fourth phase basically we have full AI automation and job shift and people move on to something more more important so so DeeDee is that more I would say the four first for safety system or I would say the kernel operation within the company right I think that the fifth phase basically starts - what we call delivering the last mile of this AI automation okay and that really has to do with robotic and and you know and and these a machinery sense and that's because you know like I think AI and and digital transformation it's great but there are a lot of things we can't do digitally I mean you can't eat a meal digitally right you could you could surf on the web and then configure and buy your product right but you can't that you can't always not every single product can be downloaded to your laptop right it's some lot of these product need to be delivered physically right a lot of service need to be performed by humans right so how do you deliver that last mile right basically there's another class of AI that actually is able to you know the same kind that they are the powers autonomous vehicles today it's actually a like your power robotic as well you know so so that would be the fifth phase right basically it's actually letting these machines to to execute essentially what we call it the last mile the delivery of the service where there's a meal for some some tasks that you know like cleaning a window right so maybe there would be no so we starting to seeing this already you know like so different you know you may be surprised that you know this it sound like far fetch you know in the future but this is you know in a some way in Asian countries you know we have robotic waste that robotic chef robotic barista you know date or you know I mean I think in San Francisco we assemble about a person they make coffees or right so so they're they're you know so this is happening right and and then the final phases when when the whole kind of you know lots of accompany the majority company is starting to able to adopt this AI you know then we have I would say a organic economy basically right so so that with that I'm gonna pause and you know video is in a burrito bit on the law so you you come back to this topic live from sure I mean I could I mean yeah the a IR command economy is basically now that you know I would say that a large part of our work has been automated right then you know there certainly is I would say a lot of feeders that well what what the humans do right well here I would say that you know until we get to the world where there's no problem anymore right there's always a role for human there's always a role for forget for human because because you know there's always new problem this unknown problem there's more challenging more typical problem that people have never saw before right and so those problem we have no data we have no data to train the AI to how to mimic to to mimic us how to respond in those situation right so so basically I would say that you know like in this fully a IR command economy right I mean people who essentially you know do things that are actually more motivating more challenging right and and you saw this new problem or the once or twice or maybe several times depending on how how consistently these problem can be solved using a set method right so sometimes sometimes it's a method same problem need to be solved several different fine with different methodology right then you would need to address them all right there's two today I learn how you solve those problem right and they can mimic you how to solve this problem so and then they has actually a lot of I would say economic effect as well you know such as you know universal basic income right so this is the greater I would say a I augment economy you know it could create so much efficiency that maybe a lot of us would not need to work you know a lot I mean we have decreasing our work our significantly since the Industrial Revolution right and it's steadily being decreased now I mean I think a lot of people right now they don't really have to work eight hours now they they they can actually make a you know pretty and though it's not very equally distributed among the population but I think that there's a you know when there's enough this automation enough efficiency gain from AI and robotics right maybe a lot more of us can work a lot less and focus on I would say things that are more important our life you know so that would be I would say the last phase in the AI or command economy thank you very much I think there will be more discussion I see already questions popping up in the in the Q&A we wanted to get also to way and asked your perspective on what we learned out of this crisis but maybe then following up on what has been said with this perspective of sustainability and and maybe how can we make this situation that we were what can make of this situation and and profit with the perspective of making processes sustainable and making this new economy sustainable yes so what I would suggest you do is let's rewind time let's move to a time before covet so I can tell you before coffee there was already the idea of a digital transformation happening so the big companies like ours who deal with these water systems we deal with cities we deal with many industries and basically we when we were moving before copied to try to use and understand how to use best the digital jobs and what did that mean it meant that in the past in the 50s or 60s engineers what they love to do is to design in steady-state you know give me how much maximum flow something is going to take maximum chip and then you design something according to something fixed Eddy State but you know that the world is never steady-state in fact we're moving in a world which is less and less that he stayed I used to live in North Carolina and you could see these huge storms in North Carolina how can I design you know something that is steady state where where there is a fluctuation of plus or minus a thousand percent in a short period of time well I think what was happening before and then I'm gonna move to covet is we saw the huge possibility of this digital transformation to make systems smart more sustainable more flexible and and and so that's where we were moving technically you know basically instead of designing a huge central facility the tendency was to move to decentralized facilities more agile and basically the image of that is what it's Internet and we've heard discussing within the panel that Internet has been so robust and and we were hoping to move to system variable but answer them and then you know there were people saying hey be careful you know we may receive a meteorite or they may be a virus we had warnings but suddenly been covered how it happened and I think so for me and then I'll shift to more sustainability when Kabat happens there is one thing that it does it puts the human not more in front that we thought before because to make systems run the big systems that you know they're still operators and things like that so for us of we the first thing it does it put humans in more in the equation it tells you human doesn't have to be necessarily on the plant but somehow the interface between these fantastic AI and humans is going to be very important and what is going to be important is this this idea of sustainability and the idea of resilience because we will never guess what is gonna hit us next okay but in the future then I move to the future can we use a I with things like digital twins to play scenarios and so in our industry this will become very important so we want to be able for cities and for for industries with them to play scenarios what if because you can imagine in the water and wastewater industry first question is e is coming in the wastewater so you have many many questions that you are bombarded with and when you deal with that in the moment of the crisis you don't do a good job but if you could try to work with AI and then work in a world before the world I think this could be fantastic and we are trying to understand in my industry how how we can play with that I bet with a human AI interface as being very important maybe this could be a question that we can can open up to to all of you and the panel the the thing that you just touched upon with the interaction between AI and humans how would you say from your specific vantage points did this relation between humans were the workers or managers changed through the crisis the interaction between humans and AI I think the first thing that I could tell is not so much arrived at the digital world and Ed was mentioned before is the fact that if that public crisis had happened before we had internet what what would have really happened because we have 50% of 60% more now 80 percent of our people worked out of their own and it was possible so I think the main thing was that the ability suddenly will realize the power of things of the ability to still work out of our homes I think that was the biggest possibility and then the big in one for us is the interface between AI in the real world so there is a revolution in AI but there is a revolution also in biology biotechnology are we going to be how are we going to be able to link the genomes and analysis on the genomes to some smart AI so it's I think that is the future but it will perfect but for us we need to learn how we can analyze bugs so we for another stop where there is a new part of technology which spells if a population is sick we should be able in a wastewater to see before even the doctors signs that the population is sick because in the wastewater you find all the viruses older so I think we we are we have we have we didn't see wastewater as data wastewater is data what there is so much data and so I think it changes our mind we see things as not enough but we also know should not forget the physical world but but I think that's that's what do the others think the the change in the interaction between humans and they I through this crisis yeah I can jump in I think there have been a couple of really interesting things first of all we saw with zoom there was a crash course in cybersecurity right so an awareness of where we were vulnerable where AI and automation and BOTS could actually infiltrate and change how things are working but I think along with that came almost a misplaced trust or lack of awareness like eat that even that AI is happening I think that a lot of people don't even realize how artificial intelligence is used in almost every facet of human resources recruiting hiring selection all of those things and people don't know what are the proxies that are used why didn't I get this job why didn't I make it through the filter there's this whole black box and so that relationship hasn't been really built out or made more clear and you know especially when we talk about you know taking the example of AI and HR right there's a huge reason to do it right turnover is much much more 75 percent of the workforce is Millennials they turnover at two point eight years as opposed to the older folks who turned over at more four or five years right so we're seeing that there's a lot more hiring that has to happen a lot of reasons to automate and make the practices better and there's a lot of bias in the real world so there's opportunities for AI to address that bias but right now the teens that are developing those tend not to be diverse teens they tend not to test in different contexts they don't necessarily understand or mitigate for the bias and the datasets they don't understand the implications of the proxies that they're choosing and so you know Michael to your point you know we are been a train and in turn right we're gonna train an intern we're gonna get them to be good at this job but who's overseeing that intern to make sure that they're doing what they're supposed to do that they're not being corrupted by bad information right or bad training and so I think jobs inherit a you as well you know these trends were already happening right they've just been accelerated so rather than augment you know deleting jobs we're really augmenting or changing the jobs and part of that has to be this oversight for the AI and asking these questions you know who has helped who's harmed what are the unintended consequences how do we mitigate for that how do we create feedback cycles so we know that there is even a problem yeah precisely maybe I could comment on down a little bit I think there's certainly there's a lot of concern around this black box nature of these this AI or people of any networks I think that's that's changing though I mean I think there there's an there's an increasing need you know specifically even my company you know like when we so as I mentioned before prose is a company that company to optimize prices or you know if we help a lot of the airlines and lots of ptb company optimize their their pricing and sales effectiveness and so when you when you recommend us a price right a lot of people may say that well why why do you why do you recommend this fine I used to sell it at like much lower price you know you tell me that to increase my price at you know 50 percent that that's pretty scary I may not want to do that right I mean I may lose my customer right I mean so you have to offer explanation right so explain ability becomes very very crucial and in this world I think especially you know when you are in the finance industry especially also in HR right when you didn't get a job you should offer a reason why you didn't get a job right I'm not just a light minor Network tell me tell you you're not qualified right that's not gonna that's not gonna fly right so this is actually changing so our team is actually developing an explainable a model of these PPO networks like you train it first right first you have to have the the black box right and then you have there you have another system right it goes on top of it to explain in a working that this black box right and I think there's a misconception between like you know the black box nature I think it's not that the black boxes it's not explainable it just that it has millions of parameter it's just very hard for us to understand what it's actually doing right you can tell you that you know it's because of this this this path and this new one on this neuron gets activated and all that right so so when you make a decision right you you don't go trace like what's going on you every single neuron your brain to come up with that conclusion right you don't do that we look at it at a more high level from a top-down right and to explain what what's happening so this is the approach that we're taking to address this white box we actually have a separate model that go on to analyze the network that deep in your network to understand what's actually going on so it give us some high-level understanding right that within which we can't really go deeper and deeper right eventually we could look at all we could dig it as deep as you know each single neuron but at that time at that level you'll be very very hard to understand what's going on but we could stop at any level we want right so that's the best idea of this basically what you're saying oh sorry basically what you're saying is that for you from the perspective of more like the engineers and the companies that provide AI the crisis might have just accentuated the fact that it is a lot the user interface that counts the user experience that is important so where you might have been thinking more black box from your perspective we get a lot of questions around this topic and and maybe feel you can also comment on on this question is about like how do we do it where do I start my AI implementation and so on it seems that it resonates with your perspective coming from the engineering side where we can do almost anything but we realize that if we really want to implement it it is about the interface we need to create very good connections and touch points.the the interfaces the the way the person in the company uses the AI basically they not the machine but the levers that the buttons basically and by in role of the managers will be more and more complex because on one side the machine the black box is still there and you've got to explain the output of the black box which is a very challenging topic Philip what are your thoughts about the role and the impact on the managers side well I think there would be opportunities and challenges my point of view is about the evolution of the organization if we take a short term medium term long term perspective in the short term which is when opening now everybody is wondering should I come back to work as you were saying some people don't want to come back to work I'll do I've got further mass adoption of all the communication tools collaborative tools and that's what green is happening on the short-term and it breeds a much more knowledge intelligence to the worker with all the downside but we mentioned before when the digitalization is going to drive further into refining in the medium term what is the core of my company what is non core anymore and therefore we're going to emerge more in the virtual workforce for which digitalization is going to be key and bringing them context of decision-making is going to be absolutely fundamental and as a is progressing as algorithm kept from learning is what Michael was mentioning is what part of the human job ai is going to take and in terms of job content evolution we're going to move much more from being problem solvers to problem finders and entering more and more in the unknown having AI around us helping us to to do that so if you take it from a management perspective of course but is going to change a lot of things you don't manage a neural network the same way as you manage the parameter organization with people coming in and out according to their skills according to the project to be done the relationship of a virtual workforce with a company will be different hours a manager you bring the meaning therefore the motivation so but you keep the same level of output as you do on physical presence to to to to manager for people and and the other point as a manager as we all noticed and I said in the introduction I we're going faster we walk more everybody is back to back in terms of meeting how do you find a gene in the workplace and making sure what your collaborators are sustainable in terms of delivering what they have to be done and walk in a the right work-life balance which a lot of people has been has been lost well what I would add to that is in this world in which we are contouring we are going to be become more and more skilled specific and therefore there would be more and more need to be trained to be retrained to make sure that what is delivered to the company is really the most updated knowledge which the company is needed and continuous learning will be a formal internal aspect but managers company we need to foster in consortium probably with academy with schools which are prepared everywhere which are able constantly to obscure a skilled workforce and giving them as well the opportunity to apply to become relevant so what becomes like a more society debate governmental debate on how to address with transition because well we all know that there will be a lot of job destruction but a lot of job creation and the key point is alphas who are making the transition and our when is managed it's very interesting because as educators we have this this ha moment in the recent years which is our students are not competing and that's young students as well as unprofessional learners lifelong learners are not today only competing against other people that are studying they're competing against machines for certain jobs now and will so more and more and what you just said resonates very well with a lot of questions we are getting and I was wondering just piggybacking on this people are asking for like concrete examples would maybe and every one of you would you be able to give like one example each from your experience with I mean there's so many that we can't cover everything but maybe for our audience that would be interesting from each one of you to have one example of this is how AI was implemented and this is how it affected the the job in in the way you saw it happening if I may add one element to your question can we focus on some industries because what we are talking about is very generic and actually it might be different if we are talking about industry talk about services if we are talking about white colors of blue colors and so on so in examples the industry of this digital transformation which is being of course accelerated by kovat it will highlight and bring value I guess to the audience who wants to jump in if you want I can give you some examples on the wastewater treatment plants and how AI is implemented so like I said before you know wastewater treatment lines is an asset and then it was receiving rain so different quantities of water we didn't know that and then the output hopefully was meeting environmental standards now with with digital tools and AI what's happening there is a lot of information from the weather channel so now a wastewater treatment plant is connected to the weather channel the data from the a channel is used to predict in advance that the rainy bed is going to come and affect the catchment basin of that wastewater treatment plant immediately some valves are starting to actuate in some areas of the network are already being planned to be storage areas to minimize the water impact of what is coming to your plant so a message is being sent to the operator who is home watching The Voice and basically he's seeing a message a there is rain coming already valve B and C are being closed please know that so we may have a problem so be aware and be ready for that time to go into that wastewater treatment plant and then you know you have more sensors on the plant when the event happens basically we follow that much better so and then that is all stored in a database data and that data is available for AI algorithms to be able to to analyze a how was the plant able to cope and what was wrong so the next time it's done a bit a bit better so actually the physical systems are starting to use now it's not perfect today in fact what we are missing I would say in that is for better sensors because the eyes and gears of AI remain I think probably one of the limiting and there will be more and more the limiting factor within better sensors smarter so how how did that I don't know in this example are you able to say it impacted certain jobs and did you create new jobs or did it impact jobs where where people were basically being let go because they were not necessary anymore what was kind of the impact on the current people working there in the work force yeah I think you probably we haven't done that full analysis now because this plant I described are not your mainstream plans they are right now demonstration plants you know they are they are what can be done plants or big city so but I think it destroys a few jobs that we're there before the people always you know supposed to be on guard or available for for now they are less needed because we can anticipate a bit more and so that that is changed the people have to be more healed because they have to be able to use the interface you know between the advance control and the skills are better you need more skilled people a bit less people in some areas we really don't know we're II don't know the answer to that question but like you said we think it will destroy some job create some new jobs and we are just people right now another afraid because we know that we needed the plants to work better and we know that will make the plant better faster cheaper so overall for that example I think is gonna be good it's gonna have a positive impact even in terms of people in jobs now anyone have secret examples if I can add to that we to bring the debate the level of maturity in which we are so we talk about AI but many industries are still in the descriptive analytics which is having the data on time on what happened yesterday not tomorrow the data cleanness is still an issue in terms of predicting what will happen tomorrow and even transcriptase for a lot of industries keep some fiction so when you are we add proof-of-concept pilot yes I am anything you can predict you can predict in a factory where and when an accident will happen because the weak signals precision accidents always the same you can predict which parts will arrive on your manufacturing line late depending on the interaction or of course you got your suppliers and generate changes that you wrote or all over is creating some noises which ultimately create a delay you can tell which parts will arrive with a pathology you solve that so many things you can predict and do a pilot on but but 90% of a job is about training data to ultimately get the pilot which has a life shelf which is very short six cause every time you replay the feature and you need to reprogram so I mean these are two concrete examples but when we talk about AI and I really give an industry test perspective today everybody is about getting two very clever to get just descriptive analytics and getting it right and having the right master determinate rod which tomorrow will allow to bring that scale the the solution that we are talking here I went to plus one on that for Philippe in terms of data it and getting the right data setting the right requirements for the data is the data clean is the data accurate have you mitigated for the bias and the data and so I'm gonna give the counter example rather than how people are using this but if you are going to think about using HR and AI are you building it in-house do you have a diverse team if you're building it out of house if you're you know licensing a solution have you asked those companies about how they're mitigating for bias what tests they're doing how they're auditing their AI and that's really really key because they don't have a financial incentive necessarily to do the extra work but if you as the client asks for it you will and the counter example I wanted to bring up is that companies and this is a great thing companies are aware of the short fallings of AI so recently I think you probably saw IBM Amazon and Microsoft basically upended their facial recognition because they realized that it wasn't ready it was causing more harm it needed more work and we need companies to be transparent about these things where it's not working so that we can improve and make things better and you know even at berkeley you know we're seeing almost a shift the other way where some schools are using software to pick admissions Berkeley's not where we used to rely on SAT and AC T scores we're no longer going to consider those because they're a better predictor of wealth than they are of performance in school and so it's it's a really interesting time where we have to look at you know what are the proxies that we're using in AI and are those good proxies we should be questioning those gold standards are they actually doing what they're supposed to do maybe I comment on a couple of things I think in terms of job disruption I would say that you know yeah it's actually no different than any technology I think in the short term it will always disrupt some jobs you know or displace completely some jobs but in the longer term I would say that you will create other jobs as well you know I think that's that true of any technology that we invented you know throughout the course of human history I think the effect of AI may be a little more dramatic you know and some people said that you know this is like the Industrial Revolution the fourth Industrial Revolution or something like that but and the reason is because you know this this AI is it's possible pretty much everywhere you know it's like the electricity or steam engine in the you know first to Industrial Revolution in this a you know mechanical machines now they can be applied everywhere you know so so it changes the way we work very very dramatic with lots of lots of jobs are being where labor is required is the something I will count you a manufacturer all these things require human labor had been disrupted right so now when you have rather than the mechanical machine you have an intelligent machine right now a lot of these analytical jobs that require a lot of data processing right the decision making those job may be disrupted regardless of which which industry you in right so I think that that's the fear because it is so versatile right so but I would say that you know yes in the transition phase there will be some job disruption and I think this you know we have to make plans and execute strategy to how do we kind of transition in a more smooth way right rather than just have this disruption and just all get to bad you know you're the collateral damage right and we can't do that I mean so rather than so I think they're out there their tactics or strategy does the implement for example the the gain that you get the efficiency gain or the monetary gain the financial gain that you get from AI part of that should be reused to train up skill your employee so that they can move on to something else right that's a good piece I would say that you know a good use of the resource that you gain right so that you preserve the capacity to to use those your employee in a different way right to be displaced some job will no longer exist in the near future right but what did they do I mean if you don't rescale them retrain them to something else right then then that's a danger right so we so using the the monitor the game to you know to educate these people and retrain them I think it's a good strategy so I think in terms of the I would say I know overseeing a I make sure it's not doing what I supposed to do as I mentioned before this is something that's that's changing right we have to again this is also I would say a transition phase you know in this transition phase there will be a lot of black box type of AI that's not interpreted well that's very hard to it's not I would say not interpret or ease it's possible but very hard for human to make sense of it right but this is changing like as I mentioned like our team is actually developing explainable in your network you know these type of technology is starting to come up you know and they will become more and more prevalent and yeah and I think this will will change the way we look at AI you know in the sense that we now now you can actually understand that they what it's actually doing right at the high level I know in the way that we can understand right so you didn't get this job because you have this this this factor or you know you get drunk or whatever so well it's something like like like like these they'll be able to explain it right and you could decide whether what do you want it's not working right so this the second thing is that like I think one thing that's really really important in moving along this maturity curve that I mentioned this six phase maturity curve is the collection of feedback data all right so what's working what you have to know the machine has to know right not only you haven't the Machine also need to know what's actually working and what it's not working right so these outcome based feedback data need to be fed back as input to this algorithm so that they could tune themselves right and you as a we as a human right you know a supervisor will have to oversee that and see how it's actually leveraging these is a is a feedback data to to return the model so yeah go on thank you Michael very linked to what you're pointing out change management C is a key topic how do you explain change how do you secure your employees every in a large organization a global organization dislike Veolia how do you make sure that your employees are part of the game and will be part of the game for this transition we are talking about yes so there is actually a strategy what we call adoption strategy for AI and I think that's a you know the I would say that you know the sooner we move to this kind of in this transition phase right as you go from one face and X or doing this entire maturity curve of the adoption maturity curve this this entire six phase could be think of it as a big transition is one right there will always be some disruption right but once we get to that you know AI augmented economy right then things start to kind of you know I would say level itself out you know like you know one of the sci-fi maybe people just work less you know enjoy life more right and a lot of things get automated and people I would say will pursue things that they like to do not because they have to do it so people will only work on things that they they want to work on it's a little bit kind of futuristic but I think that's possible so what is this adoption strategy right so it's as if you have this adoption strategy to move along this this maturity curve faster I think it's better for everyone so the mature this one the doctrine story that I talk a lot about with the company that I work with is that this again this is a three-phase strategy one is that you never roll out this AI to the entire company we wrote it out to a small kind of pilot team okay you roll out to two and you roll out I would say almost in secret okay you don't know me knows about it right and then so because and there's many good reason for that because AI you know it's it's I would say it no deployment of any technology is ever 100% smooth and perfect right there will always be some kinks and that you have to iron now and so so you work out all those kinks and you know with this highlight Group and and the one of the important thing is the selection of this pilot group yeah so within the company there will always be people who say like no I'm not gonna deal with AI you know it's going to replace my job I'm not gonna so but they're always going to be some people who is going to be say hey you know this these are cool technology there will always be people who are I would say wanted to experiment want to try new things there there so so you select your pilot by picking the most you're almost designed for success okay it isn't one day if we all have the same point of view because this part of the world especially in Europe the social dialogue is key and I would like to have the input of Phillip and airway about how do we manage this transition which which is key in a complex environment just like ours where we definitely to have a dialogue with the trade unions with the all the players and so on yeah really put your yeah fee so now so I going go ahead go ahead you're going to find I mean the traditional elements of the playbook of transformation I you need a strong vision but people understand our line we need the change story to back it up you need to size the impact and well my view from Europe its transparency is key on that ideally I mean the right strategy of EPs kidding risk killing but that's an element of the change employability without elements of a change story which really can reassure anybody in bad change and then you develop your solution so I mean I shall approach to it and step by step it's a test and learn constantly and grow your solutions around that because I mean that there's a really a learning path on the on implementing air and what is important is constantly keeping the purse on the organization making sure they have the ability to renew for in your but but keep from the mountain because we're going to change the nature of their job and their control continuously trained with the right idea care to make sure that they can walk in this Leone gentlemen so what I'm saying you'd find it in most transformation what is going to change on on the AI is a part of the unknown in which were on Terry because the vision can be very strong but we know that on the way I the way we will develop the application could change which well is that all of the new technologies being implemented in companies yes so for us you know there's not answer is is really we don't know but I think the things are happening will be training because you are AI knowledgeable people but you can imagine that in companies the first thing is you really I okay but the first thing is a training understanding so the big groups when they will do typically they will go to consultants specialized in AI and then will these consultants they will do what you mentioned Michael which is to try to set up small examples or pilots of you know what that looks like and I think show me she'll like you it's gonna be very different in France and it is in the u.s. simply because our cultures are so different and I think we'll be challenged in our culture because we're a culture with less responsible is asian of people we are more here Yoshiko so I think that may may be an interesting twist but but you know I think what will happen is we will learn we will do a pilots like you mentioned Michael and and slowly slowly with that understand but we will have to deal with a you're right with the CSRs or with the unions and with the with the people but yeah I just like to add you know from the perspective of three skilling and retraining I think this is across the board we need to have learning organizations because there's the pace of change is not going to slow down we need to have people who are agile and able to change and this goes double for the leadership so when we talk about retraining leadership we're talking about people who know how to build psychological security and trust in teams right team-building because Michael you know if you're gonna get feedback from people as well as from this the system itself they have to feel like they can give you negative feedback right like this isn't working or here's this problem and so that idea of emotional intelligence being able to really understand what it takes to enable your workforce to be optimized to transition to understand what it takes to re-skill people and see their potential how do you do reviews and evaluations that are focused on very concrete actions for you know here's a potential career path for you here's a next step here's the area where you could build your skills and then you would be qualified for this job so again there are really positive opportunities for AI to inform and kind of give people more more opportunities to advance in their career but that's gonna rely on having a pretty you know competent leadership team that understands and sees the potential in their employees and knows how to transition how to do change management how to work with people to make this learning environment part of how the company does business react a bit Jill to this topic I recall what you say that the beginning of this discussion all of us are not equal where is the transformation phase we are facing so how do we address this topic you mentioned at the beginning we are but equal at the same time you want Z ok and to take everybody on board for the next move yeah actually maybe even with the concrete example of a question that that pointed out the extreme case of people that might have handicaps and and it's that that really is a strong example on top of the examples you gave that were hard like hit hard by the covert situation and if the general idea is we move more into digitalization it's an extreme example of potentially people being left behind right so it's going to require intentionality right we actually have to be looking in more places you can't rely on refer you can't rely on your the channels of hiring that you've used before and so when we talk about intentionality it's across the board understanding how we write job descriptions I saw there was another question in the chat about what tools are out there right to make more equitable hiring so there's a company called tech Co that will actually look at your job descriptions for gendered language or you can look at them just for yourself and see what are extraneous requirements that aren't actually part of the job that's just sort of a copy and paste from another job there are lots of things we can do to be more intentional about the recruiting phase and then for the advancement phase as I was kind of alluding to earlier it's about removing the gray areas where unconscious bias can creep in it's about being intentional about the evaluation structure so what are your actual responsibilities and what is constructive feedback on how to improve for those specific skills or if you want to go into another field or re retrain what skills that you need and traditionally women of and especially women of color will get less constructive advice they'll get subjective personality feedback and so this is where we talk about making systemic changes so we get better leadership but then we have to make our systems align the rewards and advancement with those so if we really do care about having effective communication collaboration critical thinking problem-solving skills then that has to be part of the evaluation that we look at not just how many widgets did you sell and so I think there's a lot of things that we can do structurally around the systems of HR to make the systems more fair and just equitable and then you know coming back to the AI I think there's a lot to think about in terms of making sure that the technologies that we develop the technologies that we employ work equally for everyone so I think those are key factors and you know there is opportunity for avoiding some of the biases that are out there in terms of you know when people look at resumes they look at the college you went to and they look for the big name so they they know certain areas that people are from these are all forms of hidden unconscious bias so I think we have an opportunity to anonymize and show people with the skills that they have there's actually a number of tools that will allow you to do testing right computer skills testing or different things like that where are the people evaluating don't know the gender or ethnicity of the person applying for the position so it's exciting right because there are a lot of efforts being made in this way and we just need to make sure that we're auditing and checking to make sure they work work as intended I wanted to we're slowly coming up on time I wanted to summarize I think a few of the questions from the audience that resonate with what you were just describing it seems to me and one of the overarching topics that we have been discussing through this was this differentiation between effectiveness and efficiency and the effectiveness has like an effective organization has more of the human component is more focused on the humans and has the key advantage of being more resilient there is still this efficiency perspective to it and so the question is given potentially how to say geographical limitations that are imposed on organizations through policy in Europe versus United States or even other countries in the world wouldn't you say that there is a risk of an economic divide not just between companies that are more or less automated but also start an economic divide with economic economies where you can just like fall on out go for efficiency so you could imagine a company that just goes like we're going to lay off everyone replace with AI and we're gonna lay off the other people as well if they are not already trained with AI or data technology and just hire new people that are trained in data and we're going fully on efficiency and we will therefore be the most cost effective company versus other companies that say no we go for effectiveness resiliency and we stick with the human factor what do you how would you react to those two scenarios I think it's always the truth will you be sorry good makeup yeah I was just gonna say I personally don't think it has to be either way right I mean I think companies and have we've been training to optimize certain things right but I think we'll be very good at optimizing but we are we do it I would say a pretty bad job at balancing okay so I think what is balance they mean balancing it really means that you know you don't just optimize for a handful like four or five or ten different metrics what are you simultaneously optimized for I would say hundreds or maybe potentially thousands of different metrics right and that's very very hard right I think that that's not easy I mean I think that's a mental shift right rather than you know optimizing for words with just a few things right you need to balance among all these different constraints right I mean one of the reason I think we get into get ourselves in this situation of highly interdependence in this that this supply chain it is because companies are optimizing for cost saving right for profit right so if but what about if you actually look at other things that we can optimize for example environment for impact and others that you may not actually choose to do a certain business or a certain region because they don't have a strict enough environmental protection one with the law or or labor protection right so these are other there are many many other dimensions that you need to optimize and which means requires you you need to really balance money nothing it's very interesting and very complex a point you know be very important effectiveness work in our case we have a CEO who is always mentioning you guys all that the reason for being reason for me just saying that we are not only there to make money you know now it's a it's a communication it's a company structure no but I think there is something in it and I think because the human element could change I mean company then what a ima do it will unable individual people to do things where if companies are only looking at effectiveness they will lose some of these people the opposite if they are looking at efficiency they will lose the people with a broader and you have known more young people with very broad thing who say we have fantastic people joining our industry which were not joining at 350 years ago simply because they say we want to work on green things and these people may not accept companies you know that are only looking at efficiency you may lose some of your best people so it's it's a complex thing yeah yeah I would just add to that I mentioned earlier 75 percent of the employees are Millennials and Millennials care about sustainability right they care about equitable participation right these are things if you want to recruit the top talent you're going to need to address but it's not just coming from the bottom up it's coming from the top down I just posted in the chat you know the Business Roundtable redefined what it meant to be a successful company that it you know it's not just the stakeholders it's multiple stakeholders and what do you play in the community and so this larger idea of you know what was originally like the B corporation the for benefit corporation the triple bottom-line like these things are coming back in a form that makes it part of how you do business yeah well thank you very much I'm seeing that we're coming up on time maybe just from each one of you like a parting comment to the question what would you suggest to each one of our listeners what can they do so that they can make sure they didn't waste the opportunity of this crisis from your perspective I'll jump in since I just was talking I think this is our big opportunity to co-create a new normal the idea of going back to the way things were is just not going to happen these changes to the point of Filipe and Michael were already afoot right they were already happening sustainability is becoming a more critical issue as Herve said you know these are things that are not going to go back to there is no going back so that means we need to think very intentionally and consciously what it mean to create a new normal that is more equitable that is more inclusive that is more sustainable that is more efficient right like all of these come around to this issue of AI because efficiency and sustainability can be fueled by these these different technologies so let's go create a new normal well I'll talk on the same way it's really the moment to reins and shall carry a puff reins and the workplace even rings on society but where we are we all realize how although we've been on good ways and bad ways under it so unique opportunities to to make a shift in my life the human element is so important it will always be there so even if we are messed up whatever comes will be messed up I mean at the end of the day for me it's education so the only thing I would say educate yourself about AI because AI is going to be very important and educate your children and as a society make sure that this education is gonna be equal because if things are not equal you know again so it could be anything things are not gonna work you know if access to AI is gonna be limited to a few people if then it's gonna be tough again I would say that you know way to not waste this opportunity is it's just trying to try something new I mean I always just say that you know like I think a lot of people are afraid to try new things because it impacts the the top line the bottom line right I think this but the top line bottom line is disrupted anyway right now so you might as well try something right and to make a you know create a new normal create a better normal right thank you very much thank you all to all our speakers I will let John Michell for make the closing remarks I'm just very pleased about the discussion we just had because we all know that it's a very complex situation we are facing and that we need to have amazingly new prepared managers photo for the future they need to be techies any travel region they need to be sustainable they need to be leaders and thoughtful and so on so that's why it's always very interesting to be part of this type of discussion making the links between California and Europe because we share the same concerns and we have the same if we are facing molly's the same issues and we are still looking for how to do we mix our next move so this is the aim of this type of panel this type of discussion we cooperate and we are very pleased to have this cooperation with Berkeley extension and come under on the European side and we look forward for for for the next session I definitely want to thank the preparation team I want to thank of course our panelists because they you brought your different perspective and I guess we are very pleased about this discussion and of course I want to send the audience something like 400 people were attending this session this is just great and and I hope that we will have a very fascinating session in the near future so we will communicate very quickly and very briefly about the next panel but thank you for your time and thank you for participating to this to this session so bye-bye from Paris and and good day in California isn't it take good care thank you all your and take good care bye-bye
