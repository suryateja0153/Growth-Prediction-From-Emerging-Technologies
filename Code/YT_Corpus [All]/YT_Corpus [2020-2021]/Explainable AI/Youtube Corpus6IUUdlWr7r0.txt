 while trying to build a high performance model you will have spent considerable time feature engineering trying different algorithms and tuning hyperparameters now that your overall model's performance metrics look good are you finished before pushing that model into production you might want to first investigate whether the model performs identically across different subpopulations if the model is better at predicting outcomes for one group over another it can lead to biased outcomes and unintended consequences when it is put into production to be aware of this you can use the subpopulation analysis to check the fairness of a model across various subgroups of interest let's see how it can be done in dss back in the model report is a tab for subpopulation analysis in the same way you would do for a partial dependence plot you need to choose one variable for which to compute the analysis both categorical and numeric variables can be used to define subpopulations in this case let's choose race when the computation is finished we find a table of metrics in the first column we find all of the unique values or modalities in the data set if we had chosen a numeric variable instead of a categorical one we would find the distribution divided into bins the blue bars represent the percentage of values belonging to that category clicking on a specific subpopulation reveals that group's density chart and confusion matrix for a classification task the table makes it easy to compare the overall performance of the model to the performance for each subgroup across various metrics you can add more metrics to the default list for the two largest subgroups in this case common metrics like rock auc accuracy precision and recall appear to be quite close there is no magic button however that can decide whether your model is fair it is ultimately up to you to decide what degree of difference between subgroups is meaningful for your use case and how you want to address these differences now we have one last test for explainable ai to show you in the next [Music] lesson
