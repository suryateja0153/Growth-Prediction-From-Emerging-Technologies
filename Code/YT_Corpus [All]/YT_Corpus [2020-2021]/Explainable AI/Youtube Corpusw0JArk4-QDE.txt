 What if you had the power to stop a disaster before it strikes? What if you could see into the future... see where the next disaster might strike, so you can make the right decisions at the right time to avoid it? Wouldn’t you kinda feel like a superhero? Introducing GAIA from Minerva Intelligence. GAIA is Minerva’s cognitive-AI natural hazard mapping and management system that makes up-to-date hazard evaluation a whole lot easier. At the heart of GAIA is our cognitive artificial intelligence engine. This state-of-the-art technology combines machine intelligence with human intelligence to reach conclusions faster than possible with humans alone, while providing the explanations in plain language that users need to trust the results. GAIA provides dynamic, transparent hazard assessments via a user- friendly web app, and is updated on a daily basis to take into account weather and landscape changes, so you can easily visualize the location of potential landslides or floods. Here’s how it works: this map shows areas that are susceptible to soil slides. When you click on one of the areas, you can investigate why it’s been flagged as dangerous. You can visualize the potential landslide impact, then get full explanations of what you’re seeing in plain language, so you can verify the results for yourself. With your maps now updated and auditable around the clock, you can easily monitor and manage potential hazards... even multiple hazards are no problem for GAIA’s Cognitive AI system! You can easily integrate as many datasets as you like to investigate potential landslides or floods in near-real time, and get comprehensive, auditable results. GAIA can help you see into the future to prepare for and react to disasters before they happen, potentially saving countless lives and untold millions. Kind of like a superhero, right? GAIA.
