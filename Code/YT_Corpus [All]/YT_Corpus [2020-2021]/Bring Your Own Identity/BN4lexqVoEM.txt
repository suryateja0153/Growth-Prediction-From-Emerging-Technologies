 until nakisha not a Lacroix the body sugah feeling with ticket to jail he we met ELISA who me way to join in flamenco mafia today on the podcast what language teaches us about identity can you be more recent but yet not speak the recent creole language can you be Latino but not be fluent in in Spanish can you be a fan American butts it's not be fully fluent in so called black English welcome to choc radio a podcast about inspired teaching at MIT I'm your host Sarah Hansen from MIT OpenCourseWare my guest for this episode created a course that teaches students about how language helps us see and better understand our world Michele de Graaff teaches the course Creole languages and Caribbean identities the course highlights how linguistics can teach us about broader issues of identity history education and more throughout this episode will be intercutting professor degraaf's answers with his creole translations for now we'll let him explain more about how he developed this unique course with schmancy su developme Avex research is about trying to understand how languages evolve over time and what happens when new languages are created say for example the Caribbean in magnitude Haiti where Haitian Creole emerged in the seventeen eighteenth century so we try to understand the patterns of development of the things that we call Creole languages and in terms of a structure but also of an applied sight my work where I try to understand how best to use say Haitian Creole and other local languages in education and how that's crucial for developments of countries like Haiti so the course started out of a desire to try to have increased accessible to a broader range of students and within which we could connect languages to a lot of issues of culture and identity and as I'm from Haiti and as my research is unclear languages I try to think of ways in which we can use the history of Creole languages 2002 issue is connected to linguistics identity history sociology education even though the course focuses on Caribbean identities and Creole languages the course requires its students who come from all over the world to observe what language means for their own identities sits in wing a bolero fit can you be more recent but yet not speak the recent creole language can you be latino that might be fluent in in Spanish can you be an American but yet not be fully fluent in so called black English so those were questions that they themselves brought in then what I asked him to do as the very first exercise was to write what I call the linguistic biography and actually and I get this hand from a dear friend and colleague professor and Sarah C Hadley and charity actually shared with me her own lingzi biography and when I read that their eyes how powerful it was to read about her own growing up in terms of language ethnicity race so I thought that I would ask to this or something similar the connection between language and power is highlighted in this course a lot of what comes through in students language biographies and other assignments touches on power structures and the hierarchies that exist because of cultural misconceptions tied to language and also race I asked professor de Graaff if students brought misconceptions about Creole languages to the course and how he unpacked them HSL you come and see quoi as I can see the vision so one way that we start unpacking these misconceptions is by comparing attitudes towards languages with attitudes towards race and ethnicity and as they get what we get to see very quickly is that in fact there is perhaps as much misconceptions about language as it is about race so they get to see very early in the course that language can be used as a proxy for race so now it's impolite to say certain things about say black people or Asian people yet it's still polite to say pretty negative things about language and then and then at that point what we do want reduce some basic linguistic analysis tools for them to be able to see that in terms of musics structure there is nothing at all that's inferior about Creole languages in fact what we do from the very beginning is to show that structurally they are patterns both in the syntax or mythology of calamities that are quite similar to patterns in the syntax and history of of English or French of Mandarin Chinese so the equivocal isn't that empirically and theoretically one cannot argue that qo languages are anyway less than non calamities the same way that there are no biological measures that would deem black people to be inferior to white people so they get very tender Stan the power of this means that often they themselves have brought along in terms of how to view different languages in some case communities and other kids just even dialects of English there is southern English or black English their attitude that are very demeaning towards those varieties that have no basis in science that are rooted in hierarchies of power and they get to see that very quickly this course the covet is discussions and and in order for the course to be successful we have to be able to discuss very delicate personal issues in a very safe way and to be honest it cannot be that students are afraid to reveal the positions and various topics including race language identity and one way to do it is to given that I had at the very beginning of the course I had the questionnaires about where they came from I mean which is they spoke where they grew up I was able to to use that to trigger discussions you know so if we really talks about authenticity for example if an African can you be an authentic writer if you write in English example then I knew that some of the students I dealt with this issue for example where a student who although she was black and Hispanic she wasn't very fluent in Spanish and and she wasn't clear whether her not being fluent in Spanish neither any less Hispanic you see so I was able to use that in order to trigger a discussion around this notion of grand red in this famous debate between Chinua Achebe and googy what jungle about African writers can I write to be authentically African if they write in English or French for that matter so that that was one way to trigger rich discussion so the motive there was rich discussions are best arrived at if they came from a personal basis where students are are invested in trying to find an answer that can work for them in the in the personal lives or in the lives of the families the community is the country is etcetera another special feature of Professor degraaf's course on OCW is that his instructor insights are available in both English and Haitian Creole I asked him why it was important that he share in both languages how the course was taught for me is to be made for time so it was very healthy crucial for me to do this interview in both English and Creole because I see Creole languages back even in the case of Haiti especially because of Haiti as a particular revealing and clear test tube or history to really show how language can be such a powerful tool either for lumination or for its instance either for oppression or for development so I I would love teachers we look at the course to see how they can adapt the content in order to address similar issues in the own community because I think that what you see happening in the case of colleges also happens in in the u.s. appengine in in Europe in America in Africa where language is often used as this technology for domination or resistance and I think this course gives the some basic analytical tools to be able to analyze these patterns and and for me it's also very important that teachers in Haiti and soon as in Haiti including say you know future leaders or policy makers get to understand the discourse and the readings and to understand that that Haiti could do so much better if teachers students leaders had this awareness of how the old attitudes towards Creole versus French have played over centuries in keeping the country in the developed and if they could get a better sense of the importance of language in education development then I think the country would do so much better and for me it's a it's a key bottleneck that we have to go pass in order to really be able to develop a nation is to be is to be able to and understand the history and the nature of your national your ancestral language and to be able to use it in the most systematic and productive way if you cannot do that there is no way that you can develop a whole nation that speak that language while the students get to understand at the end of the course is that we all hold dear certain attitudes about language and so everybody choose are positive for us doesn't for others but oftentimes and this is actually one of the major issues that we discuss throughout the course is that sometimes we have attitudes that have a negative impact severe negative impact on the lives of other people the lives of sometimes entire communities and nations so I hope throughout that students can actually take the theory Dallas's in the and series in which they can apply it to themselves to the communities to the countries so some in the course of this class I've applied what they've learned and taken it outside including volunteering in say the usual English program that just started in in Boston is a Jewish program promoting the use of both in Creole in English and where students are immersed from kindergarten in both Korean and English and now there's a student go to that class myclass amis volunteering in that classroom for kindergarteners who are learning in Creole and in English and to me that's a person as a dream because it's one case where what she learned in the course can be directly applied in in the real world context where she can make actual positive change in the lives of these children [Music] professor de Graaff shares additional thoughts on teaching Creole languages and Caribbean identities within the instructor insight section of his OCW course you can find these dual language videos along with his openly licensed teaching materials at ocw.mit.edu and if you use these materials in your own teaching we'd love to hear about it use the contact link in the show notes to share your story until next time I'm
