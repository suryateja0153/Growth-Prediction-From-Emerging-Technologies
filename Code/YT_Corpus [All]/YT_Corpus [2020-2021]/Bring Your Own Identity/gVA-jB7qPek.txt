 this video I'm gonna show you the three step process to shifting your identity which is controlling your life situations and how that will then transform your life so in this video I'm gonna show you exactly how to do that welcome back to another video my name's Erin and I owe people expand their consciousness now in this video I'm gonna be sharing with you the three-step process one two three to be a better version of you now a better version of you implies that you're not already whole and complete already but this has to do with understanding our identity our self-image who we think we are and how who we think we are the way that we see ourselves is then projected out based on our vibration which our vibration is a combination I like how that rhymes of how we think feel and act think feel and act that is going to determine and that especially in regards to how we see ourselves is projected out to other people other people pick up on those cues and then respond to that energy we are putting out so if we are in a position of believing that things always happen to us that people are always mean to us we think feel and act that way our body language maybe even has shown a certain way to where we are depicting that subconsciously other people pick up on that energy and then respond to what's depending on that so if you want to change the way other people perceive of you you must first off change your self-image part of that could be understanding the identity or a summary of that would be the identity and the way that you see yourself because that is the way people are responding to you and everything in your life is a reflection of the way you see yourself if you see yourself as able to only make fifty thousand dollars a year I use this analogy a lot then you are going to be thinking equal to making fifty thousand dollars a year you're going to feel like you deserve only fifty thousand dollars a year and your actions will also link up with maybe fifteen thousand $50,000 a year you will accept a job that pays $50,000 a year even if you had a sales commission job and you believed and you thought I'm gonna make a hundred thousand dollars this year what would happen is if you didn't change your self-image you would somehow sabotage yourself or find yourself coming up two blocks that keep you from attaining that now the reason being is our self-image is like a cybernetic mechanism I have a thermometer on that wall right over there so 276 degrees it looks just like this and anything that happens the door opens it heats up it cools down the a/c kicks on because the thermometer is a cybernetic mechanism your body your self-image is a cybernetic mechanism the reason many people are trying to attract things they say I want to make $100,000 a year but their self-image says I can only make $50,000 a year that's why it doesn't happen because the identity the self-image the ego will do everything you can to remain consistent to the way that you define yourself so that one more time your ego will do everything within its power to remain consistent to the way that you define yourself now these filters sometimes come off you ever see someone it's a very shy person but then they drink alcohol and all those sudden they're really loud that filter went off the filter of the identity of them saying I am a shy person I am quiet I don't speak out of turn that goes away and then they're more they're more able to express themselves now I'm not claiming that alcohol is the way out definitely is not but what I'm saying is these filters are interchangeable how we think feel and act will change depending on how we feel in the the kind of state that we're in but in this video I'm gonna show you three steps to becoming more aware of this because when you change these three steps your whole entire life will begin to change you see one of the reasons the Epiphany I had the other day was I was making a podcast episode and I was on self image understanding that when we change our self image we then transform our life and I had this epiphany the epiphany was most people that go through what is called the spiritual awakening have such a profound change in their life because they at the core are becoming aware of their old ego their old identity and by becoming aware of it it changes their self-image now when you change your self image you change your life instead of seeing yourself as a a 3d physical human that's all that I am I'm a human having a human experience spiritual awakening says I'm a spiritual being having a temporary human experience it changes the identity and therefore everything on the outside begins to change according to that so that's why the self image is the key to changing your entire life and in this video I'm gonna share that with you now the first step has to do with simply awareness and letting go now the reason this is is 90% of people and almost 100% of people aren't even aware of their self image if you ask them maybe they can come up with something but people are not aware of their vision for who they are they're not aware of the way they see themselves and they're not aware of the story they've been telling themselves about who they are you see we go through life we have these little experiences something happens somebody calls you a name your parents treat you a certain way we then internalize those meanings and think that this is who I am I'm not worthy because this happened or this person I was embarrassed in front of class I'm an awkward person we in the past gave situations meaning that then were kept on autopilot running themselves over and over and over again and we haven't become aware of it so therefore we think feel and act consistent over and over and over again depending on that level of identity and the meanings we gave things in the past so even if somebody told you maybe you say well I didn't give it that meaning my dad gave me that meaning my mom gave me that mean you know this person this ex-boyfriend a girlfriend gave me that meaning you had to agree to it at a certain point and when you agree to it you internalized it now if you haven't seen or listened to that podcast episode yet I'm gonna go and link it in the top of the description box below it's one of the most powerful probably pieces of content I made get into it it's about 40 minutes long you can list to a lawyer at the gym you let's do it while you're driving whenever you want but if you haven't subscribed to the podcast yet already I do new episodes every Tuesday and Friday and they're all specific podcast episodes so check that out if you haven't already and in general what I am mentioning is the power of understanding these agreements we've made in the past about who we are now I had a certain identity like when I look to my own life my own life everything in my life that has transformed has been because I've had an identity shift an identity shift it's this process that I call identity shifting understanding how we shift our identity from one way seeing ourself in one way had seen it in a different way so one way we have a certain story we tell ourselves about who we are I'm able to make $50,000 a year then you say oh I would make $100,000 a year but we must first talk to his become aware of the story that we're telling herself that is keeping our reality on autopilot and then once we become aware of it what we can eventually do is observe it and see that it is a false sense of identity it's an illusion it's an illusion it's something that we internalize but it doesn't necessarily have to be true all of these stories and beliefs that we tell ourselves we're going to use for a certain period of time but eventually we give them all away because we are actually infinite spiritual beings have a temporary human experiences even the version of you that's gonna me I'm making $100,000 a year eventually you're gonna move beyond that and that will be your version now of this version like that's the old version of me I know now I can make 200 thousand dollars a year you see the analogy here so you have to first stop become aware of what the story is that you're telling yourself and you have to take complete utter responsibility for it even if someone did it to you you know I had a a painful past growing up but that led me to waking up that let I changed my story you changed the meaning of the story you give yourself people knocked you down rejected you the first girl you ever asked out rejected you what did you do with that story change the story don't tell yourself a lie like oh that girl really knows no instead see it as a new meaning that happens that I could love myself more now I feel more loving of myself that job that you got that the people that fired you from that job that boss that fired you it wasn't a job you really cared about you changed the meaning you're like now I can find a job I really am cute I am passionate about change the meaning that you give these core things what you notice is that there's like I'd say five or ten main things that happen in your past memories that developed your story and your identity and when you become aware of those you could then change the meanings simply by being aware of it you become aware of it you can then change the meaning it's just that was unaware so you were experiencing it over and over and over again and your reality was a reflection of how you think feel and act now the next step is actually really simple normally we're going to tell ourselves a story well now we go from fifty thousand one hundred thousand I got to do all these things I got to make it really hard make it very resistant the key is to just be give yourself permission to be this version of you to find other people that are that way that are making that kind of money to be in their energy field to give yourself permission to be the kind of person that is this version of you what are the habits of that version of you what are the actions of that version of you how does that version of you walk how does that version of you talk pay attention use your imagination to bridge these two realities and simply give yourself permission to be this version of you and when you give yourself permission to be this version of you what will end up happening is you start to wire in that vibrational resonance and it becomes more of who you are and then what will happen is other people outside of you will begin to then respond to you depending on that way that you are showing up in the world so if you want other people to view you as more confident you must first off be confident with yourself if you want other people to help you to love you more you must first love yourself and even love other people you can people only perceive you that which you are embodying now the thing that I encourage you to look at is how you are being understand the the level of identity he you do things because it's who you are you see the difference of that so for example huge shift for me was I used to see myself as working a nine-to-five job that I hated I said you know what I'm just gonna be a full-time youtuber before I even have the outer reflection of being a full-time youtuber I made video every single day I made a video every single day for a month for since that was it's been almost three years but initially that's what I did and I wasn't making a daily video so I could get more YouTube subscribers so that I could leave my job I was making a daily video because I was being who I really am I identified it I used my imagination I was able to wire it in and then by being that version of me I was able to then embody it and then eventually my outer reality reflected it but I first off had to be in that vibration I had to understand that that's who I am not doing it most people do things because it gets them somewhere else the key is to do things for the sake of doing it because it's at the level of who you are it's at your vibrational core my vibrational core is expressing these videos I get into such a flow state that it's very easy for me to do this if you'll say how do you do videos every single day well it's Who I am I don't know how to explain it when you get to the level of being when you create from the beam level it's more much more powerful to creating from the the doing level being it's like being present to the moment enjoying the process doing what you're passionate about that will put you in the beam state so what you do is you focus on the identity of that version of you and you focus on wired it in and then this third step is simply this repetition get those reps in the more consistent you do it the easier it becomes the more consistently you do this the more you wire in this new identity this identity has simply had a repetition of affirmations a repetition of thinking a repetition of feeling a repetition of acting that has kept that identity and lock it is the path of least resistance neurons in the brain that fire together wire together you have fired the neurons in the brain that say I am this type of person I feel this way and I act this way over over and over again and what you must simply do is make the choice to be this version of you with repetition stop telling yourself a story that it has to be forever has to take forever it doesn't have to it can be as simple as you make it and the key is just giving yourself permission to be that version of you if you be act feel as that version of you eventually your outer reality will be in a change but the key to this the caveat is you cannot need the outer reality to change first before you really give yourself permission to be it if you say oh I have to do I have to paint every single day then have an art gallery studio then I can be an artist then you're going about it backwards you are the artist and because you are the artist you naturally think feel and act similar to being an artist I did that with YouTube I think felt and acted as a youtuber knowing that's who I am and then eventually the outer reality change and people started to subscribe to the channel and now it's grown to where it is so just to recap this become aware of your old identity the old story you tell yourself it's an illusion this is also an illusion by the way but this version of you with that story you tell yourself with the way that you show up in the world become aware of that self image and then what you do is you're aware of it you decide to let it go it served you it served you to this point to where you now watch this video and you're aware of your self image it served you change the meaning of those core experiences in the past parents divorced you thought you were worthy parents divorced that you could have two different birthday presents okay change the meaning you gave things you you give the negative meaning my parents divorced it means I'm not worthy I probably caused it that's what we give it as a kid but it's said you realize you could change the meaning of it your parents divorced so you could have two birthdays okay you don't just have one birthday over here you got this birthday over here so it's all the way that you look at it if you change these meanings you didn't change the emotional response that you have for it that's keeping you within a certain bandwidth of information with the reality that is equal to how you think feel and act start to give yourself permission to feel worthy and know that the more you do that the more you change these old meanings is the more you change your life so then be that version of you give yourself permission to be in the vibration of how you prefer to be understand you do things because it's who you are not because it gets you anywhere else I simply wired in and was a full-time youtuber before I was a full-time youtuber and now I'm getting ready to go to the next level where I'm gonna start doing live events and be in front of large numbers or people in person rather than just online well guess what I'm gonna be doing the same thing but it be being that version of me wiring it in knowing that my outer reality will eventually begin to reflect that and then a repetition wire it in powerful way to wire it in is to do it in the 24 hours you have in a day do something every single day that wires it in for me that's making a video a day for you that could be writing it could be doing a podcast every day it could be you doing something or passion about every single day 24 hours also I have techniques I shared more in that podcast episode if you want to learn more about the repetition side of it that's in the top of the scription box that'll show you how to before you go to bed there's different ways of repetition wiring this in this level of identity nonetheless these is out of all the content I teach on YouTube I believe that this is the most powerful information that I share and if you learn this then your life will change is that simple so as to identity shifting to understanding who you are a higher level I mean you're you're an infinite spiritual being but you can play small you can play big I'll show you how to play big and that's what you learned in this video so do this apply this and watch how your life begins to change also if you haven't already hit the notification bell it's the only way you see daily youtube vids that I do I got a lot more good stuff like this coming I'm excited to
