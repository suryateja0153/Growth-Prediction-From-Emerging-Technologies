 hello my name is Jeff ModzelewskiI use he/him/his pronouns and I work as the engagement manager for the diversity center of Northeast Ohio I'd like to thank you for viewing this video today on exploring identity I hope in the course of this short video that you'll gain a better understanding of identity and how individual identities affected your day-to-day life and the day-to-day lives of those around you let's start off by talking very quickly about the history of the diversity center of Northeast Ohio we were formed in 1927 as the National Conference for Christians and Jews we're now a member of the National Federation of just communities which has chapters all across the United States organizationally our mission is to eliminate bias bigotry and racism and we're committed to creating communities where everybody is connected respected and valued well I quickly want to talk about the concepts of diversity and inclusion before we move into this activity on identity what we like to say is that diversity happens but inclusion is a conscious choice and I think it's helpful to define these terms really quickly with diversity what we mean is just showing a great deal of variety or difference in a group of things diversity always happens in a group you can't have diversity in one individual it's difference among a variety of things think about a box of crayons all of those different colors show diversity in that box of crayons now diversity and inclusion are often considered very similar concepts but there is some pretty key differences diversity is something that's always going to happen because it's just about having difference among a group inclusion is the intentional and ongoing engagement with diversity so inclusion means engaging in that difference understanding and working within that difference one analogy that I like to say is that diversity is being invited to the party where as inclusion means being asked to dance diversity just means being in the room inclusion means being included in the decision-making in the ongoing work within the diversity that happens in a group so when we talk about diversity and moving into this concept of identity we often start with this diversity wheel and this shows a variety a different identities that individuals can have or individuals can feel a part of you'll see there's a whole lot of different levels of this in the inner circle we have what are often considered the major identity markers age gender race sexual orientation religion spirituality or non religion ability nationality socioeconomic status and ethnicity when people think about identity or think about diversity they often think about these concepts first and where they fall in these different categories obviously for many people many of these categories are very important in their day to day life and how they identify at the diversity center we take a very broad definition of diversity what we mean by that is that we don't just look at those inner ring concepts we're also looking at that middle ring things like diversity and thought geographic location emotional intelligence  military experience or veteran status family structure parental status all of these things can be very influential on how a person identifies and they can really impact our day to day lives sometimes more so than some of those inner ring identities so I like to show that there's a lot of different pieces to identity beyond those inner ring identities that we have in that outer ring we have workplace identities obviously for many people their workplace is critical in how they live their life and these different identities on the outside can really have an impact on how they work in day to day life so things like what your job title is your seniority in an  organization what location you're at for larger workplaces we know that different locations often have different personalities or get different amounts of or different types of respect or different resources so your workplace location can be very important are you a member of a union or not a member of the union for some workplaces obviously that's very important as well are you a part of management or not part of management so all of this just shows the broad range of different identities that fall under this concept of diversity and different ways that we as individuals can identify now we use this concept to create individual diversity wheels I'm going to show you my individual diversity wheel which is going to show some ways some of the key identities that I hold so when we're talking about identity we're talking about an individual's affiliation or identification with a particular group and this identity wheel show some of my key identities and the groups that I identify with that affect me on a day-to-day basis now you'll notice that many of these slices are varied in size the larger ones for the ones that I think about more off are the ones that have the greater impact on my day to day life so some of my larger slices are the fact that I'm a parent I consider my family my children with almost every decision I make and it's something that impacts me every single day on an ongoing regular basis my second biggest slice is the fact that I'm a man and there's a couple of reasons that I consider that such a large slice the first being is the group that I work with the team that I work with is up until recently was made up of all women other than myself so it's something that I have to consider when working with women that I'm not in the majority in terms of gender and that's something that I have to be aware of on a regular basis also I work talking about diversity and inclusion so I know that when I walk into a room the fact that I'm a man and you'll also see in there that you know a smaller slice of my pie is that I'm white the fact that I'm a white man has an impact and how I walk into a room and how people view me particularly when I'm going to talk about concepts like gender or race or sexual orientation or these different identities another slice of my pie that's a little bit larger the fact that I'm on the generation x millenial cusp I was born in 1979 I just turned 40 so the fact that I don't quite fit into the Gen X but I don't quite fit into the Millennial Generation is something that does have an impact on me on a regular basis and it is something that I think about I'm going to take a couple moments here and let some of my colleagues talk about their identity wheels and a couple of things that impact them in the regular basis hi my name is Caitlin and I want to share my identity wheel with you today so the two largest slices on my pie as you can see are being young being a millennial and being a woman and these are two pretty large slice slices of my pie and I know that because when I go and stand in front of audiences and talk about diversity and equity and inclusion I recognize that a lot of times the first things that people notice about me the fact that I'm young and that I'm a woman  first thing you see and that can sometimes lead to stereotypes or people just kind of automatically assuming what my intelligence or experience or research ability is and so that's one way in which these two identities are pretty large and pretty important for me especially in the work that I do so one example that I have of one time when these became very apparent to me was when I was with my colleague Jeff who you know you can't see from the video but he's about 6' 4" white man and we were going to a client's office to do a workshop together and so we were walking to this office and I had met this client before and spoken to them before over the phone and Jeff had never met them before and so we were walking into the office and I was walking in first and I had my roller bag with me and Jeff is walking in behind me and the CEO president came to meet us at the front door and I remember very distinctly the CEO president reaching his hand across my face in front of my head to reach Jeff's hand to shake first instead of mine he must have assuming that Jeff was there to lead the meeting or that he was the senior person when in fact I was there to lead the workshop and I was a senior person so that is one way that these two identities definitely play a role in my experiences in day-to-day life hello my name is KJ and at the diversity center I am a diversity equity and inclusion consultant for higher education and young adults I would like to share with you the way that my identities have impacted my life both personally and professionally I completed this activity for the first time about five years ago and it had changed over the years what I love most about this activity is that it allows for reflection on the way that identities can hold different meanings for different people and this can change over time the educator portion is a fairly recent addition to my identity wheel as I have grown in my commitment to sharing and receiving knowledge I hold this commitment in my personal life and education and also in my professional life as a consultant English is the only language that I speak as of  right now I am learning American Sign Language and one day I'll be able to add that to my fluency so identity can change and adapt over time dependent on new experiences or changes that may take place in your life I have been heard of hearing birth at the age of four I was fitted for my first pair of hearing aids and then I went on to attend speech therapy for over nine years and today I read lips for the majority of my communication so in my personal life this has really fostered my love and preference for reading I use closed captions and subtitles and I prefer to read the transcript rather than listen to an audio recording so all of these things impact my professional life and the choices that I make the audience engagement  when facilitated workshops being hard of hearing and being a black person are two pieces of my identity that impact me the most personally and professionally they both have influence on the decisions that I make the way that people perceive me and the way that I perceive the world so over many years of delivering programs and workshops to a variety of higher industry professionals I have consistently noticed that I'm often one of very few black people in the room so my understanding of my family's history and the history of the United States is really shaped through what I have learned in my experience and in my education so there are some parts of my identity that you wouldn't be able to tell just by looking at me or even just by having a short conversation with me other parts of my identity you might be able to identify them more easily but this still may not give you the entire story of how I understand or present myself so I encourage you to really keep that in mind as you reflect on and complete your own identity wheel thank you so I hope you found that interesting hearing from some of my colleagues that have different identities about their own identities and how their identities impact them what I'm going to ask you to do now is to take a few minutes and create your own identity wheel it's very simple you draw a circle and make yourself a little pie chart with including the identities that you feel most impact you on a day-to-day basis making the ones that have the biggest impact on you larger and the ones that maybe don't have quite as much of an impact on your day-to-day life smaller you can use any of these identities that are included here you can also use other identities if there are certain ways that you identify or certain things that you hold closely that you want to include on your identity wheel while you're getting started I do want to share a little bit about my experience in creating this when I first did my identity wheel I struggled putting it together I realized that I didn't think about my identities very often as you see again on my identity wheel I am a white heterosexual able-bodied male a lot of the identities that I sold are what would be considered privileged identities they're not identities that are going to negatively impact me on a day-to-day basis or make my life more difficult on a regular basis because of that I hadn't done much thought about my own identities when it came time for me to make this wheel I realized that it was just something I didn't think about very often and it's something that I'm privileged that I don't have to think about very off and because of the identities I hold I'm saying that because if you're struggling with this activity with this idea of making your own identity wheel I want to let you know that's very natural and very understandable I still would like you to take a couple of minutes and create your own identity wheel based on the identities that you hold and you can pause the video if you'd like and take a couple of minutes to do that so I hope you found that activity worthwhile and that you learned a little bit about yourself in thinking about your own individual identities and thinking about which identities impact you the most on a day to day basis so I'm going to go through a couple reflection questions now if you're doing this as a part of a group I encourage you to have a discussion around some of these questions if you're doing this by yourself I'd like you to think about any answer these questions to yourself as you think about your own identity wheel think about first what identities do you think about the most and the least and why is that your larger slice is why do you think about those the most your smaller slices why don't you have to think about those very often think about why it is that these slices are bigger or smaller in your life and the next question is how does your identity impact your personal and your professional experiences how has the identities that you hold impacted your daily life in a personal way but also your professional life where has that shown up in your life the third question to think about or discuss is how does understanding your own social identities impact your interactions how does understanding your own identities and even the identities of others help you in your interactions in your day-to-day life and then finally how can you take this exercise and this concept of identity and apply it to the context of your work where does understanding identity fit into your work what are some ways that you can use this activity to improve your relationships your co-workers with your clients with people you see on a regular basis or people you see in your workplace so I hope that these reflection questions can give you a little bit more of an insight on your identity wheel and the identity wheel of others some other reflections I'd like you to think about always remember that everyone has social identities often identities that are different than you know what you might expect our identities don't always match up with the identities of others and we all have  these social identities we're going to think about some of these identities more than others some of them are going to have more of an impact on us and the identities that are more likely to negatively impact us are the ones that we are going to think about the most often most likely we have to remember we might not know what somebody's big slices and small slices are we don't know what the big slices and small slices of somebody else's identity wheel might be and then we all have experiences different experiences based on our identities our identities act as a lens through which we see the world and they it also impacts how the world sees us we walk through the world differently because of these different identities that we hold our identities this is important because our identities and experience they can influence our perceptions of others and that is the start of leading into biases we're not gonna have a conversation on bias today that is obviously something that we can do other work on but this is a key concept when you're going to move into understanding what bias is and how it impacts our day to day life so I hope you found this interesting and informative I hope you learned something about yourself and this concept of identity if you'd like to learn more about the work that we do at the diversity Center please feel free to reach out we have my contact information up there my email address and our phone number for the diversity Center as well as our website we have programs such as unconscious bias and micro messages this identity piece is a small part of that understanding unconscious bias and micro messages program we also have programs on creating inclusive work teams privilege and systemic inequities we have programs on a variety of different identities like our sexuality and gender acceptance programs as well as our racial justice series and we also do customized consulting around diversity and inclusion so if your organization is interested in learning more about diversity and inclusion or looking for ways to create a more inclusive environment we would love to be a part of that thank you very much again I hope you found this interesting and I was hoping to work with you soon have a great day
