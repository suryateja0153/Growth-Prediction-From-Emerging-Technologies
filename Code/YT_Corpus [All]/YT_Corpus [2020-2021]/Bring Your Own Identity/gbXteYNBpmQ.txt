 Life Here in the crowds, in this town Pretty faces without expression The girls and boys, hidden impressions Higher and higher, I take a deep breath Farther and farther, I plunge into the depth This is my identity No one on this earth can take this from me Who am I, I am me I never want to wake up from this dream Welcome to reality More painful than I ever imagined This is what I really need Right now I want to feel like I’m alive In a world made only for adults I want to believe I can be a hero Be soft towards others, be hard on yourself Make an effort to be true, now’s your only chance to move Look at me, I haven’t hit zero Time, I never had doubt or fears way back then Always had an answer inside, that voice from my own heart Deeper and deeper, I get so lost in the darkness Faster and faster, sometimes this speed is too much This is my identity Never will I let anyone touch this part of me Who am I, I am me My heart’s never skipped a beat to this day I’m not a robot, can’t you see Don’t underestimate what it means to be human Who am I, I am me Don’t lump me together with the rest of them Don’t run away, can’t run away, won’t run away no more Gotta look ahead, always look ahead, have to look ahead To my future “I like you just the way you are.” It was the gentle way you said this to me This is my identity No one on this earth can take this from me Who am I, I am me Right now I want to feel like I’m alive
