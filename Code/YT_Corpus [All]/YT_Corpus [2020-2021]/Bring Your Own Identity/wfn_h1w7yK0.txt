you create your sense of self so much better and again this is the key to living the life that you want to live it's also the key to having the confidence that you want to have the self-esteem that you want to have it all starts with who you believe yourself to be and what I use this for is pretty much all of my coaching all of my coaching and the majority of what I teach and the work that I do in myself is all related to identity because it is the biggest generalization you make and everything relates to it so if you want lasting change in your life it needs to be a part of who you are who you believe yourself to be before I go into this any further I'm curious about how you define identity now I'm not looking for a textbook definition I'm looking for what is your particular way of defining it how do you define your sense of self let me know in the comments below and I will respond to you so who are you how do you know you are you how do you know you are consistently the same person who wakes up every morning and does whatever it is that you do what is that sense the consistent sense of self come from and what defines you now I used to delve deep into philosophy to try to answer these questions and I did find some answers but none of them really gave me what I wanted and what I I wanted something to apply in my life that could change it transform it so that I found it easier to accomplish what I wanted to accomplish to succeed to become the person I want to be and unfortunately the philosophy that I at least the philosophy that I studied didn't give me any of that and it wasn't until I started learning NLP neuro-linguistic programming and more specifically the self-concept model created by Steve andreas they gave me exactly what I was looking for so I asked you the question what defines you now a lot of people would say well maybe it's how I feel about myself how I feel about myself is it does that define you I would say no it doesn't that's kind of the aftereffect how I feel about myself well again what is the self how do I feel about this thing it doesn't define it but it what it does do is it defines your self-esteem so I'll put that here so how you feel about yourself is what we call self esteem but again we're pointing at a self this is the feeling about self so what is this thing what defines identity now a person might say well my experience my experiences defined who I am and now we're on to something but not quite I mean if you think about it how many experiences have you had well endless experiences right and so many of them you've forgotten and they don't really matter anymore they don't really say a whole lot about who you are and you don't even have a sense of it reflecting on who you are we've had many experiences I can think of meaningless experiences I had as a child walking to the store or petting a dog or something like that and none of these things define Who I am so you can probably think about endless experiences that really say nothing about who you are in your own interpretation and in the interpretation of anyone else so I would say certain experiences do define you define who you believe yourself to be but not all experiences but I it is enough to write down I'd say experience is a starting point so we start having experiences and then they lead to something in between here between experience and identity now somebody might say well the qualities of me is who I believe myself to be and I would say yes to that so not just a few qualities I would say all of the things that you believe about yourself or what we could call qualities or generalizations but we'll call them qualities which are generalizations so yes you have experiences but not all experiences define who you are you have a feeling about yourself your self-esteem but that doesn't necessarily define who you are your qualities the things that you believe about yourself which are probably many many many beliefs you have about yourself so many many qualities that you have you're not thinking about them all at the same time you think about them from time to time like one at a time and probably depending on what context you're in or even the even who you're interacting with and so you have all of these qualities and if we put all these qualities all together and create one big generalization based on all these qualities and yes you get your identity so how are we going to define that do you need to sit down and write down all of your qualities that would take a long time and you probably wouldn't be able to complete the list because there's probably a lot of unconscious qualities meaning qualities that you have that you're not even conscious of okay so it's not important I believe in trying to define your identity by going through all the qualities I think it's important to understand this and that this defines your identity and from here from here there's so much that you can do for example what are the qualities that you value that you may or may not have or may or not believe you have in your identity and how would that change your life how would the change who you are if you believed you did have them so for example and I talked a lot about values I have videos out there on values if you've been a part of any of my programs you know that I talk a lot about values and how important values are what do you value what qualities do you value now you might need to get contextual about this meaning you might want to make it easier to make it less general less vague defined in context okay my work my relationship my social life those are three major life contexts easy to grab onto everybody just about everybody has all of these and then I can ask myself okay what do I value in these contexts let's say your professional career well I can value success I could value accomplishment I could value I can even joy hat I could even value happiness in my work or passion in my work and so if I can write out those values then I can ask myself do I possess those qualities now what happens when you think you when you believe you possess the qualities that you value yep you get a lot of this you get a lot of self-esteem you have a lot of confidence okay but what if you believe you don't possess the quality of what you value you guessed it this goes down your self-esteem goes down you don't feel as confident now here's the interesting thing I've coached a lot of people and of course I've just met a lot of people the one thing that I see most common is people who are actually highly competent I couldn't most of the people I coach or highly competent people most of people I interact with are highly competent people but almost all of them have low self-esteem and low confidence now some of you're saying no I don't have low self-esteem I don't have that problem that's like you know that's like junior high stuff no most people suffer from low self-esteem most people have feelings of low self-worth most people have feelings of not being good enough at least in some area of their life and it does not help you to feel that way some people think well that's being humble and no that's that's a different thing humble is different than humble is I know what I'm good at I know I'm good at it I don't Bret I don't need to brag about it because I know that I'm good at it but I don't and it's certainly not I don't feel good enough that's not that's not humility that doesn't help you but trying to pretend like you don't feel that way it's not gonna help you either so what you can do is you can identify what you value in certain situations certain major life contexts and then realize ask yourself be honest with yourself do I possess those values as qualities of who I am and if you don't now you know you've got some work to do and I can help you with that by the way we have a wonderful group of people who are transforming at the identity level and if you're interested in that you can just shoot me an email and I'll give you more information if you want to join that group back to this when you start living the values as qualities of who you are and you start looking at all the areas of your life with what's missing what do I value that I don't have as a quality of who I am and then you start learning what that is and you get really honest with yourself and you see where those gaps are and then you start transforming it you start transforming into that person who has those qualities so that you can live those values in every major context of your life try doing that for a few months or a year and how do you think you would change how do you think you would transform extraordinarily wealth is what I would say and your life would have more meaning more purpose more satisfaction and more fulfillment and this is an ongoing thing because life is not static so this is an online thing that changes that you make normally do last because the identity the self-concept is such a huge generalization it transcends space and time but as you live and as you grow and as your potential increases because you're fulfilling that potential there will be no more work to be done there will be more to learn about yourself there will be more to improve about yourself and it's not difficult at that point it's more tune-up and maintenance but it's very very important that you do it and becoming all who you can be now you know how to define your identity but what you don't know are the elements of a healthy self-concept a
