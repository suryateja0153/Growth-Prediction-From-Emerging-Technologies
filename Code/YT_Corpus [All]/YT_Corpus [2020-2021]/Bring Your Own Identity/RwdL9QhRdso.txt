 It has been just a short time now. There's a "60 Minutes" piece, other stories. Now, you're sitting here with me since you revealed yourself where you're merging the two, Emily Doe with no, my name, Chanel Miller. I read that during this whole time you've been feeling like you were living a double life and that even your family and some members of the family, still, and friends did not know that you were Emily Doe. Yes, yeah. OPRAH WINFREY: So what is it felt like to merge them? Well, today is the first day as my full self. And it feels really amazing. Like, for so long, I felt like I was living a shrunken version of myself. Or maybe there's like a little 2-inch person in my chest, operating this four-limbed vessel that I called my body. But I felt extremely hollow and fragile. And now it feels like I've finally, like, grown into my limbs. And I'm sitting here fully. And it feels amazing. And I think it's what any victim wants is just to be fully back inside themselves.
