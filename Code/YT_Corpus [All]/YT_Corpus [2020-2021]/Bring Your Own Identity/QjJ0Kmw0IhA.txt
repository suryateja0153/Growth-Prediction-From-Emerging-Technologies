 Hi, I'm Dr. Kristen Lee and I'm the Lead Faculty for Behavior Science and Leadership here at Northeastern University. We as a faculty body and learning community welcome you to the Lifelong Learning On Demand course. This is a moment for you to really think about what your own career resilience looks like, how you can take deliberate action to shift your mindsets, behaviors, and skills to a level where you can sustain yourself in today's complex environment. And, this is something that we embody in our programs, in everything that we do. We want you to recognize the power of your strengths, the power of the learning process, and the value of community, of intentional community that helps you to shift away from a lot of the issues of today that get in the way of resilience, that get in the way of connection that caused disruption in our lives both professionally and personally. So, we, as a faculty body have come together in very intentional ways as an interdisciplinary team to help you apply behavior science to leadership to help you think about the ways that you can show up to influence, to bring about change, in your respective environments that is positive and productive and inspirational.
