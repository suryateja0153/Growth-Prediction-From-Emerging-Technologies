 so this is just going to be a short rant video about racial division and my experience with that and i'm kind of voicing my frustration and how people like to use race to put you in a box and put labels on you put limitations on you and unfair expectations and all that crazy i do crush a lot in this video so if you can get past the cursing you probably can grasp the message and what i'm trying to say um so i just want to say thank you for tuning in welcome back to the channel and um i hope you enjoy the video the problem is a lot of people don't understand that we as people are more than the color of our skin we're more than our culture we're more than where we came from people of every racial background you're more the totality of who you are is not wrapped up in just something as simple as the color of your skin if that's the totality of all who you are then you probably need to do some soul searching i would like to think that there are layers to people there are layers to who we are i don't have to act a certain way talk a certain way dress a certain way be a certain way because i'm black and i happen to be from texas i don't have to be a certain way or fit into a certain category of boxer personality type because i'm black and i'm from the south i am who i am i don't have to be all you know these things that they say leos are because i happen to be a leo no i'm a leo but i'm also who i am i have layers as a human okay i am my own person who happens to be black who happens to be from america i think that people have a very narrow way of thinking when we think about people and this is why i don't even like discussing my race and nationality with people because they try to use that to put you in a box to put limitations on what you can and can't do and who you are we're all we are all way more than that you are more than your zodiac sign you're more than the city that you're from you're more than the color of your skin or your racial heritage or lineage or whatever i'm so sick of this racial it's like people want to claim that they're not biased and they're not racist and this or that but you practice reverse racism more than any other group of people and i'm talking about black people right now the the texturism the colorism the futurism all of that i don't literally i don't fit in anywhere i am literally alone i am by myself and i'm okay with that i've always been a lone star and i'd rather it be that way because at least i can live and walk in my own truth and not have to worry about being judged every second of the goddamn day because of how i look so i should think this way because i'm black oh no you can't listen to that music or you can't like this person because they're not no i can do it the i want because i am who i am first okay i think that it's way too much discrimination going on based on my new simple and if y'all can't get past that there will be no unity in the ytbc and i have just decided to accept the fact that there's just not gonna ever be unity in some spaces period that's just the truth and fact of the matter there's not going to be any unity in some spaces and you just have to understand not everyone can understand not everyone is going to be saved not everyone is going to be able to grow and develop and evolve in their way of thinking period so leave them where you find them move on because you are wasting your breath energy and time trying to bring these people to the light period there's no point in doing it it's pointless if people want to live and lift their wounds and trauma bond with each other let them do that just move on and be great everybody can't be saved i'm neon eyes and i'm out oh
