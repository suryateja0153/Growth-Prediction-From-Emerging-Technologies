life and take charge of your destiny so if that sounds good make sure you subscribe to this youtube channel so you can get these videos on a regular basis defining personal identity this is probably the most important thing you could possibly do in your life so I'm not going to cover everything in this video but there are more videos that I've done on this topic so I will link them here and of course I've done a lot more training on this topic but for this video I'm gonna give you the broad strokes and the understandings that are really really important to get down about you and your identity so here we go the problem I think where most of the confusion comes in about personal identity and defining the personal identity is there's so much philosophy out there about personal identity and I spent years use more so in my early 20s really delving into this philosophy because I loved philosophy and it was something I indulged in quite a bit but as much as I got some wise words or words of wisdom from some incredible thinkers I found that it didn't help a whole lot in understanding myself and understanding the world around me and making progress making changes in my life that that could really benefit me and that's when I turned to NLP and neuro linguistic programming opened a whole nother way of looking at personal identity especially through Steve Andreas's self-concept model so I think the first important thing to do is to really understand what is your personal identity and that's the place that you would want to start and like I said this can be really confusing for a lot of people because you hear all these different things and you can ask that question Who am I endlessly and get endless answers to it so what NLP does is it we the approach that we take is we take more of a structural approach to it rather than a content-based approach to it so philosophy is often asked answering questions of why and what NLP likes to do is our instead of personifying NLP in NLP what we like to do is ask the whole question how is this even happening so how is it we have a felt sense of identity how is it we have a just that felt sense of self that some for some people it seems like they have great identities and for other people they doubt their identity they doubt themselves so what is that what is that difference as well and I'm going to talk a little bit more about that later but let's really talk about what is your personal identity your personal identity is basically who you believe yourself to be or what you believe yourself to be your personal identity is this huge generalization we make about ourselves now this is pretty much what we do with almost anything especially anything that we give sort of mind identity to and I want to use an analogy that I think will make this a little more clear so when we think of a city we often will talk about the identity of the city or the personality of the city I'm going to use one of my favorite cities that I've been to Hanoi Vietnam as an example as you could use this with any city I like that city a lot because of the concept that I have of it I've been there before I knew it existed before I went to it and I had an idea about what Hanoi was like before I went and then of course when I got there my idea about it I would say that it changed but more importantly it grew because now I had an actual experience of it and that's not the same experience that everyone else has it's certainly not the same experience that people have who have lived there all their lives it's not the same experience of someone else who comes from a different culture speaks a different language and visits and Hanoi we all walk away with a different Sept of Hanoi or whatever city that you're thinking of the important thing to understand though is we have a concept of it does the city actually exist well yes it does you can show up and you can see it but the idea that we've given a name called Hanoi that it has certain characteristics we these are all generalizations we make about that city and you're going to make different ones if you haven't been there than if you have been there and you had experiences so based on my experiences and each and experience when I select and collect those experiences and I put them in a category I didn't make a generalization about Hanoi the people are very friendly the food is really really good the architecture is amazing because you have these old crumbling colonial buildings alongside these communist-era buildings and so these are my experiences of that city but I'm not there right now but I take with me a concept of that I have an idea a feeling of that city and then when I go back I'm gonna take that concept with me and then when I have more experiences that concepts going to grow the same exact thing happens with your identity from the beginning when you're born well you don't know who you are you don't have any experiences and then you start having experiences and you get these influences from authority figures your parents your culture your society that influences those experiences and then as you select and collect these experiences especially the feedback you'd get about yourself you go to school what you're told you're a good student you're told you're a bad student you're told you're a good kid you told you're a bad kid and you take in all these experiences you select and collect them and you create a certain collection of experiences that reflect upon who you are and when I say select and collect these experiences what I'm really talking about is your beliefs your generalizations that you're making about yourself and so once you bring this all together it comes together in one big generalization about who you are the concept of you just like I have a concept of Hanoi or you know any other city you want mention you've experienced you your entire life and you've heard feedback from people who experience you from outside of you and so you bring all this information together and create a concept about who you are the truth is you will never know who you truly are the whole idea of an identity is a concept so it's impossible to truly know who you are it's impossible for anyone else to truly know who you are but given all this information we create beliefs and why do we create beliefs we create beliefs because when we don't have actual concrete tangible facts in front of us we have to fill in the gaps somehow so you could go into all sorts of things like well you know Damon I am a person I'm tangible I'm right here but then you would that would mean that you are only your body and we know that that's not true because we got a lot going on in here and the other thing is that you every seven years you're a completely physically different person and then you might gain weight you might lose weight you might grow a beard you might shave your beard you might grow long hair you might cut your hair so if you are your body there there comes a lot of problems with that idea when you talk about the kind of physical changes you can go through so understand yourself in the sense of what you believe about yourself that is the only truth about you you will ever know so if you wanted to define your personal identity you're going to find that in what are the beliefs you make about yourself and how those beliefs come together to form the overall generalization or concept of you now when we look at that big picture that that big idea of what all that I just talked about you can keep chunking this down into smaller and smaller structures and I mentioned some of those the experience is sort of the the granule that's the first piece of it you have an experience and an experience is a subjective thing there's a beginning and there's an end and then there's a middle when we talk about life you've never really don't remember your beginning when you were born nobody does and you couldn't possibly know anything about your end because you're still alive so your experience has actually been non-stop there hasn't been a beginning and an end but in order for our minds to make sense of life we create a beginning and then when an end and we call this an experience so this is the very beginning when we start creating experiences and this happens very early in life probably around the age of 2 years old and then we started bringing these experiences together and we start selecting and collecting them into these beliefs and generalizations and some of these beliefs or beliefs about the world and some of these beliefs are the beliefs about you and then this is how this process continues to go so without understanding this this can this is where we get stuck in all the philosophy about about life and the more you can understand what I just explained more you start to explore the beliefs that you have about yourself this starts to shine a light on them that your beliefs are not set about who you are we tend to think of these as facts well I'm just this way and that's just how it is or the world is just this way and that's just how it is but the truth is is no these are beliefs you've created and beliefs are not facts so therefore you can actually change them they are malleable and you've believed many things in your life that you don't believe anymore why because you may be a base that belief on certain evidence and then later got contrary evidence that showed you that's not true at one time you might have believed in Santa Claus why because your parents told you there was a Santa Claus and when you woke up on Christmas morning you found presents under the tree there was your evidence so you thought well this must be true this is just how it is and then later it gets revealed that what your parents put those presents there your parents told you that it was that there was a Santa Claus so what other experience you had but to believe that so that should show you that your beliefs about yourself are not necessarily true and you might get different evidence or you might seek out different evidence to find out that's something you believe about yourself is not true and this is the really exciting thing so for some people that feels she feels anxiety provoking that whoa would be what if the things that I believe about myself are not true and to me at one time that scared me but to me now that's what's really exciting about life and you can spend the rest of your life being curious about yourself and exploring yourself exploring who you really are and one way that we do that very well is by challenging yourself by thinking about all those things that you want to do especially the things that might scare you a little bit and go for them anyway what do you have to lose the only thing you have to lose is maybe an idea or a belief you have about yourself but in the process you're probably going to strengthen other beliefs about yourself and you become more who you want to be first to get a sense of who you are be honest with yourself who what do you believe about yourself and then once you have an understanding of that then you realize there's so much that you don't know about yourself so now you get to explore that you get to explore who you are and like I said one way to do that is through challenging yourself and not just challenging yourself over and over nothing I'll give an example I love to travel and travel can be a challenge sometimes it costs money I have kids so I have to find childcare unless I take my kids with me which presents a whole new challenge so there's always challenges to that but I feel like I discover more of myself every time I travel and in some cases I feel like I lose some of myself in the sense that what I thought who I thought I was maybe I don't I don't feel that way so much anymore so define yourself explore yourself and then decide well who is it that you want to be who do you aspire to be and I'm not saying it like aspiring to be said like someone else don't don't do that that's never going to be helpful for you comparing yourself to others will only bring you down but knowing who you are now who do you want to be more of in alignment with who you would like to be and then you can spend lots of time as you explore who you are creating more and more of who you want to be selecting and collecting those experiences that build the beliefs that you want to believe about yourself that are empowering rather than limiting and there is a beautiful process that is very systematic that has very predictable results and you can do this for the rest of your life making your life better creating more of who you want to be so that you create more of the experience of life that you want to live so now you have a better understanding of your personal identity and how you can explore that identity and how you can transform it but what you
