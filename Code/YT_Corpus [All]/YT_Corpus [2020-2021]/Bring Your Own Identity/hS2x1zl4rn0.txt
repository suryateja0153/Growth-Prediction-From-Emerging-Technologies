 my name is billy eilish billy eilish my name is billy eilish this is getting out of hand i am billy eilish i'm doing the till i'm 90. so get ready for it i think it's october 18th 2017. october 18 2018. october 18th 2019. october 18th 2020. i'm 15. i'm 16 i'm 17. i'm 18. i have 257 000. i have 6.3 million 40.7 million 67.5 million where are these people coming from like that's my question the most followed person that follows me is chloe grace moretz katy perry maybe justin bieber ariana grande my baby with 204 million followers it's a picture of me and charlie xcx isn't it the one about me smiling 10 million that's a lot five grammys won five grammys wow i will be 18. i never thought i'd be 18. hopefully i look fly what is that quote well i have accepted the things i cannot change and will i have changed the things that i cannot accept it's a good thing to think about what what what changes you know what endings what new beginnings oh god i did not age well girl please talk about what's going to change what's going to be different here your whole life will have gone [Music] but not just you everyone because coronavirus definitely not where i thought that that i would be currently but i'm also not mad at it i'm very very lucky to have had this year play out the way it did because for a lot of people it was literal hell and i am very aware that i have been pretty blessed for for the fortune that i've had this year even though the year has sucked it's still you know whatever we're alive still you know i don't know the thing is like i don't really have any free time but then i also kind of it's weird i contradict myself because i kind of don't really like having a day off because i get off the hustle i get out of the groove you know i get out of like my vibe i hope whatever amount of off days i want next year i get like if i want 100 off days next year i hope i get that i hope i listened to that's basically it i really said 100 days 100 days i said oh you got what you wish for where you happy are you happy because damn this is the most amount of time off that i've had in you know five years now um i think that goes for a lot of people but that was even true for like the first month of quarantine you know we had three weeks off and i was like wow this is the most time off i've ever had i can't believe it it's so great it's like a free vacation and it'll we'll go right back out on tour in a week and we'll be fine and clearly we're all wrong with that and we look like clowns now but i will say i have made and created things that i don't think i ever would have created without this period of time um this amount of time and this just life itself i would like things to be normal though again i would like that but i will say that i i'm i'm grateful for what it's given me i really wanted to go on that world tour we started it got three shows in cancelled flew back home i really wanted to get a lamborghini better have a lamborghini it's not that i couldn't have i just there were so many other things that were so much more important there's more people to give that money to there's way way more and i cannot stress it enough way more important things going on than a lamborghini so one thing i have now that i did not have a year ago is my little pooch puppy shark shark shark come here this is shark [Music] my son he is so silly oh he's wagging his tail this is shark didn't have him a year ago cause he's only eight months old all right i'll let you go bud um the people that support me my fans which i don't like to call fans my you know my family you know finishing this album and doing the most crazy shows like i'm capable of doing in the next month maintaining um my happiness which i've been experiencing for like the first time in many years i want to stay happy that's a big goal for me so cute i love that those are all very genuine those were 100 what i was feeling very strongly um it's so weird like what we take for granted like i would never have thought that i wouldn't be able to do shows one day you know so much time spent me dreading to dreading press dreading this dreading that and like i had no idea that i was dreading something that i would one day not even be legally allowed to do like that's what's crazy to me the shows are like the one thing that i feel like i've ever been good at i know that sounds stupid but it's like the only thing i've ever done that made me feel like i belonged maybe it's cliche i don't know lord keeping my family safe and you know staying up there isn't much else to do right now everything matters differently now than a year ago honestly everything i can't i really can't even think of one thing like all the things that i felt like mattered most a year ago matter less all the things i felt like mattered at least a year ago matter more um i learned so much more about just the way people are living that i wasn't aware of climate crisis and social injustices and you know kind of all the bad things and i think made me think differently it's not like i wasn't aware i just learned more and thought about it differently and you know was more open to learning and uh it's been a crazy year uh people think i'm pregnant a lot of people thought i was pregnant for a second that i sold my soul to satan there's this picture of me like running from my car to my brother's front door on like 110 day degree day in a tank top and everyone's like damn billy got fat i'm like nope this is just how i look you've just never seen it before so that's that's like the most current one but whatever um i don't know i think that's uh that's not really for me to decide i think yeah the reason people are looking up to you is because you're you they're not looking up to you so that you'll tell them something that you would never actually tell them they're looking up to you so that you tell them something that you would tell them yourself so i love having kids kids relate to me and tell me that i make them feel comfortable in their bodies like that if i can do anything i want to do that so it's really hard to talk about my life and have it not sound like i'm bragging sometimes i'll catch myself in a conversation with someone acting like i'm in an interview and in interviews you're trained to talk about yourself and not ask the other person about themselves and so i'll catch myself in in conversations where i'm like like i'm not i'm being interviewed i'm acting like i'm being interviewed instead of acting like i'm talking to a human being such a good point i will never stop talking about that i'm glad that i was definitely aware of it a year ago um i i feel so much better about it now i was so insecure about where i was so i felt like i was always having to prove like what i did and what i do and like who i am or whatever but something about it getting bigger and bigger makes me almost more comfortable not proving myself for a while now i've been really having an identity crisis a little i think it was december i did some like radio show performance and the entire show i felt like i was pretending to be billy eilish like i felt i completely wasn't looking at myself as myself i was just like totally seeing it from not my own perspective and it was so weird happened multiple times at like award shows and whatever i just felt like i felt like a parody of myself i've i've felt a little bit better about it lately just like you forget like i'm i'm literally 18. it's funny that i'm expected to have found myself and stick with it you know it's like you know i'm having i'm trying different things out i'm i'm i'm trying different ways of living and styles and personalities and you know hairstyles and clothing and shoes and like i'm just trying it all out because i'm like a growing girl i've definitely had like moments of like reaching out to a couple people but every time i do it i kind of like stop myself because i'm like this is so weird you know i've had some conversations with bieber about this where we just you know talk about the craziness of our lives and whatever like ariana's been really cool about stuff those are some people that i feel like have really shown me support and like you know even like katy perry told me that i could reach out to her whenever and talk about it because it's crazy and you know that's really important and i think it's good gaga has said it to me before it's you know it's nice to to hear from people that like have gone through this and know what it's like and went through the of it and went through the amazing parts of it and it's like it's nice to hear people with me but at the same time like no matter like how many people are are there for you and have gone through similar things it's like nothing ever happens twice a tattoo maybe [Music] no face tattoos the only two tattoos i want to get are the ones that barely anyone could see i did get a tattoo but you won't ever see it i did what i said i do what you expect okay well i looked at my phone that's what i did this morning when i woke up i looked my phone i think i made myself a burrito for breakfast with a gluten-free tortilla i woke up and then pooped that's what i did hey it's the first thing i did dude you asked i looked at my phone that's what i did i looked at my phone classic day face recognition like there's no home button what the heck they've made monograms crazy what the hell is a monogram a hologram is what i meant it's crazy that you can charge your phone by like putting it on that little disc robots dog like please [Music] robots doing stuff let's leave the robots in the lab don't let them come out here honestly the news is so bad i can't even oh yeah beyonce had some twins and she still looks fly okay lonnie's pregnant greta thunberg honestly she's been kicking people's ass literally that trump might lose like that and that's not even a guarantee i guess a positive thing would be that a lot of people that say that they've never voted are voting for the first time that is huge news we have hope at least is what i want to say i think that that gives us some hope that gives us something and maybe an opportunity to get better i'm pretty afraid of people dying not me dying but like the people around me dying the people i love dying or being you know fatally injured or um you know some sort of brain damage it's just something that would try and change them drastically or yeah that that would really be that's yeah that's probably my biggest fear is the people i love like dying it's tough because that at the time was like kind of an irrational fear that was kind of just like an overthinking fear and now it's actually a real thing to fear um because people are losing their loved ones and now it's like actually a real possibility so it's just about staying safe honestly same for a year from now because i don't know what will have happened in a year and that is in itself it's terrifying especially with like the unknown of what next year looks like being apple's up next artist i did ellen last week jimmy fallon so many festivals i just sold out a headlining arena tour had a number one single biggest selling album of the year five grammys one two three four five performed at the oscars met like every celebrity that's ever existed and it was the most overwhelming insane surreal thing i've ever experienced i went to the brits i won a brit it was amazing i performed we recorded the bond theme song working with hans zimmer and the orchestra to record it completely surreal and amazing i started my world arena tour and then you know the world kind of died but before that you know it was quite a year it started off very strong then other things happen and you know we went to tons of protests we fought for people that was a big thing this year too huge accomplishment i feel like and uh we will never stop fighting i will never stop fighting for you brianna i will never stop fighting for all the black and brown people that have lost their lives to to police brutality and literally just racism never gonna stop fighting for you ever ever ever i will do what i can and i stand by that you know i have such a huge platform like why would i want to waste that yeah it's easier to say nothing but it's like that's not gonna help anything and it's not gonna i don't know i don't get the point of of silence i think it's there's a difference between silence and processing and i think that that is like an a big thing that people need to understand is that you got to think through what you're going to say say it in the right way i think it's really important to speak up but also be respectful you know it's been a year of just trying to speak up for everything you believe in and fight really hard you know there's nothing else to do like why wait until you experience it to fight for it you know what i'm saying like just fight for it already i hope that it we have more years of fighting and i hope that something changes brockhampton tierra whack is sick my favorite artist is techno i've been loving some arlo parks honestly ash nico has some some slams like i can't even lie to you i love the strokes album that came out the most recent one tick tock songs are burned into my brain but you know it is what it is that's what 2020 is some of them are good those right so i'm you know whatever my family i'm i'm always talking to my family always every second in my life my mom and dad still come on tour with me finney still comes on tour with me every day pretty much every day we're always together always talking always you know whatever it's great i love my family i am so lucky to have my family right now not only with me but like swell and alive it's been fun it's been good it's been good you know what i'm about to say i am single and about to turn a tingle for the first time in my life i don't feel the need to be with anyone i don't have my eyes on anyone i'm not in the mood and i'm totally fine with that same yes oh my gosh that's my favorite part of the last video i'm in pretty much the same place i don't have a boyfriend and i'm happy like i'm i'm not worried at all i i love it i'm not opposed to anything i'm not you know pushing anything away or forcing something i'm just like steady and cool with it which is great so it's a good place i'm still with 17 year old billy fashion is like the main one i love fashion i always have i want to direct videos i want to have my own clothing line i want to have my own everything lots of cars such a car nut little girl that's super cute well once again i did it yeah fashion is is still my my expression i definitely am not as like interested as i used to be in designing as much as i was um because i think i there are more things that i like doing than than designing and kind of like curating and stuff but i still am like very in charge of my clothes and i have a clothing brand so there you go a little blush i direct my own videos billy i do yes you got what you wanted i used to think the industry sucked because i was miserable and it wasn't my team's fault it was just where i was at the time and that's why i thought that it was that i just feel like the industry is thought of as this like whole cult type thing it's like this big like i always see these trolls online like the industry is where all the people sell their souls to the like whoa that's very taking it far like the people in my comment section holy [Music] so true i feel the same way everybody's kind of like made to to hear like the industry and go like what the industry you know for some people it's totally true some people have terrible terrible experiences i had a couple experiences where i was like this is some but it's not like the industry does it it's just the people around you and i also have been really lucky to have the team that i have and that i have had since the beginning and yeah there's some weirdos like there's some weirdos and there's some weirdo group of groups of people that you just kind of gotta get get away from but it's just about knowing your people and knowing your boundaries and like who you trust and stuff i want to learn that it's all worth it because it's tiring as heck the shows make it worth it the shows and the supporters i was taking it for granted and i that makes me really mad and i don't want to be and i just was so true so so true yes it's worth it for sure absolutely worth it absolutely i would not change it for anything else i can finally say that it's worth it but you can't just be like expecting it to be worth it you gotta like change some stuff around make sure you're happy make sure you got what you need and then it will be worth it yes having the approach that no one's had trying to write something no one's written see that's why i'm i'm still bad at it because that's what i was trying to do i kind of have no idea what to expect like last year i thought i knew what the what people would like for my album and i thought i knew like what would be popular and how so wrong i have gotten so much better at it i feel so much more confident in my writing i feel like i know myself better i'm better at advocating um my opinions and communicating and i think phineas and i have just like seriously just like really gotten in the groove we do it so fast like there was like a period of time like a month ago or something i was just like we were just texting the label like song done another song done another song done so i'm so much better at it i'm so i love it so much more i actually really do enjoy it now and i do feel like i'm pretty good at it now to be honest with you uh like 12 i think maybe like 14 actually i think there's like 14 ish blank blank blank blank like four and a half right now i have 16. we've been working and i love them all i love all of them the first month i was incredibly uninspired i don't know why i think it was just very overwhelming and scary and i think after like that first period of time when when and came and went i got so inspired and creative and like just like made music that i don't i don't think i would have made my brother and i like i don't think we would have even made it at all this year judge me please i don't and then one word no it's my style billy eilish parody is my style my brother is my best friend my brother's my best friend my best friend is phineas but he is also my brother we got drew we got zoe we got laura we got shark we got my family my brother those is my best friends maybe like once a week i might be safe if i go to trader joe's i went to trader joe's did not work i also tried costco which i thought i'd be safe at and that didn't work sake public what is that [Music] public i have not been in at all um since march 11th there were definitely moments in this quarantine where i forgot that i'm me i was taking shark to like a dog play group with the rescue place that i got him from you know i was like i didn't even think about it because we had so much nothing for so long i didn't even think about it i had like my full like green like right there full like you know wasn't covering anything except obviously a mask and i was like walking in and there was this car full of people and they were like and i literally like looked behind me i was like what are you looking at i forgot totally forgot but it was nice it was it was really nice to see people like before covet at all like i don't go in public anyway just because it's a complete disaster um yeah it's a bad idea to do but i have googled myself only just the titles because there are they're what's funny like i'm not trying to see myself on like twitter that is a no-go oh my gosh don't want to see that because that is mean i look myself up to like laugh but i really don't want to actually see what's being said but it is it is it's good for a good laugh i don't know if i'm more confident i just think i know what i'm doing more [Music] uh i think i'm less confident actually i feel like i'm probably the most confident i've ever been in my life i don't think i've ever been more confident than i am now yep i ah totally true that first year i was definitely just like not even thinking about myself so i wasn't even thinking about confidence we all know that that second year was rough last year yeah i definitely was the most confident i've ever been last year i think i think that's still probably the most confident i haven't like gone down at all i just think it pretty much like stayed right there covett has made me less confident in myself just because it's made me stop doing the things i was used to doing and got good at but it's mostly stayed the same i'm not like not confident but i definitely was really at my peak a year ago i was really peaking happy happy girl i would tell 16 year old me to to remember who her best friends are and remember who the people that care about her the most are and not throw them away for somebody else or for something else oof that it's hard um knowing the situations that i was talking about god how do you prepare someone for this year i think all i would say is just like enjoy this don't take anything for granted don't ever come off stage during this year and think i didn't really like that show i didn't really nope and by the way i'm never doing that again when shows are allowed i'm every show is going to be the best show i've ever done that's that sure come here come here give me yourself give me your butt all right bring in the mom this is my mom she is sick as a booty i don't mind i can stay here that long i love it too hello baby his grandma i love you so much i love you so much i miss being on the road with her and i miss seeing her do her shows because she's so incredible but i have loved being home with her don't take your parents for granted people [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
