 hello beautiful star seed welcome back today i just wanted to talk about the importance of going within oneself and how to shift your identity how to let go of an old perceived identity that no longer resonates with you if you're new to my channel welcome my name is rosie this is my cosmic garden and together we will grow i combine health psychology and spirituality to empower you to become your greatest version videos are now uploaded every monday let's grab if you have been following me on instagram you'll notice that my most recent post talked about how we are not lost that we are just finding our way so i just want to motivate you and let you know that your current situation is not your final destination i know it sounds cheesy hearing that but it's true the difference between acknowledging and being aware of your current situation and you just trying to shift out of it versus resisting is that usually whatever you resist persists and i think that's what a lot of people forget these days that we were here to be authentic not to be perfect i mean look even how the seasons change unless of course you're living in southern california or florida throughout most part of the country or the world you do experience the changes of season and i think this is something important to remember that even within our own lives you know one person can be in the summer right usually these are the people that are you know happy go lucky you know everything is going great and then you can have someone who is winter they may not feel as high vibration as another person but this doesn't mean that they don't have the capacity to be that you must ask yourself what season are you in mentally emotionally physically and spiritually and acknowledge it and don't compare yourself to other people it's just a matter of shifting the way we think shifting the way we perceive things and trying to zoom out and look at the bigger picture look at how we are co-creators versus being at the mercy of other people so if there's one thing that you can do that will help you go within yourself and be really honest and real even if you have to go in nature and meditate see things that you may have been overlooking see things that you may have been resisting because chances are whatever it is that you're resisting may be indirectly blocking you to reaching the next level or to reaching the next season start looking at thought patterns whether it's the way you talk to yourself or maybe even the people that you surround yourself with you have to look at these things as a whole versus just here and there you know we can't just pick and choose we have to look at things for what they are not for what we want them to be i challenge you to try to do something today something that you've always wanted to do just do something that's fun and something that will help you step out of your comfort zone after you finish doing this you're going to feel so good about yourself if you have already done these things then let me know leave me a comment down below i hope this message was motivational and encouraging and i will see you on my next video until then let's grow together
