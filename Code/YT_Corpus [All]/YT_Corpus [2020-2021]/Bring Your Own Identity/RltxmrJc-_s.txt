 welcome back to glamour and filtered host by meet Josh Smith and today we're joined by louis Tomlinson how are you my thanks how are you good so new album new songs tour on the way you are very vulnerable in your songwriting and the music you put out there I'm just honest yeah what do you think's been the hardest thing for you to be honest about with yourself I'm lucky with where a girl in Doncaster we don't like we wear our on our sleeves really you know what I mean so it comes naturally to me really to kind of just be open about the way I feel and stuff uh we still live in a society where it's still seen as bit of a taboo or there's a stigma around mentored about vulnerability and that kind of thing what's that journey been like for you with that whole stereotype have you ever felt that level of stereotype I mean I act like I'm aware of it but how I operate personally I've always kind of owned it really you know I think the mom did a good job of bringing me up and taught me core values mr. father when we wrote two of us that was obviously a very personal song for me and probably the most vulnerable I've been especially on a song you know I've had a couple of moments where fans have come up to me and told me what that song means to them and maybe they've just had a loss in their life and then that's incredible you not me I never really had that in the band to that level and you know my lyrics really mean you some these people's how difficult has that been to go through those private things whilst having this whole massive microscope on you it was definitely difficult at first you know when I first got put in the band and having to deal with you know not having as much privacy but I suppose as time goes on you grow to understand it and and get used to it and and to be honest you know there has been some you know pretty hard times in me life and although I wouldn't have chosen to have them played out in the public you know some of the reactions and some of the stuff I got from fans was incredible - what would you want to say to the you that was going through those deep personal moments are those times your life what advice would you want to give that person who can sit them down now trust yourself and trust you God because you know those things are important and nobody understands you better than you it does out that I'm able to talk about me feelings and so far and I can have those moments where obviously I need to but yeah it comes naturally to me so I am I'm lucky I think also as well from you've had always have this amazing support network around you throughout your whole life and I think also when you're in a band you have four other members with you as well there's also that immediate support network because I was thinking today it must've been so weird for you to go from having that immediate support network there all the time to then it not being there all the time how difficult was that transition for you there is still enough familiar faces to not kind of feel like alienated and on my own and but it definitely took some getting used to you know One Direction was such a well working thing you know so it definitely took some getting used to but I think you know as you spend time on your own you find you know new people that you really got on with and develop those relationships how did you build your identity away from that part of your life it took me a second to kind of understand that I was on my own now and you know my identity for so long was part of as a collective and obviously you still have an individual identity within that so I think it took me a second to kind of understand that I can be a bit of a chav again you know basically and and and yeah just be me really and not have to worry too much about anything else did you ever feel like because he was just saying about you know he could be a bit more poor child do you ever feel like you were having to play anything on me I think I think sometimes people insinuate their you know it might be the record label management oh yeah I like this but it's not you respectful of the fan base and their age and we are you know we had a young fan base and and also they've got moms who can get angry if you piss them off you know what I mean so I think it's just being respectful that I think so much is made in the media about your relationships the band and Brotherhood and all that kind of stuff that we were just talking about as well have you leaned into that immediate Brotherhood you had at times when has it been the most supportive for you I think that I think honestly you know there's there's obviously times where you have better relationships with all the members than you do or those but that connection that'll be forever definitely because you know we experienced so much in relatively short space of time and you know it was it was crazy what we all saw together an experience so I think that is something that will have forever and really definitely sometimes you might not see eye to eye but but but that's the way friendships go and real life do you not I mean and they also evolve exactly exactly yeah and people get more mature and all that yes and you resonate on different levels and different things I think that's a positive thing to be able to take away from definitely definitely how would you say your relationship with like Brotherhood and that concept of Brotherhood has changed through your career as I've got older really you know my responsibility is has changed with with my sisters and me and my little brother but yeah I think it gets I seem to understand it more as I get older I'm currently trying have a conversation with me twin sisters to go to sick farm they don't want to go so yeah but I think I think again you know look I've just through experience and through doing it longer and kind of being older a little bit more mature I suppose mature I suppose a brother I have to be I mean yeah we're trying to adult in the southern respect exactly do you still have a thing when you're like oh my god I'm actually adding a while today like whenever I'm with Mission Freddie and whenever I'm having like those kind of conversations about school with the girls my sisters and that and feel like then I've got me I don't head on I have to to have credibility in those conversations you know me but I definitely still out like a lot of times is that anything you would change or if there's anything you would change how would you change it every mistake as Moses you know it's all part your journey and you do definitely learn something every time so in terms of my my career and and and you know I have come across publicly and all that now I won't change anything to be honest look I've got like I'm quite resilient I'm quite persistent I was actually the third year that had auditioned for x-factor and that I got put in the bands you know I mean so I I'd say resilience and persistence is important but obviously you have to have certain amount of self belief for that so just to just to be confident really if you could give someone any advice because for me you seem like a very confident person which i think is so great letting like a really refreshing nice way to if people are going through any sort confidence issues or they've been through some of the things that you've been through in your life what kind of advice would you want to give them find the people in your life that you know you love and trust and and talk it through with people because you know I might come across as confident and that but obviously you know you have moments where you build things up in your head and you think there and the longer you live with that thought you know you think it's you think it's big it ends up being bigger than the reality of the situation so I think just as much communication as possible and and and yes I'm with you with your family as well it's so great to see how comforting you are I love it let me feel good
