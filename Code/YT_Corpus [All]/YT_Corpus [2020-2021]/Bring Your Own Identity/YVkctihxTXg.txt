 [Music] and we're in this series call identity theft and we started the series just talking about how God sees us and we looked at Ephesians 1 and we saw how he sees us as pleasing and forgiving and blessed he showered grace and kindness on us he he loves us he likes us and we also recognize this reality the fact that oftentimes the self-talk that goes on in our minds speaks other kind of descriptions over us we feel like a disappointment we feel like a failure feel like we don't measure up and our identity is robbed from us and in the first week we talked about letting go of some of those names those things that we speak over ourselves and listening for a new name that God has for us there's the whiteboard in the lobby would encourage you in these weeks that if there's a new name you're hearing you've let that go the old now new name that got spoken over you would you write that on a nametag and just kind of attach it to that whiteboard out there and be an encouragement to all of us to see those names and see what God's speaking over you but Jennifer talked to us last week about how our identity is robbed or stolen from us she talked about this performance lie she made a great I have a great insight on Peters life Peter he's out fishing and you know Jesus is teaching and he's done fishing no catch Jesus go back out and fish go to the deep water and Peter kind of reluctantly goes back out there and he throws the nets in and as a commercial fisherman he has the best day of business ever and he realizes that the catch is connected to Jesus and the sense of his holiness and in Peters own depravity causes Peter to say depart from me Lord for I am a sinner I'm not worthy to be in your presence you can kind of hear the performance lie in him yet Jesus invites them to be a follower well fast forward to when Jennifer talks about John 21 and how Peter he's fishing and and again they have this incredible day of business catching all these fish and John recognizes that is that Jesus is the voice from the beach that said throw your nets on the other side tells Peter and Peter jumps in the water and swims to Jesus now you got to realize this Peter has just committed the biggest failure in his life and instead of saying I can't be around you he actually goes to Jesus which tells us that his understanding of being accepted and valued by Jesus is is so he's so rooted in this and even though he's create this blunder he knows he's accepted and can be with Jesus the power of the performance lie is that my value is connected to what I accomplished or what I can do but but the power of our identity speaks over us is that even in our blunders and our failures that there is a God who still wants to be with us and today I want to talk to you about a different line this different lie that that's spoken over us that that robs us of our identity and it's the people pleaser lie okay it's this idea of that I mean that I need to please people and their approval of me actually gives me value and and to help us in this I've kind of create a little bit of a quiz to help because some of you already know that oh man this is my thing I'd really value what people think about me and others of you you're not really sure so this is kind of help us discover how how tight this grip of people-pleasing this people-pleasing trap has on us so I'm gonna have some questions on the screen have multiple choice a B and C you can self-score a is worth zero points B is worth five points C is worth ten points four questions and we'll just kind of start getting starts slow here go back to high school for you are a high school student maybe this one will make sense to you you just got your driver's license and for six months no one can ride in the car with you except family your friend tells you that they need you to pick them up on the way to school what do you do hey you tell your friend no B you're bringing your mom or dad with you to pick up your friend because that wouldn't be awkward see you pick up your on your way to school okay got your letter all right next question here we go you've had an exhausting week at work and you want to spend Saturday resting your spouse's friend is moving and ask your spouse to ask you for help what do you do eh tell your spouse that you're exhausted and need a day of rest B tell your spouse that you can be there later in the afternoon C somehow you find yourself organizing the entire move third question you're out for dinner with your significant other and you really want your own fries completely fictitious scenario okay your significant other suggests you share an order of fries what do you do eh tell them you're hungry and that they should order their own fries B tell them that you are ordering your own but you'll share a few or C share your fries because that's what Jesus would do last question your friend needs to borrow 50 bucks again they asked you to loan them the money what do you do a tell them no B tell them you can chip in a little but you can't do the whole 50 bucks C you loan them a hundred bucks okay you got it scored and anyone score forty yeah I gotta get a few in the room anyway if if you chose a for every question and you have zero points you need to be here next week because we're gonna talk about control all right we'll talk about that then but hopefully somewhere in between you get a sense of how powerful this this pool is on you in by the way there's a tension to manage here I mean doesn't the Bible say that we are to prefer others above ourselves doesn't Jesus say to deny yourself take up your cross and follow him I mean doesn't he tell us to love our neighbor too to care for other people to show kindness and and to be compassionate and there's a sense of me is it wrong to please your parents is it really bad to please your spouse or your employer that's actually some that's that's good it's good to please people but what we're talking about is when I'm pleasing people and not motivated because I'm trying to be like Jesus I'm motivated because I get validation from other people's approval of me I feel more valuable when people like me that's what we're talking about and that's the trap this this is what robs us of our identity that's rooted in the fact that we are a child of God now proverbs chapter 29 verse 25 says this fearing people is a dangerous trap but trusting the Lord means safety some of you've heard it this way that the fear of man is a snare the message paraphrase says that the fear of human opinion disables I've got a rat trap here I grew up overseas so I'm pretty confident I know how to use these things because I grew up in Malaysia and Malaysia you know we have we had rats I'm out talking rats in America we got rats but they're small they're when you catch a rat in a rat trap like this the the rat trap disappears I mean they're big there's a part of our town we lived in that was called pullout Tikus in in Malaysian what that means is the island of rats so we had a few of them around okay so we'd set traps and I put my glasses on because I want fingers and so we set the trap we put the bait on on the on the trap and I mean you know how this works right you the baits there you're sleeping at night and you probably have this experience but we did it and and then the trap what is brank and devil here because I could really use this help but right now not here yet hopefully comes 11 o'clock okay so the track goes off and then you know and what we learned is when the trapper go off that it then would travel across the room and one time there is this hole in the wall and the rat went through it but the trap is like up against the wall doing this because the trap won't fit through the hole in the wall and and this is exactly what traps do right they they hinder your freedom they trap you they they capture you and and that's exactly what people-pleasing does it traps you it hinders you it keeps you from put this way sometimes we are a collection of other people's expectations and it keeps us from living the life that God has for us let me say that again sometimes you and I become a collection of other people's expectations and we miss out on the life that God has for us so what I want to do today is I want to look at First Samuel Chapter 15 so if you got your Bibles go to 1st Samuel 15 and I want to look at a passage here and highlight for us the ways that we get entrapped in the people-pleasing trap and and then I want to talk about how to get free I want to talk about the idea of getting back to our identity in in Christ if you go to page 241 and your Pugh Bible if you didn't bring a Bible with you pew Bible looks just like the one I'm using page 241 go there now you'll find this story if you're not used to kind of finding your way in the Bible there on that page you'll see big numbers little numbers big numbers are chapters little numbers in between sentences or verses and that's sort of like an address that you can go to to find exactly where we're reading I'm going to read in the top left hand corner of page 241 you'll see a little number 10 there its verse 10 I'm going to read this story but let me just set the context a saw is this guy's name he's the king of Israel and God has given him command he is supposed to go attack these people are called the Amalekites and he's not just supposed to attack them he's supposed to completely wipe them out just just completely wipe them out don't take any the plunder nothing all the animals everything is supposed to be wiped out and killed which kind of that kind of bugs this a little bit you know our sensibilities are a little bit shocked by that but what you need to understand here when you think about the Amalekites think like Isis think about people who've committed atrocities and what God is doing is he is meeting out justice he wants justice to take place and he once saw to take care of that that that justice so me read here verse 10 let's talk about this people-pleaser trap says then the Lord said to Samuel I am sorry that I ever made Saul King for he has not been loyal to me and has refused to obey my command Samuel by the way who's the Prophet was so deeply moved when he heard this that he cried out to the Lord all night early the next morning samuel went to find saw and saw someone told him saul went to the town of carmel to set up a monument to himself then he went to Gilgal when samuel finally found him saw greeted him cheerfully may the lord bless you he said i have carried out the lord's command then what is all the bleating of sheep and goats and the lowing of cattle I hear Samuel demanded it's true that the army spared the best of the sheep goats and cattle saw admitted but they're going to sacrifice them to the Lord your God we've destroyed everything else then Samuel said to Saul stop listen listen to what the Lord told me last night what did he tell you Saul asked and Samuel told him although you may think little of yourself are you not the leader of the tribes of Israel the Lord has anointed you king of Israel and the Lord sent you on a mission told you go and completely destroy the sinners the Amalekites until they are all dead why haven't you obeyed the Lord why did you rush for the plunder and do what was evil in the Lord's sight was hit the pause button there the commands been given Saul did do it he's kind of done part of it and he's confronted and and and you'll see here that Saul becomes a collection of other people's expectations and he indeed misses out on the life that God has for him and here's the first way this people-pleaser trap gets us we end up pursuing other people's destinies that God has a destiny for so isn't it interesting that God says to solve through Samuel that even though you think very little of yourself I mean Saul has a high calling on his life he used to be king of Israel he is the one who was to leave but what's happening in the story is in fact other people are leading him and he ends up pursuing other people's destinies instead of the destiny for himself a being King and obeying God and the thing about this trap and why it's so devastating to us and how we become a collection of other people's expectations is that we forget that we too have a calling that God has gifted us you have been gifted by the Most High God he has a calling on your life and and they would be a big mistake to think little of yourself to think little of that calling Ephesians chapter 2 verse 10 says this for we are God's masterpiece he has created us anew in Christ Jesus so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago when we give in to the people-pleaser trap we end up saying no to the things that God has called us to and yes to the demands of others and we end up pursuing other people's destinies let me keep going here in the text because Samuel i'ma saw was gonna reply to 2 Samuel on verse 20 he says but I did obey the Lord saw insisted I carried out the mission he gave me I brought back King Agag but I destroyed everyone else then my troops brought in the best of the sheep goats cattle and plunder to sacrifice the Lord your God in Google yeah we didn't wipe out everything God but but we're gonna do something religious we're gonna to church with this stuff and we're gonna make sacrifices and Samuel replies what is more pleasing to the Lord your burnt offerings and sacrifices or your obedience to his voice listen obedience is better than sacrifice and submission is better than offering the fat of rams rebellion is as sinful as witchcraft and stubbornness as bad as worshiping idols so because you have rejected the command of the Lord he has rejected you as king then Saul admitted to Samuel yes I have sinned now listen to what Saul says I have disobeyed your instructions and the Lord's command for I was afraid of the people and did what they demanded I was afraid of the people and I did what they demanded sometimes we find that we were a collection of other people's expectations people make their demands of us they want life to happen a certain way if there's something in this so we realize it's not really what I'm supposed to do or I want to do and and and yet the fear of them causes us to make decisions that that run counter to what would it be pleasing to God we're pleasing them rather than God and actually when we become this collection of other people's expectations we find that we're pursuing other people's destinies in the second thing we do is we get led into sin it's the classic peer pressure this this vice that comes in on us that you know I really want this person to like me if I tell him no maybe or if I don't change my mind maybe they'll maybe they won't like me and and our sense of value it's stolen from us by what people think about us a lot of years ago when I was a production manager for lure Jensen in Hood River Oregon it's a fishing tackle manufacturing company I'm walking the hallways I'm checking on different departments and this guy named Raoul comes out and he's got a magazine in his hand it's rolled up in his hand and I could see him kind of looking over his shoulder and looking back and seeing if anyone's around and he comes up to me and he unrolls the magazine in front of me I could see it's a Playboy magazine and he says to me Steve you're not a bible-thumper are you and you ever been there I mean no situation perhaps but a situation where something gets presented to you and you find that there's this pressure on you to be accepted now I didn't like how he was defining what it meant to be a Christian are you a bible thumper and I didn't like the idea that what he knew where this was going he wanted to open the magazine and show me some stuff so I looked at him and I just said you know Rollo I am a bible thumper I'm a follower of Jesus and his face got white and he I think he remembered that I was his boss and he quickly you know jetted down the hallway but you've all been there it may not be that but there's this pressure put on you this pressure to fit in pressure to be light and if you don't give in there's this risk of not being liked by that person somehow your sense of value is attached to them liking you for instance is what's going on the saw he's pursuing other people's destinies and now it's led him to sin and then there's a third thing that happens in this text said very next verse verse 25 Saul says but now please forgive my sin and come back with me so that I may worship the Lord verse 30 says and saw pleaded again I know I have sinned but please at least honor me before the elders of my people and before Israel by coming back to me so that I may worship the Lord your God here's what the third thing into happens this people-pleaser trap it causes hypocrisy it we become this collection of other people's expectations we pursue other people's destinies it leads us in the sin and then it creates this hypocrisy here's what Saul was saying Samuel I look I know I've blown it and I know I gave him the demands of other people and I've sinned but I want you to be with me in front of the others so they can see us together and then they will know that God is with us and they'll I want you to present and like we'll present ourselves together I want them to see an image of me that's different than the reality of me and it creates this hypocrisy and here's the here's the funny thing here's the army of Israel and they've made their ends of saw and hears Samuel over here and and God has made some requests some some demands and Saul is in between the demands of the people the requests of God are the demands of God and listen to language of saw they them the army come with me Samuel so I can worship the Lord your God interesting isn't it he's caught right in the middle Francis is the power the people pleaser trap it snaps on you and you find yourself just hindered and this pressure and sometimes we find that we are a collection of other people's expectations and we miss out on the life that God has for us one other observation I make about the people pleaser trap you won't find it in 1st Samuel 15 but later on today go to John chapter 9 read that story jesus heals a blind man been born blind from birth the religious people that they are not happy about that I don't know why well I do know why because they don't like Jesus and Jesus is the one who's healed him and they're tracking Jesus down and so they're interviewing the blind men and they're trying to figure out what's going on that blind man is calling Jesus a prophet and saying good things about him and they don't like that so they bring in his parents and they bring the parents in and they say is this your son and was he born blind from birth and they they he is our son yes he was born blind from birth they know how he was healed but what they say is he's of age talk to him let him tell you how he was healed and John tells us the reason they deflected was because they were afraid of the threats of being kicked out of the synagogue here's the fourth thing it happens to us when the people please direct gets us we become silent about Jesus we stop talking about him fear keeps us from telling people the best news ever me think about it for a moment who would you be telling about Jesus if fear wasn't gripping you the power of rejection the power of disapproval sometimes paralyzes us it entraps us and hinders us from living the life that God's called us to live and we end up being a collection of other people's expectations and miss the life that God has for us well that's cheery how do we get free from this trap right it's powerful how do we live into this true identity that that we're loved by God and it's not about performance and it's not about people's approval how do we get free from that let me just give you a few options of that then what then we'll wrap up the the first thing I would say is simply this remember that Jesus couldn't please everybody not everyone loved Jesus certainly there were crowds of people that loved to be with him they'd follow him wherever he went and so they could see a miracle or hear his teaching he he had to sometimes find lonely places so he can get away from the crowds there were people who loved being around him but there were people who did not like him because he challenged the structures of the day and they eventually would crucify him Prince jesus said this in Luke chapter 6 Jesus said woe to you when all men speak well of you that should be a bit of a signal flare flag when everyone is speaking good about you you might want to ask yourself the question am i a collection of other people's expectations a second thing I would say is this getting free remember that what it's what seems so important now is only temporary there are things that were really important to you in high school some of you are in high school and there are things that are really important to you now and in 20-30 years they won't be important anymore some of you can think back to high school and what was important was that game getting the part in the play getting good grades going out on that date getting into that college that was important then but you've matured right the things that are important then are no longer important now and that that's that's the gift of maturity you've met immature people that when you go back to your high school reunion they started still talking about that game they're still talking about that moment and that touchdown pass it's like they peaked in the 11th grade all right but what was important then it's not that it was meaningless it was important then it just isn't important now things have time has gone by just it was temporary and and what we have to realize is that one day we will stand before our God and he will declare his love for us and-and-and-and will give an account for our life and what we want to make sure is that we are we are living with an eternal we're making decisions based on an eternal perspective somebody pulled a prank on Walmart some years ago they broke in and changed all the prices took things that were really cheap and made them really expensive and I took really valuable expensive things and made them cheap so that when the doors open and customers started coming in the next day they saw this LCD TV and thought man this thing's usually a thousand dollars just like $9.99 what a great deal and then you know box of pencils or a paper that was in like in a buck 99 was was you know over a thousand dollars it was confusing for people and the stuff that was valuable was cheap the stuff that cheap was a valuable in friendship what we need to understand is this is exactly what the enemy of our souls does he takes the cheap stuff and says this is this is valuable he takes the valuable stuff switches the price tags and says it says it's meaningless and cheap which is why people chase after fame success and money and that's all temporary remember keep an eternal perspective Romans chapter 12 verse 2 says this don't let the world around you squeeze you into its mold but let God remould your minds from within so that you may prove in practice that the plan of God for you is good last thing I would say is this make God big make him big Jeff talked about this earlier that God is in a class all his own Psalm 34 o come let us magnify the Lord together let's exalt his name and make him great this is what we're doing today you are making God big because when we gathers the church we're reminding ourselves of who God is and who we are we're singing at holy holy holy this God is a cut above and he's not just holy and I only had cut above in impurity he's a cut above in mercy and his kind of up in love he's a cut above in compassion in the class all his own what happens is we make God big and these other things come around and people's expectations come our way we can say no to them and be free from the people-pleaser trap but what the enemy of our souls wants to do is switch the price tags and wants us to make people big and when we make people big God gets small he becomes small so friends if you want to be free from this trap make God big and you you will live a life that's approved by him and you will please him you already are pleasing to him but you will honor him with your life and be free from that trap and be able to live into your identity because you are forgiven you are a blessing you've been showered with grace He loves you yes he even likes you and when that sinks in the approval of men a sense of needies perform we don't find our value in that let's pray about that it's the Lord thank you thank you Jesus that you showed us the life that we're called to live you lived it for us or some of the room the the approval rating of those around us and it's just a pressure and stress did you free us would you would you empower us by your spirit to live a life that's pleasing to you that honors you free us from the mold that the world wants to put on us so we can honor your name maybe so
