 thanks will pleasure here thank you for the invitation to come and present about the Vista beyond self sovereignty I say beyond because the work of self sovereignty is really important we're developing some interesting tech as you'll see I'm gonna argue that it's not good enough so I work with the Akasha foundation founded by a lovely chap called me hi Alice II used to work with Vitalik on Bitcoin magazine before Vitalik came up with the idea for a theorem and then they co-founded aetherium together which is now the largest global computer if you like of its kind so I'm really privileged to be working with Akasha on that mission which is the socio technical ramifications of blockchain technologies if you like it's where the the carbon meets the silicon and it co should come together in a beautiful way but as we know it can also be a train wreck so we're trying to work out how we can get this trajectory going in the right direction rather than well the other way who's in the room can I just take a measure who's in the business of technology input operationalizing this tech kind of technology okay that's about half who's a technologist okay that's about half as well maybe some overlap sociologists psychologists thank you welcome ecologists anthropologists Onegin thank you yes complexity scientists love it a little bit of an imbalance that's just sometimes just one representative of some of these other disciplines but the reason I'm asking is because this is a multi or inter or even transdisciplinary topic and if we don't work with each other if you'll excuse the language we're gonna up we are dealing with the human condition here there is nothing more central to our self than identity and people have died through poor bureaucratization of identity in the past people dying today because of poor bureaucratize ation of identity and i know there is no one in this room who wants to see their work lead to people dying through poor identity and the interesting thing is have had lots of good intentions today but there is a phrase of course which you'll have heard that the road to hell is paved with good intentions I've only heard two brief comments about the emergent qualities of the work we're doing here we'll in his presentation and Dave for made such lots about the user the primacy of the individual their sovereignty putting them in the middle of a circle that there's some three-year-old who thinks that they're continuing to be the center of the universe this is not how the world works for every complex problem there are answers that are clear and simple that grab people's attentions but a plainly wrong do you and your colleagues have confidence that you're working on the right stuff and oh I just love this man read everything he ever wrote as far as I'm concerned he's just awesome and just a wonderful multidisciplinary individual who pointed out that the most of the problems that were grappling with as a species are based about based on it's not really understanding how the world works we might project how we think it should work an engineer on that basis but then we mess up because that's not how the world works so my role this afternoon is to try and provide if you like a little bit of a counter position - some of the Nirvana people even use the word stood here this afternoon something nirvana that we think we're building and point out why there's a dystopia waiting just behind it and I this is not me being alarmist look at the current situation of web to go back twelve years people stood here presenting the wonders of web - how many mentioned filter bubbles fake news the rise of political extremism very few I'd imagine so who are we doing this for because there's lots of mentions for the individual and that's kind of like a response to the fact that at the moment is big government big Corp so you know we need some balance but I would argue to the best serve the individual we also have to serve the species and in order to meet the species best interests we need to start with the individual there's a reciprocation here self defining dependency very well known to sociologists under structuration theory never mentioned it in a technology conference and yet I'll put it to you there's no one in this conference would disagree that that is not a bad a vision for what we're trying to design here we need to work out how is 7 billion people flying spaceship earth we might continue to make it a nice place to hang out we might become better concussed OD ins of it we might work with nature rather than against it that's why the Keshe foundation has been formed we want to empower individuals because only through their diversity and their agency might we get collective intelligence at a cultural societal species level we're the first species that we know of any way to have to grapple with a system at global scale and there is surely no way we're gonna do that in paradigms that say I want to control my data it's mine like a three-year-old not wanting to share their toys this stack is based on on Margaret Wheatley's work she looked at how organizations either thrive or just about survive or just die away and she noted that identity is the sense making entity it's the one that sort of is the capacity for organizing but equally overlaps with the the information flows the medium for the organizing and of course the relationships because we are who we know they're required for the transformation of that information into knowledge knowledge into wisdom and an actual fact their Co constitutive perhaps in another language I don't speak there's only one word because these three are so interlinked Co constitutive reciprocally defining you can't tease an identity away from the information as recent presentations at the decentralized web camp in California would have it you can't do that that's just a logical impossibility and equally you can't imagine just taking a static snapshot of those three circles and think I understand where we're at because it's the dynamism of the system that is is key characteristic it's the flow which brings me to another 20 century 20th century hero of mine Bucky fuller and I remember reading this some few decades ago thinking what the hell does he mean and it's only really in the last few years that it's just finally clicked for me how many of you remember when you started your current job are you the same person now as then how many of you know you're gonna go home to a different context this evening and be the same person this evening as you've been today how many of you remember the five year old tottering of the school for the first time now legal identity says you're the same all the way through your psychology says otherwise it's implicit to the human condition we have this malleability this narrative this dynamic this multiplicity right now we're just trying to engineer all that out it doesn't matter to get to identity I need to just first talk about data because I've already said that they are so interlinked that to be able to talk about one without the other is bonkers is a phrase my data you're already a guest by now that I don't particularly like the phrase my data it does two things it says it's data about me and it says it's mine it implies ownership now I'm not the only one to think that the ownership or the prophet Isaiah of data is immoral the general data protection regulator has an ethical supervisor a lovely chap called booter le and boutot le compares ownership of data with the manifestation of markets for live human organs right I mean you company more viscerally than that it's disgusting if you talk to people who want to profit eyes data it's because they haven't had the imagination to think about a world in which property doesn't immediate apply to everything so it's not my data it should be data about me now it describes the subject but without inferring ownership it's something over which I have agency not control if every all of us have control over our data that's a logical impossibility any cyberneticist can tell you that but we have agency and through it I have agency and with it I become I've become inseparable from this digitalization of our relationships so this diagram is not a diagram this is the Newtonian diagram this is places the individual that the middle Rafe eyes them tells them wonderful things they'd like to hear like you can controlled your identity you can own your data we can engineer for it I'm just saying it'll be a disaster because the world actually works a little bit differently looks a little bit like that that's a harder architecture to sell in a conference by the way that's a little bit more challenging but the one on the right is nature that's how the world is and the one on the left is how we'd like the world to be right now and it doesn't matter how we'd like it to be cuz that's how it is personal data is only exists in law there's a legal definition if only to try and stem some of the abhorrent behaviors that emerged in the digital marketing realm in reality we're not like that we're social animals this isn't working there we go we're social animals if you think about anything you might qualify as personal data under that definition it's nice actually interpersonal data even something as personal as they might DNA think about it it can't be my personal data if I go and get my DNA mapped and publish it I've betrayed the privacy of my parents for example and my siblings very very little stuff there's personal data it's all into personal data so let's have a quick comparison of the two because on one hand we're operating in an illegal environment but hey we work in nature personal data talks about data subjects I prefer to the vacuums I'm gonna get bit closer here we go personal data is node century I want it in my vault into personal data lives on the edge privacy preserving socially meaningful one is about control the other ones about agency the other one's true like boy do we love trees in the sciences but it's actually what's known as wrong as o matic a little bit like that diagram that messy picture I showed you earlier one is about facsimile facsimile can never be master your banks not gonna trust your version of their data and yet it's our data because it's my relationship with the banks showing my transactions with other parties it's all interpersonal data and data needs other data to breathe alongside to become information and information each other information to become knowledge so sticking it all in little personal vaults isn't gonna do anyone any good at all fundamentally interpersonal data must be both about privacy and collective intelligence because if it's not we're just looking at the gift horse of the interwebs the thing we so need at the moment we've got some super wicked problems to deal with there's a species and we're gonna just get them right wrong too identity fantastic my favorite quote to introduce identity is from Phil Windley it just it's just it's just a lovely thing to say here because we're so used to 400 years on after the prioritization of identity to think about identity as the bureaucratize ation of identity not in terms of all of its other softer quotidian manifestations and here and so we've heard already that there's no one definition of self sovereignty but this one is from sovereign so fairly central to the community a term used to describe the digital movement that recognizes an individual should own and control their identity without the intervening administrative authorities I like the very last bit they like the first two thirds but let's break it down let's look at the founding principles of SSR a self sovereign identity and see if they stand the test of time the first principle of is existence users must have an independent existence flag number one users sake if you think about having users you're in the wrong mind frame for inventing technology that's closest to the human condition you can possibly get the only other industries that use the word user are the sex trade and the drugs trade right so let's talk about humans and you might believe that identity is an object it doesn't make it so you can believe all you like ain't gonna make it any different and there's any sociologist or student of cultural studies or psychologist or anthropologist all complexity scientist will tell you the I and the we are not separable I am defined by my relationships second principal control this one goes back to 2005 and laws of vital identity that were developed at that time so this has predates self sovereign identity but control is a logical impossibility it's just here we are in an environment who controls the temperature would you like it to go up or down well we can't all control it right agency on the other hand is a negotiation recognizing our sociality as creatures so other disciplines have been grappling grunting with this problem long before us so let's let's just work together I'm a budding web scientist I'm a technologist to start with but I'm trying to be a web scientist co-founded by Tim berners-lee to be interdisciplinary it's the side we're not doing very well in the SSI principles so far right this is not a good score card access users must have access to their own data well there's an irony there because to know that is my data it's got to be identified as me hanging I mean there's a privacy issue there you want to know whether they tracked you're walking through Kings Cross the other day which was in the news recently well there you've got to make sure that they know that space is yours before they can tell you if your face was tracked if you see me smack a child I can't say sorry can you just take that out of your app access archives please and pretend you didn't see that I've got no right to ask others to change the way in which they choose to respond and recognize me I don't have that right doesn't nature and you obviously know why I have a problem with their own persistence doesn't work either outside of the law which has a necessary requirement to bra critize birth and Braque ties death and try and have some connection between the two outside of law there is not one other discipline in which I've emerged myself where I immersed myself where I found any kind of similar claim to persistence no quite the opposite in fact it's just now starting to sound like it's being forced on us and it's really ill-fitting persistence is damaging if I told you that you can only be it seems that five-year-old that's it you are defined that sounds weird how can I not change well you can't because we've developed the technology which locks you in one identity it's yours my only Hollywood gets this they've made movies about it how come they're self-serving identity technology community hasn't got this so here's some real flags when you know it's going wrong you see the optional becoming the compulsory we do it for the individual but then it becomes structured art are in India being case in point an optional identity system no it's not because now 1.2 3 billion people are enrolled if you love one of the last point 1 billion to get to go you're excluded from society on the topic of including in excluding you can't develop for one without developing for the other I've seen a lot of SSI presentations saying they want to include people in the democratic process Breen you're also inventing the basis to exclude people from the democratic process to revisit the clear simple and wrong which I started this presentation with Vlad gets it Vlad's you probably can't see it there or maybe him they're tweeting that saying blimey this really naive social understanding amongst these crypto people really I mean seriously then Chuck pops up and says oh yeah crypto is really hard for these social scientists I couldn't help myself I had to respond and so I actually social science is really hard for these crypto kiddies and to be fair he did actually give me a heart to respond to that so Bojan understands I think that this is has to be an interdisciplinary effort this if there's one facet of information technology where break fast where move fast and break things isn't appropriate its identity course of human condition going back to structuration I'd like to port my eBay seller rating please to my Airbnb host profile I'd like to do that instant reputation I've earned it I'm a good lad what's not to like verifiable claims w3c working group let's get that going as awesome accept the enabling Universal reputation scoring is dystopian once one person's done it it's expected and if you don't do it you're excluded and then before you know it you've created through emergence the very thing the Chinese have deliberated on creating a math state surveillance machinery we just got there a little bit more efficiently through emergence instead of deliberation is this the world we want to design because that's the one we're making path dependencies I won't let's move on friction we heard earlier Evan in removing friction from the system the phrase papers please is associated with police states now I live in a society where I'm not asked for my identity to buy a bagel to flag a cab to play in the park to do a major favor none of these things if we move the friction out from asking then some will ask and some will comply so some others will ask and so some others will comply you can see where that goes friction is an important system property yes frictionless free endless copying is a feature not a bug of the interwebs this is wonderful but let's be careful on how we just apply it I then separate identity into two concepts one a noun like these are the ones with which every technologist is familiar because these are the ones that they're designing and the verb like the noun like don't change by design actually I've only got the one birth certificate if I lost it I can get another one reissue bit of a challenge but that's because there's this kind of a copy back there somewhere I've got Passport kind of just gets updated every 10 years because my biometric my face changes these things don't change by design and they're used on rare occasion the verb like are every living moment of our lives and yet I've been in presentations today where there's 15 20 different facets of life where we can get this amazing identity systems to change things up it's like a disease we're gonna be infected we won't be able to move we won't be able to respond and grow as individuals it's it's not generative is deed narrative that's what's gonna happen if we get this wrong this one which we think is quite hard to design for technologically it's actually a lot easier to design technologically than that one so we'll do that one and that one will get squished your psychological safety is at risk in fact one of the biggest psychological problems you might have his anxiety about your personal safety in this kind of outcome Akasha we believe that generative identity is essential in fact existential are all of those levels from the individual's psychological safety so societal well-being if you like but also to our living in harmony with nature to ecological health and we've got a number of principles that we're playing with right now we're trying to up forge the questions to ask rather than trying to provide the answers but we're happy to spend some time doing that and we're pleading with the rest of the community identity community to do just the same just to just hit pause well you guys because and gals because this is not going in the right direction generative identity principle number one is change you can't cater for collective intelligence to emerge you can't cater for the emergence at all if you rule out the ability for change principle number two is Co Constitution we are not separating into personal data and identity they are Co emergent coraline reciprocally defining Co constitutive whatever they're just inseparable there's an omnidirectional T here which is a little bit tricky to get your head around because there are no inputs and outputs there's just movement and flows of data it's a continual flux there were no date of alts no dated banks anything that implies something you store stuff in is the wrong analogy altogether well sure how we're gonna do this one to be honest no idea I know that it's probably what we've done in technical code I know that we'll need societal norms and legal code to pull a apart as well if you're familiar with Larry Lessig's codes of cyberspace it all needs to be in the mix in order to reintroduce some of the frictions that have been essential to the human condition and societal health and ecological health to date and finally the complete mind twister for the software engineer called blessum is that you can have generativity or you can have universality you cannot have both so if we want the facility to continue to grow as individuals grow as cultures grow as societies grow as a species in harmony and we have to dismiss universality we have to go down a layer and produce some protocols that allow others to instantiate those protocols in ways that suit their way of seeing the world their ways of being in that particular moment in time into personal data and generative identity is way bigger than the Akasha L comes n 15 of us in the in the foundation we are going to make no difference whatsoever by ourselves which is why we'd love opportunities like this to come and address some audiences who'll get this I don't believe there's anything I've said there that's spheal or literate right I feel like everybody gets it here because everybody's in the room with good intentions so let's have this conversation see if we can channel those good intentions in ways that are good for us psychological health or societal health and our ecological health thanks very much you you
