 - [Interviewer] Date of birth? - [Anthony] Friday 31st of December, 1937. (curtains clicking) - [Interviewer] You were living with your daughter at the moment? - Yes, until she goes to live in Paris. - No dad. Why'd you keep going about Paris? - You told me. - No, I didn't. - I'm sorry Anne, you told me the other day. Have you forgotten? She's forgotten. Paris. They don't even speak English there. (somber music) - [Anne] Dad, I'd like you to meet Laura. - How do you do, sir. - I'd say you're gorgeous. - Thank you. (Anthony laughing) - I'd say he's jolly. - Yeah, not always. - Laura has come around to help you. - Don't you need her or anyone else. I can manage very well on my own. (somber music) - Everything all right? - Who are you? - Anthony it's me, Paul. - Who? - I live here. - What is this nonsense? Anne? - It's me. - Ah, there she is. - [Paul] Your father seemed a bit confused. - Something wrong? - Where's Anne? - Sorry? - Anne, where is she? - I'm here. (somber music) - [Anne] What's the matter Dad? - [Anthony] Strange things going on around us. - Don't worry, everything will sort itself out. - Saw in his eyes, didn't know who I was. It was like I was a stranger to him. It just did something to me. - I didn't know what she's cooking up against me, but she's cooking something up. - What are you talking about Dad? - I'm not leaving my flat. I am not leaving my flat! This really is my flat. Isn't it? (dramatic music) See, the situation is very simple. My daughter is of the opinion that I cannot manage on my own. - I'm so sorry about this. - Why? She understands perfectly. (dramatic music) - This is important. I explained it all to you. - Why you keep looking as if there's something wrong? Everything is fine. - [Paul] I think she tries to do the best she can to you Anthony. - [Anne] Everything will be all right, I promise you. (dramatic music) - There's something funny going on. (somber music)
