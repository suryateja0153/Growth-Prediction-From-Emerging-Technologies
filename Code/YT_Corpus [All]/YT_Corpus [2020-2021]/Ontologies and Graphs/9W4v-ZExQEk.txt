 I'm Jana Hastings and I'm the ontology consultant for the human behavior change project our ontology is a structured representation of knowledge in the domain captured in a computable so computers can understand it format but also annotated with text for humans to understand so ontology solves the several problems at the same time one is that they standardized terminology and help to structure a whole domain that it's possible to aggregate research across the field this is often difficult when things are called different things in different studies but they might mean the same thing or call the same thing it might mean different things that's one way that ontology has helped to help science another way is that they make it possible to do computational applications which helped researchers to sort of move forward like automated meta analysis and synthesis so ontology is are structured hierarchically so they include classes and relationships between classes and if you visualize the content of your ontology then it looks like a graph structure with classes interrelated and each class has got a label and a definition and the relationships are standardized so that you can understand them in in it in a systematic way the anthologies are developed through a multi-step process which aims to ensure that the ontology that has been developed meets standards of best practice in ontology development so one of the steps is that any Content that can be reused from already existing ontology is incorporated if it makes sense to do so and this is to prevent proliferation of similar ontology content in different ontology it's best to reuse it if possible the ontology development process also involves knowledge capture from domain experts so they domain experts are thinking about the knowledge in their domain and trying to capture it in a structured way but then very importantly it involves a review process with stakeholders and members of the community in order to check it's not just the core ontology development team who developed the ontology but somehow incorporating feedback in a structured way from other members of the community in order to be sure that what is developed is valid for the community as a whole the ontology development uses standard tools and procedures such as the Protege ontology development software and the web ontology language which is standard for intelligent development across domains so the method that's been used to develop the ontology has been described more completely in an a school in the welcome open research collection dedicated to the human behavior change project and there are also other articles in that collection describing the different ontology files and their specific content
