 today I'm excited to introduce the newest capability of MarkLogic data hub service data hub central hub central provides a collaborative self-service experience for continuous data integration to create explore and share consistent and fit for purpose data assets it's designed for your data experts to work directly with your data so they can build your data hub without writing any code MarkLogic has never been easier to use than it is today data hub central is powerful out-of-the-box but it's also extensible so while your data experts are using hub central to build the hub your developers can write use reusable components that extend and customize the tools to make them more powerful for your data experts to use and for the first time ever hub central allows your business users direct access to the data in the hub with a powerful search capability that lets them discover what data is available and shop for the exact data they need to solve their business problems these datasets can be saved and shared and reused with other tools like power bi and tableau all with the governance and access control enforced in the data hub itself so let's walk through an example of how data hub central empowers your data experts to work together to solve business problems before we get into the details let's paint the picture sunrise insurance is a midsize insurance company with two lines of business home and auto these lines of business are managed independently so they run pretty efficiently and they can respond to trends in their individual markets but as often happens this independence has resulted in a poor customer experience customers complain of having to deal with different systems and processes when looking up or updating information or when making claims sometimes they even get cross cell solicitations to buy products that they already have they have to call a different number or get transferred to a different division to get answers on their home policy than their auto policy it seems like the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing most of the time to fix this sunrise needs a 360-degree view of their customers so that everyone is working off the same information but instead of doing a multi-year project before they can see any value sunrise has decided to build a mark logic aha which lets them focus on getting value quickly and then building on that value iteratively over time with GDP our in the European Union and now the California consumer Privacy Act it's more important than ever that sunrise have a handle on what customer data they have so the first project they've decided to tackle is creating a single customer profile so their employees can view and update customer information in one place for all lines of business a key feature of hub central is that it's designed to be used directly by your data experts that means your team will use it to collaborate on building your data hub each providing his or her own expertise to illustrate this let's meet our cast of characters meet Belinda the business analyst Belinda helps the business make data-driven decisions she's an expert user of Excel and a variety of BI tools and maintains a set of reports that the business uses to make decisions and evaluate the results Belinda is the go-to expert whenever there's a new decision that could benefit from some data analysis Belinda knows what data she needs and she knows what to do with it when she gets it but to do her job well she needs quick reliable access to relevant data and that sometimes hard to find in her organization next we have Stewart Stewart is a data architect and a data steward he's responsible for defining and governing the logical data model for the company in other words how the company thinks about the data that's important to them things like customers policies and claims he's also responsible for ensuring that the data is well governed and that the company's security and policy rules are enforced as data is used for various purposes throughout the organization Stewart understands data well but he's not an expert in how data is physically modeled in the source systems like the company's ERP system that role belongs to Sara our systems analyst she's intimately familiar with what data exists in various operational systems in her organization she knows how that data is represented in those systems and how it's used and managed there she also knows how to connect to those data sources and extract raw data from them each person has a piece of the puzzle and all will need to work together to solve it but they can all use data hub central to work together on the solution let's take a look to get started Stuart meets with Belinda to understand what needs to be in the combined customer profile at least for the first iteration they decide to keep it simple at first and expand the profile with additional information as needed so for now they just want to focus on contact information like name address and phone number and policy numbers for any policies the customer has stewart navigates to hub central and instead of taking notes in email working with Belinda he sketches out the requirements directly in the tool this will become the definition for the Sunrise entity model this entity model will combine and govern the source data and make it available to the various downstream systems so everyone can work off the same model to produce views of the data that work for them no matter what their use case the entity model is what makes a mark logic data hub a reusable durable data asset for the company what's that's done Stewart asks Sara to take a look at the model and see what data we have that can provide this profile information Sara can sign in and view the model but she's not authorized to update it since Stewart owns it because she knows the source systems and the source data well Sara knows that we have email addresses for customers in the auto database at least so she suggests that we add email to the model as well while Stewart adds the email field Sara doesn't have to wait she loads some sample records from the auto policy system and looks at how they might map to the new model that Belinda's looking for she can see the source data which was loaded as is into the data hub and compare its model with the target entity model she can use this tool to plan how to map the data from the source to the entity model that Stewart and Belinda are looking for rather than write up her findings in an Excel spreadsheet she can work directly in hub central hub central provides dozens of built-in functions she can use but the function library is extensible so she needs a mapping function that is not included she can have her IT department provide one for her this is a great example of how hub central lets everyone focus on where they add the most value sarah can test out her mappings as she goes scrolling through her sample data to see how the mapping functions would execute against her samples when Stewart is done adding the email property to the model sarah can quickly refresh the tool and immediately see and map the new filled help central makes it easy for data experts like Stewart and Sarah to work together without having to wait on one another what Sarah's happy with the mappings she shoots an email to Belinda to have her check out the work-in-progress to see if it's what she expects Belinda can view the source data and mappings and test the results but she can't edit or update the mappings because that's not her role hub Central has granular role-based permissions for viewing or editing so sunrise can control who can see and do what in the tool this is the first time Belinda has actually seen the data that's available and she can see that there are makes models and model your information for the autos in the policy data she doesn't need that info now but she'll keep that in mind so that she can request it later if it's useful she also sees some demographic information and she thinks that might be useful for some analysis she's doing so she asks Stewart and Sarah to add that to the model while Stewart is updating the model Sarah loads records from the home policy system this is an older system and the best way for her to get the data out is as a giant CSV file to batch load it she extracts some sample rows and loads them into hub central to look at what's available in this system the home system has less interesting data than the auto system but it does have two addresses an insured asset address and a separate billing address Sarah asks Belinda which one she wants and Belinda asks her to use the billing address but to include the insured asset zip code in the policy information they also decide they need a new property to designate the policy type once again Stewart updates the model and Sarah Maps the data with the model revised and data mapped Sarah runs a sample batch of a thousand records each from home and auto and then asks Belinda to take a look Belinda opens up the hub central explorer and can search and view the combined customer records from the home and auto systems central explorer uses the model stewart developed to present the data in ways that make sense and to let belinda search slice and dice the data by facets she's amazed this is the first time she's ever been able to do that and even though it's just 2,000 test records it's pretty cool she can save her queries and export the data from them into tableau or Excel so she's really looking forward to using the tool once it's fully populated with hub central Belinda collaborated with other data experts at sunrise Insurance to build a data asset that she can use to self-serve the data she needs whenever she needs it she didn't need to involve the IT department and get in an application development queue and when she needs new data she's confident she can work quickly with Sara and Stewart to add just what she needs while being able to leverage the work they've already done for new use cases
