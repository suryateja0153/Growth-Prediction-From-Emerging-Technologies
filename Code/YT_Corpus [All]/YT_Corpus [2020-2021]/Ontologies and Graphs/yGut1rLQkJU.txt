 good afternoon to everybody thank you very much this is the webinar number six of the share4rare platform and it's focused to explain and to introduce to all of you in how your data is processing in the share4rare platform my name is Begonya Nafria and I'm the share4rare project coordinator at Sant Joan de Déu children's research foundation in Barcelona in Spain and it's my pleasure today to have in this webinar the expert of our project in data science Alex Perera Lluna he is a research member of the group B2Slab in the Polytechnic University of Catalonia these are the main rules of this webinar first of all we want to inform to all of you that this webinar is going to be recorded and uploaded in the share4rare YouTube channel you can share with your contacts on with your close people in order to disseminate about the share4rare for any question that you can have along the webinar are you can use the chat box at the end we are going to have a time for questions and answers and it is going to be a pleasure to answer all the questions that you will rise in this in this box always you can reach us via the the formative email of our project and also we encourage you to join to the conversation using the hashtag S4Rwebinar this is the agenda of the women are up today first of all we are going to introduce to all of you in the share4rare platform secondly we are going to work in an introduction about what means data science and also explain how it's the collaborative knowledge that we are going to generate in the share4rare platform we are going to introduce also to all of you in the share4rare community this is a global social network focus in pediatric rare conditions and at the end we are going to have time for the questions and answers as I explained previously share4rare is a European Project granted by the European Commission that has a main aim to build the biggest social network on rare diseases at the same time that we are going to encourage and promote the clinical data donation with the aim to foster research in this group of conditions that as you know basically are orphan of information and research initiatives we have three important objectives in our platform the first one is to educate for us it's very important to offer important information about your condition it's an objective the education in order to improve the management of the disease that we know also that contributes the quality of life of patients and families we are going to publish several medical content in the public layer of the platform at this moment if you access to the website of the share4rare platform you will see the first book regarding this educational material that is for publishing a toolkit for patient advocacy and in the upcoming weeks we are going to publish in the same area of the public website medical content regarding several oncology diseases and also about several muscular disorders in these both groups of rare conditions we are going to promote the results in the share4rare platform thanks to the clinical data donation the second objective of our platform is to share because we know that it's crucial and very important for the patients and for their families with a rare disease to share information between them to share experiences and to learn together in this sense we have built our local community of patients and families this is a development of the platform that at this moment is working you can access this is a private environment and it's only addressed through adult patients and caregivers or other kind of relatives of pediatric patients the innovative of this global community is that it has been designed with patients and patients organizations and advocates and the aim of this global community is to offer a huge community of people that according with your needs can answer the questions that you can rise to this big community alex is going to explain in more detail how it works but we have algorithms of artificial intelligence helping us to facilitate the process to target these questions to the audience it means that if you have any specific question that can be answered for another people for another person probably with the same condition the same phenotype or in the future probably you know you will select the country of this person this question will be shown to these people in first position instead in the in the global collection of questions in the community and the third and the last principle our main objective of our platform is research we know that patients and families have a lot of information that probably never is used for research we know because we are a pediatric Hospital in Spain based in Barcelona that the information that patients and families have is very important for us and the aim of share4rare is to collect this information in this private and secure environment in order to facilitate better or well description of the natural history of the disease also all these data can facilitate us to work on designing prognosis algorithms patients databases also collect information that it's so relevant for other kind of projects like clinical trials these are the patient reported outcome measures these are very relevant and in the past never have been considered at all this collection of information in research and also the aim of these different tools that are going to facilitate research basing the data of the patients in share4rare we expect that we'll promote other kind of projects these are the list of conditions both groups of diseases have between them main commonalities and the idea is to work and analyze all the data by the individual conditions but also using the approach to analyze all this information as a group of conditions with the aim as I mentioned to describe better this is the decision to probably identify information that have never been studied in these diseases these are the partners of our project the initiative is coordinated by our research institution Sant Joan de Déu and the other partners involved for the Synergist this is a company based in Belgium they are working with us in the design of the platform and in the co-design workshops with patients we have the expertise of the neuromuscular disorders from the team of Newcastle University the expertise and the needs of the patients of oncology disorders are represented by the colleagues of Melanoma Patient Network Europe on behalf of the patient with a neuromuscular disorders we have the World Duchenne Organization and the team that is involved in the IT development are Omada and also the University Polytechnic of Catalonia where our speaker today is working and the last partner Asserta is helping us in the design of the sustainability model of the platform the platform is design in a mobile first version it means that you can access you can interact from your laptop but also from your mobile and this is the general introduction all your questions can be rise in this text box and now is the time for Alex Alex is going to speak about the data science and the model that we are using in the share4rare platform it's my pleasure to introduce Alex and thank you very much for for your expertise and for your time today in this webinar thank you okay do you hear me yeah great so let me talk about the design in terms of data science that we have thought for the share4rare platform and there may be a unique or a concept a central design concept for the share4rare platform is to have collaborative intelligence in its core working system so collaboratory intelligence is a system in which each human is actually contributing to a problem solving in a distributed system working as a network so one example of this in which I can pass to the next slide yeah thank you one example of this is one example that I'd like to share which is the Tesla Tesla cars are interesting products because as you drive the cars the cars are learning how you are driving even if you have not bought the autopilot feature from a Tesla car so even if even when you are driving but you have not bought the autopilot feature you are teaching a central piloting software which is learning from you and the rest of drivers to learn and Tesla is distributing this and there Tesla is distributing this software distributing the software so that all the cars can actually drive maybe a pilot study for the share4rare it was an initiative that Sant Joan de Déu Hospital took which we also contributed which is the Rare Commons platform the Rare Commons platform was and still is working as a platform in which you can enroll and ask questions and provide data about your condition or the condition of somebody in your family and then you can talk or interact with other patients or our caregivers around the world so this is taking us to the system that we have designed in the share4rare platform so the system it's actually based in in two essential parts the first one is a system in which the caregivers and the patients are donating data and the second part is a system in which you can ask questions and these questions are not thrown into a forum as in a general website but these questions are propagated through a network as we will see later on so these two bars these questions and answer systems and the data duration is what I will try to explain in the following slides so in the first part of the data donation we centered the concept of interaction of the data with a platform using equity as a key value so you give as a caregiver or you  as a patient give data upfront and this data is guiding your interaction with the platform so in this way when you provide your data you are instantly given back with information about the distribution of the rest of patients regarding to your position or your children or your patient so this equity concept in which you give data and the platform gives statistical data to you is is central which data are you giving so we we think that profiling the patient it is important and the main idea is that you can donate different kinds of data like diagnosis of course may be genetic variants which have been helpful for the diagnosis symptoms in a very specific way as we will see later on and a number of questionnaires that are going to help us to put you in the map in relationship with the rest of of patients right and then the system is allowing different profiles to enroll in which are patients caregivers clinicians and researchers and all of them they are going to have a role in the data management and then in in this data processing there is a central at the end of the workflow of the enrolling you will see that there are actually two parts in which is the data sharing and the research part okay which is what you see here right so after identity is validated and the the diagnosis is also validated you can share data which is going to be contributing to the research and the research is going to be contributing with information about your disease as much as you contribute with the data so throughout the community we are going to be learning the features on the different learning rate of diseases and help into research and patient gain information so I thought that sorry I said before that one of the features that we want to do is to have upfront profiling so you will see that the patient as the system as you enroll you have a short questionnaire with typical data concerned about participation and so on you will see that you can state your diagnosis you can also if you are not diagnosed you can also state that you are not diagnosed and still you will be contributing into the system and in the next step of the registration you will see that you will be queried on the symptoms and these symptoms you can describe them using very specific phenotype or symptoms database which is the human phenotype ontology that I'm going to be explaining later on so when you fill up or you declare your symptoms you're going to declare the symptoms we that we will try to be as much as specific as possible and all the symptoms they have an idea that they are curated into a catalog of symptoms that I'm gonna describe this catalog of symptoms is the human phenotype ontology an ontology is a standardized vocabulary or dictionary of terms and these terms are actually describing different abnormalities that we can observe from patients in nowadays HPO contains over more than 10,000 terms it's also supported by the Monarch Initiative and and it's also translated to several languages so how do we so the structure of HPO is a hierarchy in which there is a top note like for instance organ abnormality and this abnormality can belong to the different areas like the neural system or abdomen or musculoskeletal or connective tissue so when you declare a number of symptoms you will see that some of these notes you're declaring some of these notes on the human ontology so remember that this ontology is actually very large it stands on most terms so it's very difficult that you actually state a particular term identical to another patient so in the next slides you'll see an example of an annotation right so you will see that for one particular patient a patient is going to be declaring abnormality of the skeletal system or flexing contracture and so on once a patient has declared their symptoms or their phenotypes you will see that what we are able to do is to compare a pattern of activation on this tree of different terms which is very very organized to the characteristic trees that you find on for instance diseases right so we can check diagnosis or compatibility of the diagnosis with different yeah different diseases but maybe the most interesting part is that we can compare how the terms are declared these symptoms are declared between patients so even for a similar disease there is going to be variability in the symptoms that we observe and this variability it may be just because of randomness or because the disease has some structure and when we begin grabbing or gathering data from a collective for a particular disease we're going to be learning about the structure of these symptoms and of course we can compute similitude matrix right it's a number just stating how similar patients are between them once we have this matrix of similarity we can plot or conceive a mathematical object which is a graph so if you think of Facebook for instance when you play and when you participate in Facebook you are participating in a system in which you are connected to different people in the share4rare platform we connect you with other people in terms on how similar these people is to you in your profiling and this is very creative profiling it will start with your symptoms declaration so once we have these similarities we can actually find structure in our particular disease just using mathematical algorithms which try to find groups of different phenotypes belonging to the same disease and we can use different metrics for computing these similarities like the questionnaires not only the human phenotype ontology but also questionnaires about quality of life targeted studies and others okay maybe in the second part of slides I would like to talk a bit on how we can we want to build community in terms of this question and answer system so the idea in this question and answer system is that we also use the patient profiles this upfront profiling that you get when you enroll into the share4rare system joining with your questions this is essentially mixing artificial intelligence database concepts data science and patient profiling so what we want to do is to avoid classical form a structure on the different profiles in which you ask a question on a forum and then the different the other participants they have to look for each one of the questions looking at the subject of each one of the questions you can have a lot of pages you can have a lot of forums in which you want to seek so so in the share4rare platform we want to provide a different scheme in which we want to avoid this forum structure and we want to help avoiding recurrent questions and we want to do this using two concepts the first is to maximize the probability that your question reaches to relevant people and then to maximize the probability that that these people are providing relevant answers okay so how we are going to do this so we have this simulated graph this mathematical object which is like a Facebook network in which we connect to each other so what we are going to do is to apply a kind of arrowing which are called diffusion this diffusion it's based on some research that if you are interested in more things you can look for it it's open research so you everybody can read exactly how this is done and essentially what we are doing is applying a mathematical score which is propagating through the network so in this score it's like when information is diffusing on Facebook right and the Facebook network you ask something or you publish something and this is seen by your friends and your friends are relating this post to other friends so in the share4rare network we have this graph that you will see in the next slides so what you can see here is the a graph for instance computed using HPO similarity and then if assume if you assume that you are the top right icon right is me that you see on the top right on the screen and you ask a question it's like you get activated into this network so in the next slide you will see it's highlighted as thread and then this question it gets diffused through the graph in a continuous manner so the people which is closer to you and this means that they have a most similar profile to you they are going to get this efficient score higher than other people in the network so you will see it yes in the next slide you will see it that this is reflected for instance as a way to ordering the questions to you so we are using this relevant score in which you will see a number or a color code attached to each one of the questions and this means that this question has been posed by a patient or a caregiver which has a lot of similarity and to you as a patient or as a profile and we believe that this is going to help a lot in defining to who reaches the question and who disabled to us to ask the questions you will see in the user interface that you are able to type your question into stages so you will be able to ask first your questions and then a more detailed text explaining what exactly do you want to find this answer you can also define scopes that we are not using them but we might there is a filtering sorry yes we are using them you can also filter this questions given a scope set and then given this scope selection these questions are going to be ordered by relevance from the people like me information so we are we will be using this network information in several ways and we are doing active research in this area in which what we are doing is applying concepts which are called multi-view data in which from the same network is the same set of patients they are connected in different ways and these different ways they can actually help us to understand the structure of the patients and this is active research and I ask you please to contact us if you have more interest in these matters and how we are doing research using these Network information of patients okay so just to finish by my talking here just to say that we are building this share4rare platform with a lot of before we are trying to put our best and small diseases are actually small data there is a lot of research that it's it's actually talking about Big Data and rare diseases are not only rare but it's also small data so from all the data science people they are not really paying attention into the rare disease data processing in all these artificial intelligence and all these research skills so what we are trying to do is to foster this small data in a way that it's not a small data anymore and so it can be similar to its Big Brother big data thank you very much Alex for your explanation about the data model of share4rare I want to add that probably instead of considering it small data in the field of rare diseases it's smart data because it helps to us first of all to connect and identify patients with commonalities because sometimes even the small number of patients are the phenotype is quite diverse in one condition and the other point is that if we have to know less about these rare diseases probably in a close future will be easy to set up any other kind of research projects said this thank you again Alex for your explanation as we mentioned the basis on the pillars of share4rare the patients is the data that you can provide to us are your interactions in platform because qualitative data also has a very an important value for for us on this platform it's a platform that has been designed for the patients with the patients but still we are improving and working with new developments in fact I want to invite all of you to disseminate and also if you are interested to participate in a hackathon that we are going to celebrate in Barcelona the first week of July in order to involve scientific people from the IT field and also from the clinical setting with patients in order to design a chatbot to improve the functionality and the user experience of the of the share4rare platform another upcoming event will be webinars like these to explain in more detail new tools of the share4rare and also to introduce the tools for putting research that this is going to come very very soon and you are going to be also invited to to participate and for the people that probably will live in Barcelona or closer to us we are going to celebrate the fourth of July face to face presentation for patients on staff of patient organizations or other kind of people interested in the initiative in in our Hospital in Sant Joan de Déu Children's Hospital this is the information about the RareHacks that I mentioned you can access additional information in the website of this event say this is the time if you have any kind of questions and answers you have a very relevant expert in in our community that is Alex and also myself if I can help in any way to solve all your comments or questions please use the text box of the of the system and we will be happy to answer any kind of comment from your part thank you
