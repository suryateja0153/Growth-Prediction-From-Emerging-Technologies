 [Music] starting today we're actually going to step into module four where we say look we've seen a lot of failed projects and we've seen why they fail what can we do differently right so what are some strategies that we can sort of use and every class the idea is to pick one idea talk a little bit about it maybe see if it can be applied in a case situation and see if you can add that into your toolkit of planning and developing infrastructure projects okay so that's the plan so the plan today will be it's actually a little bit of the opposite of what we do I'm first going to invite Rahul's group group 10 is it 11 group 10 to make their presentation on the readings right and there are essentially a couple of ideas that come out of the readings that they'll discuss and then we'll have a chance to discuss them a little bit after which we will select will have one of the selected group come in and present the RER ponga case study will present the case study I'll show you a small video on the project we can watch that and then we can sort of discuss that project okay so also by way of introduction we have in class with us today professor Vince Mangione Vince is a professor at the university of technology at sydney and works quite a bit in the areas of infrastructure planning land appraisal evaluation and so on and he's actually had a lot of practical experience working in the industry as well in the in the larger infrastructure space so since Vince is here I'm going to have him pick at random the group that will present today so good afternoon everyone I'm Jimmy I'll be presenting a stakeholder mapping approach one of the three approaches that our group will be presenting for the analysis of the relationships between the stakeholders and their interactions firstly who our stakeholders will be concerning our interest in only in the construction project stakeholders are not only the clients that are directly involved in the project but they're also the users of the facility and the community basically the bystanders of the project so who are these clients should they be viewed as a single entity where they'll be acting on a same word on same decision or they're a group of people with different levels and types of powers and interest in the project viewing the clients as a single entity is a approach that was made very long ago and this is not relevant and is not in use in present age so clients are viewed as a group of people with different levels and types of powers and interest so these clients or the stakeholders have basically these four attributes they are expectations stakeholders have few expectations before taking up a project they have your interests in particular part of the project or on the whole of the project they have power to change the decision or make a decision and a predictability of the stakeholder it is where you can be able to predict whether a stakeholder will react or will not react to a particular change in decision coming to the project organizations they can be defined as shifting multi-goal coalition's where clients will not be the same and even if clients are not same their decisions will not be the same they may be changing because of these changes there will be conflicts so how do we deal with these conflicts is two main methods are sequential at attention or buying of opposition sequential attention is where you solve the problem and making the stakeholder silent buying off opposition is through side payments to the stakeholders coming to the project strategy how you deal with the project strategy or how you deal with the change in the project strategy shows the rise in veil in the power of the participants how you deal with the project's strategy shows how powerful you are and why is power needed to retain the status quo of that particular company or particular stakeholder and also to enforce the fundamental changes when you find something is wrong in the project Chemical stakeholder analysis it is nothing but interactions between the stakeholders a primary shape stakeholders in the secondary stakeholders primary stakeholders are those who are directly involved in the project the contractor the developer the designers and and all secondary stakeholders are not directly involved in the project they are the bystanders how they interact with each other how they interact with other organizations and how they respond to changes is what stakeholder analysis looks at first part of stakeholder analysis is the interactions two types of interactions are there in the stakeholder interactions they are - cultural arena where stakeholders discuss and they cooperate among they cooperate and take decisions which is nothing but centripetal force that guides the interactions second thing is a political arena where only a group of powerful stakeholders and force their decisions on other stakeholders which leads to competitions and conflicts which is nothing but centrifugal force where none of them agree upon a single decision and how are these conflicts there are many types of conflicts and major important ones of those are long term versus short-term objectives when decisions and objectives have to change because of particular events happening in the course of the project cost efficiency was his Jobs quality versus quantity is one important conflict that occurs in almost all construction projects control versus independence each stakeholder wants to be independent while working that may not happen in all the projects and this conflict is this can be attributed to almost all the projects not only construction project coming to the analysis it depends upon the predictability power interest and the possible impact of the stakeholders expectations of the project strategies so one method of analysis of the stakeholders interactions is stakeholder mapping it can be done in two different ways one is power predictability matrix and power interest matrix as you can see in the diagram the first one is power predictability matrix there are four zones of stakeholders where in the first Staker first one of stakeholders have low power and high predictability with such a zone you will have very few problems while taking up the project and the other extreme is high power and high predictability sorry high power and low predictability you don't know how they react to the change in the decisions but they are very powerful so these are the dangerous with all of the stakeholders that have to be managed coming to the power and interest matrix in the dangerous zone of the stakeholders is in the c block wherein they have high power and low level of interest they might change their interest when the decisions made are not satisfying them so the main interest of a project manager or who deals with the project is to keep them satisfied and there is a high chance of free positioning of the zones C and D when there is a dissatisfaction in those zones usually when you try to satisfy the zone C of stakeholders in the power interest metrics as you see there it might not be in agreement with the zone D so they might get a very aggressive while taking these decisions so there can be repositioning of the zones C and D but that doesn't mean a and B are not important they also have a very important stake in the decision taking process and all these relations vary over time and they also depend on the stage of the project because not all contractors and designers work throughout the project they have certain period and they vary over time stakeholder management principles is a very important thing that has to be focused in the projects nowadays the first approach to this is the Machiavellian approach where a project manager has to maintain the stakeholders interests against the opposing forces when there are developers contactors designers and local authorities not all of them will be on the same road so balancing both of them is one of the important duties of a project manager the project manager also has to make sure that there isn't much repositioning of the zones of the stakeholders like Zone C to zone D they must not shift aligning themselves or wise decisions enforcing the change if a project manager aligns himself to a particular group that doesn't help the project go in a proper way wise decisions enforcing the change is when he takes decisions of a majority or something like that alliances between the stakeholders against outside stakeholders when they're here when there are stakeholders that are very powerful and are trying to influence the project with their power they can be alliances between the stakeholders that are inside the project and they can act against the outside stakeholders this has to be taken care by the project manager and the internal coalition's versus external coalition's is also the same they can be active or passive with respect to the power and interest at that particular point of time on the stage of the project another approach of the stakeholder management is the Kantian approach where it has two principles of management the first principle involves management of the project for the benefit of all of its stakeholders and their rights their rights must be ensured and it must benefit all of its stakeholders it's like a consensus principle to is where a project manager has to act in both the ways in the interest of the stakeholders as their agent and in the interest of the project to ensure its survival another approach of the analysis of these stakeholder relations will be continued by my friend so note about the social network analysis the social network analysis the modeling of the relationship between the pupil the group's organization computers etc I think you know the social network analysis care text white notes and links not representing of pupil and or groups linking represents a relation between the nodes in the pluralism both we should and mathematic analysis of human relationship the locations of nodes and links very important in the social network analysis they represent the various roles and the grouping greatest roles in the social network analysis the network a network effectively shows the distinction between the three most individual centrality measures then at social network is the property of social network analysis represent by the three brushes like degree of centrality and betweenness centrality and also closeness of centrality the degree of centers in measure the importance of the importance or the influence of the network for example in the in this figure the DNA's have more connection with other members nodes so in this figure the diny some degree of center at the degree of center is more for the day and the B diminished centrality measures the number of times no trace in the shortest path with even the nodes it means in this figure fernado and Gary there are the shorter distance between certain distance to coming with other members in the network the closeness and loyalty dimension is how long it will take to spread the information to all the nodes from the figure we can see that either a tilde if I head there and if are not and Gary will take the less distance to distance to to spread the information in the network the networks and relation the individual addiction relation provides our insight into the individual locations a network the ISA very very centralized network so dominated by Iran or few very central nodes if the nodes are the remote or damaged if the network quickly fragments into unkind sub networks the shorter paths in the network be some more important than the the larger path Network the network endure integration is more important in the social network analysis well in degree network this path void local both local and distinct information in this case boundaries - means who connect the network in the part other parts of the network network for example not a nun Gary Heather that guides the other part of the network other clusters see these they have the I have the access to various information flowing other clusters they are the position in to combine different ideas in the knowledge then the peripheral place peripheral placements there is a the Carol and draw Beverly are the peripheral players in the social network they are the they are they where the expectation in the network they were little they play a vital role in the network by the severing us as expert that's all about the social network is so I'm going to discuss about the strategic management of stakeholders this is a research paper written by some people on their views on how to strategically manage the stakeholders because this is very important for any growth of company so this they begin by defining stakeholders in their own terms those groups who support the organization without who support the organization would cease to exist exist and so on this is they basically give three steps to the top management team to effectively manage the stakeholders they are first to identify the specific stakeholders because each and every project has a different set of important stakeholders so we need to identify them properly next we need to identify the interactions between the stakeholders and then develop a strategic management plan for each of the stakeholder so for identifying specific stakeholder they also propose something similar said similar by Chinmayi it's the interest power grid so they locate the stakeholders on this grid they vary the x-axis shows the power and the y-axis shows the interest in the right top corner are the players which are very important for a project they need to be handled effectively and the people with low power and low interest require very less time or effort from the management side next the social influencer network so the players when the stakeholders are mapped on this power interested they are also connected through lines showing their connections between the stakeholders these content both formal and informal relationships there they are very specific to each organization so they should be kept confidential this is an example of stakeholder network so the dotted lines indicate the informa indicate that the both those stakeholders have an informal relationship and the solid lines indicate that they have a formal relationship informal relationship is something that is not related to the office like they might go to play gold together or something like that the formal relationships are something like manager supervisor relationships and so on next so after identifying these relationships we need to manage this stakeholder so to manage this fair holders each stakeholder needs to be analyzed separately so they propose something called social management web for this in which the specific stakeholder which we are analyzing is at the center of the web and on the top of it all those all the power which he has to influence is written on the top and his interests are written on the bottom and they are linked through lines the dotted the light lines indicate not much important relationship and the solid lines indicate that the relationship is very important and its formal relationship and the dotted lines indicate informal relationships that's it about the management of stakeholders thank you making a pretty detailed comprehensive presentation of various ways to little to really map stakeholders because I think what we've seen in many of our cases is we have a number of stakeholders many of them have ways in which they influence the project so we've looked at NGOs environmental groups political parties finance ears like the World Bank right so all of these people affect affect the project and therefore at the very minimum you need to take them into consideration I think in times past you know Jimmy made the point that there are two kinds of stakeholders primary and secondary stakeholders sometimes you call them internal and external stakeholders I think Johan calls them internal external stakeholders and in the work that he's doing but essentially the the internal or primary stakeholders are the obvious ones that you can see on the project that's the the financier the developer the sponsor and so on but then there are all these other secondary stakeholders the people are going to use it the local residents local or international NGOs and all of these people who also have something to bring to bear on the project and very often in the past people never really thought that these stakeholders matter right so very often use a strike a deal which is based on pure economics you start implementing the project and you have all kinds of protests coming in you've got people moving government to stop these projects public-interest litigations etc right so the first thing we need to do is actually figure out who our stakeholders are right so there needs to be a way in which we start identifying stakeholders might seem very easy but it often isn't really done because we really start certain to sit down and start thinking about stakeholders and think of them as internal or external or primary or secondary sometimes the list is not completely intuitive only when you start applying your mind that you actually start figuring out who your stakeholders are so I think step one in delivering these projects better is to do an exercise where you at least list or identify stakeholders right that's step number one and then once you identify stakeholders you've got to figure out a way in which you categorize them you know which stakeholders are more likely to you know cause problems for the project which stakeholders are likely to actually help you take the project forward which stakeholders are making a lot of noise but it isn't really in the right direction so I think we need to sort of categorize these stakeholders a little bit and then figure out a way in which we manage them right and that's where some of these tools come in handy so one of the tools is the one that both Chinmayi and Rahul showed which is this power interest matrix and as they explained and as is very clear here you've got two dimensions you've got stakeholders that have a high interest on the project or stakeholders that have a low interest on the project and you have stakeholders that have high power to influence the project or stakeholders that have low power to influence the project right so one might argue that maybe a small NGO might be highly interested in the project right they might feel passionately about the fact that you are resetting slum-dwellers or whatever so they might have high interest but they may have very low power right because they're a small NGO or they're not well-funded they aren't really taken seriously and so on right similarly and so those are where do we go yeah so if we say low power but high interest you know those guys would fall here whereas there are other people the developer for interest for instance or the financier so on a project finance here's have high interest in the project of course they're lending money to the project or putting in equity onto the project so they're very interested in what what's happening on the project they also might have a lot of power to influence the project because if they withdraw the project might collapse and therefore governments or developers etc might be in some ways beholden to the to the finances in this case and therefore they could be what are called players right so depending on where you find yourself on the matrix so step one is you list down people that's just a laundry list you go one to 21 to 30 whatever 1 to 15 lists down people step 2 is to actually put them on this matrix right all the power and predictability matrix which is the other matrix that my you short see where do they fall right and what do we need to do so the category here which is low power low interest right so these are people who you know aren't really interested in the project I mean have some association with the project no doubt but really also have you know not much power to influence the project maybe these are suppliers of you know equipment or material that go into building the project right so I mean they have some amount of interest in the project but are not a whole lot and they are just vendors right so you don't necessarily have a voice in the project right so you don't really need to invest a lot of time understanding what their concerns are except as far as the project is concerned because their ability to influence and their inclination to influence the project is minimal right people here on the top the subjects right have a large amount of interest but very little very little power which means they probably can make a little bit of a noise but probably don't have either the resources or the networks or the tiles to do anything significant right but so and therefore what could you do so in this paper the agree the encouragement is I don't know if you guys can see this probably cat management could encourage conditions to increase the power of the positively aligned player so when we say interest in projects remember that that interest could be positive or negative I might have an interest to make this project go forward I might have an interest to stop this project right so interest could go both ways right if I'm a beneficiary if I'm a commuter who could take this metro rail to work then I have an interest that's positively inclined if I have property whose values going to increase and properly I'm sort of inclined but on the other hand if I am you know paying rent and living close to the Metro and I'm going to be disturbed by traffic diversions noise during construction if my rental is likely to go up as soon as the Metro is finished that I'm likely to actually have a negative interest in the project right so I've got positive and negative interests and the idea is can we sort of get the people with positive interests together can we neutralize the people with negative interests can we get the people with a positive interest on the project to play a larger role right can we start moving some of the positive subjects right to this end of the matrix right can we get them more invested in the project right because they can support the project okay on the top right you have the key players in the project right the sponsors the finance here's the project developers high interest high power you might have done as we've seen in some of our cases International Rivers Network right in the case of the Bahji gali dam somebody with a lot of interest on the project a lot of power to influence the project as well because they're able to influence the World Bank they're able to influence international settlement so these people deserve sustained management attention right we really need to understand what they want figure out a way in which they can be kept happy so that the project can go ahead and then there is this group here at the bottom the context setters right who have high power but low interest right examples of context setters who do you think is an organization that could be a context setter someone's not really interested in the project but has high power to influence the project and these huh funding agencies or government agencies but we already said funding agencies might be players they have high interest in the project they've put money into it all right government agencies maybe to some extent right and they have they can clearly set the policy towards the project but not all government agencies might have the same amount of interest in the project a way to look at it is if you look at the metro rail and the Highways Department right the Highways Department actually owns a lot of the land through which the Metro Rail passes they can grant permissions to put your via ducks up or not they provide permissions for traffic diversion during construction so they actually have some power try to influence the project but they're not they may not necessarily be as interested in the Metro because it's not their project right there highways Metro so maybe the National Highways Authority right which essentially owns part of Mount Road or you know part of Mount Road in Chennai comes under the National Highways Authority probably have a lot of power to influence the development there but not enough interest in the project right so again there are very important you know player there is important sort of actor because if they exercise their power it is possible that the project could be negatively affected on the contrary if they exercised their power positively the project could go ahead right so essentially you really want to spend a lot of attention on the top right you want to spend some amount of attention on the on the top left and on the bottom right and probably the least amount of attention managing people on the bottom left but you'll understand that only if you list out your stakeholders and you actually map them like this right otherwise just because somebody published a report in the newspaper yesterday and if you starts channeling you know crores of rupees and hours of your organization's time to manage that person and you later on find that essentially it was somebody who wrote an article that nobody really took seriously somebody who had a little bit of an interest in the project very little power then essentially you've wasted a lot of resources right so the idea is can we get systematic about managing stakeholders can we start mapping them up right that sort of strategy number one we look at it a little bit in the context of our AR Bunga once we map out where they fall it's also important to understand yeah perfect that might be something that's outside your control right National Highways Authority has a certain set of powers vested by statutory rules right there's nothing you can do to reduce reduce their power on the project of course you can reroute your entire metro rail and eliminate them as a stakeholder right but it might be difficult to fiddle with the power and interest rate is maybe it's not as easy to make an interested stakeholder disinterested in the project right or a powerful stakeholder less powerful right possibly can be done but it's very difficult so that's not the idea the idea is to say we know this person has high power and high interest which means we have to listen to what they have to say so International Rivers Network comes on the project let's listen to what they have to say right that's sort of the the idea the second part which tsunade I think was presenting right was the whole factor okay I've identified the stakeholders I figured out which ones are important which ones or not but if we recall the corner coke case yesterday what did we find out about you know what did we find out more find out about the NGOs yesterday right in the cornucopia ha so they were highly fragmented they all had their own different goals you know some of them were very sort of supportive of the indigenous people some of them said development at no cost some of them said oil exploration is going to happen anyway so we might as well help so they were fragmented but they were also linked right so NRD as NRCS whoever that was was actually trying to play the linking role saying will be the front right and will collate everyone's opinion come to a settlement right so NGO so all of these stakeholders are linked in some sense so many of these stakeholders are linked and that's where sometimes picturing these linkages by putting all these stakeholders and putting lines between them becomes useful right so this is a technique called social network analysis it actually came out of graph theory which is you know very commonly used in mathematics and computer science and so on essentially what you're doing is is creating what we call a graph right and this graph has nodes n edges right so this is you know exactly the graph that so know it's put up but the names are a bit different this is the canonical very popular social network it's called the kite network because if you tilted this 90 degrees it would probably look a little bit like a kite and this is one way of saying there are a bunch of people here Bob Mike Jill Shane etc and this is how they're connected right when we say connection you will have to decide what it means to be connected right sometimes connection means I speak to you sometimes connection means I speak to you and you speak to me right sometimes connection means I transfer information to you so you'll have to have some definition the good thing about social networks is you can have different kinds of lines right I think so knowledge was talking about an even Rahul pointed out straight lines and dotted lines right so sometimes you can say straight lines are when you know we have two-way communication dotted lines are where you have one-way communication but it is representing the network right so this is how this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 there's 10 people right so ten stakeholders ten organizations and this is how they're connected to each other right so Jill talks to Bob Mike EMA Shane Leah and John these only speaks to Alan or these are only communicates to Alan right this is how the network comes down right you can build your own network quite easy okay so you could say you know if you had such and talks to Sandhya Sandhya talks to such in and Rahul Rahul talks to Priya Priya talks to such it and Sandhya right you could say okay here's such in here's some dia and here's Rahul and yes Priya okay so such in talks to Sandhya which means such in sends information to son there so I'll mark that with an arrow Sandhya talks to such in and Rahul so there's a two directional arrow between Sandhya and Rahul Rahul talks to Priya notice that boys only talk to girls and girls only talk to boys and Priya talks to such in our and to Sandhya okay take that back then okay so pre our talks so this is now a social network right and the directionality of the arrow tells me something right so now it sort of tells me you know if Priya needs to communicate to Rahul right she doesn't seem to have a way of communicating directly with Rahul Rahul has her phone number she doesn't have Rahul and so she has to go through son there and say look how do I get to Rahul pass on a message and so you know you get to understand a little bit of the dynamics of the network right same thing just drawn with colorful notes right and also remember that these ties can also be strong or weak right so yeah we said such in talks to Sandhya but such it might be talking to Cynthia a lot right that might be a strong link right whereas Rahul talking to Priya might be once in a while and probably just to say no right so that's essentially a weak link or possibly a non-existent kind of link so ties can be unidirectional bi-directional can carry information can be strong can be weak so I think it's important to start looking at and modeling these kinds of networks right so now I've put in I've sort of shaded these to show that there are strong links and we clicks right so I know a link now tells me is that unidirectional bi-directional is it strong is it weak right so I can start playing with so you can you can do anything that you can take you know the network of just the people in your wing in the hostel and draw a social network diagram right you can even take people in your own group in this class and draw a social network diagram right or you know whatever group it is right people on the football team right and draw a social network diagram right so and the social network diagram can be on who speaks to whom but you can look at the football team and you can say who's passing the ball to whom right and you can get sort of a graph of you know what does that look like right aren't there certain people who everyone passes to right others yep certain people who no one passes to and that gives you a little bit of intelligence on what's happening out there and then you can decide do you like that do you not right do you want somebody centrally to control the pace of the game or would you like it to be what the dutch used to call total football right everyone goes everywhere passing to wherever they can find okay and one way of sort of looking so when I have four people such as Cynthia Priya and Rahul it's easy right I can take a look at it and very quickly understand what's going on right but Rahul this Rahul not that Rahul put up a you know a matrix with the Scottish something Authority right from that paper they were what thirty five forty you know actors may be there so one was read it so now it becomes difficult right that's a lot of links to keep in my mind right I want to sort of understand what this network tells me I want to sort of get some metrics out of the network right and these are some key metrics the degree centrality is how centralized is this network right so in other words you have maybe have a picture here yeah so who is the most in so you can ask questions like who's the most central person in this network who's connected to the most number of people who's the hub that's what we're really asking who's the hub right where does information flow through who's the most active right so who's the most active you think here right so Jill seems to be off the lot the most central actor in the network Jill seems to be the hub through which communication flows right which means if I were to quickly if I wanted to quickly influence as many people as I as I need to in the network right so there's sort of an important piece of information in a classes cancelled I want to get the word out by phones running out of charge there's exactly one and I can send a message too right then I'd probably be best served by sending that message to JIT right because she's the most connected and that message can go out as quickly as possible okay of course you can I could also send it to Lisa and it would slowly propagate its way through the network but by that time all of you might already be assembled in class only to find out that it's cancelled right and so Jill is sort of central really helps spreading information out throughout the network but very quickly to other parts of the network so centrality and you can calculate an overall centrality score for the network right how centralized is the network or you can calculate centrality scores for each of these nodes right and is very simple you know how many people am I talking to versus how many people are talking to me kind of or how many what are the total number of people talking in the network versus how many people am I talking to so you can do these so if you go and read up anything on graph theory or on social network analysis and there are tons of books and you can go to Wikipedia and all of that you will find very simple formulae right that allow you to measure centrality but I want to sort of understand centrality of the network I want to understand who are central because this is a stakeholder who if I can positively influence can possibly positively influence a large portion of the network right this for me could be NRCS right or whoever or maybe even the International Rivers Network right if I can influence these guys positively really spreads whereas you know some other save the save Buju Gally crusade right might be sort of somebody peripheral if I influenced them it might take a lot tie a lot of time it might not even be possible for them to influence the network okay so that's one said that's what we call degree centrality but there's another concept again suno's mentioned all of this but I'm just sort of going through them again is betweenness right so who's a broker who influences the network right which sort of node can I penetrate right so that I actually can sort of penetrate different parts of the network right so who do you say hire has the highest betweenness centrality here so who could influence simultaneously multiple parts of this network right possibly someone like Liz right so in fact what you really have here is what we call two sub networks right these are almost two sub networks you know sort of joined together it's what we call clicks right this is a group you know these people talk to each other right essentially Jill and her friends and once in a while they asked Liz to come out with them but you know Liz really connecting to Alan and then to Lisa who nobody else has you know power to really influence or talk to right so Jill would be great to very quickly spread information to at least a part of the network but Liz would actually ensure that there is probably more equitable distribution of information around that network right so she has what we call more betweenness centrality right and that's again you know if I want to start spreading a rumor I might actually start with Liz right rather than with with Jill because this could actually spread in multiple direction there'd be very difficult to correct it right because there's it's also far-flung so Liz's in that way is a a broker okay closeness centrality who can assess others most easily who is the shortest passed to others who's the best visibility to what's going on who do you think has the highest closeness centrality who do you think has the best visibility to what's going on okay let's go look at a definition again who can access others most easily who has the shortest path to others right so mi and Shane are in these very interesting positions they're not as centralized as Liz they are still they aren't as connected as Liz to both sides of the network but if you really look at it if I wanted to send information to anyone Emma and Shane end up being uniformly you know two or three steps away in most cases two steps away from most people right in most cases except for Lisa who is three steps away all right they are essentially two steps away from everybody else right whereas Liz is one two three steps away from John she's three steps away from Bob Jill is one two three four steps away from Lisa so if you look at just the shortness of the connections right the closeness centrality is a property that I my and Shane have right Megan that's just something so they're all these metrics that you can start looking at and you know who is connected to those who are so you can start now getting to meta metrics right he is most connected and she is most connected to him and therefore she is most connected to he who is most connected and can actually start you know looking at but it's very important because now if you can understand this right you understand who to talk to to influence the network right so you have a high power high interest stakeholder takes a lot of time and effort to manage this person there's somebody else who may not be as high power or high interest but may be much better connected onto the network right and by influencing that person you actually quickly influence fifteen or sixteen other stakeholders right and so unless you have this map becomes difficult to sort of understand because you have limited time and resources right to influence stakeholders okay so you can ask these questions how centralized in the network so these are two very extreme canonical networks right this is sort of the this I think is what they call the star Network is that it is the star network this is highly centralized all information flows into the center this is your typical bureaucracy right everything nobody else talks to anyone else we only talk to the boss right and that has a particular dynamic highly central network this is the highly dense Network everyone talks to everyone else right everybody talks to everyone else right so here are it's very clear that this person carries the shots calls the shots and if I can't get to that person right I'm in trouble here I could potentially everyone is equal right it's it's a perfect team here I could influence any of these people and I'd have an equal chance of being able to influence or contact or deal with anyone else right so there's centralized so these are important things to understand this kind of a network you can obviously see there are three clicks here right there are three different sort of subgroups right very clearly connected to each other these subgroups you can visually see are not really very well connected to each other right and you can even do metrics to sort of figure that out and jenni John and Jack form an interesting triangle okay where they actually are now these boundaries panels right these are the gatekeepers through whom information flows in and out of these networks right so in some ways you could have some brilliant scientists here with wonderful theoretical ideas right but unless you have good coordination between Jennie Jack and John none of those ideas might really make it to other parts of the network right so I just just say this is design this is finance and this is construction right I these are the gatekeepers who really sort of help understand how all of this information flows together right so again looking at a network helps you understand what are the strengths of the network what are the weaknesses of the network right what do I have to do to really influence that network right and how do I make sure that I get the best ideas the positives out of the network and I find a way to minimize the troublemakers and the negative sentiments and so on okay so we look at this there's a very important concept particularly in the social sciences but also in graph theory called structural holes and these are actually you know places in the network where a tie is absent where the presence of that tie you could really solve a lot of issues in that network right so there's a guy called Robert who sort of wrote this whole sort of book on structural holes so it essentially indicates a gaps accidents of ties so one of the things you do when you look at a network is say is there a structural hole here do I need to bring in a facilitator a mediator another agency that can actually plug this structural hole that can connect these actors together because they certainly need to talk and they're not talking write a boundary spanners sometimes it's somebody who actually fills that structural hole okay so you have ABC if you have a relationship like this then B essentially is nothing is a coordinator takes information from a passes it on to C right essentially does a coordinating function okay okay all right so yeah so be essentially okay so a in some ways is a gatekeeper because a is the one who starts the information flow so if there's other information coming into this network it has to come to a because information flows from a and so a is what we call a gatekeeper right C essentially is the representative information so someone that you call a representative right and they so you can identify looking at your network who's the gatekeeper who are the representatives right gatekeepers sometimes are extremely important because they are the ones through which information flows in right B sometimes becomes a very important layers on kind of person okay so in all of this yeah I don't think that so this is again a very you know interesting kind of structure it's it's similar to that star structure but it's called the core periphery structure and this is a structure that we see very often on projects there's a small core of people right at the center of the network making a lot of decisions right and there all of these actors on the periphery all the actors in the periphery don't know each other right they are often connected to certain members of the core network right so these could be citizens these could be NGOs right these could be utilities these could be vendors technology providers all of them have stakeholders right but they and they all have an interest in the project but they all have different interests and they're all connected to different people citizens might be connected to the government right technology providers might be connected to the contractors technology providers and vendors right and so on and so forth okay so so what I'll do is I mean there's I've got some slides here but I'm going to slip them now we have a small experiment we did some years ago in a class that some of you took the construction software lab because you'll recall that you actually worked with people from other parts of the world as part of a group project and so we actually started mapping the social networks between groups and I won't talk about it but I just to show you the network so we did what we call sociograms right and we said okay you know there's team one some people from IIT at the time it was Columbia University who's talking to hope right and how does this network evolve over time right so you can see there's a network here it becomes far more dense over a period of time and actually then becomes far less nets right where both teams had one representative and they engaged information right and you can look at these kinds of networks right what happens with these teams and then try to see if these networks can actually predict project performance right and it turns out they can sometimes very dense networks tend to do better than other networks and so seeing how our network forms and performs and changes over time is often a very important and useful tool to see how projects might actually take place so the whole point is listing out actors mapping them to figure out who's more important and who is not as important right figuring out who talks to whom and who can be influenced are all important exercises that you might want to do to really figure out how to manage stakeholders all right so it stop here with this discussion [Music]
