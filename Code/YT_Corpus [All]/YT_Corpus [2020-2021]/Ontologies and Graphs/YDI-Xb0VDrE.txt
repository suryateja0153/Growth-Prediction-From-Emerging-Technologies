 Graph databases are driving the next wave of data harmonization and analytics and there are a lot of graph database options out there that can handle simple data transactions but what if you need to perform deep analysis with speed and integrate many data structures? Applications for a 360-degree view of the customer, knowledge graphs, AI and machine learning, social network or other complex use cases. Most transactional graph databases will take too long or just quit when asked to perform analytics on a lot of data. AnzoGraph DB is one of the only graph databases built for online analytics with performance that linearly scales. AnzoGraph DB is uniquely analytical, able to handle potentially billions or trillions of triples and fast deep analytics like deep link analysis, super fast aggregate analysis, graph algorithms and statistical algorithms and it's designed for massive scale with the fastest data loading and analytics capability. For example, since many graph databases are loading billions of triples we task anzograph DB to load 2.6 billion triples and run 22 analytical queries. Other solutions require 3.5 hours to complete the work that AnzoGraph DB does in just two minutes and another test to load one trillion triples showed that AnzoGraph DB was 113 times faster than the last graph database to perform against that benchmark. With AnzoGraph DB you can get compatibility with w3c standards but you can also have labeled property graphs and compatibility under the new upcoming standard. Analytical capabilities go beyond these standardized graph languages. But don't take our word for it see our scalability in a real world test, check out our benchmarks or download AnzoGraph today for a free trial.
