 Hello, we are using a Lubuntu live distribution that can be used in every desktop without requiring any installation. We start by opening our web browser and going to the book web page. Copy the link for the file archive Open a terminal Download the file archive into your folder by using the command wget Unzip the file archive. Return to the book web page and click on preprint. Go to Section Entity Linking. We may be interested in identifying what the recognized labels represent. For example, we may not be aware of what the matched label AD2 represents. Copy and paste the echo command to find what AD2 represents using scripts previously presented in the book. The result clearly shows that AD2 represents the Alzheimer disease. Now copy and paste the echo command to find what ATR represents. We can see that it may represent two classes. Copy and paste the echo commands to get their labels. The 0050434 represents the Andersen syndrome. The 0110034 is the X-linked Alport syndrome. If we find a ATS mention in the text, the challenge is to identify which of the syndromes the mention refers to. An intuitive solution is to select the class closer in terms of meaning to the others classes mentioned in the surrounding text. Copy and paste the echo command with a string with multiple disease mentions. LQT1, LQT2, LQT3, LQT5, and LQT6 are mapped to a unique URI, namely 0110644, 0110645, 0110646, 0110647, and 0110648. The only ambiguity is for ATS that returns two URIs, namely the 0050434 and the 0110034 . Semantic similarity measures have been successfully applied to solve these ambiguity problems. Go to section DiShIn installation. Start by installing the python and SQLite and git tools using the apt tool. Copy and paste the git command to install the semantic similarity tool DiShIn. Enter into the DiShIn folder. Copy and paste the curl command to download the latest database version of the Human Disease Ontology. Copy and paste the first python command to calculate the semantic similarity between LQT1 with the identifier 0110644 and Andersen-Tawil syndrome with the identifier 0050434. Copy and paste the second python command to calculate the semantic similarity between LQT1 with the identifier 0110644 and X-linked Alport syndrome with the identifier 0110034. We can see that for all measures LQT1 is much more similar to Andersen-Tawil syndrome than to X-linked Alport syndrome. This means that by using semantic similarity we can identify Andersen-Tawil syndrome as the correct linked entity for the mention ATS in this text. Thank you for watching this video.
