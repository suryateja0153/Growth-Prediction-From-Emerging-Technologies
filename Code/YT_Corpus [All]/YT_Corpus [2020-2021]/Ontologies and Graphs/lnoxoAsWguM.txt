 in this video I am going to show you how to create and use a database for your training experience using neo4j hora neo4j hora is where you can create a neo4j database in the cloud for a monthly fee you must have an account with neo4j to create a database the database you create will be managed by neo4j this means that the database will be automatically backed up for you will be available 24 by 7 and will always be running with the latest software updates assuming that you have registered with neo4j for an account to use for neo4j hora you simply sign in with your credentials since this is a subscription service you must have authorized payment for your usage by specifying a credit card for your account when you create a database in neo4j hora you must select the size of the database notice that the size of the database will determine the subscription cost for any of our training classes the smallest database will suffice you must specify a name for your database as well as the location of the server after you provide the database information you are presented with the credentials that are to be used for this new database instance the username will be neo4j and the password is displayed it is extremely important that you save this password as it will be necessary for all connections to this database whether from neo4j browser or from your application you save the password and acknowledge that you have saved it before continuing you must wait a few minutes for the instance to be created here we see that the database instance is now running notice that the bolt URL is shown this is the URL that applications such as Java or Python or even neo4j browser used to access the database next you open neo4j browser for this database in neo4j browser you must provide the credentials for connecting to the database the user neo4j is already filled in for you but you must enter the saved password for the database that you were reminded earlier to save then you can connect to the database here we are in neo4j browser this is the UI that you use for virtually all of our training class exercises this is the database with nothing in it it is up to you to populate it with nodes and relationships which is what you do in the training classes after you have gained experience with neo4j you might want to import an existing populated database into your neo4j or a database instance this page guides you through this process the connect page provides links to the documentation for using neo4j with Python JavaScript Java net and go and of course there is a help page where you are brought to the support portal for neo4j hora each neo4j training course requires a different set of data in the database but there is no reason why you can't delete the nodes and relationships in the database and populate it with different nodes and relationships for another course so that's a quick tour of how easy it is to create and use a database for your training experience with neo4j aura
