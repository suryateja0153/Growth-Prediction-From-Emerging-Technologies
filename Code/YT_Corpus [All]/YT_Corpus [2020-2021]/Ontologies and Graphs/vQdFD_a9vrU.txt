 hello everybody welcome welcome thank you very much for joining us today today we have got something very exciting lined up so quickly before we dive into what we're going to do a quick set of introductions i am luna zaravich i am a developer relations advocate at neo4j and i am joined with my colleague alex would you like to do a quick hello yeah hi hi everybody welcome to summer of notes welcome to the stream uh yeah i'm alex i'm in marketing in europe for neo4j so um i'm looking forward to this should be fun and should be uh yeah should be entertaining for everybody so yeah excellent excellent so let's get into this so some of you will know or have an idea of what some summer of notice some of you will be hmm what is this summer of notes what is this pretty blue screen with the sun showing at me so we're gonna get into this so it is uh summer of notes this is a new thing that we've started for this year and hopefully we'll keep going uh we will have themes for these and given the current situation that we're in the theme for this year's summer of notes is staycation so it's all about the kinds of things that you will do typically or may well do whilst you're doing a staycation and hello to everybody who's saying hi in the chat hi lovely to see you all so this is our theme a little bit of an introduction about uh summer of notes so effectively we've got four weeks of challenges so the first week's challenges are going to be coming out today and we're going to keep doing that every monday we have got something for everybody so if you are completely brand new to neo4j you're brand new to graphs you've never done it before don't worry we have got something for you and you should be able to do it it should be achievable for those of you who exactly there you go for those of you who are a little bit more experienced with neo4j don't worry we've got something to test you as well so we've got a bit of that's going to test the old log in there for you to work on so we've got something for everybody so what you will find that every week we have two challenges uh beginner challenge and experience challenge and there are lots of opportunities to learn so this is going to be fun we're picking fun themes and we hope you're going to go away at the end of these four weeks with you've learned with learning something it may be something around neo4j and maybe something around queering it may be around the individual weekly challenges that we set so for example we've got a challenge this week on barbecues it could well be that you're going to go away have learning having learned something new about barbecue so it's all about something fun and something to learn so this is nif j summer of notes we'd love it if you're getting involved if you're watching again you don't you can formally compete in the challenges you can do it from the sidelines you can just come along and come watch your streams you're all welcome but let's let us know what you're doing make some noise do tweet the summer of notes hashtag on twitter we'd love to hear and see what you guys are up to and hello we have people from toulouse so hello uh participants hello hello right so that's the quick introduction to summer of notes let's talk a bit more so yes we have some prizes available so oh yes so we have some bespoke stickers so for the first 100 correct entries that we get um over the challenges we have these fantastic stickers these are limited edition we are not giving them out to anybody oh no no no no you have to submit yes you have to submit a correct entry and then you you know and if you're one of the first correct entries first 100 correct entries you get this beautiful sticker to adorn your laptop knowing full well that you are part of an elite group to forgot this on top of this as well we also have a beautiful exclusive nifty rucksack exclusive i don't have one of these bags oh you know i work at nifty i do not have one of these bags but we will have eight of yeah alex doesn't have one either it's so limited nobody with neo4j exactly but we have one of these bags which will be filled with neo4j swag also up for grabs and we've got eight of these and what we're going to be doing so basically four for the uh beginners challenges for for the experience challenges and what we're going to be doing for each of the challenges we will be drawing a correct answer at random and lucky lucky you the person who we've drawn the random correct answer you'll be getting one of these bags and don't worry you'll have one of the stickers in there as well so we do have some prizes not for grabs so there we go make it a bit of exciting again you don't have to formally potties but if you just want to play not worried about the prizes please come along and join us as well okay let's talk a little bit about how this is all going to run as well before we dive into the challenge so what we're going to be doing we're going to have two live streams a week so we've got the monday stream so this is the one that we've got going on now so this is the time slots and we have all the time conversions there and what we're going to be doing in this stream is we will be introducing the challenge for that week so we'll be so we'll be doing that this week with our theme of the barbecue so we're going to give you an introduction to the challenge we're then going to talk through what the beginner's challenge looks like what the experience challenge looks like and then from next week onwards we will also give you an announcement of the solution so with some of these challenges there may be more than one way to solve the challenge so don't worry what we'll be doing is we'll give away or some ways that you can solve that challenge so just because we don't mention the way you've done it does not necessarily mean that you're wrong it just means that there's more than one way and we've just given some examples so don't panic if we don't panic you know more than one way to the to the to the solution but you know we will show a way yeah and that that will be yeah so at least you know how it's done if you if you struggled or if you couldn't come up with the solution then at least you know what it could have been absolutely and then what we do after we've finished the session so the same with this one as well we've got a blog post which we're going to publish and that's going to have all the various links in there so everything that we cover today don't panic if you see a slew of links you go oh my goodness i can't write fast enough don't worry so these these videos so this the recordings of these streams are going to be available afterwards and also we have a blog post that writes up and pretty much covers the same information that we cover during these sessions there as well so you'll have all of the links there and what have you for those of you who have registered we'll also send out an email to you again just following up with the details so this is another reason for registering if you've not done so already we will send you email reminders of where to look where are the links to the main resources and so forth so that's your mondays following for mondays our second stream is going to take place on thursday so again we've got all the various times there and what we're going to be doing doing during this stream is providing some hints so some of these challenges can be have got some interesting takes on them and maybe you need a little bit of help maybe you just need some hints and that's what the sessions are going to be so we're going to provide some hints there also if you've been posting questions in the forum don't worry we're going to give you a link for that shortly if you've been posting questions in there we'll have a look and you know if there's a commonly occurring theme or question that comes up we'll also take the thursday stream as an opportunity to cover those if there's been any confusion or we've not been clear about something so that's what's gonna happen and again that same blog post that we publish on monday we're going to update that blog post and in there we're going to uh again put any details we'll put in the hints that we've covered and so forth so if we're the same blog post and we'll update it i'll i added the links to the to the chat so if you want to want to click now you can click but as lou said we will we will add all the links and all the important bits in the in the community blog post so everything will be at your fingertips you don't have to worry now absolutely so you'll have all of the details don't worry and if we've missed something if we haven't missed something again we'll be keeping an eye on the forums just let us know and we'll make the appropriate updates and then on sundays at the times indicated this will be the deadline for that week's submission so for the ones that we're going to be giving you today the challenges the deadline is as what will be this sunday with the times provided and give some links again don't panic you don't have to quickly drop these down and do a screenshot these are going to be available in the blog post well i've got a provided link to blog post so the the main one of interest is going to be this one here which is r dot oops r that neo4j.com son hyphen week one so this is don't worry it's not live yet if you go there you're going to get like an error so give us a chance as soon as we finish this stream we'll upload it but that's going to be the blog post for this week that's going to contain all of the information about the challenges that's the blog post that we're going to be updating on thursday with information and so forth so that's going to be the blog post this week you will probably depending on the challenges you will probably be using the fj indeed you will be for a lot of the challenges to be using neo4j and if you don't want to install and download it we do have an option of the sandbox so you've got the link there and the sandbox is a no download no in-store way of being able to use neo4j so think of it as a bit a bit like a temporary cloud instance so that's something you can use and you've got a link there and next week we'll be providing hints and tips on how to get started with the sandbox and how to navigate so that will be coming up so that's more targeted at the beginners people who are new to neo4j so we will have instructions set available for you so that you're not starting cold if you're keen to start ahead of time and have a play please do that's a great way to start getting some hands-on experience and we've got the forum so this is again this is a shortcut link to get to the forum i think you've got the longer version as well to be posted in link so this is probably the more memorable yeah perfect it's yours yours is a little bit this dish will fit on the slide better yeah i had i had little space i was going for short links so um so what we're going to be doing so you're going to have the forum there and then i've got the we've got the addresses for live streams there so we're live on on twitch and we're live on youtube so uh we've got chats coming from both twitch and youtube here so yes we are we are uh streaming to both of you see if you've got questions we can catch those questions so again as you all do now if you've got questions we will try and answer those as we're going through the stream but those are the addresses for the streams so that's the schedule and your key links and again this blog post here that's going to contain all of the links that are relevant to the various challenges and hints and tips so on to week one challenges so as you've probably all deduced the theme for this week is going to be the barbecue which is very common on a staycation or certainly in in western europe it is i guess in the states as well absolutely so we've got week one changes which are the bbq and i'm going to provide a quick introduction before i hand over as you know i'm going to hand over to alex and he's going to talk all about the beginner's challenge over to you alex okay sure yeah barbecue so like you say you uh it's it's uh it's a you know fun activity in in summertime so um yeah should be good uh and the um the beginner's challenge is talking about what kind of different barbecues there are worldwide so i mean i'm from germany so for me barbecue means sausage on a grill and then potentially potatoes sauerkraut something like that so it's very you know cliche but it actually is true so i think that's probably why it is a cliche um but we we thought about this and we looked okay this is not only sausages on the grill there are actually many different ways to have a barbecue so um there is a wikipedia page there's a link on on that slide and we will post a link provided for you which is a huge collection of all these different kinds of barbecues that are happening globally with all the original variations and i was surprised how many how many there are and how different they are so it's it's uh it's all kinds of different uh setups and uh we want you to look at those um look at you know implementations cooking styles so um and actually what what they put on the grill and what what they actually make uh these these different um settings in different countries and different uh different cultures so check that page out and and you will see all the background information you need and then the challenge is going to be modeling these these barbecues around the world so we have um we have the article or you have the article and then you we want you to think about how how can this how can this be in a graph how can you how can you combine all these information into a graph because essentially this this website has lots of lots of um [Music] information and you can you know ask some questions that can then be worked into a graph so for example what is the most common type of barbecue um what countries tend to have vegetarian flanky barbecues i mean like i said sausages on a grill not very vegetarian friendly i mean this is this is a german cuisine for you in a nutshell but um there is different uh countries for god's steak and there are different cultures and vegetarians are are you know appreciated to to um to grill something on on a barbecue what kind of food is most popular um is another question you can answer by looking at the the article and then interesting connection here uh relationship i think is um is there a relationship between the cooking surface the cooking type and the type of fuel you need or you use for a barbecue so is it wood is it charcoal is it gas is it i don't know solar power um so yeah i i think thing to point out here as well uh it's really important to you've got a set of question takers especially for those of you who are quite new not done much of done done much in the way of data modeling a lot of the time when you're thinking about how you're going to model your data it's going to be very much driven on the types of questions that you're looking to answer and based on those questions you're looking to answer that's that's going to pretty much direct what your data model is going to look like and effectively what alex has been talking about here we've given you some questions and this is hopefully going to help form in your mind going aha whilst i'm reading through this wikipedia page i'm starting to get an understanding of how these various elements are going to interact with each other so that i can answer these questions so exactly uh and then and then exactly like you said they will help you guide along your your model and then help you fly a little bit create that um so if we continue um what kind of tools would you use how would you how would you go about with this um there is a there's a there's a couple of guides on our website on the developer guides um which um which will help you to um to start your modeling there's a training course on the graph academy which you can look at and and see how how you you model typically and what you do when you start modeling your your data but actually um i think if you're completely new to neo4j you want to start with it what helped me the most was looking into looking at the data taking out a piece of paper or actually use arrows the the the tool that a colleague of ours wrote uh it's a web tool and just you know start drawing your graph start with the first creating a first note giving a label drawing first set of connections between or relationships between the the other nodes you create and then your graph develops into something and then you you obviously not not your first go will be right so you will have to change things around and and then work around with your with your model but but i think it it helps if you just give it a go and then see oh actually this is easy and you set your mind to it and you you realize how how this this all works and then if you start it maybe then look into uh how this is properly done and then maybe do um the data modeling training course which then obviously helps you yeah so the data modeling course is super useful if you're completely brand new to all of this you're going oh i'm feeling a bit nervous yeah go have a look it's completely free completely free so have a look at the guide if you're new to it have a look at the training course again we've got the forums so again if you've got questions again post questions on the forums again we've got an active community so we would highly encourage everybody to who's taking part in summer summer of notes if you see a question that comes up and you can provide some assistance with please do so yep so we've got that so we'll come on to the next sheet at the moment where we give you some you know what we're expecting to see but i mean let's talk a little bit more about what we're expecting people to submit or how they're going to submit things oh yeah absolutely so we will have uh so this link is also not live yet i think but um we will have a form uh which catches uh your responses so the first one because it's um in the end you will send us a picture of your model is an image so you can send us a link to an image um wherever you wanna you wanna host that uh of your model which you done either in arrows which we would recommend to you because it's the easiest tool to create a model but if you have other tools you want to use or if you want to draw it out on paper and then take a picture of it you you're obviously welcome to do so um and then send us that image just make sure it it's readable and it's not not too too heavy i mean don't please don't send us a 4k uh high resolution image just send something that is that is workable for us so we can look at it and and and see if that is indeed uh um a right solution but we will uh yeah we will have a form for you to to submit your answer should we talk about the the the model and what we would like like to see here or or lou what should be yep yep no let's talk about the um so let's talk a little bit what's going to happen so we're helping you out a little bit here so we're not leaving you completely out in the dark and for those of you who are completely new to neo4j and you're like what's a label what's a property again have a look at the have it have a look at developer guide it talks through that but what you will as you go through your journey and you go ahead right i know what node labels are so what we're going to be doing is we're going to be providing you with a set of labels that we would like you to use so we would specifically like you to use labels listed up here we would also like you to think about what would be an appropriate relationship type that you use to connect between your labels so again put that and again the same with properties and what we want you to do as well so what you'll discover if you're using arrows you will need to if you're using properties you will need to provide a value for the property so it takes this sort of key value pair set up so for those of you as an example if you if you're submitting your answers on uh paper so you're doing pen and paper jobs or you're doing them in powerpoint or you know again physio how could you forget about powerpoints i don't know sorry many departments are run by powerpoints but you know you if the world is your worst you've got many options so um you know so if you're just going to do like a node label and then just what the property is that's fine if you're doing in arrows you have to provide a value so we don't mind you may put in like hey sort of like the property name and then just put value that's fine if you want to put a mock property that's fine so i'm going to talk a little bit more about what we're looking to see so what we want is a data model rather than the physical uh data itself so let me describe what i'm talking about so if we were talking about we have two uh notes here and we've got the labels of bbq and country apply to those notes and here we've got a sensible relationship that's connecting these two notes so all good so far and we well we're saying we've got a type of barbecue and a country's got a name so type of barbecue might be oh my goodness i've forgotten one name like grill like in serbia it's grill everyone calls it grill um so you know so i'd have type and if i'd either put value or maybe i'll put type grill that's fine same here for country i've got name so the country has a name so i might just put value on what put name such as serbia as an example that's fine that's great that's that that works fine you can also put in an example so here we put in values here you can put in an example so here we've got an example of a south african bbq so a bray and we've got the name south africa that's also totally fine what we don't want to see is um sort of almost the right description the physical data so yes you're going to have more than one country uh that may have type of barbecue uh you may say so what we don't want to see are multiple countries or multiple barbecues or multiple foods please just keep it down to one instance of each label so that's what we're looking for so these ways of representing the data model whereas this is starting to show physical data so we don't want that we just want the data model yeah exactly it should just be a model you don't have to take the whole wikipedia page and make it into your everything you know what i mean is you don't have to take everything out of that wikipedia page and turn it into the model you just take the the basic knowledge of the wikipedia page underlying concept of it and then moving it on to the model and not take everything one to one over because then it would be a huge graph and then it's a bit more tricky we're trying to keep this we're trying to keep this is useful and this is a good this is a good education in thinking about um models in general and how you present your data so do do stick with it as alex said you're probably going to do a few iterations especially if you need this you might have a couple of goes before you go aha right i get this i'm on the go so that's that's that uh there is the beginners challenge for this week so let's move on to oh here we go we've got some examples so yeah abstract properties that's fine example property values that's fine multiple nodes are the same load global no we don't want that please don't do that right moving on to the experience challenge and this is going to be around the socially distanced barbecue so as we're all aware we saw some easing of lockdown we're now starting to see some of the easing being rescinded and what have you but to some extent we're we're being given this opportunity now to meet up with our friends and family and we have to be really really careful we have to think about how we're going to maintain social distancing and the challenge that we're setting for you the heart challenge we're setting for you is thinking about how can you use or how are you going to use sofa how you're going to use neo4j to do your table planning for the socially distant barbecue and what we're going to be doing is we're going to be providing you with a data set and this data set is going to be containing a list of guests that you have invited to your barbecue your social distance bbq and here we this list we have guests these guests come from households so they're either individuals so they're just living in the household themselves or maybe there's a number of people coming from the same household and what we want you to do taking this taking this data is what we want you to do is to figure out how you are going to find where all of your guests are going to sit whilst respecting social distancing guidelines sounds like fun doesn't it oh yes oh yes so let's get let's get a bit more detail so we've got some rules with this so you will have a total of six tables and each table has six places each place is a metre apart from the other one so as you can sit there so you can picture it you've got tables so basically if you go around the circumference it's six meters so each place is a meter of parts so here are the rules all guests not from the same household must be at least two meters apart from each other so that's certainly the rule in the uk you have to be two meters apart from each other and this we're saying guests from the same household if the guests are from same household may sit next to each other so they can sit closer together because they're all part of the same bubble a table must have no more than a maximum of two people from the same household so for example if you've got four people from the same household only two of them may sit at the same table so you're gonna have to split them up somehow and a table must have members from at least two households so we don't want somebody sitting on their own because that would be a sad experience you know there's already been enough there's no fun yeah it's it's a isolated barbecue basically but that's not good socially distance fine sitting in your own a little bit over the top and again don't panic about this very long link it's going to be in the blog post but this is the data that we provide you with so that is the data we want you to use and take to solve this challenge and again you're going to be using the same form and the question has popped up if you're allowed to submit both the easy and the hard challenges yes you may you may enter both challenges we invite you and you are welcome to do so so please do if you want to have a go so again just because you're experienced does not mean that you're not allowed to do beginners challenge because we've got some fun beginners challenges coming up as well so please enter everything and anything and everything you'd like to enter please do so again we've got the same link so this is the same form and what you'll see is you've got a radio button that says which one you're submitting for so if you're going to do both challenges submit the form twice and again with all the challenges you will need to be registered for the event for us to accept your answer uh the reasons why we need you to register so it's a way for us to be able to contact you if you've won it's a way we use to contact you all to remind you when the next challenge is coming and we let you know all the important links and and it's a way for us to let you know that summer of notes 2021 so yeah it's all good that's that's why we would like you to register with us it's actually i'd like to start thinking about those challenges for next year uh so tell you a bit more about what we're looking for from you in the hard challenge so what we want is the query or queries you use to load and prepare your data uh so this is what we need to do so obviously we've given you a set of rules so let's get there's going to be a bit of undoubtedly there's gonna be a bit of stuff you're going to be doing in the background so you're going to do the prepping stage so we want to get those queries so please separate those queries in semicolon again you'll have the instructions on the submission form we then also want the query you ran on this data to allocate guests to tables and we want this queue to output the data in a specific format so we want to want it to output the guest the household and the table number you don't have to use pure cipher you may use some of the standard neofj plugins so for example apoc you are welcome to use those and please please please the queries that you submit must be runnable if we can't run them we can't uh you know we can't assess them so please do we won't fix it yeah we're not going to fix your typos especially if we end up with hundreds of entries [Music] no that's not possible so please check please please check that your queries were on prior to submitting the bug we'll be able to figure out if you're using apoc or gds we'll be able to figure out that you're using those so that's not a problem but please check that they run okay so let's check we've got any more questions that have popped up on this um i guess not so we'll quickly scan if any questions have popped up uh if you've got any questions now now's the time to fire them but apart from that we wish you all good luck so we're gonna hang on now for a couple of moments if you've got any questions other than that we will in a few minutes time also give us about 10 15 minutes we'll get that blog post out with all the links and we wish you the best of luck all the best of luck yeah and then if you have any questions and you know you wanna you wanna ask them then always use the community board that is um where we will be monitoring during the week when we are not in stream um monitoring your questions we can answer them directly and also we can then look into uh incorporating these questions into the thursday stream so we have a couple of questions for for from you for others that might be you know a challenge for for other people as well absolutely brilliant okay well nothing has come up in the chat so give us a few moments we're going to get that blog post updated and sent out so just as a quick reminder actually yeah so let me go uh actually we'll ping that so if you hang on in the chat we'll ping the link to the the blog post but uh yes keep an eye on that and we will send it so i've got quick questions come in what version of cypher can we use uh whichever you like whichever gets the job done i mean we'd recommend so i assume you're referring specifically to the database so i suggest you use one of the later versions of three five x or uh four point x so i pick one of the later new databases but again if you're more comfortable with using three five 17 for example over 4.1 then yeah that's fine i mean there shouldn't be a huge difference in the cypher queries they should be fine so if it actually just pop a comment slash in using 3.5.17 or something and that should be fine cool uh is the fine text advantage yeah another question yes it is it will be in the blog post so give us a few moments and that blog post will go out and you'll have all of the written information there so let me just quickly and also in the forum so we will keep both both both sides updated so you can either wherever you you go you find a link to cross-reference each other so i think so this is the link you want so give us again just give us about give us about 10-15 minutes after the end of this stream and we'll get that blog post updated i've just posted it in the chat so give us give us give us about 10-15 minutes after we end this stream that blog post will be published you will find all of the information there and if you if you registered you will get an email with all the important links as well in half an hour or so so after the after this is published so later today yeah so that's another top tip if you if you go i don't want to be looking i just want to get an email with information if you register then you'll get an email in your inbox so you'll be able to follow that as well yep exactly perfect brilliant well i think in that case right that was a quick first one absolutely looking forward to your questions to your answers in particularly of course uh especially uh then and um yeah see you on thursday but uh in the meanwhile i think maybe you can make i think adam is on tomorrow here at 2 p.m european time 1pm british so i think your next neo4j dose tomorrow dates check that out and again keep an eye on the keep an eye on neo4j twitter account so we normally ping a tweet out about an hour before the session starts so that's another way to keep track of it or the the fail safe option is to follow us on twitch and you'll be notified so follow us on twitch and you'll be notified when we go live excellent cool thank you very much everybody very excited i hope you guys are too and happy summer of happy summer of notes i'm super excited see you soon see you later bye bye
