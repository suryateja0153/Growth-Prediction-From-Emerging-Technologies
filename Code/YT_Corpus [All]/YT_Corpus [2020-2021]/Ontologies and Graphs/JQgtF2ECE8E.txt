 Hi, everyone. I am Andrea Guarracino, a PhD student from University of Rome Tor Vergata. In this talk, I'm going to present to you COVID-19 PubSeq, a public sequence resource for SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences where data, metadata and analysis tools lead together publicly and [INAUDIBLE]. Existing data repositories allow for sharing data but enforce strict quality control control on the submitted data and its metadata and don't add value in terms of running conditional analysis. Moreover, some databases have a restricted license which prevents data from being used in online web services and on-the-fly computation, hindering research. Our idea was to create a repository that had a low barrier to entry for uploading and analyzing sequence data all in one place without imposing any restriction on the utilization. For this aim, we created COVID-19 PubSeq. This resource is designed to abide by FAIR principles. Data are published with Creative Commons attribution licenses, and certain metadata are validated against other ontologies. The workflows are written in Common Workflow Language using best practices. They are standard, shareable, reproducible, and importantly, everyone can add new workflows to offer new functionalities. COVID-19 PubSeq is currently running on Arvados, a cloud open-source platform for managing, processing and sharing scientific and biomedical data. The data uploaded can be used from a command line or a web interface without installing any software. The metadata are in the form of YAML files and are strictly validated against a schema. Data are validated for being in a supported format and for not being duplicated entries in the resource. Importantly, the available workflows are executed after the upload in order to provide up-to-date results rapidly [INAUDIBLE]. To date, these outputs are already used by two teams. The Graph Genome Browser Consortium uses the JSON outputs as inputs for Pantograph, an interactive virtualization of the SARS-CoV-2 pangenome. As pangenome, we defer to the entire set of genomic elements in a given species [INAUDIBLE] the naturally expressed genome rearrangements, so Pantograph allows researchers to browse the entire genetic diversity in our SARS-CoV-2 population that will otherwise be underestimated. Each time someone uploads [INAUDIBLE] on COVID-19 PubSeq, this input is immediately combined with all the already uploaded SARS-CoV-2 genomes in order to generate an up-to-date pangenome as the input for Pantograph. Moreover, the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics has included COVID-19 PubSeq data in its knowledge base, and they uploaded metadata, and the outputs are transformed into RDF databases. This means that it's possible to query this data using Spark or ontologies. For example, this query asks when the reported sample was submitted and that is originate from USA and is a biospecimen collected from the back of the throat by swabbing. COVID-19 PubSeq is the result of a community effort, developers but also submitters. There are several reasons why you should upload your raw data to this resource. Make your data available to the widest audience possible quickly and without restrictions is really important for scientific research in particular during this COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, we recommend uploading to ABI and NCBI [INAUDIBLE] using our data [INAUDIBLE] tool. In this way, you only enter data once, making it public to multiple resources and getting the results of analysis from the workflows available on COVID-19 PubSeq. Finally, I want to thank all the teams involved in this project for their hard work and of course the audience for listening. Thank you very much.
