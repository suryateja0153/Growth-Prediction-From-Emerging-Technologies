 hi this is laura Ridenour again and i've had a couple more questions for my 315 class about how to add classes and protégé so what I have pulled up here is the zero zero two classes ontology and protege as it currently stands and what we're going to do is add a subclass in grooming needs but first I'm going to describe kind of how the classes are arranged for in this hierarchy so in an ontology encoded in owl or l2 all classes fall under all things so everything is a subclass of a little thing from this we've got separated out animals their needs and the owner for each of these classes we have the Grameen needs and we're going to work on the grooming needs so what we're going to add as we're going to add some dog grooming needs just for an example so you're going to go up here and you need to be in the entities pane and under the classes tab so if you click on grooming needs and then you'll click the add subclass so we're going to add a subclass of dog grooming needs and then you're going to click OK or hit enter because this is an ontology and we need to be sure we're defining everything under the annotations we're going to add an R DFS comment that is a string literal so it's just text that describes what dog grooming needs are so these are the grooming the the class of dogs so it's a subclass of dog grooming needs so for this we can add things like dog bathing and going back and makes you you can either be here and click the sibling relationship or you can be clicked on the dog grooming needs and click the subclass relationship so we're going to do it from the sibling relationship at this point we're going to say dog brushing and because we have Neal clipping for cats we'll add it for dogs too we're going to add dog nail clipping so we've added three subclasses to the subclass of to the class of dog grooming meats and that's basically what you'll be part of what you'll need to do in the assignment so as I get more questions I will record more videos
