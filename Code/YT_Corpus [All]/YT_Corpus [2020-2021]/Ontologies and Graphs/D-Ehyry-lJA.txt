 [Music] hello everyone my name is Joe Kerekes I'm a PhD fellow in the problem of digital technologies for cultural heritage hosted by Department of Computer Science University of Torino in Italy and with my supervisor from Zurich in Changwon Bardo we will present today and multiple perspective account of digital creation for culture heritage and I will be talking about the tasks disciplines and institutions and specific them so just start to give you the glimpse of the presentation we I will be talking about this new creation through the schema that we created and in this schema I will be talking about the the digital cultural heritage domain from its the beginning till the end what is happening what all it has what are digital technologies and the goal of this research is examining the contribution of digital creation which is fairly new in the field of cultural heritage and by doing that I will be reviewing the component of the cultural heritage task the territorial task for the cultural heritage in specific day and some digital tools in the long term my project is about develop a unified digital creation framework and what is this digital curation managing that data actively from its point of creation or accusation until it's determined to be useful or not useful at the end and considering all the accessibility preservation personalization or authentication issues some of them considers it as an operational workflow so it's basically consist the preservation data creation and management combines all these things from the lifecycle of the cultural heritage and assets I'm also an emerging field because it's kind of making relations between the researcher practice training a multinational multidisciplinary then why digital creation is still far from being a common practice so in fact as much as the digital technologies are evolving cultural heritage institution is still neglecting the importance of the information technologies right cultural heritage assets and physically is not the same as the digital assets and there are several software's and several digital environments and several disciplines since its beginning - and now beginning I mean that the first time the digital curation term is coined in 2001 and there are several institutions several researchers try to create frameworks for the digital creation as you can see there are a couple of frameworks but there there is not one simple or unified framework yet what we did is we examine these frameworks and we got six different tasks so later I will be talking through all these six tasks which is that the creation creation and acquisition or the decoration of preservation the publication and dissemination and I will give examples and explain the tasks and technologies so overall the schema you can see here starts with the cultural heritage domain and it ends with either the archive repertory or the publication website and exhibition and just to start with the data creation or acquisition and as you know that the acquisition even is about bringing dates are from now that solve various creation is getting this time of measurements and the signals from real-world physical connection and commerce converting it in a digital numeric values both of these either/or and all creation and acquisition creates a raw data after the process so from the interdisciplinary account these diverse tools and workflows and this kind of decision of the scientific communities - what is the best tool for the best quality of the data is very important in the the personalized access as an example I think virtual electronic plan is the best example because this project was a replica of the record this year the famous architect in Pavilion in 1958 in Brussels World Expo and later the researchers try to reconstruct virtual reconstructed they had to on the left hand side you can see the original drawings of the right technical detail and these drawings accused and from Philips archives but it wasn't enough the recounts digitally reconstruct the pavilion they had to in the middle you can see that they had to create the data from the scratch getting all this information so this combines the doctorate position and better creation together so another step is the data processing and modeling while we have the raw data after the process of the doc declaration or acquisition and now we had to get the processed data to do that this of creating a conceptual model from droid raw data and heed it with the metadata by method date I mean the data about data in this sense you have to also understand the role of metadata which is crucial so why it's crucial that different scientific communities use different sets of matters meta standards for example and a very well known example of milanesa so this on the left you can see this a EDM European data model Dublin core system or side of CRM so this kind of enriching the data about Melissa I showed you that the the provider is the the in France and then also you can get in the web has view aspect and also as well as the side of serum person of the Leonardo da Vinci so the basic thing about that interpretation is the making sense of all these numerical data from different source and between them scientific knowledge and all the members of the projects needs access this time of overview the obstacle in view of the data for example project chatted in Konya turkey and it's one of the long term multinational multidisciplinary project archaeological project maybe in Turkey and over the 4050 years numerous of the disciplines with memories of the people International and national work on this project right so what digital technologies and the desaturation allows us to get this kind of deal during this task of data interpretation to be more cyclic specific is that giving this access of the knowledge by layer by layer all these colors represents the different years different scientific communities and it combines in one virtual the same environment but GIS is specifically work on the archaeological project if the geographical information system and to do that in order to do that you need to get all this kind of scientific knowledge into the this kind of interpretation of the data the later actually this is kind of the overall umbrella of data processing and modeling as well as the interpretation so it's kind of to protect in preserving the data these management of the the data is actually more related with the semantic relationships between teams and people are also the artifacts and this kind of the parts digital parts and relational database as well for example so this repertory teeth aren't maybe you might know is about just about this archaeological knowledge and each as you can see on the left hand side it's the the fragment of the ontology in order to understand all this kind of the creation and preservation of this data you are you need to understand the data processing and interpretation but also the relations of the database one and two as you can see and the numbers and the taxonomies as well as the coding and sheets so these kind of environments and this kind of tools digital tools gives you this holistic view about the project and also that of documentation and archiving and here is as each you might notice that archiving is the story is not the same thing but it means that this kind of the managing the metadata information about this kind of tables and database and understand how to use the data and this is this gives you the the opportunity to collect it where it was collected than on their child so to understand that I'm gonna give you an example so while we were talking about the chat alone project obviously everything collected during the years can not be in the archive because this kind of living our archive website it shows you the the the who collected and how it was collected and it's open access in the personalization aspect is in different scientific fields you can also contribute this knowledge on the creation of the project at the same time you have to be possible in terms of taste archiving so it can be by years by whom and by there and then so it's kind of tight providing you this possible archiving website to the this platform and the last one is data publication and dissemination here it's very simply providing this data in from one source and into the several different sources what my it means using this interfaces you present and publish and disseminate the knowledge so for one of the project that we were involved b arky oh we were building this website so this website actually serves both publication and also dissemination propose so anyone can reach this data but this data it comes from strictly from these excavations in Japan about in a coffin under atone and it's also coming from the and scientific perspective so in order to do that creating this kind of interfaces for the users both for scientific and general public is very crucial to have this personalized access because also it gives you an opportunity to combine backend and the front-end and also this kind of knowledge one is created in the system you can reflect it in the exhibitions and you can reflect it in the publication so what we learn and just conclude a little bit that it's important to concern con sexualize the entire process digital creation gives you this opportunity and also gives you this kind of management and management of skills to decide the tasks in advance because it's important to define the roles and responsibilities in the beginning and to do that you need to gain the knowledge and also then exchange to know how to train for the specific tools and the software application which I told that it's not the same for each scientific communities so digital creation helps in this issue of the personalization the further steps of my research on the other hand is about removing dust and frameworks and then compare them and then eventually create a unified with the situation framework so thank you we would like to hear your thoughts I hope you enjoyed and you can always email me and my supervisor and also I put some additional input here if you are interested in the Archaea project and also my PhD program take for culture and also you can always reach me through my personal website thank you
