with that welcome lucina we  are very much looking forward to your election thanks very much uh dr van horn it's really a  pleasure to be here virtually with all of you   um share some of our work in this area and i  do wish i could be there in person for all of   these different activities but um until then the  virtual format will have to do so um what i'd like   to share with you today is just some some thoughts  and some data about the topic of neuroinformatics   and cognitive ontologies so for those of us  working in cognitive neuroscience we know that   there have been decades and decades of fmri  functional magnetic resonance imaging work   that's identified distinct patterns of brain  activation that occur while participants perform   different kinds of cognitive tests and the goal of  course is to map the areas of the brain that are   involved in different types of cognitive processes  um sort of the goal of cognitive neuroscience   very broadly and what we would like to suggest  here today is that these data can in principle   be used to provide the basis for constructing  a biologically informed data-driven ontology or   taxonomy of psychological processes and there's  many others who've worked in this area too over   the years and i'll draw on some of that literature  as well so in this talk i'd like to highlight some   of the progress and challenges associated with  the construction of cognitive ontologies using   informatics approaches and based on functional  neuroimaging data so let me go the right direction   let's see okay so what is a cognitive ontology um  so an ontology generally is a branch of philosophy   that deals with the nature and organization  of reality so what things are there in the   world out there how do we carve up nature at its  joints that's really what ontology deals with   um and so a cognitive ontology then would  be a formal description of concepts that are   assumed to exist within a particular domain  here we're talking about psychology and the   interrelationships between them so uh one sort of  easy way of thinking about ontologies is just what   are the knowledge structures that we you know know  about uh that we use to communicate amongst each   other so you know we just saw the the nba finals  with the the lakers uh coming out as champs again   um and if you think about an ontology of the nba  you have things like basic units like players that   belong to teams and you have a western conference  in an eastern conference and knowing this   knowledge structure tells you that in the finals  you're going to have a team from the west play   a team from the east because that's the structure  of the nba and knowing all the things we do about   teams and their compositions and the players  that make them up it tells us something about   what we can expect um in any uh you know given  category to contain so just knowledge of the   way the nba works is a particular ontology and  just like that we we had these sort of knowledge   structures in in various domains so you know in  the case of of cognitive ontology we might uh   think about something like a particular task  um and how we should categorize that so many   people use these simple task paradigms the flanker  task is one in which the participant is asked look   at the arrow in the center and tell me if it's  pointing to the left or pointing to the right and   you use a button press to indicate your response  and the challenge of this task is sometimes   there's flankers to that central arrow going in  opposite direction and um you know anytime you   do this behavioral paradigm it slows people down  when there are arrows uh pointing in the opposite   direction of the center arrow this task has been  around for a long time and we use it um you know   in the laboratory uh and the question is what  what are we using this task for what process what   cognitive process do we think we're tapping when  we do a task like this and a cognitive ontology   the research in this area would actually formalize  this kind of question so if you had for example so if you had one individual who says well this  is a response inhibition test that's what we're   measuring here the cognitive construct of response  inhibition and then you might have another   scientist say no what we're really looking at when  we ask people to do this is error detection that's   what i think the flanker task is mapping and in  what we do when we look at cognitive ontology   research is formalize this type of disagreement  into a research program where um you know we can   say well let's figure out what it what cognitive  construct or process is this task really tapping   and how do we get to the answer to that question  uh what what is a way to sort of uh create a   better cognitive ontology or categorization of  these mental and uh psychological constructs   so there's several approaches for constructing  cognitive ontologies and they can sort of broadly   fall into the category of uh bottom up top bottom  up and top down so a top-down approach is where   you would use expert knowledge and opinion  to um you know get a group of researchers   to agree well when you do this task what you're  really engaging is this cognitive construct and   now we all agree on that and we can write it  down and use it to communicate um so there's   been a lot of work in this area um using  expert opinion and topic modeling of text   in article databases you'll see some of the  references here russ podrick's group ng laird   jessica turner italia arcone have done a lot of  this work building a top-down sort of cognitive   ontology and of course the benefit to something  like that is that you can you know produce a   detailed ontology of relationships and entities  but there is of course the downside that this may   fail to map onto actual divisions or categories  of nature and uh and there's some other downsides   that i'll mention in in a minute but um this has  been one sort of popular approach for construction   of a cognitive ontology and on the other hand  you have this bottom-up approaches it's usually   a data-driven or more informatics-based approach  so data-driven classification or clustering of   functional imaging or behavioral data and you  can also you know use supervised machine learning   for this type of thing or exploratory unsupervised  machine learning um and uh this this bottom-up   approach basically um you know can try to derive  cognitive processed categories of cognitive   processes directly from task fmri patterns and the  pros of this is that this an ontology derived in   this manner might more likely reflect actual  divisions or categories of nature that we see   but they may not necessarily provide enough detail  to be a practical use for knowledge representation   so um you know every sort of approach has  has its pros and cons so one example just to   you know that many people might be familiar with  is of a top-down approach is this research domain   criteria that the national institute of health  has um sort of put forth and this is a way uh   it's a sort of a call for new ways of classifying  mental illness that are based on dimensions of   observable behavior and neurobiological measures  um and other measures and this is uh just a real   um kind of summary of some of the categories  within the research domain criteria uh back   in 2016 i was part of this cognitive group  the blue group here in the middle um that   basically it was a group of experts who decided  what the categories were that um would be of use   for study um you know to standardize across uh  psychiatric disorders and uh to push forward   uh personalized medicine and so forth um and being  on the panel of you know on this top down panel   made me realize sort of firsthand what were  some of the downsides of doing the top-down   approach and one of them is of course everyone who  studies uh cognitive neuroscience has their own   biases and their own sort of lifetime of of ways  of thinking about things and so expert based   approaches are prone to the kinds of biases that  experts have so you may be a person who studies   executive function so you think these particular  aspects of cognition are the most important or   the most salient or the most interesting for  investigation doesn't necessarily mean that's   the way the brain is carved up or that's the way  that the mind works but um so you know that this   was a top-down kind of ontological approach um  but the reason that this sort of research domain   criteria has been so popular is that the goal was  to carve up psychiatric disorders in a way that's   not just symptom-based so it's not just you see  a person with observable symptoms in this manner   and you put them into major depression or bipolar  or some other category because you know of course   symptoms themselves cannot tell you much about  the underlying mechanism so perhaps if you look at   genetic risks brain activity physiology behavior  and life experience and derived data-driven   clusters of individuals who were more similar  within cluster than a cross-cluster um those   those people might not all fall into the category  of major depressive disorder but they might all   be most uh well treated by a particular type  of of drug or intervention because once you've   identified clusters that are more homogeneous the  treatment and kind of response research can be   more targeted and hopefully more uh efficient so  rdoc has really prompted individuals in the field   of psychiatry to rethink how psychopathology  might be best served by building a framework   that's based more on biological and cognitive  validity so you know a lot of people working   with the rdoc framework now look for research  findings that cut across diagnostic boundaries   and uh you know this is all towards the sort of  goal of precision medicine so you can see why you   know despite there being flaws in the top-down  approach there there's been a lot of success   with this uh method and um there's been a lot of  work uh this was from russ paul drake and talia   irconi trying to derive things like cognitive  atlases which carve up the space of uh you know   of all the different cognitive constructs in  a way that lets us use a common language to   communicate about them so this cognitive atlas  project is basically a collaborative knowledge   building project aimed at developing an ontology  characterizing the current state of cognitive   neuroscience um and so this nice paper uh  summarizes some of the constructs you see all the   time cognitive control working memory executive uh  you know function and what tasks measure them um   that tasks that we use as scientists um and sort  of how the different things map onto each other   based on basically what the field is already doing  so this is just a summary of what is actually   going on in cognitive psychology and cognitive  neuroscience and cognitive sciences more broadly   um and as you can see uh this you know similar to  what ardoc is trying to do the goal here is that   if you uh you know understand a particular process  like response inhibition um which we then map onto   a brain region which we think well the trilateral  prefrontal cortex seems to be involved um then you   can look at things like signaling pathways genes  that contribute to uh function of those regions   and then at the highest level syndromes in  which that particular function is disrupted   and cutting across different diagnoses as well so  all these projects kind of get at the same goal   of relating biological functions and processes  eventually to things like psychiatric syndromes   a similar effort is called the cognitive paradigm  ontology put forth by jessica turner and angela   laird and this was based on a drawing from the  taxonomy of the brain map project which many   of you are probably familiar with the brain map  database includes uh coordinates from you know   thousands and thousands of task activation  studies that have been coded in particular ways   and what the cognitive paradigm ontology  does is represent the characteristics of   the cognitive paradigms that have been used in  fmri literature over the years so this is a uh   the brain map database itself  includes these categories like   the experimental paradigm that was used and  the type of stimulus the response type um   you know uh all these different sort of categories  um that are used to characterize the broad you   know the broad database of fmri studies that  are available today so this is another sort of   a way of organizing what's what's out there  um and this is just one example that i like   why am i going backwards there we go  another example i like of uh trying to   identify cognitive components from neuroimaging  work um from thomas joe's group and uh here he   um basically used an author topic hierarchical  vision modeling uh approach to apply this to   contrast from the brain map database to derive  what he's called here cognitive components that um   you know may contribute to performance of specific  tasks like working memory or attention tests   and a very nice sort of mapping between experiment  tasks cognitive components and the brain regions   involved this is very interesting paper that i  recommend for for those who want more on this   topic the reason i particularly like this paper  is because he he quantified what brain regions   use the most number of cognitive components  and really interestingly there's the areas   here in red you see one of them is the anterior  insula is basically activated in many many many   tasks and paradigms and experiments and as you can  see it's it's got a very high number of cognitive   components a lot of my work uh in the lab that  i'm not going to be talking about today focuses   on the role of the anterior insulin brain network  dynamics and i think it's just very interesting   that you can use completely data-driven approaches  to show the same thing that we've been doing   using things like meta-analytic connectivity  modeling and dynamic functional connectivity   looking at the flexibility of the insular  region and here you can see the flexibility   uh here is associated with the fact that this  region just participates in all kinds of uh all   manner of tasks so really interesting findings um  and so what we uh you know what i'm gearing up to   tell you about today is some of the work that  uh taylor bolt in the lab did when he was a phd   student and he left the lab a few years ago and  is now a data scientist at deloitte but he's still   publishing with us even though he uh he's taken  a position in industry so um really fantastic and   interesting work for his dissertation here where  he began a project that was sort of a data mining   cognitive ontology discovery project looking at  these task fmri data repositories with the goal of   mining them to look for clues of how patterns  of bold activity might delineate categories of   psychological function following up on some of  the you know the work that i showed you on the   introductory work that i showed you and the  goals of um this project here that was done   in collaboration with andrew laird and simon  eichoff and others i think this just came out   in neuroinformatics in 2020 the goal here was to  identify data-driven uh dimensions of a potential   ontology based upon the ability of that ontology  to explain variability between patterns of brain   activity and the approach he took here was a  whole brain representational similarity analysis   to quantify spatial similarity among task  activation maps within brain map and here the   assumption is that important features of existing  ontological categories um could be identified in   terms of the amount of how much variance they  explain in task activation map similarities   so that was the um you know the goal in  this project so what he actually did in this   set of analyses was applied an  unsupervised clustering approach   to all the task activation patterns that could  be derived from the date frame map database   coordinates and here this analysis included  15 over 15 000 activation maps that yielded   almost 9 000 contrasts that's contrast between  um you know different conditions in an fmri test   and they were all of course derived from  activation peak coordinates that are what   are available in the brain map database and um  this involved a data driven dimension reduction   and a multivariate distance matrix regression  so um so basically we started here with   this is an unsupervised clustering approach  applied to the entire corpus of the reported   activation coordinates in the brainmap database  and he began here with the construction of   uh activation maps from these reported  peak coordinates of task fmri studies   um and then a dimension reduction step  um dementia result reduction of these   voxel level maps to a smaller set of networks  using sparse non-negative matrix factorization   and then a clustering of uh basically an  activation map by activation map similarity   matrix based on the similarities and network and  activation estimates between the different uh   activation maps from these coordinates so there  are there were two goals on one was sort of to   identify how closely the uh the labels in  the brain map database really explained   differences in task activation patterns across  this huge database and the second goal was to   see if we could use a more bottom-up approach to  derive latent categories directly from the data   so um the way this worked um well interestingly  the unsupervised clustering of all these um brain   map activation maps uh yielded a four cluster  solution that achieved the most replicability   using a cross-validation approach and this  four-cluster solution could be sort of divided   up into these broad categories of tasks uh object  viewing complex action affect introspection social   and auditory motor um but note um of course  these sort of four clusters um showed a lot of   overlapping the activation maps that were  associated with them so um you know the the   only cluster that didn't look a lot like the  others was the affect social cluster which uh   resembled a little bit uh the default mode network  which we'll talk about in a bit but what this   type of analysis suggests that the um the current  those i forgot to mention that the the current   labels in the brain map database didn't um explain  as much of the variance in the test activation map   as these latent clusters so this suggests that the  current descriptions of cognitive processes and   the tasks used to elicit them do not necessarily  reflect activation patterns commonly observed   in the human brain and this is just to to note  that yeah the four data driven latent dimensions   explained a greater variation among activation  maps than all the conventional labels that were   already present in the brain map database that  were used uh to categorize the tasks in the   brainmap database and this is just showing that  the sort of task uh you know the default mode and   the negatively correlated frontal parietal systems  it's sort of a ubiquitous pattern that you see in   you know resting state fmri as well we'll get  back to that um a little bit later in the talk   um and this is just a little  bit more of a view of the four   um uh activation profiles and the associated uh  constructs with each of them and this will be   probably not so easy to read here but you can find  the full table in the paper if you're interested   um it's just another view of the cluster one two  three and four in terms of the different task   paradigms and different constructs that seem to  be associated with these types of activation maps   and this was just a you know on the left showing  you how we determined the number of clusters and   there was both a four and a seven cluster solution  that showed high levels of of stability but if you   look here on the right the um the four cluster  solution and the seven cluster solution derived   in a data-driven manner really uh explained more  variants than the traditional brain map labels on   the bottom which are behavioral domain and test  paradigm for example um so the basically the   similar similarity matrices here with brighter  colors within the red lines and cooler colors   outside are showing you that the um they're sort  of more well separated groups of task activation   maps in the top two matrices than in the bottom  two meaning that the cluster solution that he   derived in a data-driven fashion was better able  to explain differences in activation maps than   the labels that have been provided already by the  users in the brain map database so in summary here   task paradigm which is one of the categories that  that brainwave database includes seemed to explain   more variants among test activation patterns  than other dimensions um including the latent   categories that you saw there and and this means  that like when an individual is is deciding on   particular tasks to study a particular construct  like working memory for example that which   paradigm they choose can be very important because  different test paradigm as a category explains a   lot of the variants among these activation maps  study id which is what you know which study the   activation maps came from actually explains  about 50 of variance and activation patterns   um and the data derived late inactivation states  uh we saw here um were associated with kind of   known functional systems from frontal parietal  um salient sensory motor and default activation   patterns and those four data driven latent  dimensions appear to explain greater variance   among activation maps than all the conventional  ontological dimensions combined so these are um   just some clues that that just because we  think well we have a working memory task   or we call it a working memory task um you know  it doesn't necessarily share activation patterns   with other things that are called working memory  tasks and in fact the uh the labels that we've   been using all along um you know may need to  be revisited and if we're really looking for   things that explain great variants amongst brain  activation patterns then the current categories   um that are used the current labels that are  used don't seem to be doing a great job of that   um so that was uh there's another  kind of way to to ask this question   the first analysis was trying to classify  activation maps into separable categories   um and and you know have you know separable  clusters but not sort of account for commonalities   um between them so there was a lot of overlap  in the clusters i just showed you however   um that's because the goal of a this that  unsupervised clustering algorithm was to   highlight the differences among the maps not the  commonalities so the next goal was to sort of   explore the commonalities that were observed in an  exploratory model and here um what he chose to do   was a bi-factor analysis to explicitly model a  general commonality that could exist across all   activation maps while allowing for subclusters  to emerge within this general pattern um and   um and this analysis oops yeah so this  analysis uh required us to accurately   estimate similarities and differences between  activation maps and the p-coordinate meta-analysis   you know that that is permitted by brain  map wasn't quite sufficient for this job   what we really wanted here was unthresholded  activation maps and we found those available   in the neurovault database as well as the  human connectome project those are two   places where unthresholded active whole brain  activation maps are available so um you know   using all the task fmr activation maps available  in neurovault and in the human connectome project   yielded 108 activation maps across a  variety of task domains that we could   use in order to to follow up  or to ask this question so um oops okay so the approach here was to  first do a data reduction to reduce   the spatial dependence between the activation  estimates across voxels um then we uh enter   we conducted a initial extraction phase  in which an initial factor solution is   estimated and the appropriate number of factors  is determined by parallel analysis followed by   a bi-factor analysis phase in which the factor  analysis is re-estimated with estimated number   of factors from the initial extraction phase  and a bi-factor rotation criteria and finally   testing the fit of other alternative factor  structures using confirmatory factor analysis   so um how did this work so this is just a test  activation conjunction and test deactivation   conjunction across all those maps and as sort of a  sanity check you can see a lot of frontal parietal   and um you know insular and cingulate systems  are activated across all tasks and deactivated   default mode network regions uh you  know as one might sort of expect so um so basically um the first step was a data  reduction as i mentioned and um this was sort   of followed up by the bi-factor analysis approach  where each task activation map representing   um activation uh here in red associated with a  particular task is modeled as arising from direct   effects of a single latent general factor and  various lane sub factors so this was a way of sort   of first accounting for all the commonalities we  see across the task activation maps regardless of   task as well as sort of sub um you know activation  or sub factors that account for differences among   different task activation patterns so this results  of this five factor analysis suggests a general   factor which explained over 50 percent of the  variance in the activation maps and again it   looks very familiar to um sort of task positive  test negative or default mode and you know front   to parietal systems that we see sort of across all  kinds of both tasks and rest paradigms but within   the you know in addition to this general factor we  saw as well subtypes which explained an additional   31 percent of the variance in activation maps  um so um you know this is suggests that uh that   there is sort of a hierarchical structure to  these um these patterns that we we have observed   so what else do we know about this pattern of  you know the sort of midline regions um with the   lateral frontal parietal regions so this kind of  lateral frontal parietal system is independently   described as a multiple demand system or domain  general test system or the extrinsic mode or the   executive control system it just goes by a lot of  names and i'll bring up this point again in a few   slides about what i think about the problem of  all this nomenclature and then there's the sort   of midline regions that are often described as  a default mode network and of course there's   seems to be antagonist antagonistic relationships  between these sets of systems and the the pattern   um that you see is pretty ubiquitous if you look  at um you know if you look at uh gradients of   functional connectivity here on the left with  margulies if you look at co-activation pattern   analysis um you know if you look at the posterior  cingulate and its co-activation again you get this   default mode network if you look at correlations  of brain areas with amplitude of eg alpha rhythm   um this pattern of sort of lateral frontal  parietal versus medial frontal parietal regions   is ubiquitous across different analysis techniques  research questions tasks or resting stata from rye   so this shows that the single activation pattern  dominating uh most observed tests and from our   activation maps is is uh this positive negative  pattern we've seen over and over again um and   any cognitive ontology derived from an exploratory  analysis of task fmri activation map seems to be   it should be dominated by this pattern so  understanding what this pattern represents   is i think essential for any cognitive ontology  or any construction of a set of um you know basic   principles by which cognition uh is organized  in terms of um underlying brain activation   and that um all of this brings me to our sort of  current work which uh centers more around uh brain   networks and cognitive neuroscience so i've been  talking a lot about individual brain areas that   are activated or not in response to specific  cognitive tasks or specific instructions or   specific paradigms but what our lab really focuses  on a lot these days is network approaches and   network neuroscience um and understanding that you  know brain regions don't really work in isolation   right um and you have sort of patterns of  frequent co-activation and patterns of functional   connectivity that um are sort of underlying a lot  of what you see when you look at task fmri data   and one thing um we've sort of been trying to  tackle in our recent uh work is this problem   that you people refer to different brain  regions belonging to different brain networks   in a way that's not at all standardized um  for example you know for a region like the   anterior insula um you can look at the cognitive  neuroscience literature and find people saying   well the anterior insulin is part of the singular  circular network the anterior slowest part of the   stainless steel work the anterior so it's part  of a ventral attention network um and they may   also ascribe um overlapping yet unique roles for  these uh brain regions within these networks so um   you know i see this as a problem for the field in  terms of developing a common language developing   taxonomies that we can use to communicate amongst  ourselves um so how how are we going to define a   functional brain network given we don't have this  consensus at present and how many functional brain   networks are there these are of course ill-posed  questions but they're sort of what's uh keeping us   up at night right so um you know i started to do  this work with thomas yo and nathan spring uh last   year where we tried to move towards developing  a universal taxonomy of macroscale functional   human brain networks i mean i think this just  relates a lot to the work that's being done in the   um construction of cognitive ontologies i think  for obvious reasons and this was a an initial stab   at this difficult question that we took um and  this was just the stance that if we start to use   similar terminology across studies we may really  make progress in terms of of of human brain   mapping and if we don't have conventions and we  don't have consistent nomenclature it will just   hinder future progress in this field so luckily um  i was able to convince the new ohbm best practices   committee that what we really need is to have a  committee of individuals working on this topic who   have worked in connectivity who have worked  in um meta-analysis and worked in anatomy   to come together and see if we can have reach  a consensus of sorts on this really important   nomenclature issue so the first thing um you know  we did initially was just look at what's already   out there and um almost every like independent  component analysis or brain parcellation or um you   know connectivity modeling approach meta-analytic  approach almost everything identifies something   with a visual back-of-the-brain network as you  can see and here's steve smith work on the left   comparing resting state networks to the brain map  data base meta-analyses on the right thomas use   you know well-known functional parcellation of  the brain on the bottom one by evan gordon and   you can see there's always seems to be something  called a visual network or an occipital network so   maybe that should be one of the things we include  in our taxonomy of networks when we eventually   build one um you can also almost always see  something like a somatosensory or somatomotor   or um you know motor cortex network you can  see it in resting state parcellations here   on different resolutions and you know if you  obviously parcellate the brain into smaller and   smaller bits you can subdivide these networks into  subsystems so this seems to be you know a place we   can start and then you get into these higher level  cognitive association areas there's been what's   been called the dorsal attention network from many  years of cognitive neuroscience research showing   that sort of top-down attention engages these  frontal eye field and posterior parietal areas   and meta-analytic connectivity modeling  suggests that something like this exists   and you can see in green the dorsal attention  network comes out in several different   parsolations of the whole brain um so these are we  think some starting points um this one and as we   get further along we get into more controversial  perhaps and less agreed upon um nomenclatures   but you you know people talk about executive  control central executive multiple demand   as i mentioned um this this network seems to have  a lot of names um on the right it's uh classified   as frontal parietal and uh on the left these are  from um executive individuals who refer to these   networks as executive control or central executive  networks uh so there just needs to be a little bit   more um agreement upon what label we should use to  to describe systems or activations or connectivity   within these regions and here's one that's you  know close to my heart and also very controversial   um you know in my work i've called the insular acc  network the salience network and but there seems   to be a lot of overlap anatomically with what's  been called the ventral attention network as well   as the singular particular network um and there  seems to be a lot more variability in terms of the   spatial topography here and uh you know this one  will be a difficult one to come to a consensus on   but the nomenclature that we're proposing here  is is more anatomical based and less and more   agnostic with regards to what we think the actual  function is so if we see mid-singular insular you   know connectivity or activation we might just say  okay well that's a midsingulated solar network   and that will prompt us to um you know more  consistently identify this uh in future work   um and this of course the default mode network  everybody has known about for many years   and we're even proposing to rename that as a  medial frontal parietal network with the idea that   sticking with the anatomical  terms will help us moving forward   and of course you see fractionation  within this network you see subsystems   it's not a sort of monolithic entity so this is  where a lot of work needs to be done to parse that   and what we should call these subsystems for  example so you know this is one example of a i   would say this was a top-down approach at deriving  a taxonomy of functional brain networks this is   the initial uh breakdown that we observe or  that we agreed upon but again the reason we   formed the current best practices committee  was because we really need sort of wholesale   buy-in from the community in order to make any  taxonomy work so it doesn't really make sense   for me to call something amid singular and solar  network in a paper if no one else is adopting   that terminology and no one else knows what i'm  talking about so these are some of the ongoing   challenges and goals for our current best  practice committee on network nomenclature   and why we still need to refine this taxonomy it  should be obvious i gave a twitter talk on this   a few months back about what about network  dynamics what about inter-individual variability   and activation and connectivity what about  subcortical brain regions what about the idea   that networks fractionate into subsystems and the  hierarchies i just talked to you about what about   these hierarchies these are all things that you  know require a lot of discussion and so the group   we have assembled is now meeting once a month to  hopefully tackle these issues and see where we get   and i think one of the things that will make  this program or this uh goal hard to achieve   is that networks don't just kind of stay in one  place and do the same thing from moment to moment   um there's really a nice theoretical paper by  marshall messellembeck from the 90s talking about   how cognition is subserved by interconnected  neural networks and complex behaviors mapped   at the level of multifocal neural systems  rather than specific anatomical sites so even   you know back in the day before fmri we knew that  it wasn't as simple as one brain region does one   cognitive process you know multiple brain  regions contribute to multiple processes   um and you could see that even with uh you know a  neuropsychological approach we also know that the   function of a brain region and brain area can  often depend on the status of other connected   areas this was the idea of of neural context put  forth by randy macintosh so a set of nodes here   for example the gray nodes um might behave in a  particular way uh when the black nodes are there   activated but behave in a different way when the  the black nodes in b are activated so this context   is important for the function um and lastly  something we're very interested in is dynamics   and how regions change raid regions change  their affiliation over time in the matter of uh   you know seconds and probably even milliseconds um  and so a network of course needs to be understood   in terms of the interactions between multiple  brain regions as they unfold temporally so i think   because of all of these issues uh with respect  to dynamics and many to many mapping of brain   region to function all of these issues will make  it really difficult to arrive at a taxonomy or   um you know ontology of brain networks but  you know nevertheless will will uh persist   so this is uh you know just a short overview  of how i think neuroinformatics can contribute   to the formation of cognitive ontologies  this work was really done by taylor bolt um   and you know congrats to him for uh pushing our  lab into this direction um and angie laird has   been a great collaborator um simon eichoff thomas  joe and nathan spring um and of course the funding   sources have um you know made this uh you know  all possible in many ways so i wanted to just   close by saying um you know vote like your life  depends on it because that's been the only thing   on my mind for the last few weeks and i just  thought um if we haven't yet um please do and   this is our you know the only hope that keeps  us going at this point and uh now i'm in san   diego on sabbatical so this is um this is my  sort of morning view and uh i'm i'm happy to   to leave the rest of the time for questions and  and want to say thanks again very much for this   kind of invitation and for uh providing me the  opportunity to share some of this this work that   i've been very excited about i'm happy to take any  questions now i'll hand it back over to you jack   thank you lucina that was a fantastic overview  of cognitive ontologies many of the challenges   which exist and uh it's just uh an area which i  have observed either either been involved with   those discussions or observed for many years and  you're absolutely right it's a very challenging   problem um and one of the things i think you kind  of i want to encourage our data science innovation   lab participants to send in any questions via the  chat but while we're waiting for a few um i was   very you you touched on a couple of key things you  have the kind of the expert opinion about how the   ontology ought to be constructed and um i remember  you mentioned russ poldrack a number of times and   he's a a colleague and friend and he's mentioned  to me uh several times it's uh trying to get a   bunch of psychologists to agree on what to call  things you can maybe get them to agree on the top   most layer of the ontology but you get about two  layers in and it becomes a probabilistic fog of   what people are gonna call it and um so there's  this sort of lack of consensus with regard to   these um kind of psychological constructs and  you kind of mentioned some things about the um   uh the uh um what did i have in my notes  kind of the labeling of various tasks   and this sort of reminded me of you know what you  call something and what it actually measures maybe   two different things this notion like construct  validity um what is your feeling about how we   can kind of clean some of that up in order to make  some of these challenges a little more attractive   yeah i mean that's exactly you hit the nail on  the head i know you've been working in this area   as well over the years and we're sort of new  to it so i i haven't tried to do the difficult   task um that you know russ and others have been  doing which is to try to get scientists to agree   that okay this task measures this construct and  um and you know this one instead measures that   i haven't been involved in those discussions  and um and to be completely honest the the bit   that i have like in the construction of the  rdoc cognitive domain it's been frustrating   because so much of it is ego driven you know  if you spent your 20 years of your career   building up a task to study working memory and  suddenly someone tells you well if you look at it   this way it's not really studying that at all it's  studying this other thing i think people are often   really um loathed to give up their favorite task  or to concede that they're not measuring a pure   construct the way they thought they were so that i  think that has to sort of give way a little bit to   but what do the data tell us you know uh the  kind of thing taylor was doing it looking at   similarity across activation maps is one way  to do it like if if they're measuring similar   things do they activate you know uh similar brain  regions that's one way of thinking about it right   um so but you know it's not the only way of  course they're just because regions are activated   similarly doesn't mean there isn't a pattern  within there that could differ differentiate   um so as many people know there's there's a lot  of patterns within boxes of activation that could   again be discriminative so um i feel like everyone  you know the field we all need to kind of take a   step back and say well is the goal to be right  about what is working memory or is the goal to   come to a consensus where we can all speak  a common language and move forward and   and uh you know be a little bit more um clear  in in what we're saying when we use a particular   terminology so i actually do think  we're getting towards that but um slowly   it sounds like an advertisement for the use  of data science to help some of this stuff   out doesn't it i would say that yeah one of the  things which is kind of interesting and maybe you   have a comment on this as well is that um a lot of  these data driven or computational topic modeling   type approaches um they create a reality from what  they're given yeah and we see these biases creep   in we see this kind of particularly um in machine  learning and ai kind of applications for like face   recognition that certain ethnic groups don't get  represented properly don't get identified in the   right way and obviously this sort of thing you  can see how this might get baked into any sort   of data science application of these very rich  uh data sets how can do you have any idea about   how some of these data-driven approaches uh for  cognition can be more robust or at least honest   about the potential biases that exist and that  might be driven by what's trendy in the literature   and you know may drive these things like you said  there's some egos involved always yeah this is a   great question that's so important for a lot of uh  reasons um in terms of equity uh and i think the   the best i mean you cannot guard against human  biases because they exist on so many levels but   what you can do is build the most diverse teams um  you know if you have programmers from all over the   world and different you know ethnic backgrounds  they'll be more likely to notice when these biases   creep into an algorithm and they'll be more likely  to test against those kinds of things so you know   having these diverse teams is is critical for  the science it's not just the right thing to do um absolutely um one other thing is uh there's  other kinds of biases though as well um one being   like publication bias and so when you draw from a  literature or from a database that is leveraging   a lot of uh different results from around the  field you can get biases because people just   publish stuff that's statistically significant so  things that aren't significant which would greatly   inform your ontology you just don't even see them  and so again you've created a reality out of stuff   that's statistically significant is that helpful  exactly um this is the file drawer problem uh what   i've been heartened by is the um the emergence  of these new journals i think neuroimage has one   now coming out their image reports um and  aperture the new ohbm journal there's so   many journals that are now realizing the need for  reporting all results you know good bad and ugly   because that that that's what you need in order to  um get a full picture of what people are actually   finding it doesn't help if only 20 of studies get  published because those are the ones people label   as interesting it i'm more of a fan of you  know publishing everything somewhere because   publishing is the way you communicate what you did  and it just because what you did wasn't the most   exciting thing doesn't mean that other people  don't need to know that you did it absolutely   it might stop them from going down a road or it  might put them on a different path to explore   you know something that hasn't gotten a lot of  uh attention but yeah i agree with you completely   that this file drawer problem makes it hard for  data science because you can only do meta-analysis   or you can only do a data-driven approach  on data that exists or it's published so if   there were you know no there's no studies in the  brain map database that are not published right   there's a whole sociology about uh  data sharing um in neuroscience i   was the tip of the spirit of that for a little  while i could tell you horror stories but um   it's uh it's just a very interesting thing it's  i'm pleased to see these journals taking this   on and trying to do something about that i  think that's a positive step well one thing   i wanted to ask you about is um something about  the um the stability of these networks um and   how reproducible are they this is not only from a  empirical point of view and a replication point of   view but also in terms of the analytic procedure  which is used to identify them many times people   use the independent components analysis method  to be able to partition these networks into   their different components from the data um  there's some mathematical challenges though with   some of the most widely used methods which they  sort of take a guess at to the initial state of   the weighting matrix that produces the independent  components analysis result um the challenge there   is that while it may converge after that random  guess it may converge on a particular network   structure that totally satisfies the matrix  equations it's supposed to satisfy if you run   it again you'll get a different guess and you'll  get a different solution and even if you average   across all those potential uh solutions it's not  representative of what's actually going on and i   guess this uh brings to me the stability of these  and whether or not they can actually be truly   called functional networks if they vary so greatly  not only within a person but between people   right you get the idea yeah yeah it's just such a  great question it's so important i i would say it   the the bigger question here is um is almost uh  you know it's the same question of you know how   many networks are there so and that of course any  kind of uh data-driven clustering solution you can   either determine the number of clusters you can  say i want 20 independent components i want 100   independent components you can ask the algorithm  to automatically estimate the number of clusters   so it's a clustering problem as much as anything  else right so it's not unique to um brain networks   or brain regions that user defined clusters could  be one approach or you know data-driven clusters   could be another project then you have to evaluate  the stability of the clusters and you have   some metric for doing that and you might get a  different number based on which metric you use   so i think these are you know um problems that  are not unique to the question here we have   about networks um you know clustering and how  many there are what's the best solution that's a   problem generally right for anyone doing anything  like this so i then it's like which metric do you   trust enough what's amazing to me is the  um consistency of networks independent of   whether you do you know a resting state kind  of breakdown or a task meta-analysis or what's   what's what's surprising to me is that at a  given level let's say i i want 10 parcels or   10 networks at a given resolution there seems to  be a good amount of consistency between you know   different approaches and different data sets and  different techniques and not of course they're   not identical from one to the next but you know at  a given resolution it's it's a heartening to see   a good amount of um stability as it were so i mean  for example there's almost nothing you could do   there's almost no ica you could run that wouldn't  give you some kind of default mode network yeah   which is heartening it means you know something  is there it can break down certainly it can be   subdivided but you know seems like there's  something about the brain that lets it settle   into this state so you know there's hope is  what i'd like to say yeah it's uh some of the um   our participants in our data science  innovation lab are asking about the stability   and changes in these networks over the life span  and i know that you've mentioned some of the work   of michael gracias and he had done some work  kind of a long time ago now that looking at the   variation between people who have alzheimer's  disease in contrast to those who are otherwise   healthy agers in the context of their default mode  network and changes thereof do you do you see that   this is also something we should be looking  at is the changes in these networks as they   uh alter their structure over time uh 100 and you  know we do lifespan network development in my lab   is one of the things we're interested in um and  the all of the parcelations i showed you in the   last few slides are done on adult subjects and the  assumption is well that's how the brain is parsley   but of course anyone who does developmental  work knows that you have changes going from   infancy to childhood to adolescence to adulthood  um in the spatial topography and the connectivity   within in between networks these are these  are processes that develop and again change   with aging and with disease so of course this  is this is critical to understand there have   been as far as i know no attempts yet to parse  the brain in these um you know in these ways   across the lifespan in order to say well does this  parcel sort of change from childhood to adulthood   at the whole brain level i think people have  done this at like individual brain regions   um and i think i know a group in western ontario  who is working on this we're looking at age bins   let's say for example five to eight and eight to  twelve and twelve to fifteen and looking at how   whole brain organization in terms of the  parcellation changes in those um in a stepwise   manner uh there's other ways of doing it um and i  think uh the availability of large data sets to do   this kind of analysis is really what's what we're  waiting on i think there are some data sets but   you know not at the level that there are for hcp  and the other like normal adult samples so as soon   as we get more developmental samples across the  lifespan this will be super important to address   how can we integrate functional networks  with other means for measuring networks   for example diffusion tensor imaging  where you have a measure of structure   that could be used to guide and maybe inform  the functional networks that are being extracted   yeah i mean the multimodal integration part  is something that is so tricky because on the   one hand you want to say well okay these these  two approaches let's say structure and function   converge um but on the other hand why should  they converge they're measuring completely   different things you know axons versus statistical  uh relationships between fluctuations of old   signals so so when they do converge you say  great these these are telling us the same thing   when they don't there's a million reasons why  they couldn't and one thing we found early on   was that structure and function like let's say  diffusion metrics and functional connectivity   are high are seem to be very correlated in the  adult brain but when you look at children like   let's say seven to twelve there's very low  there's non-significant correlation between   structural and functional connectivity this  is something we noticed a while ago and   so something is happening you know something's  developing what comes first structure or function   you get into you know all of these chicken and egg  questions not not to say we don't care about this   but we haven't made uh progress in this or our lab  hasn't made progress in the multimodal integration   domain but i think others have vince calhoun's  group and others have really thought about this   more seriously do you think there's any sort  of uh opportunity for people who are developing   more uh comp i guess complete models of brain  networks that are more than just correlative   that this is correlated with that it's rather it's  a solution to a say a physical like a physical   network where you have you know a source and you  have a you know another source and there's a wire   between them and you could model the properties of  the wire and the signal that travels over that are   there any opportunities for those people in fact  i i before this the last international trip i took   was a conference in nepal that was a computational  neuroscience conference with you know victor yirza   and michael breakspeare and all these great people  and my plan for sabbatical was to go visit michael   breakspeare in australia and then visit gustavo  deco in barcelona that was my original plan   obviously the reason for that was because  of just what you said i think computational   modeling is the only way you can do  this um linking of different levels and   really testing what parameters affect what  you know what outputs and so my whole plan   was to spend my year instead of in san diego to  spend it with those labs in those nice locations   and and i'm hoping that the work that those  groups are doing um are going to feed into you   know these these questions of how many networks  are there and how do they change over time   because those are the only ways in which  you have complete control over all the   the different variables um and  unfortunately i'm not doing that   as you can see but that doesn't mean that  it won't be done eventually international   multi-hemispheric travel is going to have to be  put on hold on hold exactly a little while longer   i think on that note i want to thank you lucina  for uh providing us with this great overview of   this very interesting area of cognitive ontologies  and uh the role of uh data science and helping to   identify the structure and organization of these  different cognitive constructs and what that means   for the brain and for the data science that it's  going to take to be able to make some traction   um so thank you so much we really appreciate  chatting with you today thank you so such   a pleasure and uh yeah good luck to everyone  excellent and uh i want to thank everybody who   who joined us and uh we'll look forward to seeing  you uh next friday for the next edition of our uh   data science innovation lab seminar series  thank you everybody have a great weekend
