 Hello my name is Pedro Ruas and I'm here to present the work "Towards a Multilingual Corpus for Named Entity Linking Evaluation in the clinical domain" The first question is: What is Named Entity Linking? Imagine if you search the word “Pandemic” in Wikipedia you’d obtain several results because the word “Pandemic” is present in several articles titles For example “Pandemic” can refer to a disease outbreak to a novel to a film and even to a board game So, how will Wikipedia know what is the exact meaning of “Pandemic” in the context of your search? This is the central question in named entity linking because we have words or entities in text and we want to automatically link them to concepts in a knowledge base In this case, our knowledge base would be Wikipedia Why is it important? Because, nowadays, most of the web content is text and computers cannot understand very well text So first, we need to convert text in a more computer-friendly format For example, in Science, most of the results are published in scientific articles, which means text and human curators need to read these articles and transfer the scientific information to scientific databases But the problem is, every year, millions of articles are published So, the task of curating this information gets more difficult named entity linking systems can aid in this process of curation Can also improve relation extraction and question answering systems and, as we saw in the example before, can also improve search engines Why do we need multilingual evaluation resources? The existing datasets are useful for compare the performance of the several named entity linking systems and this comparison leads to the improvement of the systems But without evaluation resources for other languages than English This improvement cannot happen So we decided to build a named entity linking corpus or dataset for evaluation and we decided to focus on the clinical domain because usually it is a less explored domain comparing for example with news text or social media text The first step was to retrieve the clinical case reports from the SciELO database We obtained the English, Portuguese and Spanish abstracts of clinical case reports The next step was to automatically annotate these abstracts What does that mean, annotate? It means identify the medical diagnostic entities present in text and label them with a knowledge base label The first step was the named entity recognition For example, we have here “hypotension” identified in a abstract We applied the MER tool and here we have the original English sentence We have the entity mention “hypotension” The MER tool identified the begin position and the end position for this medical diagnostic entity We also have here the Portuguese and the Spanish versions of the same sentence and the respective identified entities The next step, we had the entities but we had to link them to a knowledge base and our knowledge base was ICD10-CM, which means International Classification of Diseases 10 – Clinical Modification So taking this example “hypotension” was labelled with the code I95 The final result was the MultiNEL corpus that contains six hundred and thirty nine abstracts of clinical case reports for each language: English, Portuguese and Spanish This corpus is available in our group GitHub page in this link over here For future work we intend to map the ICD10-CM codes to the respective Medical Subject Headings to expand the evaluation capability of this dataset and also because this vocabulary also contains Portuguese and Spanish versions Additionally we intend to validate the obtained annotations by humans, either by clinical experts or crowd-sourcing Besides this, these human validators will also add new annotations not identified by this automatic pipeline It’s everything Thank you all for listening
