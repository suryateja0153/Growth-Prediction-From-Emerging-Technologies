 hello my name is bach and i'm a phd student from the czech republic university of economics in prague i'm going to present to you a joint work of me and my colleague golam rabbi and project zlatik in collaboration with oscar corcho from the polytechnic university of madrid in this presentation i'm going to talk about our research paper and the name of the paper is ontology supporting research related information foraging using knowledge graphs literature survey and holistic model mapping so just a brief recap of the paper the paper itself focuses on identifying potential caloric overlaps and missing features in anthologies about research and the academic domain and to do that we look for anthologies that contain concept about research and we align these ontologies with a holistic model that we created using a competency question analysis and then we make the coverage to find out to which extent the anthologies that we found cover our model uh all of our results and materials and resources for this project is available on our github repository which can you can find under this link here and so for this presentation i'll talk about our motivations for doing this research and then a bit of related work uh i'll talk about the methodology and the approach that we used and for each phase i'll discuss the results so our first motivation here is that the information researchers want or need depends on their particular role in certain situations and because throughout the researchers career he could be involved in many different activities and his role can change each time and it is obvious that the type of information that is needed for each of these roles can be quite different and if we take a look at the academic domain itself we know that there is a good number of concepts that could be used to describe the whole domain and and this common basis is relatively generic across research fields and makes it possible to move from textual search to structured databases on the web and this is where knowledge graphs come in because they may help improve the exploration and integration of this kind of linked data that is well modeled using ontology schemas we found that the existing scholarly data sets or knowledge graphs they only cover a few types of entities mostly things like publications authors projects and maybe some kind of institutions that's why researchers usually need to manually combine knowledge from multiple sources most of which is actually unstructured textual search and that's why it is our goal to try to develop a holistic knowledge graph to address such needs so to do that we must understand the current state of ecosystem of reusable anthologies that could help build this knowledge graph and by doing so to identify the overlaps and gaps in the system this would help us better decide on choosing among the overlapping ontologies and possibly developing new ontologies to fill in the gaps so this is the couple of related work uh about anthologies that i want to mention uh in it is it's like quite evident that these this work focus on unlimited areas of research life um so there was a research gap that we wanted to cover uh and that is making a survey of ontologies related to daily activities of researchers in different roles and our contribution is therefore to update existing scholarly ontology surveys and aligning these ontologies with an analysis of information needs of different researcher roles and our approach is first we carried out a literature search to find related ontologies then we created a holistic conceptual graph model based on a comparison competency question analysis and and lastly we align the the concepts in the anthologies with the concept in the holistic model while looking for missing features and overlaps for the literature survey part we use online databases and search engines because given the fact that research related projects would be published in research literature we use scopus web of science google score and also google to make sure we do not miss any related ontology or relevant projects we followed a step-by-step procedure which can be seen in this figure here we use several generic keywords to find articles and projects we looked at the citations and gathered a bunch of links and related resources and they manually examined each resource and then created a list of anthologies with links to their source code and descriptions and sometimes even documentation as well another significant source for finding ontologies what was the linked open vocabulary catalog of anthologies uh in which we found some more relevant ontologies the result of this phase is a table of metadata of the anthologies that we found we have gathered 43 anthologies in total and we used 34 of them for further analysis and if you are interested you can go to our github repository to see the full list of anthologies together with their metadata so the next part is to create the holistic model that i talked about to do that we analyzed the resumes of an activity logs of two senior researchers and we interviewed them for what kind of information they would need in particular situations or in particular researcher roles and then together we identified the research roles which can be seen here and for each role we ask competency questions and provided answers using academic concept and their relationships so an example of such competency question might be how important are the venues where the researcher publishes this is a common question of people that evaluate researchers and the answer to this question could lie within the connection of concept such researcher publication venue and the assessment of this venue another example is at the bottom of the site the question which company or other organization is active in the given field as a potential industry transfer target this is the question asked by industry transfer promoters and the answer to this question involves the concepts of project topic and organization so from these complex questions we extracted rough fragments and used them to create the the holistic conceptual graph model which you can see here and here you can see the model with the interlink concept the connected nodes indicate that there is some relationship between the concepts and the nodes that have a self-loop uh for example public publication indicate that there could be a relationship between two instances of the same class one thing to note here is that we target the concept of the high level only uh the process of creating this model here is to have a glossary of terms and their hierarchies and after that we use the top level concepts to create this relationship model also note that the paths are not disambiguated and may correspond to multiple different relationships you can imagine that there could be like three or four separate connections hidden on hidden under one single edge and this is the further breakdown of the top concept these category members are needed after for the coverage analysis where we map existing anthologies onto the model for each of its concept and so we moved on to the coverage phase uh what we did here is we created a spreadsheet with the concept in relationships from the model and the con and the anthologies that we found during the literature survey so for each element in the model we determine whether it is covered in each ontology and by which class and properties in the ontology to do this we have to look for if we had to look into the ontology source code and their documentations to find the causes and properties and their meanings we note down every coverage match and put them in the table the matches are in many cases approximated we also aggregated the number of covered concepts for each ontology and the number of appearances of each concept in each ontology and therefore we ended up with the coverage table from which we uh identified missing features and in in each ontology and the overlaps of of concept coverage across these anthologies and this is the fragment of the table the the whole table can be found in our github repository so i'll just quickly explain the table structure here the first column is the element of from our holistic model the second column represents the the number of ontologies that cover this particular element the following columns are the actual anthologies where on the second row we have the number of terms that is covered in a particular ontology and in each cell under that you can see that we have note down the concept that represent the particular partial coverage and these are some of our observations after doing uh the coverage table and the result shows us that there are lots of research related concepts and they are pretty well covered by existing anthologies but mostly when combined because there's never a single anthology that covers our whole model and also there are some concepts that is sort of underdeveloped such as spin-offs funding programs and some forms of assessment and also we missed we missed a unifying superclass for um research outputs so a concept for that might be reusable artifact and so the conclusion of our paper is such that the covering analysis reviews a high number of overlaps in many areas while some others are untouched our paper has been focusing on the ecosystem of ontologies alone in the near future we plan to extend our survey to actual knowledge graphs and some existing tsri we also expect to add another dimension to our analysis regarding their usage in data sets and knowledge graphs that concludes my presentation thank you for listening
