 hello everybody happy monday we are back we are back for some wine had a bit of fun with the connection a moment ago so if you spot anything weird if it starts sounds coming up one second all right okay got rid of the echo uh so if you've got any um you know if i start going blurry or video skips let me know and then i'll have a play and see if i can fix that but apart from that welcome uh usual slot adventures with wine we didn't do last week so it's going to be a little bit sporadic over the next few weeks and that's because we are doing nodes extended what's notes 2020 extended i hear you ask well we had so many talks submitted so many amazing talks and we didn't have enough space in the schedule to fit them all in for the nodes 2020 day so what we've been doing is we're now scheduling loaded these talks to progressively like an online meetup so most of these are happening two talks a week so i'll try and get the link up in the chat so you can have a look in fact let me do we can do i'm going to just pop something in the chat very quickly so if you go to neo4j.com developer online hyphen meetup you should and i've just popped that in the chat you will get if you scroll to the bottom you'll get a list of the meetups that we're running so what i've done so i've got to fill out some of the details on this i will do that later today um but we've got various guests coming in and they're going to be doing their talks and what we're doing we're running this like a panel session so we're going to have a co-host so we had our first nodes extended last week and we've got our next one tomorrow so that's tomorrow at 2 p.m utc time so i was joined last week and i'll be joined again tomorrow the co-host nathan smith and what we do is we have the two talks and we had two great talks by chris and tim last week so they do their talks and at the end we have a panel conversation so we have the four of us chatting if you've been putting any questions in uh you put your questions in and then we answer those so that's great so talk about notes right i'm being told off by henry s here on youtube that we should be talking about wine or should we be drinking the drinking of the wine i think will come a little bit later henry but uh certainly let's start talking one but anyway nose extended keep a little eye out keep an eye out for that have a look at the schedule there's some really good stuff there so all right let's get cracking i've been told let's do this so what are we going to do today so last time we met so it was a couple of weeks ago i thought it was a good idea to just take stock and have a look at what we did so we basically revised and had a look at everything we've done up until today and the kinds of decisions we made and how we're going to change you know why we change the model why did we choose something over something else and so forth so we did all of that and today i was having a think well what we're going to do because i want to have a bit of fun with graphql at some point and i want to start building something so at the moment we've been theorizing with a lot of stuff and we've been talking about how we clean the data and the kinds of fun queries you can run but i'm gonna build something a bit fun so i'm gonna have a think about what that might be but we do still have a last bit of data that we have not yet imported so for those of you if you can remember let me just quickly uh scoot over to here uh you may or may not remember so let me pull one of the older data models is we had some things so we had this idea of region and it wasn't just region it was region one region two there may have been a region three i can't quite remember we have province and province and a number of provinces and we had country and i think we had this big sort of conversation about well we don't quite understand what they are is it the case of a country has a province has a region is it a country has a region has a province is it the case that region and province have intersex you know intersections and they kind of do the same thing we don't know and we kind of thought you know what let's just park that to one side and let's worry about what that looks like later and i thought you know what let's stop putting it off today's the day let's start having a think about what we're going to do with that data so let's try and figure out what it looks like let's figure out how we're going to change the data model to incorporate it and let's load it in that's the plan and again if you've got any questions pop them in the chat i will pick them up and we'll have a look at those and you know what let's just do for a bit of fun for a bit of fun um what's your favorite grape variety we we spent a lot of time on grape variety recently let's let's do a bit of fun so in the chat pop in what's your favorite grape variety you can have more than one i'll let you off so what are your favorite when you if you are getting a bottle of wine what would be your grape of choice how we can have a bit fun maybe we can throw in a grape a variety query at the end okay so that's that so what i want to do is let's remind ourselves of what that data looks like so if i go to localhost oh i couldn't find any contact details i've waited for live session i've run into descriptions for an ar text native extract entities are you interested to hi barry thanks thanks for the question so what i suggest you do could you drop me a personal message if you're on twitter so i'll put in my uh i'll put in my twitter handle so drop me a message on there and let's let's chat about that because i'm very interested to have a look at um a lot of stuff you've done around this so let me put this in and we can have a chat chat about that that'd be really interesting um bay ray okay right so let's have a quick look at what our data looks like the moment yeah sure um if you've got a link to a github repo or something like that what you've described please drop it in the chat and we can we can have a look at that thank you very much okay so we have got pro so we put in province at some point now put in uh country so let's have a look at that so let's pull some data so i'm just gonna borrow a query because i'm all about re reusing stuff my memory is not so great so if i figured it out one time i like to copy and paste it oops wrong window right let's have a look so let's bring back some rows so return row limits five yes recommendation engine would be amazing and we've kind of done a very basic one on great variety so let's let's build something a bit more substantial so we've done some recommendation queries but let's build like a recommendation app and we can do some fun stuff where you can pick your reviewer and whatever else we can have a look at what's happening in the background with regards to the query center absolutely turbo to burst that would be good fun okay so what i want to do is i want to bring back a bunch of the provinces the region so we've got region one region two we've got province we've got country so country is the easy one we know that stuff connects into country and this is when you discover that actually there's some regions that cross country boundaries let's not go into that i'm sure it's not going to happen here but okay so you've got a situation where some of these have got uh some got region one some have not got region one some province i think some of these didn't have provinces as well so let's do the first first thing let's see what kind of stuff we bring back so let's do a bit of a data analysis well data viewing it's not we're not we're kind of analyzing the data so let's do a little bit of that with siphon see what's going on so let's return distinct row dots province to begin with and see what kind of stuff comes back oh we can probably bring back country as well why not let's push the boat out yeah i tell you what i'm really looking forward to about the whole wine recommendation thing is it's one thing to do the grape but can we do recommendations based on taste so this is why i'm really keen to try and do some of the description words so if you really like things that like have you know smell of peach and nectarines and whatever else can we use that information to recommend why do you discover like new wineries that you'd never have thought of because it's based on the taste that'd be good fun okay so all by p and c and let's see what comes back so it's probably gonna take a little while because we have got some 140 000 rows so we're kind of telling it to put everything into memory and then like did it distinct and and then the sorting so although it wasn't too bad 13 seconds i mean that's fine i mean it'd have taken longer in excel to do this so we are forgiving if nothing else so did i sort by province and then country so maybe i should have sorted by country than province okay let me just rerun this so order by country then by province and it'll be a little bit i actually know just be long says to pull that stuff out but it's all good it's all fun not seeing much coming back about your favorite grape varieties so you know be a bit fun right okay so we have got armenia armenia okay so that's something we need to look out for so i'm just gonna going to take out a notepad so i can remember what we've looked at during this session so that i can write it up in the repo later so let me just take a note of this so we've got a situation where we have some uh provinces that equal the country so we'll do a queer in a second to see how prevalent that problem is we have got not just that but we have something like australian other and we probably that's not perhaps useful information to us so we need to figure out is south australia or western australia is this something we'd consider to be useful information so that's something we need to ask and figure out and what else have we got i i'm gonna have to figure out what these places are so i might have a bit of fun with that as well [Music] vienna okay so we've got actual places so what's interesting here about the provinces is and again this is where my um my geography's not so great but for example at vienna i know of vienna it's vienna's capital city of austria so is it a case that we've got a mix of cities plus actual land areas like i saw new south wales and that's obviously a big chunk of australia and that's not going to be the equivalent of vienna so it wasn't around that mustard that's a town in bosnia um [Music] oh you know what we should do as well be a bit of fun and we have to see is there some way we can pull in some data from openstreetmap or something like that so that we can pull the joe um the uh la long stuff so we can plot it out to a map that'll be fun chris just asked when did we start we started about um 10-ish minutes ago chris so you've not missed much uh and if you you know if you want to catch us from the start the video is going to be available on youtube later so you can catch up from the beginning so it's all good okay so we've got we've got a mix of things going on here so province is anything from country to region to an actual town so that's fine it'd be fun if we can map some of these and and putting some location stuff so maybe we can have a look at that that might be a fun one if we can find some api to pull that in okay so you got that from everything so what we've put we've pulled back 426 so we've got 426 different provinces in here and what would be interesting to know is do we have a situation well here we go we've got an example here where we've got this so do we treat these as the same i mean i'd have to have a look to see where they are in chile if they're you know if they're treated as the same region uh i'm not spot i mean i'm not being very scientific about this but i'm just having a quick peek to see do we have anything where the names are kind like maybe there's a there's a spelling difference or something like that and i've not spotted anything okay i think we're i i think we probably don't have too many of like the duplicates going on so i think we're okay with that yeah okay that's cool so let's have a quick look at how many of those the country so we've got what we're saying we've got a total of 426 different um provinces and just for entertainment failure let's see if it happens it probably doesn't but is there a situation where we've got provinces that have different um does it is the same name province in two different countries or more more than one different country so let's have a look and we'll check that out thank you very much for those links by the way barry i will check those out and have a look at them later so much appreciated and i'll just grab a copy that as well so i don't forget okay right so let's have a quick peek first how many countries and proven country and province where they're the same so let's do let's do that to begin with so let's do let's see where so i'm gonna do actually what i can do is i just steal this return line and just add the vehicles where p equals c and then we can do return count p doesn't matter it's going to be the s same maybe yes this let's see what happens oopsie daisy what have i missed oh yeah i see i just missed that number all right okay okay it's going to take a little while because we're telling it to go through the entire data set i'm very mean like that poor poor cypher is going what you want me to download this file again and go forwards yes i do because i'm lazy it's all good though 27 okay so 27 out of our 426 um have province equal to country so that's rough so bear in mind that's an exact match so you know we had like other australia then it's going to ignore that because they're not exactly the same strengths but there's things we can do to try and map those i've covered similar stuff before when we looked at uh removing duplicates from the wine grape varieties so i'm not going to cover it today so it's there we do have we have a a system for that um okay so that's cool so the other thing i wanted to have a look at do we have a situation where we've got province and provinces we have the same name province with different countries so just trying to think what that would look like if we probably do something like distinct um with province just trying to think how would we do this um probably something like we want to collect the we get province and then we collect the country so i might just have a couple of attempts at this so we're gonna do something like let's do something like this i think this will work i hope maybe i'll see what happens it may work it may not work but we love playing the query it's all good so let's look at that let's have a look at region one and region two because that's going to be the more interesting one cause we've got two of those and we've got province and this is going to come back to the age old question of which one's which and i think this is where we're going to find all sorts of interesting crisscrossing and whatever else going on so this may not necessarily be a solvable problem we may just end up throwing the towel and go you know we're just gonna stick with winery but let's see what happens so whilst that's loading let's get ourselves ready for the next query that we're going to run so i'm just going to close some of these or not that's the case maybe oh i've asked an evil query of it ah you know what's going to happen it's going to collect all the countries up so i'm just going to kill that query because otherwise it's probably not going to happen so let's do that this is going to discover i've knocked my database over it's all fine right okay so let's have a look at province so let's just remind us oh not don't want it in there i want it here so let's just remind ourselves of what it looked like so let's do turn row limits three just get the first three rows so we've got this region one region two so let's bring some of those back and see what they look like so let's start with um return row dot region underscore one and oh and let's return the country again like we did last time and same idea we're gonna order my country then by region and i just want to do the distinct and let's see what's going on there so let's have a look what that looks like and then we'll do the same with region two because no so some of them had region one and a region two some of them had no region i think so we'll have a quick peek as well what's going on with that bit of excitement okay what have we got oh my goodness [Laughter] one thousand seven hundred one thousand two hundred and seventy three different regions region ones and again straight away i've spotted look we've got argentina argentina so we've got the situation where the country is repeated in the region okay fine uh i mean it could be a bit more thorough we're just doing quick eyeball here see what's going on so all of these okay we've got some nulls so that's fine and the reason why it's coming back to us because it's going to do unique matching of country to region and so i've seen some of these have got no so some of these have got no no regions that's why it's coming back as that so that's cool that's not a problem nothing to worry about there favorite one shiraz and maroud i'm a rude i'm not sure i've had before i do like issues though oh hey very nice there you go look at ladakh so we know that's that's um australia and then we get an interesting one here as well so what do we want to do with things like adelaide hills and adelaide plains i mean do we want to treat those as the same thing i don't know that's that's we're gonna have to make some decisions about that aren't we but um okay that's what's going on again so the same situation going on here do we want to cast all of these as the same and we might decide that actually yeah we do and the really fun bit here is this one's really obvious and we kind of go yep whatever contains uh barossa this we want to link all of these together and say the same and like we can use country as a mechanism to help us ratify that but what happens if we've got the word valley appearing everywhere like this so that's going to be a bit fun but that's right i'm not going to worry about that one just yet okay let's have a look at region two okay all right let's let's see what happens same idea so remember we had two of those and then what we can do is we can pull pull together and see how many of those we've got region one region two so at the moment it's looking quite exciting because we can see we had city and a region under province we've got city and region coming under um region one i'm guessing the field i'm gonna have the same under two oh okay look at that okay so that's not too bad so we've got 61 records but look a lot of these are nulls so this one's probably going to be a little bit an easy one for us to fix let me just quickly rewrite that query so we skip the rows is not equal to blank so that's just going to get rid of all those nulls because we're not really worried about those we can we can handle those when we're importing the data so that's not an issue what have i done loads okay yep with ro there we go we matched mr magic with keyword okay let's see what comes back right so 17 records okay so not a huge amount to panic about with the region two so that's quite that's got quite a small footprint so these are unique ones by the way it's not saying we've only got 17 ones but the point here being is not too bad and we can probably do something about other do we want to get rid of things that say other is that useful information to us don't know so let's bring back province into this just to see what happens let's order region and then province and let's see what we get back oh there too many colors okay we oh look at this okay so remember peas province so yeah okay so this is quite small so it's still 17 so we've got a clean mapping between region and province so maybe for the purposes of region 2 we've got an idea of how we're going to change the data model and what we're going to do is we're going to attach it's going to be province 3 so country province region 2. i get the feeling is what we want to do because i think most at least when i say new york here i assume they're referring to new york state not new york city and in new york fine uh napa obviously very famous napa valley in california long island i assume now is referring to new york city but again long island is more granular than new york and okay that's cool so let's take a note of that so we can probably say that it's region two to province to country okay we've got winner there so let's have a quick look at region where there's region one as well so let's have a quick peek at what that looks like again we don't want to bring back we love looking a bit so where row region one is not equal to blank and let's say my dear bro bro.region one as r2 [Music] i would leave the ordering as is okay so let's have a quick peek at what this looks like oh my goodness what have i done again oh i keep doing that don't i oh let's get rid of this bit ah okay whoops ner as well let's have a look so give that a few moments to run again and let's bring up our good friend arrows whilst we wait oh no here we go okay so remember so r is region two r is confusingly i should have named something else r2 is region one then we've got p is province and then see his country so what have we got going on here so oh that's interesting so slightly confusingly we've got more detail for a lot of these in region one so [Music] some okay so some of these match fine and [Music] yeah so it looks like region one's more granular than that so let's see where we had that long island didn't we so what happens with long island north fork of long island the hamptons long islands okay so it looks like in this scenario where there is data for both region one and region two the ordering is region one region two province country okay that's fine so let's take a note of that we can incorporate that into our data model we'll have to figure out how we're going to do some cleanup of some of these where um well we don't always have region one region two so we'll have to figure out what we're going to do with that so maybe we make the executive decision to just not bother with region two because it's not telling us well i say it's not telling information it is telling us very useful information because look at this example here so california is a big place napa valley is a massive area for growing wine so we probably want that level of detail so let's figure out what we're going to do maybe we we may try and collapse this down so that's going to be an interesting hierarchy modeling question that we we will need to answer at some point but that's fine so last but not least let's have a look at as you no i think that's good we've got that so let's bring up arrows so one moment let me just get that ready uh i'm just cleaning arrows i was modeling some chest stuff previously oh we did the session ages ago we looked at fish's numbers that's what i was modeling and that was in the cache okay so let's go back to what we've got so so we had this thing and we weren't quite sure but actually what we're saying is it's wine so we probably want to put the winery to region actually thinking about this so would we say winery region one region two region three so let's quickly do that for a bit of fun so slightly tweak this again so one more so we're going to flip these around so we don't get confused let's do because we've said it's region one and then we said it's region two so let's bring winery into the equation as well so let's do rows of winery as w so ordering by [Music] by country by province by region and let's order by winery lost is that the right way around yeah let's let's actually let's do winery then region because then we'll see if we've got winery across different regions all right let's do that so this is going to be a bit slower i do apologize but that's fine it's about gonna be about 15-20 seconds i reckon that'll be worth it oh 12 seconds that was fast oh there look have we got here so we've got the same winery and the same winery is sitting across different regions so it looks like the same winery sits in the same region too but region one uh no guarantees so here we go 10 knots it's sitting in two different two different areas that's okay that's fine uh have you got more of those so that's there you go you got another one oh because we're doing distinct as well aren't we so yes this can choose so again we've got some of these coming across and it's the same winery so we cannot i don't think we can link winery so we can link winery to country perhaps but we can't link winery to region uh we maybe we can link it to province but even then do we know that happens so okay so let's just quickly have a look what's up sorry two planks look at this loads of different regions different regions different um pro no it's different region too so yeah so we can't make that assumption so let's have a quick peek at winery to country because i still think it's useful to do some kind of link or one or two winery to province and winery to country so let's see if those remain consistent i'm just going to take a copy of this query so we can remember what we were looking at in the recap and [Music] let's do winery province and country and let's order it by winery province country so we can see if that's true oh got question coming in cool thank you very much i will check that out um bailey that looks good okay so let's have a look well this is promising so we don't see any repeating almost almost okay so to country it's not repeating it's different got different regions i am kind of curious as well is this a data issue look how we've got sixty north and six north uh i wonder if that's a mistake we're not gonna worry about that but okay so we can see pretty much just again you're just quickly eyeballing we could have written the query slightly different to look for this the other thing as well to bear in mind is it could well be that you've got wineries with the same name which wouldn't be a surprise really so which which might be the other thing we're looking at so let's have a look how do we carve this so let's let's do winery to country let's just see whether let's see what's going on here and yeah let's look at that then what we're going to do so let's do this query and then we're going to do a count of all the different wineries we've got and if it's the same number as this then we know yeah why don't we need to we're going to eat the country and we're all good cool you're very welcome jay thank you for joining us on this stream so i appreciate we didn't have one last week for wine we did have this week in neo4j article review so i'm going to be doing one of those two whilst we've got nodes extended on so there'll always be something and we're going to have something at 3 p.m utc on a monday or 4 p.m on utc and i usually put tweet out to say which one i'm going to be covering and then we should be you know normal service should resume in the new year when we've got nodes extended done so but yes thank you for joining okay so what we've got five thousand and two so let's have a quick pick we had five thousand hundred okay so it's not too crazy so we haven't got that many wineries across different uh provinces so let's just do a quick count of how many wineries we've got and if it's small then i'm kind of okay to put a bit of not being 100 accurate with what we importing with the data oh distinct so i missed that's a bit interesting why have we got so many wires interesting let's do this distinct let's see what comes back with if we run a distinct oh how oh you know what this is sorry i made a bit of an assumption here so my assumption here is that all wineries are linked to a country and it could well be that we've got a lot of wineries that are not connected to a country which is why we're having that so if i do match winery has country i think that's what we said in our data model didn't we at winery from province province country so what may happen is that we've got some wines that are not part of country so let's let's have a quick peek at that let's see what's going on there so from province province and did we say province to country from country province country uh to see country and if i remember correctly we've got no province and no country so let's do where see uh name i think we used name was it value we'll have look in the second see that name is not equal to no country let's see how many of those come back oh okay that's puny that's like like none that's interesting huh well that's that's me confused ah i see what i've done look look so i've done it where region has got no name so let me just get rid of this this is probably going to be this is where we just yeah okay i forgot to remove the flags we had on region so that's probably why it's done that so let's see if the number that comes back is similar to this number here and then we can kind of go yeah we can just do winery straight to country so we have got oh yeah right i think what's happening here is so we've returned 16 961 and we've got 16 745 so what we're looking at we are looking at 216 different so i'm going to make the assumption here that the reason why we have that 216 difference between a unique wineries and wineries to country is because oh we yeah one of the countries is because uh some wineries some countries are just going to have the same name winery and i don't think that's that's unrealistic so you know there's only so many company names so i don't think it's crazy to think that people may have picked the same name and they're in different countries so let's use the assumption that it's winery to country or that you can have the same winery and it's a different you know it's pointing to different regions i don't feel brave enough to make the assumption that a winery is only attached to a specific province or region so let's do so i think we represent it here in the data model don't we so we say winery oh we're saying winery to province to country i don't let's quickly check to see if we can safely say that um i think we ran one that was a bit similar to this didn't we let's have a look yes this one didn't we let's see how many of these come back and then is it can we make a safe assumption about that so we are returning so what i'm doing here is i'm just checking to see how many wineries to province to country we have so if we have a similar around nearly 17 000 then i'm just going to go let's use the assumption that we can do winery to province to country if it comes back with like 20 000 then we can't then we're gonna have to change the data model and not make that assumption so last one of these before we start putting some data in i promise so what we've got to figure out whilst that's running what we've got to figure out now is let me just put another node let's anchor this so that we can work with our space and figure out where did it create my node is it here okay so i'm just what i'm gonna do is just no that's wrong oh yeah this is right i want to do this okay cool so what we've got here let's let's let's do that's a bit small okay so what we've got we have got winery have got region one we have got region two we have got province and we have got country so where we got so what we're trying to figure out is where do these different things sit so how do we connect all of these together so i think we can safely say there is zero argument that province belongs to country and and this so this is the highest the lowest level of granularity's country then the next slice level of granularity is province so i think i think we are not going to argue about this one at all i think we're all in violent agreement about this one cool so let's do i think we call this province country didn't we okay cool so that's tick happy we're we're happy with that model there that's fine now let's see what has returned okay oh no no he's brought back the 19 000 records and i think that's kind of saying i was kind of saying one of two things so we when we did the when we did thingy to to to country we're only 200 records now that's like uh just over 1 1.2 1.3 difference between the the wineries that we have and then the wineries that link to a country so i'm i'm just going to go yeah just assume why need a country that's fine the annoying thing here is that 20 of our records uh so we've increased the account by 20 is that fair nah about 78 is increased when we've done winery to province to country so that means that a winery can be belong to more than one province so i assume if you've got some of these really large wine producers they probably go across more than one so the only thing to bear in mind with this as well well here we go look this is this is fighting the question shall we um yeah so that's that's basically challenging that straight away so these are in different places and here you go you've got another one here this 1814 winery to different provinces so we can't use that assumption so what we're going to do so at the moment we're saying winery to province to country we're going to have to cancel that assumption so we're going to change this data model and what we're going to say here is winery to country so i actually from country from country country okay cool so that's a bit and the last bit we've got is is this awkward bit because we're now going to have a winery and [Music] we don't have that many actually how many regions do we have do we actually have let's let's quickly check that that's something we didn't have a look at so let's do return where row dot region 1 is not equal to null yes no absolutely right it has 17 unique values so what i'm keen to look at now is how many wines oops region two how many wines have got region two on them so we know we've got 17 unique values but how often do those values come up so that's what i'm going to have a quick peek a peek at now so let's do return count row why not as good as anything else so how many how many times do those 17 unique values repeat is what we're after and survey says oh my goodness okay so whilst we only have 17 unique values for region 2 it turns out that they repeat quite a few times so 46 769 of our wines have got a region two label wow okay so that repeats quite a lot so we do need to include that so let's have a quick let's repeat the same exercise with region one and we'll do the same for province as well and i shall take a copy of the query too so i can remember what we did okay that's nearly all of the wine so we've got about 120 000 wine so nearly all of the wines have got a region one um about just over a third of the wines have got region two and let's see how many have got provinces this is this is making it fun for us isn't it i tell you all right let's do province oh man field day this field day yeah look at that so pretty much for province that that's at least good so we know that pretty much every single wine has got province so that that makes our data model a bit easier so this is the fun bit now but we we now have to figure out so nice bit of uh group participation here so here's our dilemma we've got winery we've also got wine so let's let's not forget about wine i mean this this this is what this whole exercise is all about isn't it got wine and we know wines come from winery so that's easy so i don't think anyone's going to dispute this and i think that's what we've got in our model as well haven't we wine has wine from winery so yeah that's fine so our fun bit is what are we going to do so we kind of i think we've discovered that we have this flow don't we so country's the least granular then it goes to province then it goes to region two and then it finally finishes at region now we've got some interesting things to figure out here because not everything has got a region or a province so sorry region that's just true so what we've done in the past we've loaded data um is we've done like no region i've done no province or no province country no country that kind of thing so so we fill something out so we capture that it doesn't have that but we're gonna end up with like gaps aren't we oh questions come in jerry's asked what software am i using for drawing these graphs i am using arrows so let me pop a link into the chat and it's super super useful for um just drawing things up like i'm doing now and there's like we've got bunch of videos if you look at the neo4j uh youtube channel so that's youtube.com neo4j we've got various guides and things to get you started with arrows so it's super useful tool for sketching out these these ideas and thinking about what's going on so this is quite interesting because we have this problem where we've got this thing where we've got like what do we say so we said here we've got something like uh oh my goodness hundred thousand so you've also got a hundred thousand records for this and we've got like forty something thousand records for this and we've got like nearly 120 000 records for this but some of these are nulls but we want to build a chain so this is going to be an interesting one about how do we model this so this is why if i come back to here why we kind of did this previously and we have location description yes now this is true berry so i um said barry said that we can have location data from the description perhaps use that so definitely worth having a look at so what i would suggest for that is we probably need to clean up the region data so this is probably a nice activity we're not going to do it today but this is something we can look at so we can use the same principles we used when we were cleaning up the grape variety data and the description data and what we did was we tokenized the words and then we did you know similarity checking and phone x and that kind of thing and the reason why we're doing all of these steps is to try and build up some reference data so reference data is a type of data that doesn't tend to change very often so for example if you think about country codes those those don't tend to change very often and it's a finite list and so what we can do is we can try and create some reference data of like location keywords and then what we can do is using that we can then cross compare against the description and try and pull out so we can try and figure out these descriptions and then reuse that data to then sort of map the blank so i think that would be a fun exercise to try so let me take a note of that so i've captured it so this is something we can explore in a next episode because that kind of stuff's really fun just being able to fill up blanks and i'm going to plug my my notes 2020 talk as well so i did do a talk for nodes 2020 and it was called i had to do something with the wine dataset we've been having so much fun with it but it's called um oh my goodness i think he's like filling the wine blanks that's what i call it i called it filling the wine blanks and basically and i think we can use the same process um that's being suggested here you know that we use for finding that the wine blends but yeah filling the blanks with wine blends so we can use that similar process here as well i reckon so i think it'd be fun so let's try that so let's take a note of that but just just entertain i'm sorry i'm getting a little bit off peace now but let's quickly have a look at the descript the wines with a description that have uh no country and see if it's actually in the descriptions i like that that's a really nice idea oh what's going on here just trying to clear some frames i might have to restart the browser again i forgot can you have dynamic values tighter relationship that change based on object value just like what you would do when you change data in excel row oh that's an interesting question so if i understand you correctly mason are you saying that if you change something oh let me let me think this through so oh so you want to dynamically recalculate a bunch of things so i mean theoretically you could set up some triggers so maybe you've got some properties and then what you can do is you can have some triggers so if you look in uh apoc so google neo4j apoc triggers so yeah i've got triggers so you can probably set some rules for something to happen in the database when certain conditions are met so i suggest you have a look at those that may be what you are looking for okay so we were going to have a look at oh yes um wines wines that have no country but we want to look at the description to see if the country is in the description i love that i really really love that idea bailey let's have a look at that so we have got wine to description and then we're going doing wine winery province that okay cool let's do that so let's do match description and then it's going to be as description wine and then winery from winery one from winery oh i'm really excited to see what comes back i have to say oh i i i'm really really really keen to see what happens from province p province oh no not price province and then province to country no province country these that's the one we want i'm gonna say where cedar name is equal to no country so that's what we set uh for those of you who are watching for you know every episode of this epic battle what we did was we decided we wanted to capture the wines that didn't have a country name but we just put it in a node called no country so at least we can capture information and then let's have a look at the description oh no d dot value i think description is and let's bring back um province as well i think it's province name i could be wrong but let's see what happens oh that was quick ah right let's have a look so we have got 464 records where we do not have a country name and do any of these have a country mentioned in them nope oh look at that look look look look you're a guy there we go we found one so we can definitely do this so we can do the let's do the quick trick for the ones we can at least do this for country so switzerland all right so let's do the quick trick because we've got country data already and 464 records so we've got 464 records that have no country as a country so let's see how many countries we can identify oh this is exciting right let's do um this okay so let's do this work done country and d dot value contains c country dots name so let me just quickly tell you what's going in there yes i know switzerland's in there as well and uruguay so let me tell let me explain what's happening here so i'm using the same principle i used to try and figure out what the great varieties were in red blend which is really really cool nice little trick so first part of my query i'm treating my list of countries i'm just looking at the country nodes i don't care what they're connected to i'm treating that as my reference data and what i'm basically saying with my reference data you know and i quickly gave things up so reference data is a type of master data and what we do with and what we do reference data so reference data is the kind of thing you have in the drop down list so think about country codes is an example of reference data salutation so miss mr doctor sir is reference data it's a type of data that changes very very infrequently so it's super super slow updating you have a finite list of them so it's not like you continuously adding to the list you know it doesn't happen it's a finite list you probably see them in a drop down menu that kind of thing so here country is our reference data in our wine data set so what i'm doing here is i'm saying bring me back all of the notes all of my country notes so i'm just removing the one that's no country i mean probably didn't need to do that but that doesn't matter so bring me back all of the country notes and then that's that so i'm now putting that into memory so i'm going to keep hold put that to one side then what i'm saying is okay so now match me all of the wines that are from a country where the name the country is no country so we don't know what country it's from it was not in the original data set that we imported and then what i'm saying as well is i also want to bring back the description for that wine so this is what's been used and then what i'm going to do here is say now look in the description and bring back all of the out wide all of the descriptions where the description contains one of the country names we brought back in the previous part the query you know we would pull back the list of country notes that's what we're doing and then we're going to return the description and we don't need to pretend the province name and let's return uh the country name so we can see what country we've mapped so this is going to be fun so let's see we've got contains count now it's fine um no if what i'm doing here is i'm saying oh county well spotted wild spot yes it should be country not county nice spot there in denver okay so what i'm gonna do so this is gonna be fun now bearing in mind let's see how many weak countries we discover so we've got 464 records where we haven't identified there was no country specified when we loaded the data how many countries are we going to identify 32 look at that right let's have a quick look at what we found so there we go look we've got uruguay switzerland south africa chile chile chili chili oh look at that that's nice there we go looks again we've used existing data to help us figure out what the countries were that's brilliant we did this we did this for all of the red blends we had we've now done it for all the no countries cool little trick that isn't it so there we go look at that that is brilliant absolutely brilliant so let's flip that and let's have a look what we've got for the ones that don't have a country so let's do where oh no we want that so let's do the opposite so let's say let's say where it doesn't contain country names so and not d value contains country oh no that's not gonna work that is not going to work and the reason why it's not going to work is because there'll be other country names it doesn't contain so that's going to bring back everything again actually let's do this so we're gonna end up doing a bit of repetition here so i do apologize because i can't think off the top of my head i can't think of a quick way to do this so let's keep a copy of the wines i'm just going to rerun this query again i'm just going to say where it's not that oh one two where uh w is not equal to two okay let's do that and let's do return the value okay what could possibly go wrong that's very kind of you panko i'm that's very nice of you to say i hope you did find the video of modeling useful oh feel honored thank you thank you for joining me today so this is going to be a bit of a slow query but that's okay let's have a look what happens worst case scenario there's going to be a nicer way to write that query i'm just sort of going off the bet here but the point thing is we discovered 32 country names for 32 wines that we did not have country data for so that's pretty cool that's that's going well so uh let's whilst that's thinking about it let's have a look we had so we had oh look at this so here we go this is where we're gonna have a bit of fun right because we've got stuff like this swiss well we know that's switzerland but we don't have swiss as a country so whilst we can infer it by looking at the data um this is where we start have to start thinking about what else can we do to deal with those okay that's one so that's a quick pick what we've got so not all of these have got countries um mel nick i'm gonna have to look at what that grape is a bit later ah okay i'm sorry i'm not gonna lie i've just spotted a wine that tastes lemon cut i love lemon curd so i feel like i have to go discover that wine uh okay so it's interesting so we have a wine maker here as well so is it the case we have an option maybe we need to be looking at all of the data we have and keep crisscrossing it back so i'm going to take a copy of this and let's see if that appears in our wineries or any of the information that we have so i'm just going to take a quick note of that so we can have a quick peek yeah i know it is a really cool trick i love that trick it's so cool it's like it's so powerful and you're not loading in any new data you using using the existing data you already have this is data you already imported and use you're just using in a really clever way i love it such a cool thing um well thank you i'm glad you like the github stuff i appreciate that thank you another one here as well look greek what do we do about greek so yeah so this is where we're starting to hit the buffers a little bit and we probably need to like import new data to have things like swiss and greek and british maybe and that kind of thing so another wine maker so i'm gonna grab that name as well let's have a quick no i broke it that's all right just reload it it's all fine hey right okay so let's let's do that i'm i'm going to bring back the previous whoo let's let's have a look do we have any wine uh wineries that have that name that i i copied so let's have a look so let's do match w winery you know what i've we were supposed to be loading data about regions and we've completely gone off piste here haven't we that's right we're going to come back in a second to figuring out those regions but i i just need to now find out if you've got janis voyages uh as a winery in there because that might be another thing we can apply and try and figure out if we can uh fix some of the blanks that we have so let's do uh winery uh where dots i think we called it a winery name if it comes back as a blank we'll figure it out yeah i know exactly that by ray so if you have a look at what i did with the let me just quickly um nip over and show you so i can't remember was it week six week seven we did a bit work on that so let me i think it was weeks week six and week seven i think if i remember correctly is we did all of that good stuff so we fixed the years and cleaned the years out a little bit and then the other thing we did as well was all right week six yep so what you'll see here is we did a lot of stuff so there we go so we used uh we looked at levenstein sorenson we had a quick look as well yeah but what's really nice is yeah it's the same trick we can keep using so we can have a look as well what we can do for the other bits of the description so we keep coming back to description the description is a gold mine of useful things for us to uh recycle so definitely we need to come back to that and have a look so let's do when i where the name contains this or w dot name contains this oh are we going to get anything back i mean it probably won't but it was a fun experiment nevertheless survey set no look oh we brought back we brought back her so is this when we come back to the description so let's have a look what we got salt colors this uh description is pink right so let's have a look what we've got i've only got one description i know we've got two descriptions right so this is where we should have checked see where we got the description from no that one hasn't got in there um isn't there a like operator um oh i don't know i don't know i'll have to look into that i can't answer straight away so let me let me have a look so now we've got contains we've got um begins with ends with uh you can do wild card matches only if you use apoc you can help you the wild card matches you've got a number of tools but the really exciting thing here is i think we've discovered by complete accident uh probably something that was had the value of no winery and by complete fluke by pure inspiration by berry that maybe we've just discovered uh how we're gonna fix the the no winery one so let's quickly pull back that wine that had that description because this is rather exciting so um right says so let's just let's let's bring that back so let's do um match uh d description [Music] and we're gonna bring back the wine as well and let's bring back the winery to i'm i'm being really lazy for my query with not specifying a relationship type so please forgive me uh let's do so let's do where d dot value contains let's pull that name again and then we i promise we're going we're going back to the we're going back to the location dilemma but this is fun we've got to figure out what happens here i mean this is cool return d uh the description of value and let's return wind dot name i think we called it let's see what happens oh no okay so this this this brings back a whole this brings back a whole series of questions so this is a different person but the winery name's different so i'm now confused okay that was an interesting jaunt um but i guess the question here is is this a data issue and perhaps that they should be the same same winery so i assume these are let's let's have a look what country what have we got here so one variety or where's where's the country node i didn't bring back country did we do we bring back we did bring back province so we got different different provinces and we know that province brings countries so that's just double clay that was not what i was expecting to do there you go greece so i assume these are all going to come back to greece aren't they yeah oh no no okay that was oh is this a no let me make this a bit bigger because i'm like i'm sure you would like to see this as clearly as i would like to see this so that's interesting so i appreciate we've diverged a little bit off the path here so we have got grease we just expanded this region here where is that let's i'm gonna just uh i i'm intrigued now let's have a quick look oh that's the variety now we're not interested in variety we're interested in uh region oh that's confusing bear with me so that's the problem okay the province province country so these presumably if they're all these are all wines they should all come to there we expanded this one this expanded so we expanded the winery which brought back okay so so that's from that so i assume that all of these wineries are from the same i know we need to change that don't we right you know i'm going down a rabbit hole let's park this i think we need to to go to go back to the uh the mission at hand which was to solve this dilemma but that was a really fun diversion there i thought that was really really interesting about um how we can fit fix some of those countries so that'll be cool so let's look at that okay right when any node has a lot of fields it becomes very inconvenient to look at them from the bottom is there any plug-in to properties get displayed inside bob oh so what you can do i'm not going to do it now because i'm streaming off of browser and i don't have a certain plugin installed but have a look at bloom so what you can do with bloom is if you double click on the nodes it will produce like a sidebar and inside but it gives you all the properties for that node so that's super cool for that so we should probably do a bloom special looking at the wine data so you know what let's do that so i'm not around next week so we don't have a wine session next week but the week after if you're all up for it let's do a bloom uh bloom view of the wine data because we've got lots of interesting data now so maybe we can have a bit of fun with that so if that sounds sounds of interest then we can have a look at how we can easily look all the nodes and things maybe we can start coloring stuff and that kind of thing okay right how we have we solved this problem so you've got a couple of options we've got the hacky option which is kind of what i did uh let's go back to the day model we've got the hacky option which is kind of what i did originally where we've got this and i don't really want to do this because i think we lose a bit of fidelity in the data so i'm not crazy about doing that but what i i'm thinking so if you recall when we were loading the data if there was no province we just loaded a thing called no province if there was no country we just called it no country subsequently we can now identify 32 wines that don't have a country with a country and then we just got to figure out how we're going to do with like swiss and greek and that kind of thing um now we have oh i just thought something no i'm gonna hold that thought i'm going to behave myself we'll do it at the end um oh yeah we'll do blue we'll do blue so uh let's say 23rd of november let's play with bloom wine and bloom let's do it it's a date people are watching this recording will be wondering what's going on but yeah let's do it let's bloom two weeks time bloom and wine fantastic combination so we didn't know province we did no country we did no region so the only thing i think we've not imported we did not imported region just because we didn't know what to do with the region let me just double check this is a true statement uh let's do uh called skimmer because i've got a very short memory span yeah so we did not so we we never brought in region because we were just like don't know what to do region but i think we're gonna do flow so i think we just have no region one no region two and then what i suggest we do afterwards is we can then figure out if we can collapse region one and region two down and maybe we remodel it i think let's put that story in to begin with so that we we keep the fidelity of the data and then what we can do afterwards is we can remove things like australia other because maybe that's not really helpful to us we don't other other what of australia we don't know or other england because that's not helpful so we can get rid of all of that stuff and clean that up and then we can figure out if we you know based on all the cleaning up that we do and what can we then refactor the data so let's do that so i've got a question here so i wonder what is the thought reason we split our data data mostly nodes and not store data's properties and nodes right those are fantastic gen and this is very much dependent on what kinds of questions we are looking to answer so the kind of the rule of thumb is if you're going to keep asking lots of questions about region for example so if we're going to ask loads of questions like um what's the most popular region for a wine from a certain year what's the most popular region for shiraz what's the most popular region for you know taste tasters so which you know does a taster continuously do the same region then it makes sense to pull it out and just create it as a node because we're asking loads of questions about it and what you don't want to do is if you're asking a load of questions about something you don't want to be having to be sort of hunting around in the properties especially if it's something that's quite common so something like country is quite quite common obviously i'm not going to go into the sort of conversation about dents no so we'll park that for a different day and actually we kind of covered something about it sort of a few weeks ago when we were importing the ratings and price for wine but you kind of do that so you end up verifying your data model so verifying is when we're pulling out these properties and we do that because we're asking loads of questions about those so let me give you an example of what we did i don't know if we have it for do we have one finale so what we had and we've got a great example of where we did this so let me scroll down to some of the data that we have imported so i know bear with me i know this diagram's a little bit small so up until very recently although we didn't import the data we had you see here we've got the wine node and on the wine node we had like the id title of the wine description and the price and we very quickly went well actually we keep doing stuff with the description so it probably makes sense um well we pulled out description because we were processing description so that's why we turn that into a node because we then created description words much like we did with the variety we oh it's on here so right we ended up creating variety name because we were tokenizing it and we were doing stuff to find useful information so it kind of makes sense to do that and we can kind of see and follow the lineage of what we've done so you think if you cast your minds back to winery we had things like sort of winery to um variety we had things like cabernet sauvignon shiraz like that to our purposes those are the one the same but because of the ordering of the words so what we did was we tokenized the words we've done cleaning we've done similarity that kind of thing and what we're saying is we're also putting a relationship between that cleaned cleaned up word back to variety so that we know where did that come from we know what process we went through we know what the origin of it so that's quite useful for why we might do that as well and an example i'm pulling here for one is look we've got price on it so admittedly we never imported price but originally when we were modeling this we said well we put price on wine but if it comes back to we want to ask lots of questions about the price of the wine we did a bit of research and we discovered that we only had something like i think it was i can't remember my head but we were looking at like 200 300 wine different prices price points for one i think it was even less than that and you know well but we've got 1 000 120 000 different wines and that means that's 120 000 different properties on wine to hold the price and if we're asking lots of questions about price that means we have to look at the properties of 120 000 nodes to figure that out but if you've only got 200 different options that that that property can be and you're asking questions about it then it makes sense to pop it out and that's what we did with price and that's what we did with review so we've got another example where as well did i think this was later on um one year's another good example i mean you can't say it so one year you're only going to have about 30 different years for wine so if you're doing queries about what which year had the most wines you either have to look at 120 000 different wine notes to look at the property of the year or you just go well let's create a node with that year and that's significantly less lookups that you need to do so you can speed up your queries as well like that so yeah so you've got questions so you can build out many nodes first and then base your query you can reorganize smaller yeah yeah so i say it's always about when you're modeling you're when you're doing data modeling and this is true irrespective of what data system you're using a lot of that is going to be driven by what questions are you looking to answer so you're always going to do this thing and thinking well i'm asking questions about blah so unsurprisingly this is a wine data set many of the questions we ask are about the wine so why in the center of the universe if we look at the various data models that we've come up with inevitably even when we started with this this one here where we've got nowhere near as many nodes as we've got now so we've got more of a refined model so you can see here we've got what one two three four five six seven eight and we never put in region so actually we only ever had one two three four five six and now we've got about i think 12 13 different nodes uh no types no labels and you can see that the wine here is kind of the center of the universe look of all of these different you know spokes coming off of wine and it's central universe which is not surprised because a lot of the questions we ask are angled around wine what is the most popular wine variety what's the most popular year for a wine uh you know which countries have the most one you know all of our questions are leading by wine so that's going to be center of the universe but you're going to have some questions and based on those questions you're going to start talking about how different entities are interacting with each other but as you gain more knowledge as you dig a bit further you end up with new questions you you have more questions you want to dig into further into the original questions that you asked and then you can step back and go well okay so what do i need to do do i need to flex my data model again to work it now again you can still ask those questions but the queries are probably going to be a bit slower and again we're in no rush it doesn't matter if the query is a bit slower but a lot of the things that i'm doing i'm kind of doing it because i know it's going to speed up the queries so let me come back to uh let's come back to the reviews i think the reviews are a great example of this now what we have i now know this is really really small so bear with me so we've got here we've got a taster note so this is the person who tasted the wine and then they you know tasted a particular one here's a taster race wine wine so that was what we had originally and on this freights wine we had a property on the relationship which is the number of points that that taster gave you and that was you know seemed like a perfectly reasonable thing to put in and if you never do queries about what score a wine got that's fine once in a blue moon you look up to find out what score a wine gold that's fine don't worry about that but if we think about the data and what we know about the data we know we've got 120 000 bonds and wine is at the center of our universe in this data model so we know that there's going to be a hundred and twenty thousand relationships between wine and taster and that's 120 000 review scores on the property of that relationship so if we suddenly find ourselves asking loads of questions about uh which wines scored at least 96 and above uh what was the average score reviewers go for wines what's the best wine to buy based on a combination of price and score and all that stuff we keep asking we find ourselves asking lots of questions about why the score that wine got and then you go well hang on a minute let's let's look a bit further so we've said we've got 120 000 uh different 100 000 different scores that we have and then we little bit and then we think about it logically and go lying in a minute well the minimum score a wine can get is zero the maximum score of one can get is a hundred and then we have like well how many tasters do we actually have in our data set and when we looked at this we went well actually we've got 19 named tasters and then one taster with no name so this is where we didn't have a name for the taster so yeah we'll hang in a minute so worst case scenario we've got 20 different tasters 100 101 different scores that they can give one so that's going to be 20 times 101 so straight away we're looking at 2020. so 2020 different possible combinations of a reviewer to give a score to one and that's significantly less than 120 000 uh relationships to look at so straight away you're winning straight away you're winning if you're going to be asking lots of queries about what score wine got then it's it's a great thing to do to speed up your queries so the only thing you bear in mind there is a there is a downside to this and this is where you have to weigh up performance for usability is every time you do something like this you may make the data model less obvious if that makes sense so it's it's less intuitive to what you started off with and sometimes that's fine but sometimes you may go you know what i don't need this query to execute in i don't know 200 milliseconds you know what i'm perfectly happy to wait 5-10 seconds because i'm in no rush and for me it's more important to keep something that is more truthful to how i would you know how i see this you know in my head so it's it's it stops and balances it you you know you pick what's important to you uh for some situations performance is more important so you you optimize the data multiple performance for some situations you you may go you know what for me you know i want something that's true to to what i started with and that's fine so you pick what's the right thing for you again i've gone off on a tangent i do apologize but i hope that was useful it's a very interesting debate to have and there is no right answer it's what's right for you okay so let's have a look back to this dilemma which we're gonna solve and what i think i want to do is i'm thinking probably so we've we've answered this winery to country so we're feeling pretty confident that a winery can be in many different regions or many different uh provinces so the most sensible thing for us to do is do winery to country so at least like that we can ask questions about you know which country has the most wineries uh which winery produces the most wine etc etc so that feels like the most sensible thing to do so we're going to be changing our existing data model which i sure we got here so you can see we've got winery to province so when we update our data model and update the data itself we're going to chop that out and we're just going to do winery straight to country so that's fine this is the first time we've spent good quality time figuring out you know what exactly these things are we kind of shied away from we shied away from them in the past but now we are we're grasping that nettle and we're going to deal with it now the other thing to do we figure out is this and i think for now we we talked about this maybe the best thing to do it oh i've accidentally added a relationship to itself let's get rid of that cool and i think maybe the best thing for now what we're going to do is do this so let's oh well we're done no we don't do that so let's do this so i think we do this and i know it's not perfect but this is like stage one so we're not gonna do the queries today i think we'll follow those up on another day but we've talked about the principle and what we're trying to achieve and then uh either we can do it together in another stream or maybe i can do it ahead of time and then you've got the queries so we can figure that out there's all options are good but i think if we do something like this to begin with and then what we'll do is we'll do the obvious stuff so for example if province is the same as country then we're just going to maybe call it no province and if region's the same as country we'll call it no region and that kind of thing so we'll do this for now and then we'll figure out what's a you know try and do some data cleanup and maybe some of these just resolve straight away because maybe if we keep having province and region of both california for example then if we discover it's the odd city so if it's a only i don't know one percent of all of our wines actually have a proper region too then we we do a special rule and then we just create generic model for everything else so i think that feels like the most sensible thing for us to do in this scenario so let's do that and then we can figure out you know with various cleaning queries and then once we've got this in then we can do some cleaning and diagnostic stuff of what we've got so you know as you mentioned maybe we've got some regions in our description so maybe that's going to help us fill the gaps and that kind of thing so i like that i like us doing this gap feeling exercise as well so we can sort of clean up and fix some of the data so that's cool right that's been that's just been a fun session we we did meander across different parts but it was it was fun meandering there was a lot of interesting things we can explore there so i think we'll leave it there for now so if you've got any last questions so ask them now and i'll hover about uh we'll keep the stream going for a couple of minutes so if you've got any questions get them in now we'll answer those and then we will wrap up and then in two weeks time we're gonna have a bloom special so what have we got would it be useful to make a relationship between wine to country country as well uh great question i'm going to answer that question with it depends and it really depends on what questions we're looking to answer and what do we want to do about performance so if performance was super important and we asked loads of questions about wine to country then yeah it completely makes sense that we have that direct connection uh i'm being a little bit lazy and i'm trying to keep that providence of this kind of like hierarchy and actually this might be a fun one if we get the data in but this might be a formula to have a look at using the hierarchy function in bloom but i'm thinking here i quite like being able to do wine to region to province to country and we can always find out what country of wines come from by just traversing these nodes so we've not lost that information it just it's just a little bit more um query costly to find that out but i kind of feel that's a price that's acceptable to pay especially if we think about the relationships between these two so the risks that you run although is still we don't escape that risk but the risks that we run wind directly to countries you think of something like the us you've got california which is a massive wine producing region we're probably going to have a fair bit of density of wine to country if you think about again france you know they kick out a fair few bottles of wine as well themselves oh australia australia is a great example so they produced a huge amount of weight so we're going to have quite dense nodes between at wine to country whereas we're kind of splitting them out here so if we have if we ever kept our queries quite local so i want to know what's the most popular wine region i want to know what's the most popular ones at that so that kind of helps us slightly it doesn't get away from the problem if you want to do wine to country but we can still traverse through those nodes to find that so hopefully that makes sense so we're not we're not losing too much by having it like that but we still we get a bit more clarity as to the providence of the wines and that kind of thing which is why it was so painful to try and figure out uh what order these go in and the fact that we've got replication but that's okay we're going to have great fun cleaning that data and and it's going to be very informational but that's not the word i was looking for it'd be very informative as well that's the word i was looking for but yeah be brilliant so okay thank you very much for joining me today i know this was a bit longer than usual but it was good fun if you come up with any more questions or either waiting for two weeks time when we have next session or uh send them to me you know on twitter so you can tweet me at ella's al you've got the the repo address let me just post that again so if there's anything in particular you want me to try out then raise it raise an issue on there and raise an issue on there and then we can look through those that's one way to capture that information so you've got a couple of options there so i don't know other than that i hope you have a fabulous rest of your day uh don't forget for those of you who are about we do have our second episode of the nodes 2020 extended tomorrow so that's going to be great fun we're going to be looking at some talks around um finding limp prediction in chemicals we're going to be looking at business data from brazilian companies so do come along so that's at 2 pm utc tomorrow i'm going to be joined by nathan smith so that's be great fun and let me i'm sorry i've got we have a yes we do have older recordings so if you go onto youtube.com neo4j i if you look at twitch they've got we've got a playlist called twitch catch up i think it's in there and oh definitely it's in the online meetup um playlist as well so have a look at that so let me let me dig out the two seconds let me find the link for that so bear with me one moment and i will get you the link from last week that was a really good session it could be really concession tomorrow i'm really excited we've got some like super cool content these are great great talks uh um one moment i will get you the link for that and oh my goodness i found it i found it it's all good okay so here is here is the link from last week yeah so i about say something but mention that stuck on chapter 12 yet so i need to update some stuff if you're stuck in chapter 12 um just pop it in can you raise it in as a github issue or something like that might be probably the best way and i can pick up because maybe i've done something wrong and i need to update something so if you can pop it in as as an issue then i can pick it up so i think if you go to let me go up to the top and then like that yeah so i can pick it up because i i could i could have well have made a mistake first so just pop in so that's what some people have done in the past if i've done something like something that doesn't load or query doesn't run or it froze an error pop it in there i can pick it up and if i need to make a correction i can do that there as well brilliant thank you very much hello thank you for joining me hopefully some of you will be able to join me tomorrow at 2 p.m utc for our next episode of nodes 2020 extended otherwise have a great day and i will see you in a couple of weeks to continue our wine adventure which we'll be doing in bloom have a lovely
