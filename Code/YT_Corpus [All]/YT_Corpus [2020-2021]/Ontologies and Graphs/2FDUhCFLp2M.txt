 hey neo4j fans out there thanks for joining us for the neo4j online Meetup we are trying something a little new today we're we're using a software called crowdcast to do the live streaming which means the chats will not be live on the youtube they're going to be live on crowdcast if you are watching on the youtube live and you want to join the live chat room in the description for the meetup you will see the link for the crowdcast also in the description for for the in the youtube description you will also find a link for the neo4j community site for the presentations thread so any links that we're going to be talking about throughout this presentation will be sharing slides there afterwards or if you have questions for the presenter about the project after the live stream is over that you want to ask via about you can go right to the community site to ask for that and that is also in the description for the youtube and before we get started don't forget to join us next week where we have blower holding data and visualization using graphics are it's going to be fun and then also if you haven't yet registered for it we're going to be doing an awesome event it's the neo4j online developer expo and summit nodes 2019 happening in october so it's going to be a bunch of like really awesome technical talks and we're gonna have a couple different tracks too so it's pretty interesting so if you haven't registered for tea yet you can we will also include the link for it here in the chat room we have a code for the acronym we did have to work hard for the acronym it started as neo4j online developer summit they're like it's so close to being nodes we just need an eat in there somewhere and then we tried to be like ok neo4j online developer what else what do we come up with I don't even remember but they really made any time to find any I would say we should have called it like a summit like electronic summit like email whatever was like that is Alder [Music] so to get us started I'm gonna choose my colleague Mark Needham who is developer relations engineer for neo4j COO hello everybody I and he also is the co-author for the graph algorithms book which you haven't if you haven't gotten yet you can get it for free on our site and also our very special guest speaker yeah I'm going to let you introduce yourself yeah hi it's really weird not to see anyone here but to know that um yeah ma'am I work at as a scientist in Olympic Channel and I've been working with graphs well they're equally since I was in the university but now with databases which is really much faster than what I did so um yeah that that's mostly we can we can if you have any questions about what I do or whatever you have the community strengths in the description yeah sure so she runs our ladies meet at home yeah oh yeah that's a big thing a big major beat out for Women in Technology yeah yeah and I guess as Michael Mackenzie points out in the chat Women's World Cup started today so we've got just the just the right meet up so there's gonna be showing us how to analyze football data always my favorite topic using graphs and it's like three beautiful things all in the only one and David says you are an acid data known as more questions ask me later tell you about yourself I am an acetate they turn out and I'm yet to say that first I studied with nail because of David who's here right now and he's whose chief knowledge architect at NASA and he said with a little project and I just followed and I did them this model thanks to the two marks post about the World Cup and I could do the model about that because he was a little different from a table to graphics a little bit different to me so my son but yeah and then she also spoke a craft or and yeah she's the do a lot with our community she's been very active mark you inspired her how does that feel there's I'm sharing people the world cup graph in case they've not seen that this is the Men's World Cup I guess from last year awesome okay cool so I think we can get started now be if you'd like to I know anybody has questions feel free to ask on the chat if it's right to do so mark world politely interrupt via and ask her the questions you guys have but like I said you can also chat on my thread - so it's like a spare you can share you share the screen you hover over if you have a rear window ding and okay if you like her presentation please give her a thumbs up on YouTube hey yeah make sure other people find it - in the future she's like oh yeah we have to do that to hover over your window you should be able to okay you can see my screen map oh yes here we go okay perfect there we go so I have the presentation which I hope to follow but I also have that code open I'm whatever so I will be switching back and forth so we are not same only the slights clan some let's see this okay so yeah this is me we already talked about that and what would it what it was these two analysis one which was home advantage and the other one was competitiveness we will be talking about the definitions and so don't worry you will get them all and I did this [Music] someone set out so maybe the data it's an updated but you can you can if you find new data you can just follow this model or followed a description just do it with with your own data and yeah so let's do this I don't know I I don't expect many people to be new about me or 48 but just in case I just have a little bit of explanation so yeah I did this and then you forget what it is what what it does is you have a table a data table and then you go and get a graph so here we can see the actual data of my my football data and you can see I don't know maybe it's not very clear well you can see you later when I share that the the slides here every bar is um it's a team from the Premier League and we have converted that in a in a graph so every yellow ball or note better is um is much and then you have the home team and avoid team and then you have the link which belongs to because in my database I have Felix I will see it a little bit and then well you can see here you have a oh sorry a team match with the with the date and then you have a whatever it belongs to okay so the thing is that you have a new syntax for this kind of stuff because it's not table data so you need something that recognize patterns which is cipher in this case and and the thing is that it's really simple to use at least at first you can do very much complicated things in here but for getting a person that is named Tom Hanks and he said they acted in name something he he said that like as a as forest in a movie so anyone anyone this person I want return P which is the person I have it here can you see my my mouse because I'm you I don't think we see your mouse oh yes yes because your mouse okay okay so you have fear P which is the one you're asking for and you one p one but you can return up the whole chain and whatever you want really so a very good and very working people did this better version of a new driver for our and it is on crime so you can download it from can or you can download the last version from github and what I did to test it because I was put into the developer and some of us were testing it and it has some yeah yeah it needs some work but um but it works like really smoothly and you can have your data collection are really really fast and I did this with an old Mac from 2015 and it worked it worked much better than with my new mic which is potato which something we say in Spanish yes it's really really a big a little bit preppy but yeah so but so I had to limit some some of the stuff some of the queries but you will see the same thing and it's really really fast really so the main thing to do in this driver you can connect to the database database of course and you can query of course otherwise where are you going to do and also when you when you query the the neo4j database you have you will have a JSON response so in in our casings are not really welcome but the young man's instruction will UNMISS your data and get your data in a table which is really really useful so and you can also use a I grab for the GD prop or whatever graph or library you want to use for making this graphs in a in a our graph or in to visualize them I used this crap and it's really easy to do just get the data transform it a little bit and you can just use a library whichever is your favorite and just visualize it so the data better than to see it here we can see the database and how do I get out of here okay okay I have my database here I think we can yes okay you see I have countries games leagues and teams ideas I have three country not two countries and three leagues because after doing this analysis I added the woman's Lake in the UK or I don't know if this you the UK or England but yeah I don't really know the difference there but but this is that the English lake for them for women and it should be working the same as the other ones because it's the same mesh structure I mean you have here your league and then you have every match and with that they eat and sorry and the home score and whatever to two teams played in that date mmm I did this name because it was easier for me to just later get the data but it's really not necessary because you have everything connected so really not that necessary but I needed the season and and I think it has mmm can I see this here mmm sorry your oh sorry um this is games right okay you have the home score and the OS score and the season and the date so that's mostly what it is this is every every much and then you have the teams of course which are linked to every match and then you have I because I add a two countries I had to add the country to every league so yeah let's see okay let's see here's something well I have the relationships here it's really easy they do a team and the home team from for a match and then in league is four matches for why is that much prom and then what is the leaks delete from from which country easily sorry so let's see this much country its what do you do this okay so yeah let's do some of this see sorry I love that you're doing live code it is very bold I hope it works the demo dealings that come out yeah this should returns ten countries which I only have two of course and same thing we can do with teams which I have more so yeah yeah and sorry about this um and yeah you can see this this is all stuff because until you are you're after this I added another another league which was the Women's League and but yeah yes you get a little bit of perspective whoa let's worry this um team much town see this is this is right right no sorry okay market market here to help you lose everything thank you Mark yeah so yeah I guess I thought you were here yes it's so we're dude I can see you you got extra ass on your teams yeah I have one you don't need the S on teams oh yeah true Wow now a bassoon is counting how many teens they've got a hundred hundred and ten teams yeah I have 100 teams with the new league and before I had 99 which was only the Premier and La Liga the primaries English league and La Liga is Spanish like for men - mm yeah oh sorry this is how many games which now will be more about yeah okay okay so about home advantage this is something that we always say that if you have more chances to to win at home when you when you play at home but we can see that in the data - and it is more like a state of mind because it's not like you play better or anything but you can see here in the in the in this fan image that mmm these on all varsa fans and then you have the elliptical Madrid fans which are really far and I don't think the players will see them and yeah so let's call this series and for mission that I what I did is like I I counted them winning their winnings at home and away which are always a celebration of course because you want to win which is a mango football and when you lose weight I I didn't count losing away because it's just well you look you have lost but in it can happen it's not that tragedy I don't know if you watch hope so I mean imagine so bad it's always a tragedy when you lose it's always a tragedy but winglet fans the England fans are used to that tragedy when you lose aways less of a tragedy they kind of what I could expect that but when you look at home is really really bad like nobody wants to lose at home with your fans there and your parents I'm sure they are there yeah and so we were able to do this analysis because in your model you've captured in the in the game which team is at home and which team is away right of course yes and we can see this I don't have the actual art studio open but just so you see what it is in there in the data you can see it here is very well marked it's called home advantage and you can see I get the team's which home score is greater than our score I didn't come for the for the how do you say that when when to when two teams has the same they have this our oh yeah I met the Americans the Italian and the British say drool yeah language for that because it didn't make any mostly any difference and also you you want to see this the three points in your league so you want to win not to time to retire or to Talia so I look for the winners at home and I look for the winners away and I compare with the whole arm with all the winnings and we can see here their salts which are here which is really interesting because I didn't do any statistical test but you can all you can actually yeah you can see it in the in the plot I mean whoa so wait sorry I'm gonna have to explain how do we read this how do we read this chart I'm the part of the equites on the axis measuring so the the x-axis is measuring the difference between winning and how many how many wins you have and how many wins at home you have so for example well these are really really small teams they are only in first and no first class or whatever it's called just for a few just were a few matza so don't count on them but here in the orange one you can see Barcelona and Latika Mary and Ramadi which are one of the strongest and you can see they win 0 0 point point and more times at home that they do away so that little lot like the line kind of the well if you win the same times at home that the same times away then you'd be 0 yeah then you'll be a 0 oh there's two teams that are better away yeah ok oh yeah there but yeah they are really like you should count or discounted teams there are always in the main league this lady Dan Cordova they are really small and they had the chance to to play with the with the with big teams just like a couple of moments and then they went down again so so this kind of cleaning should be have done before yeah so Mike Mike French asks is the way that we interpret this they have about eleven percent chance more of winning at home is that how you read it um yeah yeah you could really like that it's not a really a statistical test how the chance is not it's what yeah it's really small but yeah you have like 5% more here if you are in the 0.05 and here you have 10% more chances and yes I'm wondering about the people who are more likely to lose is playing at home really small teams yes yes I said you I should have to have done some cleaning before doing this next time yeah but but the main thing is that we can see here that the big teams which are here again the this whoo this here they win more times at home at home that way and in the Premier League it happens the same thing which you have here a really small team will we could call it an outlier but it is really not but but it is because you only played like two or three times in in the premier and then it just went down again you know and here you have Arsenal and Liverpool which are the biggest and the Manchester United here and you can see they win more at home than outside yeah even without the analytical test to see if this relevant or or whatever it is in the data you can see directly just looking at wins at home and away Adam Callie said that in the books acronym X it says that the home team advantage doesn't significantly affect the players performance but it affects the referees because they become more biased towards the home team that's that's us only and this really really a possibility because that's gonna be Adams next project to look at the gold per thousand gainst could be a good match yeah and also they feel so pressure because there are so many people from the home team there that they are really pressure to just favor one team or another you know same thing happens in the in the World Cup but it's much more difficult because everyone is is a four-inch so yeah okay we can use it is there any other question I can move on to the no I've just got people agreeing that Adams doing a meet up you know we do the one thing at school about this new software that we're using the crowdcast is that you're actually able to bring other people onto the screen to ask questions so if you want to ask questions to be a face to face you could do that too we can bring you into the oceanography at the end that's just really cool yeah yeah of course I didn't get on the analysis and then we can bring you in okay do it right now before I study on uh there I know they're made up yeah and so yeah this is a really cool image that we you can see how the pressure feels when they this is a German team I don't know who played I don't really remember but they are watching them so yeah that is really creepy and awesome at the same time um and we are gonna measure competitiveness and which is and I think I found actually found this in some cool blog I have the references somewhere I will share them too and it was a really interesting metric because what you do here is that you measure if there are many teams are really really strong or if they're the the all the teams are really balanced and you can see that the competition here I have two tables they are from different years but you can see here that Barcelona got almost all the same almost all the all the points you can get from our league so you get three points if you win you get one point if you draw and you get your points if you lose so there are 38 matches every league Alice in La Liga and so you say it's 38 times 3 so you can get maximum 140 points Barcelona oh sorry Barcelona and Real Madrid and two different lists got 100 which they which means they won't almost all the all the matches so that's not really a competition right when you have one one really big or a strong team and they start to win to win all and you don't have a competition so I think I wrote I about the about this in in another soccer book I don't really remember the name but I have it over here I can share this later and he said he said about them he was talking about the money that they had that they strong teams had and how that doesn't mean that they have strong team strong teams just because they are a strong team they have more money but not vice versa you know them because they have more money they are a strong team so it's not really correlated but yeah here in two different leagues that you were really really big so what if it was two teams are connected if sorry if they in one much they one of them wins or they sad row oh sorry if one if one if one round one wins and the other one there is a draw the other round the there is a draw and if the in the two rounds there's two draws or vice versa the of the first point the other team wins the first round and there is a draw in the in the second round so basically you have am basically every team is connected except if one team have a one boss runs yeah that's true and so when you have a more connected graph which we are doing is we are moving from one scheme to another one and we are doing basically we are doing another way another graph but with difference connect with different connections so if you have a more connected graph then you have more competition and you have more uncertainty of what is going to happen and if there's less connections then it means that at least one or two or three teams they are really really strong and you know they are going to be in the first positions so if we look at this league we can see the the strongest teams and you can see here Real Madrid and Barcelona La Liga and which is so much predictable right and but it's also interesting to see the Las Palmas and Barcelona is connected because that means that they all they got points for from the round and round they both got points and same thing with a ver but of course you are with Valencia you can see two connections because well I did this with this graph and because it has a different ID they it draws both connections but it's really just one say oops sorry same thing in the Premier League but which with less teams and it makes sense right there you have Liverpool and Manchester City and yeah and it is nice to see if the competition is going up or going down over the years and it looks like that the number of connection is going down so there is less competitiveness over the years so they are like a few teams really really strong and and yes the other ones had just scrapping for whatever is left and that's that's not really really interesting because you don't have intensity in certain matches right and yeah so more team more team wins more teams win both games have more team lose both games that what that's what it means that it has less connections over the years and oh before this I can show you this in the code sorry about this I don't know how to get out of here okay you can see this in the code which is here and I did this directly in our with the player but I can show you some of the new for our methods which are really cool because you can integrate in with with the player and here we have the I got all their all the all the games all the matches and I just called the connections I just called the query for from the database and basically I just put in another data frame and just change the change the well did three three separate columns which is really cool that is really well integrated with the prior and with data frames because you can i maybe you cannot query all because you maybe have a really big the database but you can do little queries and just get your data friends and do whatever you need to do and just push your results to to new for neo4j again so yeah you can see it here I did the connections here you can try this well I will talk about it now and here you can see just with two different transformation I just did the Beast this network which is what you see here here this is a business work it's really easy to use and it's really not that different from from what you are used to so yeah what I was going to tell you is that there is a docker working I have the link in my name in the repository and you can download directly the script and the data and import the data and you have your new floor yay in a doctor and a docker whatever it's called and and you already have the ER and the package and you can start working with this I don't think it has the last term I don't remember but I don't think it it has the woman's leak because I added that later but you have the file in the in the repository so you can also import this in your neo4j did a clip on from the package which is really cool and yeah and that is all and if there is any friendship people here congratulations for winning the hook up and good luck to USA which is the favorite for the woman's book yeah look happy awesome does anybody have any questions that is not afraid can't come on a video live so we could turn on the podcast yeah anybody's I will stop my my my scream but if you want to if you want me to show you something I can just show you again I don't know how to we lost her we're going back let's bring her back must have accidentally left she did she's like bye guys she's going back but I never wanted questions I wasn't if you could do that in a real life somebody dropped the bike yeah anybody does anybody bold enough to join us in the live stream video and ask me a question somebody asked if you can reach reshare the doctor called yeah and we shared the mark shared B as github for the prize - yeah soon as you can find the darkest stuff on there yeah yeah I guess I guess an interesting thing would be if somebody wanted to pick this up and like what would what would you say is the next thing that somebody if they were like oh cool I want to continue with also like the next thing you were thinking I am really interested in seeing if the same thing happens to the woman because people said that women don't know how to play football but I think is there is more uncertainty in the in the in the women's league that in the men's league which is more interesting because you don't know who is going to win right and so yeah you can do it you can do that with the new data and also it would be really cool which I haven't done that but I'm I'm planning on it to submit some issues to there so people can can still develop the the driver asked in this particular case study what could you do with the graph database that you that could not be done in a relational database um well I think everything can be done from one another point of view but the the thing is where it is easier or faster or more appropriate we do from so in this case if you're looking for relationships and that thing to do is to use relational date I mean I think a database that can measure relations and you can do it you can even do it with the CSV or the Excel at home that's not really that's not a problem but here he said the the the databases prepare to do this kind of stuff and I did that in in are but you can do it directly in database so yeah and I guess if you if you started to add in like other things connected today to the original data so like if you started like bringing in the different stadiums or the locations where the teams are or if you wanted to actually capture more details about each of the matches then it starts to become hmm just check it out because when I added the the last data file it has a lot of more information had the STD name and the referee but it didn't match with my with my current schema so I just didn't add it but it has a lot more much more information and if you want the hours or if you wonder if there was more minutes or their relationship has much much better to work with because otherwise you will have a table with a lot of blanks and with a lot of Naas which nobody likes and yeah and I don't ask the question Adam do you want to come on you and ask convene is desperate for someone right I'm one of them just did that we try this because it's a new software and this is our first time using it so we have Elena and Adam ask questions and I want to see do you guys do you guys want to ask it live we can bring you on to the video to ask it why you want to should I just like Adam - I mean I guess if they're with the referees then Adam is able to do is referee home bias analysis see which referees in the most yeah most likely that actually would be really cool in all caps and in and the Champions League and because the referees have really biased really really biased more much more than in leagues and so that would be really cool just to confirm this to me because hey we've even got people plus warning for you to come on the screen and also so element really quick as Ellen I can't actually join the video but she said how impact the data quality in your experiment experiment in the network's my data was actually really really clean the only thing that I didn't account for was what I told you about this kind of but teams that go up and down how do you said in English when you you have to either get relegated improvises sorry teams get relegated and promoted between the league's yeah that's the thing and I didn't come for that because that was kind of messy too you have to count the mattress they they play and whoever they play with and yeah that's really a little big of more analysis and klee and data clean to do I think what I was trying to to say what's really clear without clean and data Adam have you completed your analysis on the referee bias not yet no they say we'd be really interesting to look at the stats and to see that like the the number of files for and against and how many goals are scored oh well I have given a certain area so I remember reading an ages go about and like Fergie phone with my chest unites and italics Ferguson would sort of berate the referees and so he got like five six seven minutes of stoppage time and they'd always get a penalty in that time and so be interesting to see that but I guess my main question is is there anything else in in our that you think would be useful for analyzing the data well I used here I use the driver for neo4j and which is near for art and I use well I like to use tidy where's when they when the data is not that big which is this case and you know in this case in this particular case because I was using a graphs I use this graph which is them a thing is the the easiest package to visualize graphs okay cool so I jump off say where it's a joke enjoy yeah wait to see your analysis when you're when you're ready to present it alright let's see you know we're gonna add they're gonna be scared to join this in the future has except that they don't want to it's like welcome you know a big brother live do you have any questions nor anybody else is it just Jerry just Joe Ellen asked the question but I already asked her oh is any up for volunteering at them so we can I can jairs question Foreman okay so Joe was asking have you have you any plans for adding time dimension like time stamps or time trees to the to the matches or today yeah yeah I would love to it's not that they didn't use more variables is because I couldn't find for all the data either the same variables so I wanted to you still find us something that I could use for all the leads but I would love to to do some players analysis when they move from one team to another I think is really interesting and also the the manager school manager right the one that is yeah and it's just called the Ola we've got a we got a real Madrid fan in our office he's not a big fan of Kona so yeah I would love to do that because I think just looking at the news you can see that you're changing players or whatever they do better or they do worse and I would really love to add that until you said um about the time I think the most interesting thing is that that time added at the end which is kind of what kind of tell you how the place how didn't they the game is going which is not always how great sign and you can you can use I think you can get some stuff from there but as I tell you if you get the data you're sure it I think we need to make a Women's World Cup growth now that's like yeah yeah I've got to do it get a good idea before the tournament finishes they're gonna get on it yeah the thing is that I don't know where to get this kind of stuff and maybe if you follow that they're much as you can do it yourself but otherwise it's not that easy at least for for more complicated stuff like players or something like that and also before I forget if you want to play with the driver there is the movie example done here you have it and it's the same example that it is in the new four years examples and it is not in our so yeah if you want to just play with the driver Adam said he found that Sky Sports website is the best resource for scraping data and then Mike French volunteered Michael McKenzie saying that he might know that's really good I mean it's creepiness always have pain and if someone does hit yeah nice for the for the Men's World Cup last year I was watching the network tab of the FIFA website and you could see where the API of where they were getting sailed from was so we can find that and that's even even quicker okay cool I don't run we've run out of people to bully into coming on today but thanks you guys thanks for joining everyone via thank you so much for I think you doing and having to deal with the rescheduling of this problem that was really this was really fun and I'm sorry for leaving before I yes if you're on the view in Europe or I guess more east have a good weekend and for Kareem and everybody else in America have a good and don't forget to like the video on YouTube so that other people can can find it off the top of that link in there and you can also contact via directly yeah on the community site thread and if people watching after the livestream ends and have an idea of where she could scrape data from that make it easy you know go and let her know that in their thesis right there I will put up the link and then book how I talked about before which is interesting too yeah so okay thank you everyone and we were saying great job everyone saying they loved it you got a lot of thumbs up and thank you I will have a nice week and then I'll have a nice Friday bye
