 sent here good morning good afternoon good evening depending away or in their world I'm happy to be able to talk to you a little bit about a knowledge graph that I have put together over the last few years actually from scratch and what I actually meant with that is that I didn't have the luxury to go out and download theta from some other source and represented in the graph a lot of the data that you'll see is actually mostly manually entered as well as same automatically entered into into the database and I'm not a really a full-blown developer which means I don't write code on the daily basis as my job but I do write scripts to automate certain things and that has also be done in my example here so a little bit about myself I grew up in Austria and initially started to study molecular microbiology then switched over to molecular biology decided to get my PhD in Switzerland and then had an opportunity to move to California to do some postdoc time and during that time I decided I wanted to kind of combine biology with computer technology and particular databases and that ended up blending a job in information technology and I've spent the last 25 or so years in that field in particular in the biotechnology space where I got to learn a lot about drug discovery and the data that is involved in there I'm really excited about interactive visualizations worked a lot with the traditional BI tools and love to see data that can be interacted with that are not just static charge that you see on the screen but you can actually see what's behind the charge and for fun and I like to drive fast cars and but the color of rally cars if I have the opportunity to do that so how did I get in to neo4j it really started with my interest in cancer research oncology and but the color because I had a brush with cancer myself which fortunately turned out to be not serious but I also have friends that are affected by it and I've also seen idols and the business being affected by cancer it's a very non discriminating disease and it basically can affect anybody at any point in time and to have been good improvements in treatment of cancer over the years but there's still a lot of work to be done so I wanted to learn more about the space the domain that is involved in cancer research the companies what are they working on what kind of types of cancer they're working on what kind of molecules they're developing and so I thought okay as I learned about this how do I captured his knowledge because I can't keep everything in my head I need some kind of database to do that and initially relational database came into the mix and I thought well as we've seen from other presentations usually you start off with a schema that is very fixed so you have to know everything up front and then you populate the database so it's not very flexible so I was looking for something more flexible and so I I came across the idea of node relationship node or subject assertion object and I was really excited about this idea and I thought okay this is the way I want to implement a database to capture this knowledge about cancer drug discovery so I found this slide actually on a presentation from Alessandro Negri from grandpa where and I thought this actually captures very nicely how one could capture knowledge in a graph you start off with the data that's just out there these are the things that we care about in a particular domain and then we start labeling it to give it some information the next step would be to say well if I have these individual things how are they connected with each other and how can I represent this how can i define the way they're connected with each other and that leads you to kind of knowledge in a knowledge graph and ideally that leads you to additional insight and then last but not least wisdom we can debate about the wisdom but definitely you can get the insights through this connected data landscape so the initial idea that I had and I represented this in the graph just a few years back labeled competitive intelligence and kin discovery was that in this face we have lots of different companies small companies startups medium-sized and very large companies the pharma Giants and all of these they're working on what's called therapeutic molecules these are the drugs that they're marketing in the end when they are approved to treat a particular disease these therapeutic molecules interact typically with a molecular target this molecular target is a protein inside your body that has a critical role in the disease process and the case that I'm interested in here is in driving cancer and you want to influence that with the therapeutic molecule with the drug in a way that obviously benefits the patient either stops the cancer or eliminates it altogether so I thought well there must be some network in this and when you look at the bottom right I kind of show you the the basic network that exists there where you have a company that builds it a molecule or designs a molecule that acts on a molecular target but then there are other companies that work on a different molecule but they act on the same target so you can create then sort of a network of companies that work on the same molecular target and treat the same disease or sometimes also different diseases so it's a start of a network but it's by no means the end of it when I'll start to look into the whole drug discovery process that's outlined in these different boxes here there are very many things involved in bringing a drug to the market and so the initial idea that I had was really at the very beginning here where I said okay target a molecule then we obviously have to have a disease the molecules go through some steps along the way to optimize and identify a single molecule that will be pushed through this drug discovery process that is then safe for entering clinical trials and then the clinical trials themselves are going through various phases before an approval could happen that brings the drug on the market that you can then as a patient receive to treat the particular disease so looking at this space I started with this simple model but as you can guess this is going to increase in terms of no types very rapidly and it certainly did so just as a reminder why cancer the statistics are still a pretty abysmal when we look at how many deaths are predicted even in 2019 taking from the American Cancer Society so there's definitely still lots of work to be done and we need to see how we can support the companies that are actually bringing these mock drugs to the market and it costs a lot of money as well to move this this forward so looking at the knowledge graph idea I wanted to have an environment that allows me to answer simple as well as complex questions so I wanted to quickly see well if I have come across the company in the past kind of look it up by name for instance or a molecule can I find it by its name or any aliases or alternate names that this molecule might be known by but I also wanted to ask some more complex questions for instance while which of these molecules interact with a specific molecular target or a target family what is the drug pipeline for instance for a specific company which of the molecules are they developing themselves which of the molecules are they developing in collaboration with others then which companies are working on therapeutic molecules that act on a specific molecular target and which diseases are they targeting as I mentioned a molecule may be involved in a disease process but this disease process is necessarily isolated it may involve multiple parts in a human body and one molecule could be used in multiple treating multiple diseases last example here which therapeutic molecules are in a particular phase in the clinical trial that is targeting breast cancer irrespective of a subtype so they got to be an opportunity to consume taxonomies of disease for instance to get to the right answer so with all these questions in mind I definitely wanted a flexible system well easier said than done when I started there was really nothing and I resorted to something that I was familiar with that had a decent scripting language and a good framework to build a UI and I created some input screens that you see here to enter the initial concepts about companies and the basic information that I wanted to know like such as name a description maybe an image and then potential link outs to other information that I didn't want to capture directly in in my knowledge graph and I wanted to also have the option to have minimal entry possible because sometimes all I knew was the name of something and then that would be connected to two other things so then I needed also relationships I needed to figure out how to connect a molecule as shown in the example on the left hand side labeled subjects where is an object with a company in this case through a named relationship so I defined my relationships such as developed by company or has location in city so I can use that also as a potential filtering mechanism in the future once I have a knowledge graph in place and in addition there were some link outs to other source information and buttons for a quick lookup of course a molecule is then connected not just to a company but it's also connected to a lot of other information that one would like to know about the particular drug molecule in the pipeline such as the highest clinical trial phase that this molecule might be in what it potentially is indicated for in this case pancreatic cancer what type of molecule it is if you're familiar with this space traditionally a drug was just a small molecule a chemical that you consumed in a pill form but the biotech industry started to bring proteins that typically had to be injected into the mix and now the design has gone much further where proteins and small molecules are combined in quite sophisticated structures and sometimes we even have cells that are now used as drugs so one couldn't necessarily even say therapeutic molecule and would have to be changed to therapeutic agent which is something that I actually would like to do my knowledge graph and in the future so if you're familiar with neo4j this will remind you obviously of the property graph model you have nodes with properties here of relationships with properties and I had designed this in FileMaker Pro initially by setting up two tables one for subjects one for objects and then another table that connects everything together through relationships and I didn't know neo4j at the time when this started but it allowed me to collect some data over over time and then I came across neo4j and I said well this is exactly what I need to continue on this idea and as I started out with a simple set of concepts it obviously grew over time and it is still growing this slide shows you some examples of these additional concepts where I started to get into the actual product that a company sells I got into some of the financials that gives me a perspective of how profitable are some of these drugs and I also wanted to get into the biology and the chemistry more and started adding bioprocess or biological structure in addition to the target of the molecule and disease so the graph is still growing as it is as more they have become available and as additional questions may come to the foreground so I said I didn't have neo4j I also didn't want to enter all the data manually so one piece that I looked into was to get data more automated thankfully and I looked into clinical trials.gov which lists all the companies that are actually developing drugs and enter them into human trials and I'd set up a script that allowed me to semi automate an extract transform load from that database on a weekly basis so I do it is actually weekly extract the data from clinical trials and then go through this process by looking up cancer-related entries and assign them there's a lot of stuff to it as well all on the lower left and the and the slide here you see some of the issues that are actually popping up which is the terminology that is used to describe a disease or the drug is not very strict in this database so if you really want to harmonize some of that it requires some manual intervention in this ETL process to establish the proper connections and that is a process that I go through it's a quite labor intensive and you also have to have the knowledge at times to make the right decisions to bring this data to together so just a little bit about what's in the database so this database is not large this is not about big data but it's about highly connected data so at this point I got up to about 86 different types of data different types of labels I have 160 relationship types that connect these different know types together sixteen thousand nodes and eighty nine thousand relationships the majority as you can see is clinical trial data with lots of dates associated with it well then we have the therapeutic molecules which are kind of the at the center of this graph the molecular target and the company the organization or mostly have companies but I also have some data about some research organizations as well so I had the data I had this in the FileMaker database but how do I get it out into neo4j I resorted to a pipelining tool called nain and open-source tool which is actually quite great to read in files and process it manipulated somehow and then potentially write files again and so I did export data out of FileMaker then did some transformation in there to create load CSV files that could be used and in a script that I would run to get the data into the neo4j database I started off with a stand alone database Community Edition initially and then when neo4j offered the opportunity to get into neo4j desktop i started switching over to use desktop to store the knowledge graph the load process I wrote a script in sublime text to initially just define some simple constraints and the only constraints that I have is that I have some unique identifiers for each note type and I have a uniqueness constraint on on the name to make sure that I avoid duplicates because that is something that you can come across quite often especially when you're dealing with things like molecules that have many different names throughout the development process but I all wanted to represent it only once in the database not 15 different ways just because they have a different name then I loaded in the notes first very simple scripts here followed by the relationships which I put together by looking up the notes initially and then assigning a particular relationship based on the value that I had extracted from the FileMaker database and last but not least I also looked into using cipher to add some content into the data based on the data that was actually there such as associating for instance a company to a therapeutic area particular disease area that they may might be working on based on the type of molecular molecule and the disease that the molecule is is supposed to address and that all went into one file and once I first statement and that is used to basically load the database so the technology stocks that I've been dealing with to build all this is FileMaker Pro Advanced to enable me to write scripts and capture the data initially the ETL process through nine and a load script getting it into neo4j and then I had the ability to write queries through cipher that lets me actually answer the questions that are set out in the very beginning to this knowledge graph in addition now it also offers the opportunity to write create reports through a park through the awesome procedures on cipher that allows me to put those into a visualization tools such as templo to maybe create a dashboard I could create a graph QL API I tried a few more examples of those and I'm very excited to get more into this to maybe put a web application on top of it and I also can visualize this data in neo4j bloom and I'd like to get to that actually in a few minutes to show you this life if the demo gods are with us here and then last but not least we have the graph algorithms playground that one could use to do graph algorithms okay so here are some cipher query examples one example for instance for some real-time queries if I wanted to know what is the pipeline of what they call the company the thing I want to point out here is that because not all the data is always available I had to use quite frequently an optional match phrase here to say well if it's there show me the data if it's not there then obviously still show me the original molecule that I wanted to see even if it doesn't have anything else other than maybe just a name so that flexibility is really important in this context the second part here we have some epic generated reports for instance if I wanted to get all the data about molecular targets out of the database I can use a park to generate this report and that is data that kind of goes into a visualization tool such as tableau now let's get to visualization graph racialization I was very excited when neo4j developed bloom and made it available for startups and I jumped on it very quickly ended up writing a little blog about this too and rather than actually showing this slide here I want to get into a bloom if I if I can and show you some examples of how you can interactively work with the data it's one example that I want to show here and I'm not sure whether I can do it online here is that bloom doesn't just allow you to look up the individual entities in the knowledge graph such as a company or a target or molecule you can also do these global visualizations that show you for instance like on the left hand side here companies and therapeutic molecules which gives you a perspective of how highly connected some of these areas are in the space of big companies that are collaborating with each other working on the same molecule and then you have such a halo around these companies which represents the newer companies the startups that are just getting into this business and and trying to make a mark in that similar with therapeutic molecules and molecular targets the centers here highlight those that are heavily worked on those are targets that are so-called validated that many companies and try to develop drugs for whereas the novel things are on the bottom side here which don't have too many connections so let's see a demo time let's see whether I can share my screen all right ok so if I go here I hope people can see my screen can you confirm Karen Karine yes you can see it okay perfect perfect all right so here I just wanted to show an example of a molecular target that actually has been in the price quite frequently recently because it is a cancer on codeine that has been very resistant to being targeted by a drug and so in this case I have basically a representation of the molecular target one can dub looks like honored get it basic information I don't have much here other than there are many alternate names for the same target which is sort of a common problem in biology that we have many names for the same thing and sometimes the same name for different things so in this case you can also see then the relationships which is really where the interesting part comes into the mix I have these various named relationships that define the relationships to other things and you can also look up the neighbors directly so in this case you see that I have connections to 19th era period molecules one event one source reference one company directly and one molecular class what I can do is I can highlight all of this and reveal this in the graph which then lets me further explore what I would like to be what I might be interested in I might want to know well why do I have evolutionary medicines on there what is the gtp A's or their other ones or what do we know about it but the cola molecule here by a typical question which unfortunately I don't have a good solution for so far is I would love to just highlight all of these molecules that are connected to this target and then say okay give me just the companies that these targets are being developed by but I cannot get do that so that's kind of a hint for the blue team to see is that a possibility maybe in the future what I can do is I can expand this but then we get into sort of a typical graph problem or you might get a hairball which is a little bit more difficult to decipher but bloom give see still some tools that you can untangle this Graff where I can basically say okay I don't care about this and I'm care about that at least at this point in time and I can quickly just deselect these examples and say okay dismiss all of this and then just leave me what might be interesting for me which are D molecules and individual companies and then I have information about the companies laid up here including also a hyperlink that let's see then get into more information outside of the context of the knowledge graph and I wanted to say thank you for enabling those hyperlinks because I think that's a very important feature in sort of the graph visualization tool set now let's see how much time I have a little bit of time here of minutes total okay let me show you have more than that you have like 17 minutes okay all right something maybe quickly to showcase as well I prepared this already beforehand so one can use also the neo4j browser to look at the structure of the knowledge graph you can do DB schema but unfortunately that gives your hair ball so you have to be more specific and use here a park medic summer sub graph to show just the relationships between companies therapeutic molecules molecular target a similar example here for instance for clinical trials where have the clinical trial here that's connected to many different dates that come with the clinical trial record but then also to therapeutic molecule companies research institutions disease and development state I woke I was actually wrong about the time there's like ten minutes left but you can continue keep going and anybody who wants to stay can stay for the Q&A all that stuff I might just have to jump off in ten minutes okay okay I'll do that quickly I just want to hang out in Q&A for sure but go kiss what you're doing because this is interesting I think I could say that I just want to point out so I wanted to show briefly that I can run these different queries that I set out at the beginning there were my a goal to answer specific questions and also want to highlight that in some cases you don't necessarily work just on the graph but you want a tabular representation of the data which you can certainly get through running these queries or reports as I have shown shown earlier so I just want to jump back quickly since I know I am out on time here and okay where are my slides here I hope this one was the last slide here let's take this [Music] okay I think I had a couple I just wanted to okay last one interactive visualization dashboards can also be generated by this here this is for instance some financial data that I get out of the database here showing the profits that companies can make with these drugs and bring them in perspective when you look at multiple different drugs together that shows you then what are the real big moneymakers versus what maybe doesn't address such a big market size and then last but not least everybody knows now that the world is highly connected if you're interested in this knowledge domain connect with me everything starts out simple and quickly gets complex so try to retain simplicity wherever it's possible and when you're presenting about knowledge graph also think about non-technical audience that's just interested in the knowledge not necessarily how you got there interactive graph realisations I think are a key to enable data explorations of such a knowledge space and the graphs really opened the door for me to capturing learning understanding or interrogating complex data landscapes to gain additional insights and I just want to say thank you to everybody who makes open-source tools available to a broad audience so they can explore these new opportunities at particular neo4j and also 9:00 and if you want to explore that visual interrogation a little bit further I put a blog out there on medium and then last but not least we want to get to the Hunger Games questions as well before we forget that and if you want to answer those go to this address here and address them and I'll take a look at the Q&A section I see Hannah with questions in the Q&A I'm converting some of the messages from the chat to the Q&A if you can just go right through them and you can click answers okay okay all right I'll try to address its it's my first knowledge graph so I don't know whether that's what people think about a knowledge graph or knowledge base for me that that was a knowledge graph the results of clinical trials potentially yes they are of interest and at the moment I try to capture positive or negative results as part of an event in in the graph it's it's very good question difficult to address interfacing mine with neo4j honestly I don't directly interface it at this point in time I basically just export files out of nine in a format that neo4j can consume them through a script so name is is a data pipelining tool that allows you to read in data from a file or from a database manipulate the data convert it in many different ways and then output it again into files or another database I haven't tried connecting to neo4j directly something I would certainly be interested in who uses Kandak at this point in time it's a it is still as I look at it as a prototype so I'm the primary user I'm trying to expose it to a few scientists biologists that might have an interest in it and now that I have neo4j bloom available I can actually do that because before no biologist is really going to run cipher queries until unless they are really really interested in this domain so bloom opens the door to that clinical trials definitely is providing volume of the data but then there I'm also reading a lot of trade publications such as fierce biotech or endpoint news that provide information about novel companies that are just coming on the marketplace that yeah are really new and I wanted to track them as early as as possible and the link I can share in the chat box all right so let's see can I do that I might have to do that differently I can't get to that link directly here sorry yeah the last one about named entity recognition tools I would love to get into NLP there's a lot of content that could be looked at actually in what I store in the database and you could create more tags I haven't had the time yet so this has been sort of a side project of mine to get into graphs and to see what you can actually accomplish with it what answers you can provide and yeah I wish I had more time and hands available to address those I'd be interested in collaborating I'd be interested who would be interested in this kind of data and what they would want to do with it so yes please reach out to me via LinkedIn or Twitter and that would be great all right okay perfect thank you Justin appreciate posting a link to the loma presentation I think everything is gonna be recorded I don't know exactly how people can get to the recording after this is over but I'm pretty sure we'll find out from the info Jay where you can find it and I'm excited the power didn't go out in Southern California so far so I guess the wind must not be blowing that hard so far make sure you answer the questions for the Hunger Games all right thank you everyone for joining in I hope that was interesting content and topic for you let me know if there are any questions I'm happy to get back to you
