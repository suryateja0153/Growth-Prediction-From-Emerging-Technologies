 [Music] please welcome to the stage Allen code [Music] so welcome to day two of next London it's it's my great pleasure to be your host for the day and next or cloud next is all about bringing people together and you know as my voice reminds me this morning you know it's also about great conversations and I've had so many great conversations over the last 48 hours so please bear with me and hopefully it does it's it stays with us throughout the day so thank you so many of you for for getting out bright and early this morning and and joining us here also welcome to the very many folks many more folks who have joined us on the live stream I want to thank our marquee sponsors particularly for their role in making this this gathering happen Accenture at us Deloitte and Intel now day two is is where we go deeper with the technology and we have a jam-packed agenda for you you know as well as lab as well as this keynote we have labs we have breakouts we have dev zones we have spotlights all designed to help you get more hands on with the technology now our goal at Google cloud is to be your the trusted partner for your digital transformation and yesterday you heard our commitment to continuous innovation at literally all layers of the Google cloud stack at infrastructure level we are pushing hard on two fronts both geographically in terms of reach we announced five new Google Cloud regions including one here in Europe just to serve our Eastern European customers from Warsaw and we'll also continues investing in making Google cloud the very best place to work to run your mission-critical enterprise workloads including the big ones Oracle s AP and VMware and in that context we announced yesterday the acquisition of cloud simple very important technology to enable you to move your VM based workloads to the cloud with a very minimum of of retooling now at the platform layer we're laser focused on bringing you world-beating capability to manage data and analytics at scale to use the very latest machine learning and AI technologies to consume supported open source such as read its data stacks all on your Google bill and we've seen huge demand for this in fact our colleagues are at I heard yesterday used a figure that we had in just four months acquired or we had over a thousand new customers in common so this big big demand for for open source on Google Cloud and we're also working you know above that we have we've got tools and capabilities to help you transform the way you work as well through our collaboration tools the cheese suite um all of this and at sorry at the at the top layer then we are working with our ecosystem partners both our technology partners and our system integrator partners to bring you repeatable solutions solutions that tackle some of the most difficult problems for particular industry sectors all of this underpinned by the things we feel very passionate about at Google openness including open source choice resilience security the very best security and sustainability and putting the customer at the heart of everything we do so what's really exciting for us as Googlers is obviously to hear or to see all of this come together in great customer stories and yesterday we heard from Andy McGinnis in John Lewis where he talked about how John Lewis partners have managed to get ahead of relentless almost relentless change within the retail industry where they've by bringing software development in-house adopting cloud native software development techniques and agile so that they could deliver continuous innovation moving from 10 releases or deployments of software annually to nearly six thousand so far in 2019 amazing change WPP we're going to hear more from today but a very different challenge how to bring together insights from 21 global agencies to be able to deliver milliseconds insights and enabling more precise and impactful campaigns for their customers and today just each have shared how they've used Google cloud to reimagine their customer experience to bring together structured and unstructured data including menus from a hundred and twelve thousand restaurants to create individual recommendations based on transaction history and preference for any one of their 27 million customers so there's a team here and you know while costs inconvenience have been very important drivers to the cloud before now you know what we're seeing in these and many other customer stories is is how you know companies are looking to Google cloud for for new capability for game-changing new capability in some cases such as machine learning and AI that can really propel the outcomes and the change of the transformation for their businesses so either in through improved operations through you know automation or predictive analytics or as we've seen through unlocking you new sources of value and great new customer experiences so it's a really interesting time to be in technology it's a really great time to be in knowledge is great time to be a consumer but you know and what I would encourage you as we get deeper on these great offerings today also you know can I encourage you to think about the impact that perhaps these technologies and services can have on your business and your industry so let's get started hey Google what's on the agenda today today we'll be talking about some exciting topics like modern infrastructure smart analytics AI and ml and G suite including some announcements about me cool ok so let's make a start at the first step how we're making it easier for enterprises to move to Google cloud and with that I'm very pleased and please join me in inviting to the stage our VP of engineering Brad Calder [Music] they got luck good morning London I'm excited to be back here to talk about how Google cloud is helping enterprise companies complete their digital transformation journey this morning we'll show you how we made it easier for you to move to a modern enterprise friendly cloud infrastructure we have customers like HSBC PaymentSense atom Bank who bill on top of our infrastructure to run today's and tomorrow's workloads and today I'm going to double click into three areas where we've focused our investment to help you take advantage of Google cloud this is migration enterprise workloads and networking so let's start with migration many of you have VMware on-premise deployments and as Thomas mentioned yesterday we're excited to announce the acquisition of the company cloud simple a leading provider for running VMware workloads in the cloud this acquisition allows us to accelerate our fully integrated VMware solution so you'll now be able to easily migrate your existing VMware workloads right into Google cloud and gain the performance scale and security benefits that Google cloud has to offer in other cases you may want to migrate directly into compute engine to maximize performance or minimize costs so to achieve that we have migrated for compute engine this allows you to quickly and safely migrate workloads hosted on-premise in AWS or an azure directly to Google Cloud migrate for compute engine eliminates a lot of the manual toil when migrating to the cloud and as a result it's helped our customers like Gardiner health Meditec eliminate hundreds of hours from their migration projects allowing them to quickly realize the benefit of running in the cloud now once you migrated your workloads to the cloud you can take advantage of the latest Intel and AMD processor technologies this is with our new n 2 and n 2d general-purpose VM families ok compared to earlier n1 these offer higher performance and the end to DBMS also provide increased memory bandwidth for your workloads now let's talk about enterprise workloads an important workload customers are migrating to Google Cloud is ASAP and for last few years we have been helping customers digitally transform their s AP environments so let's take a look at one example customer with Metro Metro AG in Dusseldorf Germany we have about 150 thousand people worldwide for Discipline billion revenue we are b2b wholesale company and you are acting in 35 countries scalability is our main challenge and but besides that security availability of the platform also reliability is a major issue you're facing the main reason why we've chosen Google cloud is mainly due to the fact that we looking for a technical feasible solution Google is perfect in that sense the other reason was that you're looking for a partner that is driving innovation now I think we are in a pretty stable situation we have daily operations with Google we have support from the office of the CTO on a regular basis so a lot of services we get from Google and also when it comes to innovation product development so it's a it's a joint activity between Google and us and I think that's a win-win situation all right that's one of many great SAV stories we have with our customers and to make migration even faster and easier we're pleased to announce a comprehensive new program for our si P Custer's customers called the cloud acceleration program this program includes si P focused enterprise support in collaboration with our partner community to speed up your migration to the cloud now once your SI p applications are running in google cloud you can take advantage of a full range of si P certified VMs including our general-purpose end to our memory optimized m2 and our compute optimized c2 families these all offer high performance options for running your SI p environments and we have customers like cardinal health who are already live with our m2 memory optimized VMs running with 12 terabytes of memory these VMs are perfect for production ASAP Hana workloads now to keep your SI p environments up and running our VM live migration saves you millions in prevented downtime by keeping your applications running without disruption even when Google performs hardware maintenance or rolls out security patches and unlike other cloud providers our live migration works for our entire VM fleet it works across all of our VM families ok now in addition you can turn your s AP data into business insights by using Google clouds bigquery for state-of-the-art data analytics and using Auto ml for cutting-edge innovation in machine learning so now I'd like to welcome Lucy on stage to show you how Google Google cloud can save you time and money with automated si P deployment and dynamic resizing [Music] hi everyone let's say ping customers migrate to the cloud because they want to simplify their operations and be more agile CPS architected very differently from a lot of systems you might be familiar with it's quite different in terms of architecture and it's also quite complex it powers your entire business you cannot afford to have it go down it's also not easy to provision in u.s. IP system with high availability even the most experienced administrators can make mistakes and if you get it wrong you won't know until your system goes down and then it's too late it's also hard to scale up and down and running ASAP system so if your business suddenly picks up you might not be able to resize your system when you need it the most with those two things together and you find that customers buy more infrastructure than they really need because they don't want to worry about running out of space or memory so many customers choose to oversize their systems which is expensive and wasteful with Google Cloud you can save yourself the headaches and the cash you can easily set up an assay be high availability system in a few minutes using automated deployment templates on flexible virtualized architecture to resize on demand with help from my friend well let's look at a typical deployment of an s IP Hana scale up high availability cluster on Google cloud within the Google console we can see two virtual machines are active in the names 101 in Hana tiers in our monitoring system Google stack driver we can seem the top left panel that Hana synchronous replication is active in Hana one is primary in Hana two is secondary let us see how you can automate an entire deployment like this one with just a few clicks in a few minutes using Google cloud deployment templates when we're done we'll have a properly configured high availability system that meets all of us ap certification requirements we could simply open the cloud shell enter the deployment template configuration file and execute it right now in the background deployment manager is downloading the SMI Hana media from a GCS bucket installing s a peahen own two virtual machines setting up a Hana synchronous replication and configuring pacemaker for clustering all of this with one single line of code isn't that awesome with traditional bare-metal deployments you don't have the same agility to spin up environments on demand and the mistake during manual installation can leave your system vulnerable during a critical business event but with Google Cloud a CP deployment templates you can get started quicker and you get best practice design by default this takes about 30 minutes so let's use AG landscape we deployed earlier today now what if you need to increase capacity maybe it's a busy time like financial month and close or you're doing awesome in the holiday sales season and you need more power to process all of those sales orders let us show you how we can dynamically resize from a smaller virtual machine to a larger 12 terabyte Hana system with near zero business downtime so back in the Google console we have stopped our secondary hunting since momentarily so we can resize it while the primary instance continues to run our production environment then we select a new size for the secondary virtual machine in this case we'll choose 12 terabytes we can save and when we're ready we can start the instance you can see which slicing happens immediately and takes just minutes on a virtualized architecture because the deployment template gave us high availability we can use that to keep our system up while we add the memory that we need resizing also takes about a minute so let's go back to an original deployment and trigger an event that will make our already resized system the primary again near zero downtime so we're resetting now let's go back to stack driver and make sure that we can see the magic and everybody understands what's going on here so if you look at the top left panel we can see in replication status that Hana to node 2 covers primary and is now run in the system if you look at the bottom left panel we see replication was interrupted when we stopped the secondary host to resize it and then again when we're it's at the primary instance in the top right panel we see incoming transactions were not interrupted by shutting down the instance but they did take a minor dip when we trigger takeover by restart in the primary host and on the bottom right panel we can also see the memory increase we adjusted is now available in summary Google Cloud delivers agility you need to rent a sleepy without compromising availability specifically we showed two very cool things first how to automatically deploy a highly available s ap certified Hana system in minutes not weeks and second how virtualized architecture allows you to dynamically resize for additional capacity on demand with near zero downtime thank you [Applause] thanks Lucia it's great to see the time and cost savings our customers can achieve from running and dynamically scaley ASAP on Google cloud now in addition to si P our customers are looking to migrate their existing Oracle workloads onto Google cloud so we're excited to provide you with the ability to migrate your Oracle workloads on to bare metal servers with Google cloud that the new leverage your existing Oracle products and licenses and lastly for Windows workloads we added Microsoft sequel server to our cloud secret portfolio to provide you a fully managed mice Microsoft sequel server with built-in high availability and security and I'm happy to announce that sequel server is now available in beta today so we've covered how we help you migrate to the cloud we covered important enterprise workloads now let's dive into how we bring it all together with networking networking availability bandwidth and security have to be in place to keep everything running as you expand your network from on-premise to cloud to multi cloud you need to have visibility into your network to quickly troubleshoot issues and to span all of these environments so to achieve this I'm very excited to announce the network intelligence center this is Google clouds new comprehensive network platform for monitoring verification and optimization the network intelligence center offers two solutions available in beta today our connectivity tests and our network topology with more to be audited in the future so our connectivity test lets you perform on-demand diagnostics so that you can troubleshoot outages by verifying network connectivity and pinpointing the specific issue and with our network topology you can visualize your network simple ha simplifying network monitoring and troubleshooting and fulfill your SOC audit requirements our goal here is to allow you to navigate the visualization of your network with structure and insights a Google cloud is the first cloud provider to provide all this holistically for your entire global network in the cloud so now I'd like to buy it Lakshmi on stage to show you all this in action my name is Lakshmi Sharma and I'm going to show you here how Network intelligence Center can help you ensure connectivity and driven outages Google cloud is the first cloud provider to use static config validation techniques and ensure connectivity and empower customers to go and verify the impact of your configuration changes and prevent outages in production and before production let's focus on VM migration in hybrid deployments hybrid deployments require different systems connected between on-prem and in DCP migrating virtual machines requires lot of secure connectivity and private connectivity between on premises and GCP systems configuration of such systems can be very complicated and is prone to errors and hence could be very difficult to troubleshoot here my colleague coyote is going to create a simple test for troubleshooting connectivity from on-premise to GCP he's going to click save save the test go to another tab and then you see that the test is complete as you can see we are able to see a detail hop-by-hop packet trace through the network you can click on any of these hubs to see more details if you look at the bottom you will see that the traffic is being blocked and if you as indicated by red if you go to the previous hub you will see this is being blocked because of a firewall rule now we can go directly from here to firewall page and you saw that figuring out such a firewall based blockage of your traffic only took two clicks for you to identify now coyote went to the firewall page he will unblock the firewall rule safes go back to the page reruns the test well the test is running I would like to emphasize that we do understand that network outages are business problems and connectivity test is here to help you out solve your business problems related to network outages now the test is complete as you can see by the status screen and on the packet hub by hob trace you can see that the traffic is complete and your connectivity is there with this we are back to business so this is how network intelligence Center helps you quickly diagnose connectivity and prevent outages now let's move on to network topology so network topology gives you a global visualization of your global network in DCP as you can see there are traffic entering from three different regions into your DCP instances Americas amia and AIPAC you can also see that drilling down into each of those regions you will be able to see which specific country the traffic is coming from you can also see all your regional load balancers deployed on the bottom here you can drill down to see your NAND instances as well as all your GC instances in that region many customers use network topology to validate their business and IT policies for instance let's say you have a policy that all your egress traffic needs to go through load balancers so looking at this you can identify that for this specific region there's a traffic going directly to the Geo region without going through the load balancer that means you violated your IT policies so another way you can use network topology is to proactively verify if the traffic is being served from the optimal region in this scenario traffic from a pack it Bing is being served from the from Asia East region this will help you troubleshoot your performance and egress issues that may happen as a result of your egress being served out of a non optimal region and lastly let's look at Time Machine this time machine slider takes you back couple of days and we'll give you the view of your topology at that time and with this with this topology Time Machine is you can diagnose your issues which relate to configuration problems back in the time for instance if a network even happened you can use this capability to look at the topology around that specific event and determine if the topology change was a reason for your network outage during migration it helps you monitor the state of your deployment as you migrate your workloads and thus providing you visibility into your migration status and it also helps you track your configuration while you're moving the topology while you're moving the workload and the topology along with it as your migration completes you can go and click the project aggregation status and then here you see all your projects and all your VP sees in that organization in one place so once you have completed your migration you can get the consolidated view of your topology this is how network topology helps you with proactive monitoring troubleshooting optimization and verification of policies thank you so much thank you coyote and over to Brad thanks Lakshmi so we're excited to get the network intelligence Center into your hands and we know it's going to have a huge impact on your migration and modernization efforts we've heard great feedback from several customers like kochava who have used this product and already sees significant reductions in troubleshooting their network now I have one more exciting networking announcement for you today many of you have public IP addresses with applications tied to those addresses you've built products and infrastructure around these addresses and there's business value in preserving these addresses as you migrate to the cloud and that's why we're introducing bring your own IP which allows you to preserve your addresses and bring them to Google cloud and Google cloud is the first cloud provider to have this available across every region and we're the first one to give you the flexibility to allocate IP address blocks as small as 16 addresses per region on top of that Google cloud is the first cloud provider that allows you to use a single global anycast IP to route your user traffic to the closest back-end server when bringing your own IP so we work closely with several customers like bitly under cloud migration for bring your own IP and this was critical for them this allowed them to bring their application without changing code and keeping their well established IP addresses addresses that their customers had already taken in dependency upon this allowed them to minimize risk downtime and toil with their migration and reduce their networking infrastructure costs so in addition they also used anycast with Google's global network resulting in improved performance with a 50% reduction in latency connection time and download time so as you can see we are heavily investing to deliver the modern infrastructure that you need for today's and tomorrow's workloads and we're excited to have you leverage our new capabilities for your digital transformation journey so just to recap from Gration we have new solutions so that you can seamlessly migrate your workloads into google cloud and we're very excited to welcome cloud simple to the google family providing faster and easier migration of vmware workloads to google cloud and for vm for enterprise workloads we have new VM families support for oracle and new capabilities for s AP and sequel server and for networking we're introducing the network intelligence center with bringing your own IP to make sure your workloads can best leverage Google's global network so thank you for your time today I look forward to making new successful in your journey to the cloud now I'd like to welcome Sudhir on stage to talk about Google's smart analytics thank you [Music] [Applause] I'm super excited to be here and especially it was so inspiring to see all the organizations yesterday telling their stories of how they are becoming more data-driven transforming their businesses with Google cloud as organizations are becoming more data-driven there are few key challenges that they have one the size of data within organizations is growing really fast second they need to derive intelligent insights from this large-scale data sets that they have and finally and most importantly make these insights available to everybody within their organizations for this at Google cloud we have the most comprehensive and performant smart analytics platform in the industry you can collect data both in streaming fashion as well as batch you can collect billions of events every day and go ahead and process them in real-time we have both capabilities to go collect and process these events with open source technologies that you may want to have or cloud native services that are highly scalable for for you to use you can also store this data in different kind of storage formats you can have structured unstructured semi-structured data sets that you can store you can store them in our data lake with GCS or in our data warehouse with bigquery you can leverage different engines for example you can use bigquery with its sequel engine to go ahead and analyze data both on data lake as well as in your data warehouse and you can go ahead and use spark or flink or different open source technologies to analyze data across all of these platforms and finally you can understand the data using various of our technologies including Google sheets you can leverage various BI tools within the organization and also use our cloud AI technologies that are available there are three key reasons why organizations pick Google smart analytics platform one we have a highly scalable data warehousing solution with bigquery second we have a highly differentiated real-time analytics capability and third our embedded AI and machine learning capability is is really unique so let's talk about each one of them one by one so first let's talk about highly scalable data warehousing traditionally the challenge within organizations was organizations had data warehouses in their environments growing with data within these environments was really expensive really difficult so what did people do they summarized the data they aggregated it try to keep as less data as possible within the data warehouses and use it only for reporting dashboarding for very few within the organization so what happened with the rest of the data moved it into the data leak and what does that do it creates data silos within organizations we are breaking those silos with with Google Cloud bigquery allows you to go ahead and store massive scale data sets within its environment when you have structured data we have customers that are using creating data Mart's that are few terabytes and we have other organizations that are leveraging bigquery to run their whole business on top of the query where we have like tens to hundreds of petabytes of data within their environments few of the key things one key one interesting fact one of our customers actually did one of the largest queries that has been run on bigquery had hundred pillar trillion rows in it fascinating stuff other than that what we have also enabled this year is we know organizations want to analyze data not just with sequel but various different forms of engines that are available and we have enabled organizations to run spark jobs directly against bigquery data structured data it just opens up completely different worlds for you to go ahead and leverage in addition bigquery also allows you to go ahead and query data that maybe in PAL K or o our C files within your data Lakes so that expands completely different opportunities for you a great example of this is HSBC HSBC is basically they have one of the largest banks their 40 million customers are they do roughly 1.5 trillion dollars worth of payment transactions every day they have petabytes of data within their environment and they perform liquidity and capital reporting on top of Google cloud this is a super critical application that they run it needs to be highly available across multiple regions and they're using bigquery and a data probe to go ahead and do all the processing and reporting that everyday for the various organizations they need to so great example of not just reporting and dashboard in being done on top of our analytics platform but expanding it to real pr1 tier two applications that that are super critical for organizations switching gears let's talk about number two streaming by 20 25 30 percent of data is going to be generated in streaming form according to IDC but we believe at Google majority of the decisions within organizations will be made on these on this data so out of the box our streaming analytics platform enables you to one collect and process data in real time and scale with the data flow and the main capability the data flow provides is it will auto scale with the amount of data that we are collecting and without you having to do any kind of operational maintenance on it the second thing you can do is you can actually ingest this large-scale streaming data directly into bigquery as Thomas mentioned yesterday we have expanded our ability to go ahead and collect data in streaming form in bigquery by 10x earlier this year and this means you can do millions of events per second directly into the data warehouse without impacting the query performance on top of the query one of our customers Spotify one of our earliest customers Spotify has been using the platform for a few years now they were one of our earliest adopters they actually collect hundreds of billions of events every day they basically use this to go ahead and make royalty payments for their artists so real-time streaming events coming globally processing it making sure you calculate exactly royalties for the artists that's one example but they are also using the same platform to go ahead and provide highly personalized experiences for their users they have a rapt campaign that goes on every end-of-the-year run and they're driving all of that using the same platform that's being used to analyze the reader third key capabilities are embedded AI and machine learning within our data warehousing environment so historically what happens is you basically have your data warehousing systems and your machine learning systems and what do you do you take the data from your data warehouse figure out what columns you need you export it and move it to your machine learning environment and then you realize oh the couple of columns that were not right or you have to do different kind of transformation and you're just moving data between systems and that's not the most efficient way of doing things so our thing was how do we change the paradigm in this space and so instead of taking data to machine learning engines with bigquery ml we are bringing the whole machine learning engine inside the data warehouse with just like few lines of code or actually two lines of code you can create machine learning models directly inside bigquery you can do various type of regression models but this year we have also enabled you to create matrix factorization for recommendations you can do clustering for segmentation and various different kinds of models and great example of this is cubed cubed actually provides high our personalized ecommerce experiences for iconic brands across the world they have moved to more modern smart analytics platform they collect clickstream data that's being processed at scale with data flow bigquery machine learning is used for creating models and then they can go ahead and deploy it in production the things that you should take them weeks to do now they can create these models within a day and put it into production and try out different kind of models so the velocity of change that they can go through is really high improving their efficiency across the system our key theme around investments is radical simplicity I talked about making everything simple across our platform so that users it's easy for users to go ahead and use our platform we are building intuitive intelligent and integrated smart analytics platform just this year we have launched more than 50 key capabilities in the in the platform we are making it easier for you to migrate your enterprise data warehouses to bigquery on google cloud not just migration tooling we are providing them but we are actually making it easy to derive intelligent insights from the platform today I want to announce few of the key capabilities that we have enabled are enabled for you first of all we are announcing the beta of connected sheets I love connected sheets it's basically a spreadsheet experience with G suite sheets in front of bigquery you can take billions of rows and actually use sheets to go ahead and analyze it you can basically do pivots sorts write functions you can create visualizations and as usual you can actually collaborate across your organization with the sheet you can share it on all the second key announcement is data fusion we're announcing earlier this year around April in San Francisco we announced beta of data fusion we are now going GA that means you can now start putting the product in production start using it to go ahead and create code free data integration environments you can build complex data pipelines with zero lines of code with data fusion and more importantly today we are also announcing availability in beta of a data lineage capability finally earlier this year we announced intent to acquire looker looker has been a great partner for us we have a lot of joint customers and they provide three key capabilities they have a great semantic modeling layer so you can basically define common metrics for your organization second they have great enterprise bi capabilities and finally they enable you to go ahead and build data applications on top of your enterprise data with that let me invite Anita to bring some of these capabilities to life with the demo thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] hello everyone I think you'd all agree that revenue performance is the lifeblood of any business now let's imagine your business leader in a large organization that's grown over the years both organically and through acquisitions your footprint is broad and your data is big you are responsible for making sound business decisions with a most freshest and most accurate data in order to have a 360-degree view of your business you need to be able to bring in data from multiple sources both internal and external and that's what data fusion is all about data fusion is a fully managed and cloud native data integration service for building pipelines and it has a hundred plus out-of-the-box connectors let's take a look at how do diffusion shifts your team's focus away from infrastructure in the data fusion UI you can see multiple pipelines bringing in data if we're to click into one of them you can quickly see that these pipelines can get pretty broad and actually pretty complex multiple input sources and multiple transformations now let's zoom into one simple pipeline that's bringing in data from an ACP HANA instance that's running on Google Cloud the four boxes on your left show you the different input sources and the blue boxes show you the different transformations and finally we see that data landing in bigquery the power of data fusion is that all of this is being done without a single line of code now let's talk about bigquery I'm sure Sudi already introduced it but bigquery is Google clouds petabyte scale enterprise data warehouse it is fully managed and server less which means you can focus on insights instead of managing infrastructure now let's go into the bigquery UI to see all the data we brought in can see it on the left if we're to click into the aggregate financials table you could quickly see that this table is pretty broad with 1.1 billion rows bigquery allows organizations to run analytics at virtually any scale in order to have a 360-degree view of your business one KPI you might want to track is revenue by region and by partner and naturally a data analyst could do this using standard sequel and then visualize them with executive dashboards like looker tableau click or others but what about those who aren't familiar with sequel let's see how your business analyst can explore this data in connected sheets from the bigquery UI click on explore in sheets drop down it's worth calling out the connected cheese brings together the power of bigquery with familiarity of sheets in just one click and what's happening in the background is pretty amazing if you think about it you're taking the full table in bigquery and making a live connection to that familiar spreadsheet interface and for the purposes of the demo we already made the connection and you can see the same table 1 point 1 billion rows it's that simple and powerful and now you can naturally start to use traditional spreadsheet functionalities like charts pivot tables and functions all across your bigquery data set let's take a look at some of the few kpi's you're tracking and see how each region is doing right away you can see that the something wrong with the JPAC region the reseller revenue - seems to be a little bit off you'd like to share this sheet with one of your colleagues in finance so they can also see the analysis as well for that you will just click on the share button above and also off your running you need to find out what's going on with this metric we've all been there debugging a metric that just doesn't make sense and this is where lineage by data fusion comes in and sudra just talked about it we know that the data powering this chart is from the aggregate financial stable that's actually in bigquery let's find the table in data fusion now let's take a look at the lineage this is a high-level view of the lineage and you can see the aggregate financials data set but we're not interested in high love of you let's drill into the field level lineage to understand what's happening we know that the JPAC revenue for resellers is off let's take a look at how how we're calculating revenue ah-ha there it is it looks like for JPAC we're dividing revenue by a thousand and this should not be the case and this is actually what's impacting that data now you can correct that transformation rerun the pipeline and sync it back into bigquery to save time we already reprocess the data it's already landed in bigquery where it's connected to sheets and now let's see how our chart now looks as you can see now the JPAC revenue is now within the right threshold you've just now seen a few of the powerful new capabilities we've been building into a smart analytics platform we looked at lineage and data fusion the scale of bigquery and how we're democratizing insights with connected sheets and with that thank you and I'd like to welcome studio back to the stage that was an awesome demo I'm super excited about the data lineage capability that we are announcing today especially ability to go ahead and have field level lineage to do your root cause analysis of your pipelines but more importantly satisfy your needs for compliance across the whole data pipelines is going to be a key benefit for all the organizations with that it's important what we deliver from Google itself but we have a very important partner ecosystem they are delivering key capabilities across the data lifecycle one of the major announcements we want to make today is availability of informatica as intelligent cloud services beta on the GCP a marketplace so if you are interested in using integration technology from informatica now you can just directly go to the marketplace with few clicks start using it for your various data integration needs other than that we have hundred-plus for leading technology partners that provide various capabilities around business intelligence data integration analytics and all and I think as you are investing a lot in these partners we are working closely with them to make sure we can satisfy your needs that you have within your organization's with that let me actually invite Ignacio CIO of waterphone on the stage to share what they are doing at Vodafone [Music] well super thank you for being here can you first share with us what what your team does what you do at a waterfall absolutely thank you for having me here and Vodafone is one of the largest mobile companies in the world we serve over 600 million customers which is double of the u.s. population more or less to give a context we have operations in 24 countries and we reach 44 with our partner market but we are more than a mobile company we also have broadband 37 millions we have TV services we are very large in IOT for consumer and enterprise and we have a big number of products and services for our customers awesome so operating at such a scale what were the key data challenges that you had within your organization I don't think that we have time to describe all of them but I will go for a few of them so first is a volume of the data we process around 2,700 petabytes of the attained in a single year and for example of dimension our network to get give the best service to our customers fundamental but that's not the only one we have a lot of legacies we have been growing in organically with acquisitions and means that we have a lot of systems a lot of data warehouses and that is difficult is broken the data it costs a lot of money and we can no provide innovation and we can no be very fast so it will be the second one seen that the third one is how do we get a back-office streamline operations almost touchless we have hundreds and plus thousand employees and we want them to be excited to be doing job that isn't means something for for ourselves and I think this really is our core problem that's amazing you said 2,700 petabytes that's a lot so can you share why you chose to partner with Google cloud no absolutely I mean it was a very thorough process and the first thing is your heritage in data I mean you have been doing this all your life and now you're making available your hardware and your hope for all of your application that you have been describing for us absolutely that is the number one thing but it's not the only one the second one will be your innovation I mean you have a proven track record of innovating and delivering pros very often the third one and is a wonder I like the most is the ways of working and collaboration and co-creation you will name in some of the things that you are doing with data fusion and some of the challenges that we're having and I'm not gonna describe what we are doing here because if is private for the moment but you in six months are already providing proper solutions to us and that is amazing that feels good and especially data silos with an organization as you said are so so much of a problem and the data fusion I think it will solve some of those challenge look I can tell you one of the countries only in there we have six data warehouses massive everything that you were explaining about the inflexibility about how you have to aggregate data because it's wrong too much how you can not really get inside if you have a problem then you need to pay an analyst or and wait for a week like I will download the information in Excel try to process put it in a PowerPoint someone will manipulate the PowerPoint and you have the wrong answer too late yeah and that is something that we are in a mission to eliminate eliminate complexity eliminate all the legacies be simple focus all our energy in our customers yeah yeah perfect Thank You Ignacio thanks a lot for joining us perfect bye-bye and with that I would like to invite Andrew Moore to go ahead and share some of our innovations in Claudia [Music] hello everybody we find ourselves at the start of a new chapter in artificial intelligence it's real it works and at Google our strategy now is all about getting it deployed at scale safely in all businesses and organizations around the world we believe there is no one-size-fits-all for successful AI there's two main entry points if you're a builder then you need specific tools to help you create brand new custom a eyes and let me emphasize the world really needs you to build them we all are together in creating this new generation of AIS and it's for us it's all about empowering you to build them however there's also business decision makers who need to use end-to-end AI solutions and so we've also been working very hard on those I'm going to talk about both of these cases the builders and the business decision makers so let's begin with the business decision makers a great example of a fully packaged end-to-end AI solution is contact center AI and now contact center AI is generally available and it brings our world-class conversational AI systems to call centers to allow the exact automation of many of the kind of interactions that go on with call centers and even in the cases of the kind of conversations which are too complex for the AI to handle the air can still coach and aid the human call center operators in running successful and useful calls over and over again we've seen this help provide exceptional customer service while increasing operational efficiency leading to things like an increase in customer satisfaction agent satisfaction Net Promoter Score for the customers who are using this unlike other offerings contact center AI is integrated with global telephony providers that represent 74% of the market which means that most of you can incorporate this kind of powerful end-to-end AI into your own operations today next let's talk about the builders the people who are going to build the new AIS we have a responsibility to provide you with a very powerful platform to do this you are the folks who are facing the most complex challenges and solving problems in brand new ways we've spent a lot of time trying to analyze your needs as you're doing this and we've used that insight to build the most sophisticated platform for AI development anywhere that the foundation of this platform is our world-class infrastructure this makes it possible to run your workload cost-effectively and with the best possible performance and scalability for massive scale machine learning we're the first and only cloud provider to design and deliver a custom built AI chip to our customers these are the TPU units which have broken performance records for both training and serving your machine learning models and is used by enterprises around the world open sourced by Google tensorflow of course is now one of the most popular machine learning frameworks in the world but enterprise users have much higher demands and expectations than open source solutions for running large reliable and long-term sustainable machine learning workloads to address these needs we recently introduced tensorflow Enterprise this is the first of its kind service to offer enterprise level support for tensorflow and give that continuity extending version support for up to three years providing a safety net and a lifetime for applications now we're also devoted lots of energy to auto ml our auto ml products are great tools for builders they can't make it possible to quickly build high quality machine learning models all with minimal machine learning expertise and a great example of this is Auto ml was a competitor against more than 70 human teams in a big machine learning competition to predict equipment false and in this competition Auto ml came second beating 70 human teams and it did it with just one hour of effort this is the kind of acceleration of machine learning builder productivity that we're trying to help out with one example of the use of auto ml is News UK they use Auto amaryl natural language to better manage and target content which includes hundreds of thousands of new articles every year Auto ml natural language helps them identify which content customers are engaging their gain gauging with so they can understand how to improve that contact to make it more relevant and now more of the auto ml products are generally available this includes auto ml translation and auto ml vision Auto ml can be the very building blocks of your own customized solution we have new order male natural language capabilities like entity extraction classification and translation and these can now be combined to help you analyze documents like invoice voices contracts and many other classes of documents we call this document AI and it makes the most common enterprise process is much more effective than before now this is something I'm personally very passionate about as organizations adopt AI it's getting really important to assure quality safety and interpretability with that ai ai must be able to explain itself we see this across almost every industry to close this gap as Thomas announced yesterday we're introducing a collection of tools to help say create safe inclusive fair models we call this explainable ai ai explanations provides insights to things like which features are intruding your predictions in particular scenarios most effectively and it can be applied both for our auto ml suite of products and for our AI platform machine learning algorithms so the Builder can see a visual representation or an explanation of how much each facts are contributed to the prediction examples are of customers who are using this with success our sky I robots and well II oh so let's see how explainable AI looks in practice please welcome Sarah Robinson onto the stage [Music] [Applause] [Music] thanks Andrew explanations helps you understand how the inputs to your model affect its prediction they can be used with all kinds of models and data including images natural language and tabular data with numerical and categorical fields let's start with images first I'm gonna show you a simple example so you understand how explanations is useful for model builders then we'll look at a healthcare use case I'll be demoing all of this from cloud AI platform notebooks here's a model that classifies different types of flowers we'll send two flower images to our model for prediction looks like our model classified both of these flowers correctly but what caused our model to make these predictions explanations can tell us which features were most important to even the most complex neural network I can get explanations from any tensor flow model deployed on cloudy i platform using the prediction API for image models explanations helps us better understand which pixels in this image contributed most to our models prediction in this case we're using explanations to validate that our model is performing correctly and generalizing on the right image attributes from these explanations we can see that our model is able to pick up on the shapes that are specific to these types of flowers to look at how explanations can be used by model consumers let's see how they can be applied in a real-world example I also have a model that can classify images from I screenings to determine if a patient has diabetic retinopathy or dr a condition that can lead to blindness if not caught early this is an image of an eye with proliferative dr which is the worst form without explanations our model can correctly classify this as proliferative but for a doctor confirming a diagnosis a classification alone may not be enough they likely need to know what led the model to make this prediction here is what our explanation service returns for this image it is highlighting the areas on the retina which are indicative of this condition and helps focus the doctors attention for a faster diagnosis so now that you've seen how explanations works on images to help both model builders and end users let's take a look at a model trained on tabular data the most common type of data for businesses for this example let's say you're managing a bike sharing company and you need to decide how many bikes to have in circulation we need to guess how long each bicycle might be in use so let's predict the duration of bike share trips given data like trip distance start time and weather data for the given day we've trained the model by joining two public data sets available in bigquery London bike share data and weather here is some data on a bike trip that took 11 minutes let's send it to our cloud model and see what it predicts for trip duration looks like our model got pretty close it predicted 10 point 7 1 minutes compared to the actual duration of 11 but what caused the model to predict 10 point 7 1 minutes here is what explanations returns for this particular example these attribution values are all relative to the model's baseline prediction which is what the model predicted for the median across all of our input values attributions with high magnitude were most important to our model positive attributions increase to increase the predicted trip duration from the baseline and negative values decreased it so here we can see that the start hour of the trip decreased the models prediction by about 1 minute we could then use this to optimize bike availability based on insights across variables like time of day and weather but as a model builder it would be nice if there a better way to see what explanations returns the best way to visualize explanations for tabular data is with the wet if tool an open source tool for visualizing the explanations on our cloudy eye platform model directly in a notebook let's try it out here on the x-axis we see the predicted trip duration for all of our test values when we click on a dot we can look at the feature values for an individual example we can also see the attribution values returned from cloud explanations for each input for this trip it looks like the distance and Max temperature influence the models prediction the most the what-if tool also lets us change these values and rerun prediction to see how the updated values influence what the model will predict so let's try changing max temperature to 10 degrees Celsius rerunning predictions and see how this affects our model output looks like it decreased the models predicted trip duration by about 2 minutes AI explanations is ready for nearly any kind of model across a variety of industries from identifying important pixels and medical images to highlighting critical words in sentiment analysis to showing reason codes for asset valuations we're excited for you to try out explainable AI on Google cloud and with that I'd like to welcome Andrew back to the stage Thank You Sarah I'm so thrilled that we are now able to start using these kind of explain ability tools generally explain the middle a eye is also coming to many more of our AI products soon you can get started with explainable AI at this link so to summarize Google Cloud offers the full spectrum of AI for customers like these to build custom AI and also to build industry specific solutions so your company can be at the forefront of today's digital transformation next I'd like to introduce David Thacker VP of product and design for G suite to talk about how they're helping businesses transform the way they work thank you [Music] [Applause] morning everyone I'm David Thacker I'm responsible for product and design 4G suite I'm really excited to be here today to share the progress we've made over the last year towards our mission of helping transform the way businesses work G suite includes products that over 1.5 billion people use products like Gmail Google Docs and drive as well as our enterprise messaging and video conferencing products chat and meet G suite also empowers over 90 million students and educators to learn and collaborate together in schools all around the world and we've now reached over five million paying businesses with 1 million businesses added in the last year alone G suite customers include established market leaders like Carrefour Roche and Fiat Chrysler who you heard from yesterday as well as digital innovators like delivery a kado and Spotify who built their businesses with the help of G suite and increasingly organizations with large frontline workforces are turning to G suis to transform how all of their employees can work together not just their office workers one example is Bert's org a health care firm in the Netherlands using G suite to rethink traditional models like home care let's take a look at their story in this video I was called by one of the caregivers she saw this wound and she didn't know what to do it was already 4 p.m. and I had to go to another clients I think oh don't ask me any questions just let me treat the wound and let me go out you close the door or literally in their face I was back in my car and I was thinking well what am i doing this is this is not nursing for me there was a turning point and I had to quit my job there before I became a nurse I studied economics so I said why are we doing this this way we call it food source because we had to focus on neighborhoods and boot meets neighborhood it's going back to the principle that community nurse is taking care of the community we want to focus on our clients so the less we can spend on the administrational tasks the better [Music] they advised me to move over to G sweet really helps in our way of practicing our principles spend the time on the necessary things I'm taking care of patients on one hand and also developing new knowledge on the other hand you can easily share documents also we share screen so we can see what we are doing this freedom brings up the best way of working so you really can take time and you have to take time to invest in your clients to have a coffee once in a while and in to talk with each other and to build up a relationship within virtual you think keep it as simple as possible and that's what G suite is also doing [Music] these businesses are moving to G suite to fully transform not only their culture but positively impact their business according to a recent Forrester total economic impact study customers moving to G suite saw efficiency improvements equivalent to saving each employee 21 work days a year and in securities companies reduced the risk of a data breach by over 95% by helping teams work faster smarter and more collaboratively faster because improved speed helps you bring your ideas turn your ideas into products and services smarter because you need to be able to harness your company data to make better business decisions and together because a truly collaborative culture is the backbone of any successful business G suite is the place for work collaboration where teams can keep projects moving forward without the distraction and fragmented experience of legacy tools now to take a look at teams how you teams use G suite today I'd like to invite my colleague Ulrika onstage to give us a demo [Music] thank you David hello I'm Marika I'm from the custom engineering team here in India I'm joined on stage by my colleague Dominic we're excited to show you today how G sweet can help your teams to get important projects moving from a single browser window in this demo Dominic will act as a business line owner of a global manufacturing company Dominic is team this task with a very dead tight deadline the team is facing a presentation for an executive level Business Review so they have to move fast to prepare for the meetings right we better get started like most G speed users Dominic starts his day in G mass first he checks his calendar on the side panel which reminds him that the presentation practice is today Dominic will ask a status update from his team in their chat group and he will be doing that from within Gmail let's take a closer look this chatroom makes it easy to keep track of conversations but also shared files without leaving Gmail looks like the presentation is nearly finished so but it could use some design work and for that we need to add our designer ben is a designer with an external account so Dominic will add him to the chat room by using the same simple workflow he would will use with any regular colleague other tools required to go through multiple steps and add guest accounts before you can actually start interacting with that person that leads through wasted time frustration notice on the chat room as well actually the external badge it helps your team to be mindful of what they want to share with external partners great Dominic now needs to also give Ben access to the presentations chat makes it really simple Dominic simply paste the link of the presentation and confirms that he would like to give automatic access to everyone in the room including guest users this way G's weed helps you to cencon what you share with your partners outside right while Ben is polishing the deck we go back and check Dominic's email at the top of his email there's a note from max about the presentations let's see what's it about as you can see and this is not a regular email this is a dynamic email reflecting a common threat from slides dynamic email lets you respond to a comment within the app that you're currently in inside with our emails so let's see how this works from both Max's and Dominic's perspective Tommy can go ahead and respond seems like everything looks great on the number so Dominic can go ahead and respond max will see that on the screen in real time Dominic can also now go ahead and resolve the comment in his email and it will hide the comment thread directly on on the on Max's screen unified experiences like this allows you to save times it allows you to act quickly without ever leaving the tools yeren now is also a good time for max and dominic to quickly review the flow of the presentation they would normally need to schedule a call and switch to a conferencing tool or dial into a bridge this can take longer than the actual call itself let's be clear about that but next year Gmail will enable you to jump on quick calls without scheduling so max is available now and we're calling him using the meet experience in Gmail just like that Dominic and Max are in a call without ever leaving Gmail G speed removes all the friction of scheduling calls in a meeting so you cannot just focus on doing great work looks like they're ready to go for the presentation so as you saw G Suite unifies emailing chat calling in one place normal context switching battling noise or distraction that you would get with legacy tools geez sweet cheesy experience brings it closer to your team's it brings them together and it helps them to get more done really faster and with that I hand it back to David thanks for reggae Dominic now that we've shown you how this works in the product today I like to share some new things we've been building to help people work together and faster in smarter ways many of us spend a lot of time writing at work whether it's composing emails composing documents which is why we continue to build intelligent features to make it easier to write high quality content faster in G suite for example we introduced grammar Corrections in Docs earlier this year and we now service over 100 million intelligent grammar suggestions each week will soon start powering these suggestions with cutting-edge neural network technology to help users catch even more grammatical errors last year we also introduced smart compose in Gmail which uses Google ai to suggest complete sentences making it faster and easier to write error free since then smart compose in Gmail has saved people from typing over 2 billion characters each week now today I'm excited to share that we're bringing the power of smart compose to Docs as you heard in yesterday's keynotes it not only makes writing faster but it improves quality by removing spelling grammatical errors and helping you complete legible sentences from a raw thought it's like having a personal writing assistant and you get decide when to listen to it smart compose and Docs is available in beta today we're also exploring ways that assistive features in a I can remove friction from everyday tasks to help teams get more done and we've been working on bringing the Google assistant to G suite I'm excited to share several new capabilities today which are now in beta first you'll be able to use Google assistant to see what's on your d3 calendar you'll also be able to create cancel and reschedule meetings send quick email messages and dial into meetings the Google assistant is especially powerful in hands-free context like when you're on the go commuting to and from work now I'd like to invite one of our product lead Jennifer up on stage to show you a live demo of this in action [Music] GC and the Google assistant help me get more done throughout the day with these today I left work a little bit early to get to a doctor's appointment but I still have a few things to wrap up for work luckily I have the Google assistant with me to help me get that done I think I have one last call to help the team prep for a big upcoming project hey Google what's next on my calendar next up you have project next week sync today at 4 p.m. dial into it calling into the meeting project next leads sync and just like that I was able to call into my meeting right from my commute but before closing out for the day I want to make sure my calendar is good to go for tomorrow my calendar is always shifting around but the Google assistant can help me stay on top of it hands-free so that I can stay focused on driving what's on my calendar tomorrow there are five entries for tomorrow first up tomorrow you have weekly team check-in at 8 a.m. here's the rest darn I need to drive my kids to school tomorrow I'm gonna have to move this 8 a.m. meeting send an email to my first meeting tomorrow email 2 projects next week sync sure what's the message sorry team I need to reschedule this I got sorry Tim I need to reschedule this closet will be sent from your account Jennifer at Inc - 42 comm do you want to send it or change it send it sending your email to project next lead I love that it can quickly message everyone right in the moment without needing to remember to do this later when I'm not driving but beyond is telling everybody about the change how about we actually reschedule this meeting the Google assistant can help me do that we're gonna put my colleague Adams calendar on the screen as well so you can get a feel for what he sees reschedule my weekly team meeting that's update weekly team check-in currently at 8:00 a.m. right right sure weekly team check-in everybody is available tomorrow at 10 a.m. does that work yes okay I'll reschedule the event for tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. do you want to send an update to guess yes please okay I rescheduled it and sent an update the Google assistant was able to find a time that works for me and everybody else on the meeting and you can see that it moved from 8:00 to 10:00 on Adam and everybody else's calendar I've tied up all my sluice ends for the day and I'm ready for to go for tomorrow with the help of my Google assistant now I can disconnect for the evening geez sweet and the Google assistant work together to help me get more done throughout the day so that I can focus on the things that really matter both at work and at home thank you back to David thanks Jennifer that's pretty magical right I can't wait for you all get to use it you can now download this today as a part of the beta as you've heard and seen today geez we can help your team's work faster smarter and more collaboratively many of you are thinking about how you can future-proof your enterprise I'd encourage you to give your employees access to the best productivity tools to stay ahead digital transformation starts with real change and I hope you'll join us on this journey if you're interested in learning more come see our G suite spotlight session this afternoon where you'll hear from PwC on their move to G suite and you'll see some of our other product innovations we're working on next I'd like to welcome John gesture to the stage to talk about our customer experience investments thank you thank you David I'm John jester and I'm delighted to have a few minutes to talk to you about customer experience it's great to be in London I lived here 2010 to 2014 so it's been great seeing familiar faces catching up with many of you but I've just hit the six-month mark at Google cloud after almost 20 years at Microsoft and I've spent my time getting out meeting many of you trying to talk to our customers and understand your expectations from Google cloud how can we help you what do you need to make the bet on Google as your strategic partner and there's been a couple consistent themes that have emerged the first is you're excited about our innovative technology everything from what we can do on big data analytics machine learning in AI to help you really unlock the value of the data you have in your business to our innovative multi cloud solution with anthos where we can help you in hybrid scenarios running on prem in your data center as well as a google cloud but even taking that to multiple clouds and while you're excited about that innovation you're excited about that technology you've been very very clear with me that we have to do better when it comes to giving you prescriptive and proactive guidance on how to use our solutions that we have to give you the right levels of enterprise support when you make the bet on Google and it's clear to me that we have to invest more in customer experience and we have to invest more in your success and that's what I'd like to take you through are these investments what are we doing to help make you successful on Google cloud the first area of focus is really around professional services these are our consultants that we send on-site with you to help you build applications move workloads to the cloud we're investing in helping them scale the implementation of horizontal and vertical solutions that you've heard about the past few days we also have customers saying we want a bet on Google is our digital transformation partner and we have a different expectation for the type of engagement we have in that scenario so we're investing in a digital transformation practice to help you now that's always being done with our partners you've heard about some of the partnerships we've announced that's a critical part of how Google works with you the second pillar is really about support and there's three things that everyone has pushed me on when it comes to supporting you the first is that we need to have the right enterprise support offers so we're bringing a new set of offers to market in January you're gonna see mission critical capabilities included and you're gonna see a lot of proactive services an example of that is Black Friday Cyber Monday we have over 35 retailers running on Google cloud who were working with us in a very proactive way we're reviewing their architecture ahead of the event we're doing performance testing and we're even doing mock scenarios well we'll work through hey if there's a cloud outage or an application goes down at cetera how do we partner and work together but that's an example of the investments we're making to really be an enterprise partner for you on the support side the second thing that's come up consistently is you want to talk to an expert on your problem as quickly as possible so we're deeply specializing our support engineers nine different specializations so if you're trying to unlock value from your data you'll talk to an expert on analytics on machine learning or AI if you're trying to understand how to configure your security options you'll talk to a security expert right away so deep specialization to help you when you need it then the third component here is setting up global support centers so that we have those engineers in your time zone speaking the right language to help you now the third pillar is training and certifications one of the big barriers that I see with cloud adoption is not having enough trained staff inside of our customers so we're investing a lot in training be that instructor-led online training or even more importantly building interactive labs where your teams can get the hands-on experience before you're moving into production on our tools and technology we then back that up with the set of certifications eight different certifications on google cloud so you can validate the knowledge level of your teams now the fourth pillar is really around customer success how do we work with you to orchestrate your journey to the cloud and at Google when we talk about customer success we're not just talking about technology adoption what we're talking about is understanding your priorities understanding why you chose Google what are the business outcomes that you're trying to achieve and we want to share those with you and we want to define Google's success not as just what products or services you use but are you successful achieving your business outcome that's our definition of customer success now the fifth pillar is really around customer and partner experience how do we do a better job of listening to you our customers our partners in really creating a customer centric Google cloud across everything we do from how we develop products to how we engage with you to how we provide support this part is incredibly important as we evolve our business we also have a set of customer advisory boards role based CIOs CISOs as well as around our solutions in all of these boards it's all about deep deeply listening to you and making sure that we're investing in the right place I also want to invite all of you to come to our customer engagement centers these are centers that we have where we can sit down understand your priorities share the Google cloud roadmap and really find projects that we can engage together and work on so what you see across these five pillars is that we are committed to you and we're investing in your success so we're tripling the size of our customer-facing organization over the coming years that's not just our sales force but its customer experience so that we're there to serve you and to make you successful and I want you to know that when you choose Google Cloud you have my commitment you have my team's commitment that we're gonna be there to make you successful so with that thanks again for the time and please join me in welcoming Alan back to the stage Alan [Music] that's John so helping our customers be successful is something that we as Googlers are absolutely passionate about now I'm conscious we've shared a lot this morning hopefully hopefully you're as excited as we are about many too many of the great announcements we've made over the last couple of days around our product our product innovations literally at all layers of the Google cloud stack and hopefully you've we've also got some ideas sparking about you know new possibilities for for your business or your industry and and that you see Google as super relevant no matter where you're at in your transformation journey so look thank you very much for joining us today please immerse yourself in the sessions that follow thanks also to our partners and our our sponsors for putting your trust and all indeed all of you as customers for putting your trust in in Google cloud now there are many Googlers around hopefully with some voices left so please come to us come to us with your ideas we'd love to we'd love to hear from you okay have a great day thank you [Applause] [Music] you
