 hi everyone my name is Phil Anderson I'm one of the offering managers the Watson discovery service today I'm going to show you how you can use AI to get answers out of large of the structured documents in only about five minutes so what is Watson discovery service it is the insight engine of the Watson platform I was built specifically for this task of taking large on structured documents and returning not just the document itself with a snippet like you might see in Google but an actual answer so when we talk about unstructured documents usually we mean are things like this this is a product manual from one of the many IBM products out there it's hundreds and hundreds of pages well-written has a huge amount of valuable information that you can find in here but it's hundreds of pages and what you typically see from a search solution is it would you know if you were searching for an answer that might live in this document you'd get something like Google in the best case a link to the document would show up with a snippet that might be a clue it's the right idea but then you'd send this document and you'd you know do my favorite search technique ctrl F you're like God geez how you reinstall and you're searching you're searching and I'm gonna have taken you you know one minute to find the document in the best case but then you're going to spend ten or twenty minutes looking inside this document for they actually in 3d it's a huge waste of time we think we can do better than that today so I'm going to show you two ways that you can get answers out of this document so first of all I'm gonna take you to Watson assistance so Watson assistant is the chat bot of Watson platform so you know if you haven't you familiar with lots of assistant you can use it to return answers to common questions like say how did I how do I reset my password you can you know it's really intelligent understanding the intent of the questions and then returning the answers but you can never really program it for every single possible question someone could answer and especially if you have all this knowledge of lives and knowledge base articles you know why why would you want to do that right it's not scalable so Watson assistant just launched a new feature in beta which is called the search skill and what this search skill does is it actually connects to Watson discovery and automatically wire is these two together such that if it doesn't know the answer to a dialogue pass it off to the search skill so let me show you what that looks like today so I'm just gonna test name here and then it's gonna automatically list all of your discovery instances I have hundreds you probably only have one or two but I'm gonna pick one of my hundreds here and again it's automatically gonna connect to it just give it a second here and then it shows you all your collections so what I've done is I've actually uploaded the document I just showed you into this collection you can see there's a single document here and I'm going to search for that collection alright so what you're about to see is pretty much what you'd get if you did what we call this long-tailed pattern from any other search engine you could set it to return text so it's gonna return kind of a search result so I'm gonna hit try it and you can see I can ask the spot a question like how do you reinstall Watson Explorer which is what the product manual is so you ask the question and again there's one document in the index so returns one answer and it's a snippet from somewhere in that document you can probably provide a link to the document and it's really not helpful at all and again this is what almost every other search product out there would do and you know something make all this useful I don't think it's super useful I think we can do better than that so what you know let's bring in the new feature from Watson discovery called smart document understanding so again I've uploaded this document here and it's done what you've seen for every search engine do for as old as time it converts all the text to just one you know flat text structure and it loses all the meaning that it has that formatting had in there sure we've done some NLP and that's really cool we've done some sentiment analysis and idea extraction but let's actually train discovery on the structure of this data let's let's bring back some of that structure that was lost so the center face here is what we call smart document understanding it has the original document on the left and it has what we've detected on the right and when I say detected the way this works is it actually uses visual imaging technologies so it acts like a human does and it looks at the text here and it can even OCR so you can see it's gotten the kind of I'll show you how it looks it's kind of overlaps the text here and then it's also OCR even the IBM logo and you can see this is kind of like paint-by-numbers things that are yellow here relate to the text field here and everything is pretty much text we just go to another random page here you can see it's kind of everything is text now again the way this works is is totally visual so I may not even understand this language let's say this is Chinese or Martian or something like that but I the visual cues tell me that this text kind of belongs to this section here and so that's what we can do so let's start giving this document some structure so what I'm going to do is again paint-by-numbers I'll start calling these subtitles and what I'm also going to do is I'm going to label the footers so that one of the things you can do is you can label things that are noise so flutters table of contents headers so I'm going to give labels to the meaningful things like sections and I'm going to give labels to the things I don't want like footers and I'm going to submit the training very very quickly it's gonna go off into training I'll kind of click there click back and I'm betting it's already gonna have some learning so you can see like this is my training and this is the lower one so it hasn't learned just yet let's train the footer and we'll train another subtitle exit these ones might be a little different which might be why it didn't respond let's train again and then we'll go to a third page and you can see I've only trained two pages now but by the third one it's basically a hundred percent correct it's detecting all the different types of subtitles to different types and it's getting the footer it's just about check another one here yep it's gettin that footer yep so it's trying to look pretty good so the other cool thing is not only can you get the structure of documents some of the structure lives in semi structured forms like this table so what we can use is this table feature here and I'm actually going to label the table itself so I'm gonna say here's the table and then you can start giving me into the table so we can show where the columns are and the reason you're doing this is not all tables even have close the machines can use some tables are defined only by formatting like they have no gridlines things like that you can see as I'm training this Watsons detecting the table and it's showing it on the left-hand side so it's getting those columns of those rows and then you can also train the column headers and you turn the column headers here and you can train the row headers and then I'm gonna train the body text so the rest of it and what this allows me to do is I can now run a query that says you know give me the intersection where the module is Watson Explorer engine and which supported browser is this right and then it can return just this chunk of text from this table it's pretty powerful to be able to ask that kind of question from search and get an answer out of a table so I'll submit that so again why are you doing all this training so I'll just not save my changes there why am i you know extracting labels and fleurs what good does this do well this feeds into the next stage of the pipeline so you kind of think of these tabs is like a pipeline going left to right if I go to manage fields I now have control over those fields so I can say you know what don't index the footers don't index the headers done index the table of contents and that's noise that's no longer gonna be in my index right so I'm not gonna get a bad hit on a document just because it was containing the table of contents just because it was contained to the footer and it's also gonna make the NLP more effective the cuisine Opie's not gonna do it to the extraction from those things and you also this thing called splitting so what splitting does is it allows you to chunk up the document into smaller answers so in this case I trained it on subtitles which are those sections and those seem like kind of reasonable answers I want to return to my user so I'm going to say split by subtitle and then I can apply changes to my collection so I've already done that with another collection literally the same amount of training around three pages and let me show you what that looks like in our same so here's the split one I'll show you what that looks like in Discovery real quick just leave this one here so one of the things you do when you ingest this is you'll notice it has more structure now so it has to field instead of just one I think it also has the footer in there somewhere as well you could say there's 47 docking instead of one and then when I go to try this I'm gonna get some more options actually it's the first time I'm gonna have a new field that I've defined called subtitle which I can use is the title in lots of assistance and I use the text as before you can see this is already and I look a little better here and you know I will say the file name is the Euro or something like that let's try it out we'll ask the same question exact same question exact same document how to reinstall lots of Explorer and you can see now I actually get the exact answer I get literally the answer I wanted from the section I wanted without even having to click into the document so this is saved you click save you many minutes all those minutes add up and it was super easy you saw I did absolutely no coding I didn't have to know anything about AI or programming and I was able to train the system to return the right answer now there's some other answers here that this one you know you could argue this is more or less useful you can also use Discovery's relevancy training interface to be able to give it examples of which ones are good which ones are bad and it's going to improve over time so this is a really cool piece of technology and we've already got some customers using in production if you got any questions feel free to shoot us an email and thanks for trying out
