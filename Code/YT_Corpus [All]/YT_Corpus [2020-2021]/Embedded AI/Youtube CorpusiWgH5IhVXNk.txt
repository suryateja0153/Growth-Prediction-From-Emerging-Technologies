 and then one day the world changed it said you want to see scary I'll show you scary and like that it took away the thing we love most the thing we need most being together business is closed hospitals were overwhelmed the world seemed to stop it asked for heroes nurses and doctors and paramedics but as they fought on one front another appeared as insidious as the virus itself testing and paperwork and supply chain issues creating barriers between the healthcare worker and the patient help us they said help us do our job because nowhere in a medical earth does it say anything about paperwork so they sent in reinforcements and they called it robotic process automation to clear a hundred and sixty day registration backlog in a single day to provide more accurate test results in one-third the time to reduce the screening time of health care workers to four hours from five days to cut the processing time of an application from 45 minutes to five minutes to accelerate the distribution of loans to help keep businesses alive this isn't just about the corona virus it's about helping to solve the greatest challenges in medicine business life faster more efficiently think about what's possible if we eliminate drudgery time wasted repetitive tasks this is where hope meets technology so that we can all go back to doing the greatest thing the most valuable thing the thing that says we're not afraid anymore bringing the world back together [Music]
