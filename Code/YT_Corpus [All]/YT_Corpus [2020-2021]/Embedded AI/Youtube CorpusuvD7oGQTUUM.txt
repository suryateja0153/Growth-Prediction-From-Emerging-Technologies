 (light electronic music) - We all know that AI is definitely the large new trend in technology. But the interesting thing is in particular, computer vision, and computer vision actually on the edge, is going to be an enormous new wave that will unleash a huge amount of new enterprise applications and value for end users. So what is the edge? The edge is sometimes called the internet of things. Really it's units, it's things that are out there in the world, like cameras, like drones. Anything with a sensor that can be taught to see and learn and act. This is applying deep learning to edge devices. And this is exactly what alwaysAI is focused on enabling. alwaysAI is founded by enterprise developers that really understand what that world needs to make something effective and make it easy. We start with a set of pre-trained computer vision models that a developer can easily select. Then we allow them to download our middleware, which is really a virtual machine that enables them to develop and deploy computer vision applications. They use a set of APIs that we've developed that are very easy to use. The developer does not need to be an expert in computer vision. And literally within an hour, they can deploy core computer vision services. Like object detection, object tracking, object classification, out to an embedded device. So if you're a developer and you're already working on a computer vision project, or you just wanna learn more about computer vision, we'd love you to be involved and come along this journey with alwaysAI. And to stay involved and learn about what we're doing and the solutions that we're bringing, and the customers and partners that we're working with. We think that you'll love it, and we look forward to working with you in this exciting new world of computer vision on the edge. (light electronic music)
