 Hello Friends Welcome Back Welcome to the new members Today I am going to discuss something about career in Embedded System  Although I discussed it earlier as well But some students wanted it again with respect to the latest development in the technology So let me try to attempt it So as per my understanding Embedded career is the entry gate to anything which makes a machine intelligent using electronic  Embedded system is a combination of hardware & software for a particular application If one can understand the concept of Embedded system It will be not difficult for that person to understand CPU based general purpose platform i.e. PC so here I mean understanding of embedded system upto the level where person understand various high level interfaces PCI interface, SerDes , DDR , Cache those kind of things , then it can go upto the level of PC so Embedded systems are being used in our daily life for many years Lets look into that Do you remember when you started hearing word Automatic Automatic gear in car semi or fully automatic machine washing machine Automated Teller Machine that is called ATM machine we use Automatic Toll system etc. so who was doing that manual job here Embedded System. If you go to ATM machine who is doing that manual job of the bank clerk here Embedded System Now Few years back , Another term was coined Smart This initiated another set of embedded system applications smart energy meter smart watch smart cricket bat smart key chain smart board smart TV and a long list So here Embedded system converted normal thing to smart Further with the availability of internet everywhere at lower cost IoT came into the picture But before I discuss that lets look into another domain of Embedded system i.e. Automotive so the main functionality such as engine control , meter, chasis , safety, airbag, car audio, car body etc are based on ECU and there may be more than 100 ECUs in a luxury car while in normal a handful of them . Here ECU stands for Electronic Control Unit which is again an embedded system to control subsystem in a car so in a single car there may be multiple MCUs  Body cluster Car infotainment  And eith the availability of internet IoT converting building, neighborhood , city and in fact whole world to smart so one of the critical requirement of IoT based system is security of data so this led to the concept of secure boot and the need of framework for integrating cloud services with IoT enabled network in a secure way Application programmers need to just use API for accessing the services There where people use Python script to enable , you know, enable some services with that framework And with the increase trend of open source software , reduction of memory , silicon devices It is possible to build embedded syste with RTOS or any other OS at reasonable cost for ex Raspberry PI And the moment OS is supported for any system hardware management goes to OS itself And user application just use system to access it But for small application for ex you can use MCU even for , you know , simple Airconditioner control unit or HVAC kind of stuff And where a MCU simply you know detect or decode the signal from remote and work in different modes sleep node and keep track of different temperature ranges, different programs , those kind of things so there you don't need OS you have to , you know, monolithic program there and take care of complete hardware stuff so the future of IoT is Artificial Intelligence so embedded system folks can easily adopt AI system machine and that will be also so AI basically simulates human brain so what is AI It simulates the human brain In that similar to human being AI system has to learn from the data received, training received, apply its knowledge or algorithm for model training and predict the outcome correct or upgrade the knowledgebase You may take analogy If you learn car so the trainer will provide initial rules and all that you apply those rules during training And under trainer control there he helps you to rectify your mistake so once you are a trained driver then further , going further you have to use learning yourself based on your experience based on your driving experience you will learn certain things so similar things happen in the AI so this is different from earlier automatic system where you put a state machine in that microcontroller and it follows that state machine This is different from there , Here there is a scope for learning further and rectifying , you know, some updating rectifying the mistake and updating the knowledgebase But here AI also depends on your sensors, camera or other, you know kind of stuff Audio recognition so that is being taken care by embedded again who will provide data to a machine learning system if it is a deep data analysis over who will provide data to that system It will be the IoT end node Again the embedded professional will be required there  so You may ask Future is with computer vision , machine learning why should I learn embedded ? I do agree . The next generation is for computer vision, ML, AI, deep data etc But if you are an electronics engineer you may make a balance between these two Lets see the role of Embedded here you do try face detection with opencv that is the computer vison open source using Raspberry PI board you may create a complete product But what you will do if your competitor introduce a customize low cost product with same feature you must have knowledge to build a customize system There you need Embedded engineer who can work on low level driver, boar design bringup and integrate camera module or other sensors Similarly one can use micropython with openMV that is the machine vision board for simple , you know, vision specific things such as color tracking those kind of stuff What are the other embedded applications     But where is the job for embedded system in India There is no doubt that it needs time to get a job in embedded domain so it is basically individual choice  Everyone try for IIT , Many students try for GATE  and few go further for IAS exam  but how many get selected ? still they do that  so if someone has good academic background and try for embedded career It should not be that difficult of the level of IIT, GATE or IAS so there are options for average students as well but no one can't guarantee for job  If you are looking for Embedded system jobs just go to at the end of this article in www.embedkari.com   Career portal go to website embedkari.com and there you will find this particular article  click on career@
