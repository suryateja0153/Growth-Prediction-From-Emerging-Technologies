 Here we show the model of an Industry 4.0 production plant with integrated condition monitoring. We have a carrier here on which the product is assembled accordingly. Here we have an integrated temperature sensor that can transmit its information directly to our embedded edge computing system via Narrow Band IoT. There, the data is processed accordingly. We can visualize the data via tablet and, if necessary, we can communicate directly with the control system of the plant via the OPC UA communication standard to navigate production, so to speak. We support several use cases. On the one hand, that is condition monitoring and predictive maintenance. But we can also control the logistics in production, e.g. the number of screws, how tightly they must be tightened with a torque wrench and we can document this accordingly. The special feature of this system is the Narrow Band IoT system, the communication standard within a 5G Campus network. This is a separate industrial network in an industrial property. And our highly energy-efficient Energy Edge Computing System, which allows us to process the data site, so to speak, and also gives us direct access to the production control.
