 [Music] hello everyone my name is Jason Mays I'm a developer advocate we've been the tensorflow team here at Google and today I've got Meghna with me from the tensorflow lights micro team to talk about more about what they've produced in the recent past so what if he made and what is tensed for lights yeah thanks for the introduction our Magna and I work on the tensile floor light for microcontrollers team at Google so my team basically has built a platform that helps you to run machine learning models on the edge so that what that implies is you can run build machine learning models using let's say tensile flow and these are optimized to run on really tiny tiny devices like a spark phone edge that we have here or an Arduino and so on and other platforms that we support so what are the advantages of TF micro yeah so there are a lot of advantages one being that it's super tiny and lightweight so that it can be a part of a lot of other appliances for doing machine learning so it could be like a refrigerator or a washing machine in its countless very flexible yes and the second thing is that it needs no network connectivity so it runs without any Wi-Fi or any internet and the that's because the model is completely running on device and that's great if you do remote location like a field or something like this yes so it has great applications there the third one is the fact that it's completely secure so a lot of security concerns with like machine learning models being used for various other applications are and in this way you can assure that the model is completely running on device and the data is not being transmitted anywhere else so can we see a demo in action yeah so as you can see here the rightmost LED is orange in color which implies that it's detecting that it's not a person yeah and as I move it towards you the LED would dawn yellow so the one on the left of it has just only yellow which implies that is detected that you're a person awesome great demo so how can people get started with this if they want to at home yeah we do have a github page and a website that you can check out so it stands for light for microcontrollers yeah that should be a great place to get started also thank you very much for the information today and happy hacking today's at home everyone we're back with Pete worden from V tensorflow like micro team and we've got a super magical demo for you today so tell us more P what is this so this is a magic wand believe it or not excellence and if you want to see what it does I'm gonna try and demonstrate here by doing a W gesture and we should see that reflected on the screen and there we go look at that a beautiful W on the screen and then we try a slope uh-huh and sure enough we got V the slope coming up as well perfect awesome cool so if this is a really awesome demo but how do you actually create it well you might be able to tell by the office and craftsmanship here that they actually used some masking tape to attach this nano 33 ble cents board from Arduino and it actually contains a tiny accelerometer which is how it's actually able to recognize the Jesse very cool and how much do these go for this is about $30 ok so fairly low cost of entry fairly low cost and you'd actually don't need a magic wand you can use a stick anything is yes it's a perfect awesome so how can we get started if you want to do this at home so the nice thing is we've been able to work with the Arduino community and get tensorflow light as an official library in the arduino ide so you can just go to the manage libraries entry and little menu and get tense flow light for yourself so it's pretty much just plug and play then exactly thank you very much people [Music]
