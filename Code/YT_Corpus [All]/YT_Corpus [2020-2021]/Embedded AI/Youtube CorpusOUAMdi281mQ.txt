 i'm going to talk a little bit about how i see financial technology in a stack we did a little bit of this in our last two classes but just really thinking about the finance technology stack and then turned back into ai and machine learning in finance we reviewed this a bit in the last class but i just want to go back to it and and talk a little bit more about it a little bit more granular uh this time around and then uh take the bulk of the class around public policy frameworks and how ai fits into that artificial intelligence machine learning chatbots and the like so that's sort of the run a show and romaine if you let me know when we have either 15 or 10 minutes to go because i don't have a clock here on this zoom um so the three readings really uh sort of built upon last classes readings um and but they had a little bit of a tone towards the regulatory side and oliver wyman and uh the mayor braille mayor brown is a law firm allen wyman thinks about risk management and consultant risk um but each were with a little bit of a gloss on how to manage if you're at a board level and and uh the oliver wyman really went through the lines of business how machine learning and artificial intelligence is being used and the mayor brown went through sort of the laws and we'll come back to that but that's why i sort of i sort of reached out and had that now the the short one or two pager from julie stack from the federal reserve i thought it was just interesting to say all right here's here's a senior and julie's very well respected in the community a senior career person at the u.s federal reserve writing about fintech what are they thinking and just like i did earlier and we shared sometimes what is the official sector thinking as we shared the share of the fdic's speech earlier and i will throughout this semester i think it's helpful if you're thinking about this to sometimes think all right what's the official sector saying in their speeches and so forth um but that was kind of why i put those readings out there i'm looking at romaine to see if there's anything but um probably not yet um and then uh the study questions this is where it gets a little bit more fun and i see if we can get a little engagement and again we spoke a great deal about this um uh already but if anybody just really quickly want to give an articulation of of this question why are these new forms of ai enabled data analytics pattern recognition speech recognition so forth how do they fit into the other trends as you see it as we've talked about in financial technology luke this is your fun time to either call on people uh as they volunteered or otherwise but we've discussed this i'm just trying to get it a little going here we can start with luke so the commonality among the industries um so agnostic agnostically is the fact that all the companies who can deploy this ai to their operation system is to save money save costs so that the bottom line is better and so one thing that luke's raising is saving costs uh others want to sort of chime in um and and and i'm kind of also curious as others chime in how you see it fitting in with other emerging trends uh we had the trends that we've already lived through uh but we're building upon like the internet and mobile and cloud we have some other trends that we'll get to in future classes like open api just kind of curious to see if if somebody wants to take a crack at connecting the this piece of the technology with some of these other trends lighter yeah i think what we discussed extensively in the last lecture was um the um erica being one of uh really good examples of how the new forms of ais emerging with what's already existing and making it not just cheaper for the firms to answer mundane questions that customers have but also making it more user-friendly so i think in terms of erica just a great example to show how this exam how this question kind of flows through all right so so a lot is just racing there's there and sometimes i just break these down simplistically in the in the artificial intelligence world there's the consumer customer interface erica back america is an example and chat bots and and the various ways we communicate with customers tying into customers builds on uh uh what technology what what is it that you use and might even be using right now when you're watching this uh course eric you also had your hand up uh i was going to talk about something else i was going to say that i don't know i'll tie them all together don't worry i'll i'll answer my questions too i'm sure i was saying that ai is being used uh by fintechs to for better underwriting purposes like using alternative data to you know better assess people's credits absolutely so it's the data analytics it's the customer interface the data analytics of predictive underwriting whether it's in insurance whether it's in lending predictive underwriting it's also on the customer side where we use natural language processing and we interface with the customers um remain why don't we take one or two more i'm looking for somebody wants to tie it to the other technological trends that we see so let's go with nikhil and then with way all right and then we'll move on um i think uh the alignment reading talks about how companies that have uh been using ai and machine learning have done better i think it was asset management was a specific example they took i think it also ties to um like another class i'm taking with simon johnson on ai talks about david otter's report that says there's a superstar effect where firms that have access to this data and are using ai like tend to perform better in the market and i think that's that's a significant sign and it's probably even more accentuated in infant type specifically so let's just pause for a second it's data data what we've had is this remarkable advancement in data analytic tools artificial intelligence but we've also had a remarkable advancement of the ability to store and process data through the cloud and just through the emergence of much faster computers and much uh more connected communications so that data piece the artificial intelligence and machine learning trend might not have been able to do as well if it weren't for everything that's going on broadly speaking whether it's in cloud or computing and remain the last person that was yep so um i also want to maybe make a mention that and also help with a lot of times either collecting the analytics or cleaning the data analytic analytics because a lot of time that um you know um in the old world um there's a lot of data you potentially collect or first of all it can help to better collect unstructured data and the second round that it helps to clean a lot of data you collected so uh absolutely agreed and and often it's 80 sometimes 90 percent more of a computer science group is in the cleaning up of data and standardizing data and and we'll come back to this but a lot of fintech disruptors a lot of startups have actually created value more around data than anything else and i will say not just about data but standardizing data and later in this class we're going to talk about plaid and credit karma both of which were earlier this year acquired plaid by visa credit karma by intuit uh for five to seven billion dollars big big acquisitions uh and we're going to talk about how what was the value proposition for visa into it why were they paying five or seven billion dollars a lot of it not all of it but a lot of it relates to data but also having standardized that uh that data particularly in the case of plaque how it's affecting the competitive landscape we've talked a great deal hopefully this will continue to be a theme throughout the semester about big incumbents big tech and fintech startups i will contend in this and throughout this course that ai and machine learning is now moving into the technology stack if we think of the stack as layers of technology that incumbents incorporate and frankly will not survive if they don't incorporate that ai machine learning is being incorporated quickly into the financial incumbent technology stack we're not fully there yet um and and that the competitive landscape is such that the fintech startups and disruptors have been able to find cracks in the old business models and using machine learning they've been able to break in and we'll talk a bit about that the big tech firms of course we've already talked about that they are really about networks networks that they then layer more activities upon and there's more activities bring them more data and then we're going to we're going to talk a fair amount about public policy but anybody who sort of dug into the mayor brown uh reading want to just give it you know two or three thoughts on the broad what what are the i i'll later call them the the big three but what what what um it's almost written right in the question for you but romaine you want to call anybody michael yeah so the reading kind of did touch upon bias a lot it's potential i guess just on natural factors that i guess a machine learning algorithm would kind of trace so one of the things about art machine learning and deep learning is that it's remarkably successful in extracting correlations correlations from data sometimes that we didn't see before that didn't come just from a linear uh some a linear relationship a linear relationship that we might be able to identify just in classical statistics but in those remarkable abilities to extract correlations you might see biases if the data itself has a bias in it that's people of certain gender certain race certain ethnic backgrounds certain geographies are more likely to uh in the data's mine in the data's mine are more likely to have lower income and in the data might have more likely to be a lower credit uh quality then you might be you might be embedding certain biases in inside the data and many nations around the globe not just the us have said to uh the credit card companies and the other financial firms that you shouldn't have biases around race gender ethnic background geographies sometimes in the like so one is biases when i consider like the three big uh buckets here anybody wanna uh just talk about the other two romaine alessia hi i think we talked this last class i think um ai derives conclusions or correlations without explaining the why so humans cannot understand why some guy has a better quality rating than other and that's has an issue with the law basically yeah and why why why as societies have we embedded in laws and we'll talk about this but if you have a point of view why is societies have we embedded in laws that you need to be able to explain the why when you deny somebody credit or deny somebody a financial product we did this in the united states 50 years ago in something called the the fair credit reporting act um data analytics was was a big wave in the 1960s believe it or not when credit cards were invented in the 1940s and 50s by the 1960s data analytics were going and the fair isaac company which became fico had started and we embedded in law that you you had to answer this question explain why you denied credit but why do you think we we embed that in country after country in our laws daniele so i think it's um to prevent going back to the bias question to prevent bias in the people who are extending credit uh i i think you're right i don't think it's the only reason but i think it's a dominant reason we also in the u.s pass something called the equal credit opportunity act or what generally goes by the terms e co-op but those two laws and another law in the u.s truth and lending act for transparency were kind of this bedrock out of the 1960s data analytic credit card boom by the early 70s we had those three sort of anti-bias fairness you might say explainability these are two bedrocks in finance uh in europe in the u.s country after country what's the third challenge uh that comes up with data analytics or ai that often uh we uh we find ourselves and if you're if you're starting a fintech startup you you'd have to be aware of remain any hands not yet we have luke again we're gonna pass on luke unless somebody else we have danielle again yeah all right uh either one whoever's got their mic off um so privacy is the last one sure um for example companies have demonstrated the ability to predict when consumers have certain health conditions or you know take pregnancy for example um there's a really famous case where a company knew that a consumer was pregnant based on how their shopping patterns changed and there are reasons we've precluded um employers or credit uh extenders from asking about certain parts of people's lives but we may be unexpectedly exposing parts of those lives if we're capturing data using it so this trade-off of privacy versus uh financial services though it's not as old as sort of the fairness and the explainability which is the us and then later in other countries was embedded and many lost 30 to 50 years ago privacy has picked up a little bit more of a stream by the late 1990s in the u.s there was modest financial privacy protections that were embedded in a law in 1999 i actually helped work on that with with uh then congressman ed markey now senator at market massachusetts um but but in europe they went quite a bit further in something called the general uh the gdpr which we'll talk about a little later but the general directive uh it doesn't p doesn't stand for privacy but uh uh i think it's protection uh regulation um so those three buckets those three buckets are the important ones so again ai machine learning fits into these other trends that we think about and i'm going to walk through that in this class of cloud and internet mobile and data fintech startups big tech and incumbents i believe are all embedding it in their technology stack and you're really challenged if you don't and then the big three challenges in public policy explainability bias and privacy there are other challenges as well but those are the big three in a sense so what do i mean by technology stack well i think that three things are already embedded the internet mobile and the cloud if this class were being taught at mit in the 1980s none of them would be there and by the 1990s we would have said wow that internet that that's the word fintech didn't really come about in the 1990s but if we had applied it to the 1990s with the internet was dramatically changing mobile into the naughts and the cloud and so forth i would contend you cannot really survive in the finance space giving customers what they need whether it's in the wholesale markets of capital markets and payments or in the retail markets if you haven't yet embedded this in your your technology stack now i will note that many large financial companies are slow to use the cloud the largest amongst them tend to want to still have their own data centers i think you're going to see that shift dramatically in the 2020s but i'm certainly telling you that if you start us start off you cannot survive if you're trying to do your own data center that you're going to already embed these in your what i'll call financial staff the internet for connectivity mobile in a sense for ubiquity meaning that folks can be out there cloud you're sort of renting somebody else's storage and often their software but then the things that we're talking about in this time in the 2020s that are being embedded into the classic standard companies stack is ai machine learning and natural language processing and what we'll talk about in the next class a lot about open api now we're in a transition mode not every company has really embedded it in their stack and these are where the opportunities really existed in the last dozen years in fintech fintech startups that were savvy enough to brill build this into their product offerings faster than the incumbents or better yet in a more refined targeted way and we'll talk a fair amount that now of course there's other things in the stack and i'm this is not what this class is even money itself in accounting and ledgers and joint stock companies we're all in a sense we just take them completely for granted by the time you're in a master's program in mit masters finance or mba or other graduate program you're quite familiar and you almost just take these for granted but i can assure you at earlier decades they couldn't be taken for granted and some of them like securitization and derivatives will dramatically shift your ability if you're doing a startup to compete i see some things in the chat remain are there questions all right oh good gary all right and then the question i sort of still have and i've i've i've teach this quite a bit at mit is blockchain technology will that move into the stack i would contend it's not really yet there you can be an incumbent you can be a big finance uh firm a big tech or a startup and say i'm not going to compete right there i'm not quite sure though again we look at facebook we look at telegram big tech companies messaging companies in korea who are sort of pulling in um uh some some blockchain technology and looking at it we see trade finance consortiums and we'll talk more about this next week but i would say that you you will not survive if you're not bringing machine learning into your technology stack you probably won't survive that long if you don't really have a strategy around open api and data remain i pause a little bit we talked last session about artificial intelligence and machine learning we're not going to dive back in i'm just going to open it if there's any questions about what we talked about that of course machine learning is just a part of artificial intelligence you narrow it down to deep learning fundamentally as a business school i'm not asking each of you to be able to program or with tensorflow and run a tensorflow project even though many of you know how to um i'm sort of just saying to think about from a business side it's about extracting from data cleaning up that data standardizing that data and often labeling it labeling it because you can learn faster that's called structured learning rather than unstructured but labeling that data and then extracting correlations and decision algorithms that come out of it remain any luke has raised his hand again i'm going to pull off a question the other question yeah yeah no question so how can a country that is developing fintech out of not because it was underbanked but rather overbanked but looking for alternative investment so the likes of south korea develop a bunch of coders or those with actually better yet those people who can draw conclusion and draw extract hypothesis and build up you know better ways to build uh nlp and ai how can a government really step in to encourage that and make an ecosystem somebody's got to do something instead unless you're america and have a bunch of good great quarters and great minds and it's a it's a melting pot so you invite a bunch of geniuses in yeah i'm not sure i follow the question when i'm i'm going to take it and then move on i think what you're saying is in a country that is has a very advanced banking system how can a government encourage us i mean you do it through the education system you do it through just as we do in the u.s promoting stem education and programs like at mit i think over time you there's a challenge of how you adjust laws and regulations finance is a highly regulated space in every country we're dealing with trust we're dealing with people's money we're dealing with inherent conflicts of interest that you can't escape in the world of finance and so uh trying to deal with that with regulation but how we adjust with these new tools uh that are in in place um but that would be how i'd answer it so let's go back to what we talked about and just sort of do a little bit more granular i contend at its core that that these technologies machine learning and natural language processing and ai need to be brought into the finance stack in the technology staff and so every type of company whether you're in payments or you're in lending whether you're insurance or not you want to think about how you bring it in whether you're a disruptor or not and so that's why i think about it down the line in each of these fields and not just about disruptors and we and we talked about each of these in the past but uh i paused just again it's a little repetitive just if there's any questions about some of these slices and then remember we're going to be digging quite a bit into this in the next five weeks as well in each of these areas remain i don't see anyone yet all right um but what i've said is all right so ai is a tool and this is really an interesting debate that people can have at mit and i've been in rooms full of five to ten faculty sometimes sometimes one-on-one where we debate is ai a service or is ai at all and i would say that it's an interesting debate most most the time we land on that it's more a tool than a service but every new technology every new new technology comes along whether it was whether it was the telephone whether it was the railroads whether it was airplanes every new technology that comes along has some attributes of being a new industry a new tool the railroad industry for instance and yet many businesses use the railroad to do their shipping ai and machine learning is more sort of like a tool than it is a service but it doesn't mean it's always just a tool i i did some research over the last few days just to list where we could go through any one of these ai is a service here i've listed 10 or 12 companies in finance that are actually doing ai sort of as a service alpha sense was started in 2011 before the whole rage of ai but they were data analytics as a search engine for finance firms to search key terms and keywords in registration statements and other statements that are filed with these various securities regulators around the globe sort of think of it as the google for financial documents well google certainly has moved dramatically into ai space alpha sense did as well there's a number of these in the insurance sector who really are around taking photographs of automobiles at an accident scene and then based upon those automobile photographs or accident data to use machine learning and so cape analytics uh tractable are both firms that are in essence providing services to insurance companies they have not yet is to the best of my knowledge cape analytics retractable decided to have direct consumer interface they're not selling insurance they're selling a software analytics tool to insurance companies and similarly like comply advantage in the any money laundering space or feature space and any fraud they're saying we can we can build something for fraud detection we can build something for this this world of any money laundering compliance we can build the software and we'll put ourselves our product out there for the banking sector to basically uh rent us rather than building their own system and you see others document processing and the like and even zest i ai zest i ai founded in 2009 before this conceptual framework and their big movement but zest ai and credit underwriting software basically providing broadly speaking i'm calling it ai in finance as a service rather than building it right into the stack uh romaine i'm gonna pause uh for a bit if you have any questions please raise the blue little hand as you probably know by now i don't see anything gary and i'd say this that each of these go back to some of the sectors back here so asset management we have sentiment analysis we we have i'm not going to pronounce their their the company's name right but data miner data miner which can actually do market sentiment analysis and if you're a hedge fund you might sort of rent into data minor and and get that sentiment analysis you have several services that are doing fraud detection and regulatory the any money laundering slices credited insurance i picked three that are doing insurance underwriting but if your bank of america at jp morgan you're really or cap one in the credit card business you're going to be embedding this right into your business buy and loads not always not always but by and large you're embedding it right into your business we have a question from gita please hey um gary gita here i work for uh capital one i'm in the credit lending space um you're gonna correct anything i say about cap one please now um one thing that i find really surprising with the regulations is that um if we develop our own ai models regulations uh anybody like when auditing happens they are very specific about explainability interpretability but if you were to use a vendor shape security akamai they don't care too much about explainability i always found surprising why is it that within the realms of bank they're so specific about regulations but when we use a vendor the the extent to which they care is oh you use acma you use shape and that's it gita i'm so glad that you raised this i i i think i i earlier had said in in our introductory class that one of the competitive uh advantages of disruptors is that they have uh certain asymmetries uh incumbents like cap one and if if i might say you were working for cap one which is one of the big seven firms in credit cards it's truly one of the incumbents incumbents tend to need to protect their business models and part of what they're protecting is also the reputational and regulatory risks but the disruptors have a little bit of uh of a different uh perspective they're not generally protecting any in inherent or incumbent business model and yes they're also willing to take more risk with the regulators i'm not saying whether they should or shouldn't i'm just saying this kind of the facts on the ground the disrupters are a little bit more towards the end of basically begging for forgiveness rather than asking for permission if you if you sort of remember how you might have been with your parents or if any of you have children and and incumbents are more into like asking for permission of your at least internal gc your general counsel can we do this can we do that and so i think the vendors in that case the vendors are a little bit more willing to take risk on explainability and the explainability that's inherent in u.s law and the fair credit reporting act and the like and it doesn't mean that it's more illegal for a disruptor to do it than for cap one to do it it's just their business model uh tends to be a little bit more uh accepting of that regulatory compliance risk secondly and i think this is probably a bit of a misreading of the risks but sometimes the the the thought is if the vendor does something it sort of insulates the big firm now my understanding again i'm not a lawyer but my understanding it doesn't really insulate cap one or it doesn't really insulate bank of america if their vendor does something that's blatantly a violation um i i don't think it does but but sometimes there's a bit of that mindset as well does that help yeah yeah and the last thing is without taking too much time just to comment uh one other thing i find very intriguing with vendors is that they often get the data of incumbents like maybe bank of america capital one and they charge us back for that data that's the other thing i find so all right so here this is about how companies can cap can capture data we're going to talk a lot about this one open api just to go to get to the intersection and this is one of the key things to to take from from these series of classes machine learning is nowhere if it doesn't have data data is facilitated by a lot of startups getting access to that which the incumbents already have so around the globe in the in europe in the uk and brazil and canada us australia there is significant effort to promote what's called open api application program interface in essence that is you or i permissioning a company to get my or your data from a incumbent financial firm and so we permissioned somebody to get data in gita's example from cap one then they use that data the startup and then gita saying the cap1 then has to pay a fee to some startup even though the data had initially come from cap one and that's a perfect setup to two examples i just want to talk about i want to talk about two large mergers that were announced in 2020 and the first one is credit carmo now i don't know if we could do by show of hands but but how many how many just raising the blue hands in the in the in the windows how many people if you can go into participant buttons have actually used credit karma that you would consider yourself one of these members and romaine you'll tell me what it looks like we have at least 10 students so far no but if you scroll down so all right so it's not it's not as big a percent as i thought um let me go back all right so credit karma started in 2007. the entrepreneur who started it couldn't get a free credit report so they say why don't i start a credit report platform 13 years later they're able to sell for seven billion dollars so into it now you might not be familiar with intuit they their main products and intuit are tax software turbo tax they also have something called quicken books and i believe it's possible they have a third product they might even have mint um but intuit saw they wanted to buy credit karma that had never gone public credit karma apparently had nearly a billion dollars in revenues last year and yet credit karma is still a free app how is it that something that doesn't charge anything and have a billion dollars in revenue it's that they're commercializing data and remarkably 106 million members 106 million members 8 billion daily 8 billion daily um decisions credit decisions or other analytic decisions uh that they have and so intuit is saying why are they buying credit karma even even at seven times revenue that's a healthy price they're buying it largely around data and data analytics and credit card has figured out how to basically commercialize that flow of data on over 100 million accounts and how do they do that they do it by cross-marketing so they're marketing not just to us but then they're also with many financial firms they're going back and say this this account here this this is a worthy thing so they they make arrangements they enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and then market to us to take a mortgage to take an auto loan to take a personal loan um plaid plaid's an interesting company that we'll talk a lot about uh when we talk about open api this was software that started just seven years ago two developers but it's straight like kind of hardcore computer scientist who had worked went to work for bain and for anybody who's thinking about working for a consulting firm this is not a vote against bain or bcg or others but they basically decided after a year at bain to go out and do their own startup and it was a startup to facilitate financial disruptors or fintech companies accessing data at banks and there was not a standard there was not a standard for this open api so they created at a hackathon at a hackathon that they actually won back i think in 2012 or 2013 they were in their late 20s at the time by the way if you're just trying to figure out seven years later in their mid to late 30s they sell their business for 5.3 billion but it all starts at bain computer scientists creating open api software well what happened over those seven years eleven thousand financial companies signed up to use that standard protocol to do open api and on the other side 2600 fintech developers and if anyone in here has taken michael cosimano's class on platforms this is the classic sweet spot of creating a platform company when you have this two-sided many-to-many market many fintech developers want to access financial data at financial firms many financial firms don't want to deal with thousands of fintech developers and so inside of this many to many market cloud creates a software standard software for that to happen but what do they build on top of that they build data aggregation they announced a 5.3 billion dollar merger to visa there's a lot of people that debate whether it was a good idea because the estimate by forbes is there was only about 110 million dollars of revenue i mean now we're talking we're talking 40 or 50 times revenue but 200 million accounts are linked we'll chat about this more because those 11 000 financial firms could all stop using plaid and go to one of cloud's competitors now that plaid's bought by visa but this gives you the sense of the power of and the value the economic value of data machine learning and the like romaine questions none so far it seems like the class is quiet today all right um so i'm going to talk a little bit about financial policy how's this all fit in in the next half hour um broadly first is just a sense of of i'm trying to get rid of this participant window here for a minute um so broad public policy frameworks have been around for thousands of years since the hammurabi code since roman and greek times sometimes embedded even in religious law that's that's the nature of money but four slip streams and all four will be relevant for fintech as we talk through not just ai but all sectors one is money and lending we we've over centuries often get uh official sector as a point of view sometimes even limiting interest rates in the like two is financial stability we think about a crisis we're living through this corona crisis right now central banks around the globe are with an eye towards promoting the economy also thinking about how to insure for financial stability the reverse of financial stability was happening in 2008 crisis that that crisis where banks were faltering and closing up and then that led to millions of people losing their jobs millions of people losing their homes and the like so financial stability i grab a couple pictures here uh out of the great depression an earlier period of crisis but what we'll talk a lot about is the third and fourth bucket the third bucket of protecting consumers and investors consumer protection we can think of even just in terms of uh ensuring that if we buy a crib for our children that it's safe if we buy a car that it actually is safe on the road so consumer protection rely refers to things much broader than finance investor protection is the concept that yes we can take risk in markets we're all allowed to take risk in markets but that the markets themselves and the issuers the people raising money should explain to us at least the material pieces of information upon which we would take those risks and that the markets themselves have a certain transparency and we protect against fraud and manipulation and the like and then guarding against the list of activity this is one that we've really layered over the financial sector in the last 40 odd years um in an earlier era 19th century earlier 20th century we didn't have as much about this even though of course we did guard against bank robbers but i'm talking about illicit activity outside of the financial sector money laundering terrorism and even sanctions so these four slip streams in a sense are there um so where how does it fit back to ai and policy in finance so i talked about what i i've come to call the big three biases fairness and inclusion explainability and privacy and what what we mean by that is if you take a whole data set millions or tens of millions of pieces of data and extract correlations and you find patterns some of those patterns might have biases and those biases could exist because we as a society we as a society are not perfect we have biases even in what we've already done and and so now you're extracting and you might be embedding some of those biases secondly sometimes sometimes it will happen just out of how you build your protocols how you build your actual questions and query on the data but i assure you that most data sets have some biases in them you might not be aware of them and even if you have a perfect data set the protocols themselves might sort of build some biases on top of them and we're finding this in ai policy not just in finance it's true in the criminal justice system it's true in hiring that using machine learning you have to sort of say wait is there bias and the laws here in the u.s that are most relevant in finance started with something called the equal credit opportunity act and we'll talk a little bit more about that um explainability and transparency as we talked about earlier is sort of like a cousin or a sister to the bias issue and in the u.s it was 50 years ago that we passed these twin laws within four years the second law was the fair credit reporting act and this was the concept about holding that data but also being able to explain it remain i see the chat button we have a question from jorge please yes professor thank you so much i just wanna to to have a little bit more cover on financial inclusion uh specifically on on what type of data what models are used a what's the forefront of of data modeling for a using ai and to help financial inclusion thank you well i'm not sure jorge i follow the question let me let me see if i do it but please keep your uh uh uh audio ones that we can engage here biases are sort of the reverse of inclusion so financial inclusion is the concept that everyone in society has fair access and open equal access in some way to the extension of credit to insurance to financial advice to investment products and savings products that they wish to or payment products as well and the reverse of inclusion is sometimes that somebody is excluded and excluding someone uh could be uh excluding them on something that is allowed like i might exclude somebody only earning 50 000 a year from an investment product which is for high high risk investors depending upon how uh the country is arranged but in the us we have a little bit of this concept that sophisticated investors can be investing in products of higher risk or at least they get less disclosure but that's how inclusion and bias are kind of the the they complement each other the greater inclusion you you can get to greater inclusion if you have fewer biases and a sense fairness but yeah okay you know i i was just i totally get that i was just trying to to understand what type of models what type of data what is the forefront of ai currently because i totally get is gathering data and finding patterns but but then what is digging a little bit more on that what type of so so let's say that one pattern that we know about already this just this is a a classic pattern in credit extension is um i don't know how many of you know what it what a uh retreading attire is but retread means that you're putting rubber on your tire instead of replacing your tire on your automobile you're actually paying to put new rubber on the tire tire retreading it's been known for decades that people who retread their tires are a little lower income generally speaking and and actually there's uh uh research i don't mean academic research but there's research in the in the credit in business that retreading tires uh means that you're probably a little higher credit risk okay now bring it forward to now bring it forward to the 2020 environment and let's say that you can follow that those people who bought tire retreading or even if you went to a website on your on your laptop about tire retreading let's say that's built in to an algorithm that's going to give you lower extension of credit that might be allowed or it might embed a different bias it might be the tire retreading shops are perfectly acceptable in certain communities either communities uh ethnic communities or or gender based or racial communities that it's just perfectly you know it's not about it's not about credit worthiness so it's how you extract certain patterns that are about credit extension but not about race ethnicity cultural backgrounds and the like okay and and um if you hold just for a second we're going to talk a little bit more about this because i'm going to talk about the equal credit opportunity act um thank you romain we good oh good gary so beyond what i'm sort of calling the big three i list four other things but they're all really relevant they're relevant to uh uh broadly speaking the official sector but they're also relevant as you think about going into these businesses the use of alternative data and we'll come back to that these basically we've had data analytics consumer finance since the 1960s we have in 30 plus countries use these fico scores but beyond what is built into the classical data sets what about new data we have issues about whether the algorithms themselves will be correlated or even collude and this is absolutely the case that one machine learning algorithm and another machine learning organism can actually train against each other we've already seen this in high frequency trading even if the humans aren't talking the machines will start to actually have a sense of of cooperation and when is cooperation collusion when is it that they're spoofing each other or doing something against each other in the high frequency world i deeply this is one of the areas i want to research more with colleagues i deeply am concerned that that a future crisis it's remarkable i mean we're in the middle of the corona crisis but a future crisis will find algorithmic correlation and this is certainly the case in smaller developing countries where a baidu from china or google from the us might come in and they might come in with their their approach to artificial intelligence or a large financial firm it could be a european asian or u.s financial firm comes into that smaller country and they kind of dominate the thinking about how to do underwriting and they're the big network effect and all of a sudden the crisis of 2037 might be that everybody is extending credit kind of consistently in the same way um so it's basically less resilient we're living through a moment of crisis right now where we're testing the resiliency of humankind through the corona crisis but i'm talking one in financial in the financial side then the question is how does machine learning fit into current regulatory frameworks around the globe a lot's been written but it's all at a very high level and it's non-binding but it's these top three as i've mentioned so the alternatives this was a question earlier is the official sector can stay neutral and say listen this is just a tool we're still going to regulate lending we're going to regulate capital markets we're going to regulate everything the way we did and new activities will just come into those frameworks maybe we'll clarify a little bit around the fringes secondly you can adjust turn the dial when the internet came along in the 1990s at first it was like technology neutral and then pretty much every regulator around the globe had to to adjust what what did it mean if there was an online bulletin board that was trading stocks where buyers and sellers can meet was that what's called an exchange should it be regulated like the new york stock exchange or london stock exchange or regulated maybe a little differently where our securities regulator where the europeans ended up in the 1990s was to regulate these online platforms like exchanges were not identical so then we had a regime of fully regulated exchanges and these online electronic trading platforms and that was then later adopted in asia as well with some variations um the other thing is that the official sector often tries to promote this promote the innovations promote the technologies or promote open banking as i've said but an interesting piece of this all is activities should we think about machine learning as a tool like a hammer that everybody's going to be using like electricity like the telephone that everybody is using or should we think about it as i said earlier some companies are providing ai as a service you know activities of technology a tool and the official sector grapples with this sometimes to date mostly they've stayed technology neutral with a little bit of promoting early stage activity and the promoting of the open banking romaine questions we have 15 minutes left okay um alternative data this is data that you can extract whether it's banking and checking information or as alibaba does in china taking a whole cash flow approach saying i can see everything about your business it's called cash flow underwriting here in the u.s a payment company toast was able to do until restaurants close down able do cash flow underwriting around their restaurants because they had that payment data all the way down to your app usage and browsing history i believe this is a trend that we've been on that will be accelerated by the corona crisis that this crisis we're finding whether it's the large firms like google or even smaller ones want to contribute to trying to thwart the virus by following us on our on our location devices our location devices of course are called cell phones and smartphones but such vast parts of the population have them that with location tracking we can possibly uh thwart or even contain this virus by watching how we track ourselves i think that we will shift a little bit further into data sharing uh and that we'll look back in 2020 we'll maybe be in 2021 a pivot point but what it does mean even in finance that a lot of this data is going to be available somewhere even more maybe than currently is available so there are actually all alternative data fintech companies cb insights which is a leader in in tracking fintech puts together this chart and we don't have time to go through these companies but these are companies that are sort of marketing themselves in this alternative data set almost like capturing the data and then data and ai as a service um i want to just talk about apple credit card for a second because it's where you can also stub your toe apple credit card with a big roll out in conjunction with goldman sachs is marcus and mastercard so it's a it's a really interesting combination of of big tech big finance together rolls out a credit card product i think it was in november uh yeah november of this past year and in rolling it out uh in a very proud rollout uh an entrepreneur uh here going by the twitter account dhh but you might might might know of this goes on and finds that he is provided greater credit than his wife and he and his wife are both billionaires like literally worth a lot about maybe it was only they were sent to millionaires but worth a lot of money joint tax account joint assets and he was being provided 10 to 20 times more credit so he he took to the twitter sphere and sort of made this and he says his wife had spoke to two apple reps both very nice but basically saying i don't know why it's just the algorithm it's just the algorithm what really hurt apple even more than that was within days the next day steve wozniak one of the co-founders of apple put this twitter out i'm a current apple employee and the founder and the same thing happened to us 10 times meaning steve got 10 times the credit as his wife in the same algorithm some saying to blame goldman sachs etc etc but apple shares the responsibility not a good roll out so for apple credit card they'll survive apple's a big company they'll they'll probably fix these biases but not a particularly good rollout as you can well imagine in their models romain alita has her hand up where is a leader um yes you mentioned um cash flow lending earlier um and that really falls under the merchant cash advance um kind of business there's been a lot of debate about that being um it's not very regulated right now but that becoming more regulated is an entrant um entry point like um toast and other companies that have just launched these new products do you think they'll speed up the regular regulations around that business so i i romaine or elita uh i missed a word which company did you say in there um toast or toast okay so toast so for people to be familiar toast started in the restaurant payment space and it was basically trying to provide hardware tablets they they thought that the point of sale would be facilitated if servers had a tablet and so they were sort of in the hardware software space they found themselves getting into the payment space very quickly and then of course data and with that data they could do a whole cash flow underwriting and then they started toast capital where they would make loans small business loans to these restaurants and i think they have 25 or 30 000 restaurants that are in their client list and they did a round c funding earlier this year at 4.9 billion so this is working of course until the crisis and and so then the question is about regulation about cash flow underwriting i'm not uh familiar enough with how toast feels even though i've met the founders and things like that their boston company but i think they're dealing with the same set of regulations that everyone is which i'm going to turn to right now in the last eight minutes um but cash flow underwriting at leader are you worried about something specifically about cash flow underwriting because um maybe i'll i'll learn from your concern if you look at i would consider that to be like a merchant cash advance um product and those are not actually considered loans um in the regular regulations now there's a lot of move uh movement towards having those types of products being considered loans and then falling under um different regulate regulatory standards that you know whether whatever whatever is raising i'm sorry what elise is raising is again in every political and regulatory process there's some definition of what falls within a regulation what falls out you might think where are the borders and boundaries of a regulatory environment what's defined really as a security in the cryptocurrency space what's defined as an exchange in exchange regulation and here elita say what's defined as a loan and in toast case doing cash flow underwriting it might be considered a cash advance rather than a loan um so let me do a little research on that and we'll come back to that maybe enough in a future class when we talk about payments um but in terms of the consumer credit law environment we talked about the equal credit opportunity act the key thing is not only whether you have disparate treatment but whether you have disparate impact so back to my retreading analysis if for some reason you've been reviewing and your machine algorithms say aha all these folks that are getting retreads should have lower credit that might be okay unless you find that you're treating different protected classes differently are you treating people of different backgrounds differently different genders differently as apple certainly was in steve wozniak and his wife fair housing act their credit reporting act the fair housing act has a lot of these same protected class perspectives fair credit reporting and you read this in the mayor brown piece the fair credit reporting act you can find yourself as a fintech company or a data aggregator the plaids and the other data aggregators could find that they were in fact coming under the fair credit reporting act they were those vendors that cap1 might be using and they the vendor might become fair credit reporting act companies and there's usually a boundary there again this is not a law class but these are to highlight states also have unfair and deceptive acts and practices act when i was chairman of the maryland consumer financial protection commission we went to the state legislature in maryland this is a year and a half ago and said the maryland's unfair deceptive acts practices act udap should be updated to include abusive so we sort of broadened it a little bit um and then privacy laws general uh this should say general direct general uh i'll correct the gdpr but uh protection regulation and then in the u.s and those those are the buckets that really matter sort of trying to close out ai finance and geopolitics got to nearly 200 countries and those 200 countries we're interconnected we're very interconnected globally and we've got a lot of standard setters but those standard setters do not have the authority of lawmakers so whether it's the organization of economic uh oecd or the guidelines of things like the securities regulators and the any crime regulators or the banking regulators these are not enforceable standards so what we have is competing models for ai finance and policy and i note that because if you're thinking about starting a company or you operate globally sometimes the global law will affect you gdpr from europe has already affected how we deal with privacy in the us california institutes the california consumer protection act it influences the whole country so sometimes that works that way romaine we have a question from akshay where's actually hi professor so uh the gender biased algorithm that you mentioned about the apple credit card so uh the only thing that we can control here is the the data that we're using if you're not using any gender data and if algorithm turns out and is creating biases without even using a particular data which which is considered uh like racist or sexist so would that be counted as um like kind of breaking the breaking the laws so here it's a great question actually and and again i caution that this is not a legal class but embedded in the u.s law and often in other laws is this concept about disparate treatment and desperate impact and what you're asking is what if what if you you didn't mean to do it what if you there was no intent and and it's just well you've extracted this correlation and all of a sudden there's district impact you could have a problem in the court and and it's a very established 50 year old you know there's a lot of of case law around when would a disparate impact cause you those headaches and anxiety and it relates a lot to explainability if you can come back to explainability and you can truly lay out this is why and it has nothing to do with gender nothing to do with race sexual orientation and backgrounds and so forth the protected class you're going to be better in that court case but but it would be far better to have no disparate impact than than you're you're in a in a much broadly more safe area thank you um romaine other questions perhaps one last question from luke oh my god luke you're always in there oh those are the questions before luke goes is there anybody else just i want to make sure okay luke you can go it was not a question it was a comment to actually um question i'm sure he doesn't support this and but what he asked is isn't it same thing if a person gives a racist or misogynist comment or hate crime comment and if he didn't know about it is he liable for it shouldn't corporate be held responsible in the same way a human would be well i i don't know if that's really where actually i was going but i see your point is that that basically and it depends on the country actually and luke it really does have known country but here in the us we have this conceptual framework of just just for treatment desperate impact and then explainability is from another law but um it really should be based on fairness and inclusion everybody's got the same fair shot uh regardless of of where the data comes from uh at all so i think that's sort of where almost out of time you
