 how do you make a fast prototype and make it as a production-ready product? you can go for off the shelf cameras. So if you if you look at our product portfolio, we have wide range of cameras uh in USB 3.0 mp3 cameras GMSL cameras you can choose the off-the-shelf camera which already has an image signal processor inbuilt into it and you have a wide range of interface option as well. To start with you can go for a USB 3.0 camera and start your evaluation these are UVC cameras you can connect into a PC and it can use the default driver whether it's a windows or linux it can work with a default driver, you don't need any additional driver for this use of UVC cameras. So that will give you an idea about what kind of image quality you are getting with this camera and then if you want to continue with USB you can continue with USB and if you want to switch to an MEP or GMSL camera then it is possible that. All our USB cameras are also available in the MEPI and GMSL interface as well. when it comes to nvidia, one of the interesting uh aspect of Nvidia processor is that supports multiple cameras it supports up to six cameras in some cases we can have even have eight cameras and econ systems provide multi-synchronized camera support for all the Nvidia platforms. One of the latest launch which we did is six GMSL camera for zero platform and we do have cameras for every single application, if you are looking for a global shutter camera we don't have an option both in monochrome and color if you have if you want to have a stereo camera for your AGV application we don't have cameras for it if you're looking for hdr GMSL IP rater, IP 67 rated enclosure cameras we have the options so this way these are pre-certified cameras so here are all our cameras are pre-certified designed for certification. So you can take it to the market capacitance you don't have to make any further development with that.
