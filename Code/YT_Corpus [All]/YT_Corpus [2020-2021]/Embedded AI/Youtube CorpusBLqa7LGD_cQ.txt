  SPEAKER: Do you know what happens when you say, OK Google? TinyML or Tiny Machine Learning is one of the fastest growing fields of machine learning. It sits right at the intersection of embedded systems, algorithms, and computing hardware. TinyML is all about on-device machine leanring right at the endpoint where the data resides, and it is fundamentally different than running machine learning in big data centers or in the cloud. You already know and take for granted some existing applications with TinyML. For instance, when you say, hey Siri, OK Google, or hey Alexa, you're seeing TinyML in action. But those applications are just the tip of the iceberg. TinyML has many different use cases ranging from smart home appliances to medical devices, and it has applications even in wildlife conservation. This exciting new professional certificate program is a Harvard collaboration with innovative members of Google's TensorFlow team. This certificate combines computer science with engineering, and it features real-world application case studies that examine TinyML deployments. This program takes you through the foundations of TinyML to deploying machine learning on your very own device. In the Foundations of TinyML course, you'll learn the basics of embedded computing and discover the language behind Tiny Machine Learning. In course 2, which focuses on applications of TinyML, you'll get the opportunity to see TinyML in practice and learn the code behind some of the most common applications today. Finally in Deploying TinyML, you'll write the machine learning code using Google's latest TensorFlow Lite for microcontrollers and program your very own smart device. We're just beginning to explore the full capabilities of TinyML. Imagine what we could do if there were smart, ideally biodegradable machine learning sensors everywhere. Be at the forefront of this emerging technology, and start learning TinyML today.
