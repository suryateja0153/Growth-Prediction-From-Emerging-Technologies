 DNA computing there's a branch of computing which uses DNA biochemistry and molecular biology hardware instead of the traditional silicon based computer technologies research and development in this area concerns theory experiments and applications of DNA computing the term electronic s-- has sometimes been used but this term has already been used for an earlier technology a venn unsuccessful rival of the first integrated circuits this term has also been used more generally for molecular scale electronic technology topic history this field was initially developed by Leonard Adelman of the University of Southern California in 1994 Adelman demonstrated a proof-of-concept use of DNA as a form of computation which solved the 7-point Hamiltonian path problem since the initial Adelman experiments advances have been made and various Turing machines have been proven to be constructible while the initial interest was in using this novel approach to tackle np-hard problems it was soon realized that they may not be best suited for this type of computation and several proposals have been made to find a killer application for this approach in 1997 computer scientist MIT's inori OD hara working with biologists Animesh raised suggested one to be the evaluation of boolean circuits and described an implementation in 2002 researchers from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rijo Israel unveiled a programmable molecular computing machine composed of enzymes and DNA molecules instead of silicon microchips on April 28 2004 a herd Shapiro Yakov Benenson binya Mongol Yuri bandur and Rivka radar at the Weizmann Institute announced in the journal Nature that they had constructed a DNA computer coupled with an input and output module which would theoretically be capable of diagnosing cancerous activity within a cell and releasing an anti-cancer drug upon diagnosis in January 2013 researchers were able to store a JPEG photograph a set of Shakespearean sonnets and an audio file of Martin Luther King Jr's speech I have a dream on DNA digital data storage in March 2013 researchers created a transcript or a biological transistor in August 2016 researchers used the CRISPR gene editing system to insert a gif of a galloping horse and rider into the DNA of living bacteria you topic idea the organization and complexity of all living beings is based on a coding system functioning with four key components of the DNA molecule because of this the DNA is very suited as a medium for data processing according to different calculations a DNA computer with one liter of fluid containing six grams of DNA could potentially have the memory capacity of 3072 exabytes the theoretical maximum data transfer speed would also be enormous due to the massive parallelism of the calculations therefore about 1,000 petaflop could be reached while today's most powerful computers do not go above a few dozen 99 petaflop being the current record topic pros and cons the slow processing speed of a DNA computer the response time is measured in minutes hours or days rather than milliseconds is compensated by its potential to make a high amount of multiple parallel computations this allows the system to take a similar amount of time for a complex calculation as for a simple one this is achieved by the fact that millions or billions of molecules interact with each other simultaneously however it is much harder to analyze the answers given by a DNA computer than by a digital one topic examples prototypes in 1994 Leonard Adelman presented the first prototype of a DNA computer the TT 100 was a test tube filled with 100 microliters of a DNA solution he managed to solve for example an instance of the directed Hamiltonian path problem in another experiment a simple version of the Traveling Salesman problem was solved for this purpose different DNA fragments were created each one of them representing a city that had to be visited every one of these fragments is capable of a linkage with the other fragments created these DNA fragments were produced and mixed in a test-tube within seconds the small fragments form bigger ones representing the different travel routes through a chemical reaction that lasts a few days the DNA fragments representing the longer roots were eliminated the remains are the solution to the problem however current technical limitations prevent evaluation of the results therefore the experiment isn't suitable for application but it is nevertheless a proof-of-concept topic combinatorial problems first results to these problems were obtained by Leonard Adelman nasa/jpl in 1994 solving a Hamiltonian path in a graph with Seven Summits in 2002 solving our np-complete problem as well as a three SAT problem with twenty variables topic tic-tac-toe game in 2002 J McDonald D Stefanovic and mr. stage a Novick created a DNA computer able to play tic-tac-toe against a human player the calculator consists of nine bins corresponding to the nine squares of the game each bin contains a substrate and various combinations of DNA enzymes the substrate itself is composed of a DNA strand onto which was grafted a fluorescent chemical group at one end and the other end a repressor group fluorescence is only active if the molecules of the substrate are halved the DNA enzyme simulate logical functions for example such a DNA will unfold if two specific types of DNA strand are introduced to reproduce the logic function and by default the computer is supposed to play first in the central square the human player has then as a starter eight different types of DNA strands assigned to each of eight boxes that may be played to indicate that box near I is being ticked the human player pours into all bins the strands corresponding to input hash I these strands bind to certain DNA enzymes present in the bins resulting in one of these two bins in the deformation of the DNA enzymes which binds to the substrate and cuts it the corresponding bin becomes fluorescent indicating which box is being played by the DNA computer the various DNA enzymes are divided into various bins in such a way to ensure the victory of the DNA computer against the human player topic neural network based computing Kevin cherry and Lulu kyun at Caltech developed a DNA based artificial neural network that can recognize 100 bit handwritten digits they achieve this by programming on computer in advance with appropriate set of weights represented by varying concentrations weight molecules which will later be added to the test tube that holds the input DNA strands topic capabilities DNA computing is a form of parallel computing in that it takes advantage of the many different molecules of DNA to try many different possibilities at once for certain specialized problems DNA computers are faster and smaller than any other computer built so far furthermore particular mathematical computations have been demonstrated to work on a DNA computer as an example DNA molecules have been utilized to tackle the assignment problem jeon jongsu and colleagues built a DNA GPS system and also conduct an experiment to show that magnetic fields can enhance charge transport through DNA or protein which may allow organisms to sense magnetic fields Erin niabi has provided a general implementation of strassens matrix multiplication algorithm on a DNA computer although there are problems with scaling in addition Caltech researchers have created a circuit made from 130 unique DNA strands which is able to calculate the square root of numbers up to 15 recently salary al showed that with a new coding referred to as fractional coding chemical reactions in general and DNA reactions in particular can compute polynomials in the fractional coding - DNA molecules are used to represent each variable DNA computing does not provide any new capabilities from the standpoint of computability Theory the study of which problems are computationally solvable using different models of computation for example if the space required for the solution of a problem grows exponentially with the size of the problem exp SP AC problems on von Neumann machines it still grows exponentially with the size of the problem on DNA machines for very large exp SP AC problems the amount of DNA required is too large to be practical topic methods there are multiple methods for building a computing device based on DNA each with its own advantages and disadvantages most of these build the basic logic gates and so are not associated with digital logic from a DNA basis some of the different bases include donors iams deoxy oligonucleotides enzymes toehold exchange topic donors Iams catalytic DNA deoxyribose I'm Ordonez I'm catalyze a reaction when interacting with the appropriate input such as a matching oligonucleotide these donors iams are used to build logic gates analogous to digital logic in silicon however Deniz Iams are limited to one two and three input gates with no current implementation for evaluating statements in series the Tanners I'm logic gate changes its structure when it binds to a matching oligonucleotides and the fluoro genic substrate it is bonded to is cleaved free while other materials can be used most models use a fluorescence based substrate because it is very easy to detect even at the single molecule limit the amount of fluorescence can then be measured to tell whether or not a reaction took place that an as I'm that changes is then used and cannot initiate anymore reactions because of this these reactions take place in a device such as a continuous stirred-tank reactor where old product is removed and new molecules added to commonly used donors iams are named e 6 and 8 to 17 these are popular because they allow cleaving of a substrate in any arbitrary location Stowe Janovich and McDonald have used the e 16 as iams to build the Meyer ion Maya two machines respectively Stowe Janovich has also demonstrated logic gates using the 8 to 17 design while these designs have been demonstrated to be useful for constructing logic gates they are limited by the need for a metal cofactor to function such as zinc 2 plus or Minnesota 2 plus and thus are not useful in vivo a design called a stem loop consisting of a single strand of DNA which has a loop at an end or a dynamic structure that opens and closes when a piece of DNA bonds to the loop part this effect has been exploited to create several logic gates these logic gates have been used to create the computers my eye on Maya too which can play tic-tac-toe to some extent topic enzymes enzyme-based DNA computers are usually of the form of a simple Turing machine there is analogous hardware in the form of an enzyme and software in the form of DNA Benenson shapiro and colleagues have demonstrated a DNA computer using the Fakih enzyme and expanded on their work by going on to show automata that diagnose and react to prostate cancer under expression of the genes PPAP 2b and GST p1 and an overexpression of p IM 1 and h pn their automata evaluated the expression of each gene one gene at a time and on positive diagnosis then released a single strand DNA molecule s s DNA that is an anti sense for mdm2 mdm2 is a repressor of protein 53 which itself is a tumor suppressor on negative diagnosis it was decided to release a suppressor of the positive diagnosis drug instead of doing nothing a limitation of this implementation is that two separate automata are required one to administer each drug the entire process of evaluation until drug release took around an hour to complete this method also requires transition molecules as well as the enzyme to be present the requirement for the enzyme limits application in vivo at least for use in cells of higher organisms it should also be pointed out that that software molecules can be reused in this case topic tohold exchange DNA computers have also been constructed using the concept of toehold exchange in this system an input DNA strand binds to a sticky end or toehold on another DNA molecule which allows it to displace another strand segment from the molecule this allows the creation of modular logic components such as an ORM not gates and signal amplifiers which can be linked into arbitrarily large computers this class of DNA computers does not require enzymes or any chemical capability of the DNA topic algorithmic self-assembly DNA nanotechnology has been applied to the related field of DNA computing DNA tiles can be designed to contain multiple sticky ends with sequences chosen so that they act as Wang tiles a DX array has been demonstrated whose assembly encodes an XOR operation this allows the DNA array to implement a cellular automaton which generates a fractal called the sierpinski gasket this shows that computation can be incorporated into the assembly of DNA arrays increasing its scope beyond simple periodic arrays topic alternative technologies a partnership between IBM and Caltech was established in 2009 aiming at DNA chips production a Caltech group is working on the manufacturing of these nucleic acid-based integrated circuits one of these chips can compute whole square roots a compiler has been written in Perl equals equals C also
