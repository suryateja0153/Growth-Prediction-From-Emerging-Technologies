 my name is Henson Park I'm the co-founder and CEO of catalogue and catalog is an early-stage startup company that is working on building a platform to store and compute data digital data on DNA molecules so we've come up with a new platform to for storing information in DNA at a much cheaper and faster way than what's been possible before so why would you want to store data and compute on them Indiana in the first place it's because of the explosion of data creation right now that we're experiencing very soon will generate a lot more useful data then we'll have a room to store and so we want to be addressing that gap and provide a solution for it for the data that's useful but we don't have the room to store using conventional media so DNA can be a solution for that because it's the medium that Nature has chosen to store its most precious information it's got incredible information density about a million times more information more data can be stored in the same volume compared to a flash drives it can last for thousands of years and you can copy the information to billions of copies for nearly zero the cost so that could also enable totally new applications for your data that's not possible right now so as a company we are nearing the completion of a machine that can store about a terabyte of information per day as in the within the next few months and right now we're looking for pilot customers to use this machine with us so that we can build a software layer that can fit seamlessly around the solutions that these customers have have give the customers the chance to influence the direction of the development of this new technology platform [Music] you
