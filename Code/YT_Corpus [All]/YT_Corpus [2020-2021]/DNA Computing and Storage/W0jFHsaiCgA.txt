 that's you're also getting this smart boost power and a longer cord in terms of you know setting up and plug it in in than we've offered before for today and today only with thousands of these already spoken for it we're going to show you that if purchased separately real quickly so basically it's a half off sale is basically what it amounts to all you do is you pick your color of choice so we've got our black which I think was our most popular choice today this platinum is exclusive to HSN and then we've got this nice soft brush white you can use this horizontally or vertically it is a sixteen dollar flex pay six four nine five nine three I Spy out of the corner of my eye one of my favorite people even looks better in high definition without paying for it we are facebooking live and the big question that we were getting earlier and let's just address the elephant in the room is people want to know can I get my sports can I get my NBC can I get my ABC hsn.com and if you're looking for something in particular you have to tell you somebody know okay we broke the Internet yes you do know this okay so way to go if you go to hsn.com and you put your address in there it may very well say zero channels found because we literally sold so many of these mascot recruits over three times as many as we can tops website was totally down it's back up in that but but they're still working on it so I just want to tell you that if it doesn't give you a list of channels it's because don't panic don't don't don't panic right but let me tell you what you can okay either way to that end 30 day unconditional money-back guarantee so if you get this at home you're saying oh it's not their number one for a reason and basically this is putting money back in your own pocket it's just I think it's genius and we will shatter all records in this category we've never done anything quite like this area so here's what's so exciting about it if you're tired of hangry television you don't have to pay to watch TV but most people don't understand is you're thinking about high-definition ABC it's an NBC high-definition CBS you're thinking about Fox and the CW and in all of those kind of channels all you need to watch those for free all the time is the device that intercepts the way the waves are already going through your house now you might be paying to watch them another way you don't have to pay all you need is an intent and by the way this antenna doesn't quite look like rabbit ears anymore dial it's aesthetically beautiful it can go Horace horizontally point that out as well but the white one set up here horizontally it kind of just looked like a soundbar incredibly simple to set up and there's three key things that you need to know about this one from the beginning yeah number one the long the largest range we've ever had 80 miles so you can live in the most rural of rural places really or you can live right in the middle of New York City and you'll get great reception that's number one so Louie don't want to pause here for a moment by the way Jordan and Tina hello cuz I had the same question for Aaron my I graduated with a class of 16 yeah 16 people not 1600s so I'm from a rural area as well they're both asking about rural areas and we have ever had for rural areas as the 80-mile reception is the longest reception I've ever seen on an indoor antenna you'll have a better chance with this one than anyone if for any reason you don't get the reception you want not only do you have a 30 day money-back guarantee with Shannon mentioned we'll talk more about this later everywhere else you buy this you get a one year warranty yeah a five year warranty will get more into that but yes if you're in a rural area absolutely up to 80 miles 80 miles and one of the reasons why and that brings me to my second point is because this has something called and we can show this right now I think we have a still to show it this has this smart boozes dial boost technology what is that so this is an amplifier okay but seeing you don't always want to just be a hundred percent amplified it totally depends on where you live and it makes the snow and the visual quality on your television better so so when it rains it's windy affected by rain so in not affected by the weather ray point unlike dish and unlike cable your I use your cable all the time you're all kinds of situations in fact one of the reasons why there's there these waves go through your house it's mandated by the government so in emergencies when your cable doesn't work when your dish doesn't work etc you don't have to have it in with smart Boost technology it's all the way up from 0 to 80 miles away from a receiver you're always gonna get just the perfect amount to get the clearest picture that's was the second thing I wanted to say the third thing this is the big big big big thing this antenna is designed and built not just to power one television you can use it to just power one hell there's no problem it will power two devices so right now there's a device that Shannon and I are standing in between and by the way you'll get a lot of people don't realize you're still gonna get the guide on your TV so you'll still know what's at least something you only get on a paid service because you have a digital TV and you don't have a digital TV we're gonna talk about that you can still use this you just need one other piece if you don't have a digital TV we will talk about that in a second so stick around if you don't so anyway you got your whole you know everything we could watch right here we can watch good times we could watch last call we could watch flipper we could watch da Vinci's inquest we could watch American Ninja 3 we could watch Criminal Minds we're watching all this for free and we can watch it on two televisions and it's not just a splitter that splits the signal one way and the other way it's inside here is technology that fully powers two devices so you can watch two televisions on two different channels at the same time and that changes everything right all of the sudden two TVs in your house can be powered by one antenna that's put it the best place for the best reception like Shannon said there we are sort of at this this I think tipping point in America where we all know somebody now who is done through who've decided to use streaming who've decided to use an antenna to save themselves hundreds of dollars a month on bills on hey by the way Brian I see they're so funny I actually thought of you when I put on the stripes tonight I was gonna wear hot pink another story honestly hide to Ruth as well Pamela nice to see you as well actually Jordan is cuties like I'm more country than even him he had a graduating class of 85 but it also wants to know is there a specific part of your home that you should put this more advantageous oh the most advantageous and there's a little guy that comes along we always recommend the higher you can put it the better and the nearer a window you can put it the better the two places you don't want it to be the least enclosed by steel steel will tend to block the reception and so will any devices that use a whole lot of power so like you might want to not want it right next to a refrigerator right this is a great place for it where I have it right now so if you want to do it again I'm horizontally or vertically not too far from your TV you know in most living rooms you're reasonably close to a to a window the other thing is while you're setting it up if you have any questions we'll show you right now an top has an amazing support line there's a toll-free phone number you can call if you set it up and you're like I'm not getting you know the reception isn't quite as good as I thought it would be let me tell you the reception should be perfect that's how good this antenna is your reception will be if you do it right will be a hundred percent excellent so if for whatever reason it isn't call these folks they will they'll tell you to tweak it a little bit to the left tweak it a little bit to the right they've got all kinds of tips and tricks but the key is it is so easy my mother my 76 year old mother set up her own antenna this year you know obviously I did my own and my nephew all three by the way just in hi to you Maddy and Ruth sorry no phones iPhones in the show but I am gonna show you your choices again and any errands going to talk about hook up because I'll what that's proper your other big question is okay can I figure out how to put the thing together so mark I'm just gonna head over here real quickly remember HSN exclusive it is a world launch if this means that you can eliminate maybe one set-top box or you know something that you're paying a monthly stipend or fee for a DVR as an example just so you can get your high-definition channels this is an awesome choice for you they are from the number one name when it comes to antenna technology they make them for not only themselves but for other manufacturers there this exclusively world launch for us today and here tonight so if you want to watch your high-definition you know ABC NBC CBS QVC HSN absolutely you can do so I heard Aaron's say this earlier what is it 94 out of a total 194 out of the top 100 shows in America you can watch on broadcast television high-definition so they did this exclusively for us with that five-year warranty and of course an HSN exclusive prices well you just pick your color of choice more than three to one of us are doing the black the Platinum is also exclusive to us here at HSN you won't find that anywhere else then of course and then we have that great white it's entirely up to you why is actually the the most limited we have fewer than 2000 of those oh I'm sorry fewer than a thousand we're doing free shipping it is a $16 flex pay and I can it's funny because when I watched the Monday night Show with Adam and Aaron earlier they're already rewriting the portion of Adams show tomorrow night where this was supposed to air because they're expecting a full and early sellout so use that information for what you will but I know a lot of you probably have questions about set up because I would too it's like okay great I'm gonna have to hire Aaron to come into my home no you don't right my friend set up is that's one of the best things about this anyone can set it up if you can always compare it to um connecting a hose to a water spigot because that's kind of with the how you screw it in so let me just show you here's the antenna itself it has a 15-foot coaxial cable on the back that's the longest cable that we've ever had so you can have this really far away from your TV if you need to in order to have great reception that's no problem at all this is sort of the secret sauce this is kind of the magic weapon right here this is the smart boost technology that that lets you get the best signal no matter where you are so right there it says antenna in you can handle that right so you just take the coaxial cable and you just screw it in so once you get this one on that's antenna and okay I've got that one now this says TV oops sorry there now you can see it it says TV so now I'm gonna take the other cable we include a five-foot cable to go to your TV so I just screw that in boom boom here we go is that good yep I'm in now okay so that's it the last thing you do is you plug your you power this because it's a powered antenna so you plug your smart boost in this goes out of the way you just hide it behind the TV obviously your other the other end of that coaxial goes into your television there the gang there's nothing to it and now you can watch 94 of the top 100 shows are broadcast free every single week you know that every single day they're broadcast free into your house you can see how easy it is to use right there super easy connection now oh if you think I didn't didn't show you guys can we come back for just a second you can also hook up a second television that's one of the biggest things about this it says right here TV or it's not just a TV you can hook up a TV you can hook up an FM radio you can hook up a an OTA streamer you can hook up an OTA projector it's up to you so two devices now if you don't want to you can just do one device that's fine but that's one of the really exciting things about this is for the same price that you used to pay to be able to get reception to one device you can get as good of reception to two devices and again you never pay a single penny to watch you know if you're paying if you're paying money to watch television right now quite frankly you shouldn't be no make sure you'll be in one room in your house you know you want to have the best or you want to have more channels you and I have premium channels or you want whatever fine but think about the guest room that you never go you know there are times a year in a basement and the sewing I mean all of those experience so I know Aaron just showed hook up but I'm gonna back up for just a moment BL was asking about outputs and Rosie wanted to know if it will work on an old TV let's talk about old TVs okay so well just in terms of outputs it's there it's coaxial so it they're coaxial output that's all of them are just coaxial cables really really easy on that old television don't want to talk about hang on don't move stay right there if your TV is older than 2008 then it's probably not a digital television right you have to have a digital television that's all any digital television the government mandated that after 2008 all TVs had or in them so if your TV is older than that no it's almost good news because this device you guys are gonna love this device we sold a bunch of these in our last airing this is what's called a digital converter so all you do actually is you plug your antenna into this and then plug your two and then your TV comes out here and this basically makes your TV into a digital TV but there's one more there's one more really extra cool thing when you pop a USB Drive in here you know what else this is this becomes a DVR as well so now all the free television that you're getting not only can you stop it and pause it and rewind it and fast-forward through commercials you can even program this ahead of time to record things when you're not home by the way teary I hope you heard what what Erin just said she was asking about recording multiple programs now you couldn't do multiple programs but you could use that to record you could actually if you were if you had two different TVs because you can right you could record multiple programs but one on each television at a Michael hi to you too and and Maddie you are right when we talk about premium channels now we're talking about your regular high-definition broadcast your you know your ABCs your CBS your QVC or HSN so you can still get your Downton Abbey's those good things but if you want access to your premium channels maybe just stay with us because we have that Amazon fire Amazon fire cube gives you access and they're like Batman and Robin perfect all your base is covered so Aaron talked to the smart boost system again here's what's so important about the smart boost system is we we all live different distances away from the towers right some of us might live two miles away from where the television broadcast is coming from but some of us might live 80 miles away well that smart boost calls controls what's called the game right okay and the gain is what makes your signal look good and and all on or all off doesn't work because some of us are in the middle and so you don't want the gain too high or too low you want it just right well the first time ever it just has a little dial on it I mean it's it is the it's a simplest thing to use and you just dial it until the picture looks perfect and then you leave it alone I like and then again it's perfect tree oh wow so in that technology again is one of the things that enables us to be an 80-mile range you will have the best reception that you can really will ok by the way ok I'll show you your choices again we see you there thank you for facebooking live if you are interested in premium channels stick around we've got another today's special that's right in just a few moments a lot of you as was in the first airing are asking about specific channels like AMC etc if you're getting an error error message on the an top web site try and help us a grade you can try that for sure right you can try that for sure but remember so you can you can also go to our HSN that right there and try there as well and that will be able to address specific individual channels I'll just say though if it says zero channels it's wrong if it's a zero channels that's because I promise you you everybody get you get lots of channels but that's just something oh and by the way we're also including a channel guide this is something we haven't done before for most of the major metropolitan areas we're including a channel guide that'll show you where you can find HSN and where you can find QVC this is a great question remember you can use it on two TVs but Laura was asking lor a sorry if I'm pronouncing it incorrectly how do you hook up two TVs fer they're in different rooms so great question you simply have to have a longer wire so you would and I want to address that for a minute you would have a longer cable right you just buy a longer coaxial cable it might have to be 30 feet if it's in another room etc or the other thing quite frankly at this price you might just buy two antennas if they're not reasonably close to each other it might be just as simple for you right to get two antennas the thing is you buy the antenna and once you never have to pay another penny for it so that would be the other absolutely by the way tailored this offer is good for the next 24 hours ya need to get a little shut-eye we certainly understand but well I say that it would somewhat tongue-in-cheek just because they are expecting an early sellout on that so depending on when you'd want to trim back in later in the day just you know use that information for what you will because they actually sold three times as many of these as they weren't supposed to good for you if you were up early and shopping and we do see you there I think for a lot of us out there actually we had a question on Facebook I apologize form from Eileen wanted to know if she should disconnect your cable box well if you're using that to watch your favorite high-definition channel I guess the answer would be you can you know it's totally up to you right so some people will get this to have additionally with cable some people will replace cable with it it's entirely up to you some people will maybe keep cable in one of their rooms but they're tired of paying for extra set-top boxes and all the other rooms but if you want to get rid of any pay thing any pay subscription that you have right now you certainly can do that and still have access to most of us get so like here at HSN right now you get 66 channels at home I get about fifty-six fifty-seven channels and remember this you know when we say premium channels these are premium I mean in that ninety three ninety ninety three out of the top 100 shows in America are on these broadcast channels so you are watching literally the best the number one the top shows in America if you're thinking about your local news yes your local weather yes your local sports yes your national news your national weather your national sports you get all of those things I mean again it is regulated as mandated by the government that these signals be broadcast into our homes in high-definition for free every day the only thing you need is a device that will receive this and it is certainly a way a lot of us enjoy watching TV but it's a way a lot of us are there were a lot of money this no one else has an offer like this just a real quick question we people were asking about an RV or a basement her basement yeah absolutely perfect so hopefully that helps you we're gonna continue to take all your calls all your questions we've got one for you you're calling now remember it works horizontally or setups right here and you just oh you take it out of the base and you pop it back into the base vertically it's really really easy to do it is indeed and remember again and actually because Jordan was thinking of getting this as at you know for Hulu now when we talk about the premium channels well we've got another today's special coming up for that that's right no I believe there is something called an OTA Hulu and and if so for any OTA device you could use that second connection any over-the-air device be that an FM radio be that over-the-air streaming at cetera absolutely so Maddie you're correct we do have something for premium channels you know if you're thinking Netflix and all that great stuff Glen is saying hi to you Erin England from Athens Georgia and honestly I think for a lot of us out there we are looking for a way to just get our costs under control and the truth of the matter is the cable box so that I have upstairs in my master bedroom I really only have it there to watch HSN yeah I really do and so I'm thinking I mean I couldn't quote you a direct reference but I'm paying I'm paying a separate fee for that box upstairs and even if I only eliminate that oh I can tell you this I know it's more than a flex pay I do know that so even if it's helping you to streamline whether it's that cable bill or that set-top box or you're looking for a way to really get your budget under control what's interesting about your high-def channels there might be channels or things that you want to watch that you're not even aware of that the thing that makes me a little crazy with the the service that I have at home right now is they kind of tell me what I can get so if there is something locally that they have you know they've run out of room on their channel guide for I don't want again an argument negotiating you don't ever lose those channels when you have an intent and a lot of people in emergency situations as well I have to say like Shannon said you know you get a little bit of rain your disc or your dish stops working cable goes out all the time as long as you have power if you have a generator you're gonna be getting emergency information as well as all your local programming right all of the time so a lot of people feel good about having an antenna around for that purpose if I'm still in the room they buy the dab by the way Deb I don't know if you've heard Erin or not if you are getting zero channels in your area we call him Kim if you want he broke the internet really did break the yes they're working on that if you happen to be experiencing the folks at on top I just out the phone with my buddy Robert hi Robert if you're watching he and his team both in the US and their technical team that does their computer work overseas they're all working together right now to UM get that but remember as always a 30 day unconditional money back guarantee so if you get it at home and you decide for whatever reason it's not your cup of tea remember you couldn't fall you're always welcome to send it back remember HSN exclusive world launch longer range than any other antenna of its type in its category 80 miles now again I'm from a town of like 400 people even st. Cloud Minnesota mom I think I'm in in the right radius because I know Alexandria is 40 I think that's like st. cloud that's where my mom goes to like you know the Mayo Clinic doctors at yes so that's a big town so you know even get within a big town radius but if you do have a TV that's older than say a decade right before 2008 right before if it's not digital right then we recommend just a little digital box it's from Ematic and the really cool thing about it not only does it make this work with older TVs that this is also a DVR so you just pop a USB thumb drive in there and you'll be able to record your favorite television you can pause you can rewind you can fast-forward with your television this is this is really great we really only have like a little over 2000 of those for the whole so basically a little over 2000 for the entire day 10% off by the way temperature live if you are doing our today's special as well nice now what are you coming back we're back at 8:00 or 9:00 in the morning at can remember yeah I think 8:00 a.m. was our first show tomorrow holy cow well I know you're not gonna have much to be sure Jay tomorrow yeah it will be gonna set some records in either so we are indeed so well if you're a lot of people are asking about premium channels we're gonna show you how you can get those next Erin thank you thank you I get a moment thanks worried about one less

beacon booking life I love you she's answered a lot of the questions for me so apparently Maddy kudos to you I should send you a check after the show we appreciate you and all of our friends who are shopping so we are moving along and one of the big questions that we had when we were airing our today's special and incidentally don't hang up we do have one now that was a way for you to access and find and get your high-definition channels without paying an extra fee one of the biggest questions we had on Facebook live is what about my premium channels and you know what a girl wants at all and God knows I do and this is a way for you to do that this is a way for you to access not only your premium channels but if your Amazon fire stick and your Alexa head a bit bit it would be the cube it would be the cube so not only will this through your shopping list and your weather and play your fly you know all the great things that you like it will also allow you to access your Hulu and your Netflix and your HBO Ric and did I miss it can we show that little commercial or did we do it already okay you don't want oh we don't have it oh yeah do you know what we got it because not yes she's darling but she's live she's in person we don't need a commercial but Lori Leland is back with us and we all read the lead it's the lowest price in the country yonder in the whole country actually even a better value than so you got to pay extra for the audio folks I'm teasing I'm teasing that is a joke I'm sure I'll get an email later like don't joke about stuff like that it stumped the crew night right it is normally it stumped the host night of which you know I know our crew loves to play that game but there's no guessing game here it really is like a fire stick and you're Alexa had a baby and it is the lowest price in the country in fact Amazon is selling this for about a hundred and twenty dollars I mean so we're doing that only as long as supplies last for $16 and change also free shipping 30 day unconditional money back guarantee so Laurie the big thing is if people have not seen this what is this what does this do and and how is it gonna help me you know even if I'm getting my today's special oh my gosh you're gonna love this and you already explained it if you were fire TV and your Amazon echo had a baby it would be your fire TV cube here it is it's just tiny sleek sophisticated beautiful technology like we've come to expect from Amazon of course but now you have unlimited channels basically giving you all the free content and programming you could ever possibly want on your TV over 500,000 choices so they get over 500,000 choices in 4k Ultra High Definition right on your TV so maybe you have that room I know we've been talking about it with our today's special where you want to have all of the channels you want to be able to watch all your favorite TV shows you want to be able to do it all but you don't have to pay for hey Joel hey by the way Keith on Facebook I'm sorry I didn't see the question he wants to know if we can use our today's special outside it is intended for indoor use I mean I think when we think antenna you know we think the rabbit ears on the roof no crawling on the roof with that so just you know a quick answer to Keith so Laurie how does this were like what I think the big question people could have it's like okay premium channels that's great but what do I got I do right well and you don't even have to have premium channels if you have Netflix if you have Hulu if you have some those painted channels if you have Amazon Prime you're gonna have unlimited everything but you don't have to have that you could do PBS you could do u2 and the great thing is you can use your voice so you don't even have to use the remote you were of course including for you a totally high-end remote with voice features built right in even to the remote control but you simply talked to it so now you can talk to your assistant your favorite she starts with an A to turn on and off the TV Alexa show me comedies so look at this all of the comedies just instantaneously came right now you know what okay you know what by the way candy I'm gonna play the role of Alexa rabe in the other room candy would like this she's watching so I have to say this is a crowd-pleaser I mean everybody in your family will use and love this it's it's so funny I'm if you just factored out the premium channel aspect of this I would tell you it's worth it I am so obsessed with my Alexa I actually travel with the dot because of do you yeah otherwise I'm talking to the air it's like Alexa and she's not there if I happen to be in a hotel room so all the functions and features that you love with your Alexa device and then all the things that you'll love with your fire device right exactly it's all coming together Alexa show me chick flicks we turn up the volume on her hair so look at this all of the girls shows that you want to watch instantaneously come right up so is searching via voice across 190 different channels has to be able to breathe world of television into one place you can talk to it now by the way you could go remote free yes you wanted yes this will still work the the Alexa functions will work with your TVs TVs on or off turn off the TV okay turned it right off she's very soft but here's the great thing you could have lost your remote in the couch cushions a long time ago you don't know where it is you don't even need your remote you we use the power of your voice Alexa turn on the TV okay so there it is turning on the TV has never been easier because you have your digital personal assistant so Alexa what's the weather and look at how do you have this gorgeous visual that shows you everything right on that screen so it's just like your Amazon echo but now it's using your television for you to be able to show you the weather the traffic add things to your shopping list it does it all well and what's so great about this is she also when we say this is mindful of your budget so say you're looking for a specific movie say you're looking for a specific actor or actress not only will your fire slash Alexa find all of those movies or actors or actresses for you she also knows what premium channels you subscribe salutely so she won't ask you to pay for something that maybe your is already on a service that you have exactly and that's the genius behind this if anyone who's in love with their LexA like I am I'm it's like you want a little exit everywhere with my wish my car had a like stop because I'm so addicted to it and what's really awesome about this is yes we are about really keeping your budget on track we're about helping you stay more organized I don't know that will show the commercial again but if we do I if you take a look at that videotape it's really about household management it's much more than just watching your favorite movie or TV show online it's about organizing your family it's a media player it's a media streamer I mean so it's something as simple as turning on the television or doing a shopping list or fine you know you know what the local traffic is but it's so great because remember those days I you know I grew up with the Jetsons I love that car you that car but you it's so funny a lot of things like we're in the Space Age just happening now it's happening now many devices like this really is and you want to be able to speak to that personal assistant to manage your smart home to turn on and off your lights you to find restaurants Alexa show me nearby restaurants so look at this this is gonna show you nice Alexa Moore again you don't have to touch a remote because you're gonna scroll with your voice Alexa home always go back to your whole menu and then I love this for smart home I have a ring doorbell right so you can use this to see your front door Oh Alexa show me my front door okay oh come on on the big screen I'm gonna be able to see it's just waiting to load it but I'm gonna be able to see what's going on my friends were there it is there's my front door which by the way whenever we start these presentations poor Pam on Facebook life she's like my Alexa keeps waking up so sorry when Lori and I were meeting about the show in the makeup room our my makeup artist she prints in her dot she's like I use it like I'm she's like you have to quit saying her name well you can change the name I actually got Amazon fire tablets for the kids for Christmas and Lexi is very close to Alexa that's my niece's names like you can change the name if you need to and the big thing is Oh Valerius I hope I'm saying that right I have to start wearing my reader your readers on the air but asking about being connected to Wi-Fi so let's about set up I woke up and what you need yeah over real quickly to show you here in just a second so you're gonna need Wi-Fi for this you do need to have Wi-Fi in your home if it's high-speed Internet or you can use it with the analog to because we're also including the adapter for you to be able to plug it in via ethernet but and you do need an HDMI cable so let me run over and show you because this is a really really simple and easy install you just plug it in that is all there is to it so here's the back of our high-definition TV this is gonna work basically any television created it in the last 12 years or so you have that HDMI port right here and most of us have our HDMI cables so all you do is you look for that port right there at the back of your TV and you plug in your HDMI okay and then on your fire TV cube which is this great unobtrusive beautiful little box crafted by Amazon look at how beautiful this is all you're doing is you're plugging in your HDMI right into there that's all there is to it and then you're plugging this into power so power adapter HDMI into your TV and then you either need Wi-Fi or you can use Ethernet for you know for your Wi-Fi if you don't have high-speed Wi-Fi going through your home that's all there is to it so when I say you can literally be up and running with more TV shows getting rid of maybe that cable box in that spare bedroom of course you might want the cable box in your main living room but even in your master bedroom maybe you just want to unleash the world of TV maybe you want your favorite digital personal assistant this is gonna be that do-it-all device for you that you can have up and running in minutes it is but as an example I'm neither one of my televisions in my house sadly our our Smart TVs right so even for someone like myself they are digital TVs but they don't have you know I can't access Netflix I can't access my Hulu I can't access you know a lot of the things that I watch on my tablet which that's fine but I want it on the big screen yeah so now you have access to that and remember it is the lowest price in America in fact it's an even lower price than Amazon so it's the best price that you're gonna find it is 16 dollars on your credit card you get the cube of course you get the remote you can go remote free so you can just talk to it if you so choose remember the alexa functions do work whether or not the television is on or just a real quick disclaimer though when we talk about turning the TV on and your ring doorbell do I need one of those little smart plugs or how do I it's a quick setup process when you get your toe and it walked me through okay and it trained itself to turn on and off not only my television but also my Z Vox soundbar oh no no I don't even need that remote control at all which is so handy and then if you know what you want to watch it's so easy Alexa play Manchester by the sea Alexa play Manchester by the sea so you just tell it what you want to do or this this couldn't be more timely you know what Ian wants to know on Facebook a little two stereo speakers oh yeah I mean this is and all of that so all of that candy you are always so sweet you know I always so appreciate you and all of our friends who are watching tonight they're you know I think for a lot of us out there whether it's accessing things that maybe you can't even access on your cable company maybe you've got a digital television but it's not a smart TV and you want to be able to upgrade to that this really puts content of whatever you want to watch in the palm of your hands and I guess for all intents and purposes it means never having to say that there's nothing to watch on television right because actually oh you're in complete control and then you're really also in control of your life yeah yeah unless weather traffic order and a pizza you can do anything uber Alexa add eggs to my shopping list and then when I go to my phone and I have my free Alexa app downloaded it's gonna show me this list so I'll be at the store and pull that up which is so handy and then you can even do a voice search using your remote control you've got a little voice button right here who's your favorite actor you have a favorite Hugh Jackman I knew it I dreamed about it last night don't tell his wife Alexa show me huge Ackman oh my gosh so all of his movies greatest showmen anything on YouTube this is gonna pull all of it up right here on your television and again you don't have to have those paste services if you do have Netflix if you do have Hulu if you do have prime video you're gonna unlock even more but this is so much fun it's a great way to get to your YouTube videos or PBS if you love educational programs it's gonna be great for the kids if you're like me and I have a kid and I'm always trying to keep them entertained this is the ultimate way to get to the kids shows and the videos that he's crazy about and it always picks up where you left off easily it knows Stephanie and Katherine Stephanie wants to know subscription to animal Amazon Prime in order to get the content if you are a prime member you're gonna have access to all of that entire world of additional content right so that is something you might consider but you don't have to have it to have a great experience with her fire TV and then Katherine's asking about HBO HBO Frieda that must be a so there are and this will show you so you can go by top rated there are a couple categories here that say if you even if you don't have any

interest or fees I got a new mattress for the guest bedroom fabulous cookware set for my sister's wedding and a little something just for me flexpay gives me the flexibility to buy what I need now

free of cruelty full of what's good free of what's fake bareMinerals join us for the launch of Bare Minerals on HSN actually I know you just saw a little videotape footage of bareMinerals I will actually be launching that tomorrow night at midnight so I'm looking forward to that always great to have you here I'm Shannon Smith we are facebooking live we're showing you how your electronics can save you money and enhance your life and certainly when it comes to enhancing your life I think gone are the days where a computer was really a luxury item this is a necessity you know whether it's using it for work or play games watching your favorite television shows online as we've been talking all night long it's from our well America's Sweetheart brand this is the number one name when it comes to laptops there are a number one brand name here at HSN and that means HP does some things for us that they don't do for anybody else this is loaded in fact this is the latest and greatest from AMD if you watch the ball drop in New York City you know very well AMD is responsible for all those jumbo Tron's or if you love the movies with the little lightsabers they are really the processing company that Hollywood and Broadway rely on not only is that really kind of the fuel for the engine if you kick the tires and look under the hood on your computer it is also the largest screen size that we have it is a 17.3 inch it's a touchscreen which in this price just blows my mind loaded with software and features all you do is choose your color and then whether or not you'd like us to include Microsoft Office or not so let me show you that if purchased separately and then would turn joe harrison loose cuz oh wow this is a really abbreviated presentation I need to shut up Joe I need to let you loose so it's almost a thousand dollar value and actually to upgrade to that Microsoft Office it's actually less money to do here than you would normally play about pay in a retail store also 12 month VIP financing how are you to do this in like 15 minutes there's so many things to talk about including we tripled the warranty as well right so a lot of us have questions when you get a brand new computer how about three years of total tech premium or any question you have how do you wirelessly connect to your printer how do you sync up your old data from your old computer to the new have you ever been on Facebook they'll walk you through it it's fantastic to be able to have that three year warranty and the reason why we did it specifically on this computer is because there's a brand new processor on the inside it is a new technology from AMD I just came back from the Consumer Electronics Show they were so excited to be able to talk about this because it's a new technology called the rise in three now why Andy crater this was they realize a lot of us are doing more things that we've ever thought with our computer like Shannon a lot of us are on the webcam robbers are taking photos a lot of us want to make movies you're doing more multimedia than you thought because a lot of people think oh I just need a computer that's surfed the Internet B every internet webpage now has a movie that you can stream has all these interactive graphics you need to have a processor that can handle it that's what that Rison 3 was designed you know what J I'm gonna put you in hold for just a moment because we want to spend a lot of time talking about the processor but since it is such an abbreviated presentation I gotta apologize for that we want to at least show you your color choices that joke and fill in the blanks on the Texan specs that pink is exclusive to us here at HSN that is always our number one choice here at the network there's your beautiful blue we're calling this do we call it Merlot in the system we call it in Burgundy and it really is like a burgundy like it well I always say Merlot cuz of course my go-to wine rose gold Thank You Yosef and then of course I think Rick you were telling me the gold that is the pink ring there's the pink that Joe is showing on so pink and then is it the gold that's most limited okay gold and the silver I'll just kind of if you guys can see that zhuzh it's like a nice soft matte or brushed gold and then a nice soft matte or brushed silver remember 12 month VIP financing you choose it with or without office without office it's $91 on your flex pay basically $100 if you choose the office if you use our HSN card you're looking at less than $50 which is crazy that's with office and then $45 and 83 cents if you're doing the version without office so I'm sorry to digress but the the AMD processor this is a big big deal that this is in this computer it's a big deal gives you that power that we want but Shannon it also gives you a longer-lasting battery life it's more energy efficient normally when you go to a bigger screen it requires more battery a faster processor requires more battery what AMD is does is they created something new called an APU where traditionally there's a graphics card and there's a processor those two guys talk back and forth caused a lot of delay and is combined them to give you faster boot up times but also what they call all-day computing on a 17 inch screen you're lucky to get a to be maybe a three hour battery life this is now better than eight hours of battery life it's incredible and even when you have a touchscreen that now requires more battery life still over eight hours of battery life and it only takes 45 minutes by the way to get up to 55 percent oh okay percent your battery life it's incredible to be able to have that type of quick connect from HP but you can still see I'm playing a game over here I'm flipping through my photos I'm over here on the wall on the on the web page so I can pinch I can zoom it's fast it's responsive but I still have all these other programs that are running in the background so when we talk about this processor it gives you the absolute power for your kids and yourself be able to do your research but also be able to sit back and watch movies also be able to flip through all your photos no delay what's the left kill and once more my apologies we were just this is about half the time that we would normally have can you take us on a tour of the computer because I don't want to leave anything out because when we talk about all the options normally in this price range that's where manufacturers get what I would call an entry-level price on a 17 inch laptop so that's when they start taking away ports that's when you do not get a backlit keyboard right and wait what is the weight on this because it's not that it only weighs 5.9 pounds oh wow that's one of the lightest 17 inch like when you see a big screen oh my gosh that thing's gonna be a brick and you're not gonna carry it most laptops weigh in the 10 to 12 pound range this one weighs 5.9 pounds it's incredible to be able to have that type of weight but also when you see its edge to edge it is beautiful screen as you tip it forward your Shanon starts talking about the details that you're getting I'm gonna turn the keyboard on see that it's backlit every key right there there's a perfect shop for it now that's an upgrade right there there's an upgrade something loud Pete not a lot of people asked for but man when you start using that backlit keyboard you were going to love it it's true even having the extra-wide touch display so makes it easier to be able to navigate through there on the side I love what HP is done because we're including this one port this one Drive what you're gonna love it's a dvd/cd burner drive less than 10% of computers have this drive we're including it because we know it's a big deal for you you can also watch your movies on here you can make your own home movies you can make CDs if you want to takes only 30 seconds to make a CD takes you about a minute to make a DVD great way to backup all of your photos and your documents especially do taxes put it on a CD that way you have it forever USB ports that are connected on there when you flip it on over to the other side additional ports two more USB ports there's an HDMI port so if you want to plug this directly into your TV you can do that there's also an Ethernet port right there so you can plug this into high-speed internet on the inside what you can't see is the fastest wireless that we have ever offered so now if you're complaining how slow the internet is that new wireless card on the inside is designed to be connected and stay connected and it's incredible that you put all this power together still less than six pounds that's eight hour battery well and remember HSN exclusive all we ask you to do is to pick your color of choice it's a good thing that we brought in more of the version with office because that's the most popular choice tonight but we only have a couple thousand of the version without office so just you know you said information for what you will as you're making your buying decision of course as always welcome to shop seven days a week 24 hours a day here at HSN if you are new first and foremost welcome welcome to HSN flex pay if you're unfamiliar with it means that we take really all major credit cards here but you can split up those payments if that helps keep you onboard with your budget for the new year I actually use my debit card so that's kind of handy if you're trying to keep those credit cards you know free and easy if you will 30 day unconditional money back guarantee on everything that we offer we're also doing free shipping here as well and I have to say for a lot of us out there Joe no matter where our New Year's resolutions have taken us this year a computer is a great place to start because whether it's getting on budget get that Microsoft Office and boy you can you can do your spreadsheets in your budget and your taxes and all that great stuff if it's losing weight there's so many applications that you can actually take a yoga class via the internet you'll find a new job and then I know we don't have it supported graphically but there is three year there's a three year support with this as well right that's right when you end up getting this guy at home the great thing about having this is that this is going to be your key to having all that extra layers of support so not only you're going to have the the meal easy plan so if you want to try a new meal plan for the next year maybe one get a help the healthier and lifestyle you can do that there's a password genie on here so it's going to be able to keep all your passwords in one central location there's movie editing this photo editing there's that three year of total tech premium so any question you have for the next three years you know it could be how to use that webcam that's on the top how do you use the touchscreen how do you download an app those guys are there to help you out it's fantastic and when you have a computer that this fast it is so quick as I'm going from program to program you're gonna do new things you've never thought of before because you're no longer waiting on that system even the sound and the touchscreen is more advanced most computers just have like a high ten T sound but this has that mid-range and that deeper bass - so it really has an incredible sound and notice that as I'm moving around here I can hit every key that I want to because most devices only have two touch points this one actually has 10 touch points Wow it's the most advanced touchscreen that we've had and the reason why I love having these bigger 17 shannon's is that my kids use the 17 inch for schoolwork and a lot of times like here we are on the White House website so if you want to research on a website and then you come over here and you have to type it up and it's kind of small because you can't fit both things at the same time but what you can do now with your hp's you slide slide one the word document to the one side bring the White House document to the other so now I've got a full eight nap by 11 inch sheet of paper true multitasking only because you have the bigger better soup can I ask you a silly question and so basically even if somebody is watching this show and there's how did Joe do that touchscreen how did he do this so the how do you do its are included with that technical support exactly right how do i hook up a printer how do i there there's HDMI so I could how do i hook this up to my television could wirelessly sync the content from your TV to your Smart TV they can watch which is really interesting because by the way we're still getting questions on our today's special Sandy real quickly remember the today's special you are correct only well I should say only works with two TVs so if you do have three you know that leaves in one of them out of you know you would at be looking at two today's specials but I guess my whole point is a lot of our questions and again we love having you there thank you so much for watching and shopping and interacting with us but a lot of the specific questions that people are asking about our today's special if you had a specific question about this computer you're getting your geeks in the box so all those specific things again how do i hook it up with my TV how do I use it with my wireless printer how do I do a split screen like Joe was doing it's like having a Joe in every box that's fantastic I go to college for the stuff the thing is a lot of us use the software that we're including today especially microsoft office if you need office highly recommend you get a version they're giving you a discount if you buy it with your computer today and this is not the abbreviated abbreviated version of Office it's an entire list that you see right next to me it's word its Excel it's Outlook it's publisher it's OneNote it's access it is a PowerPoint the entire gamut and it's good you see it down there the graphic it says access to one computer which will be your HP but this is one tablet and then one phone three devices get Microsoft Office for the next year that's included with it on top of that you also get access to Microsoft support so if you have any questions about office they have 365 day support that you're going to get with office 365 so it's a great way to be able to have that interactive experience and I love the way Microsoft has set this up so when I bring this up this is my Start menu over here on the right side these are my favorites like there's my office programs right there there's checking my email there's accessing my photos that all of my favorite programs that I have down there on the left side it's every program I've ever downloaded and keep in mind give me a terabyte worth of space you can download thousands and thousands of programs and not worry about running out of room and even if you want to access your photos you just click on your photo section I'm gonna go full screen here it finds every picture you took it makes it so easy Shannon to have that organization because now I'm not hunting and trying to find my photos it knows where the photo is now so many of us over the holiday season you had some people come over and you want to upload a photo you want to put it on YouTube you want to do some edits to it the editing software has never been easier than it is today especially when you have that touch screen so I just brought the photo I found it and then come over here I can add these different filters there's a slight filter it's got a little slide bar in the bottom so I can adjust the intensity this one Sahara that one's called a Zeke there are all these different programs on all these different filters that are built into it and then once I have that done I can now upload that to Facebook I can upload to YouTube I can upload to Twitter if I want to all because those programs are built inside top of that I still have everything else running in the background it's an extreme powerful computer but it's super lightweight and I love the fact that has that eight hour battery life that's huge most of times when you get these bigger screens the faster processors you're limited to two hours of battery life this is eight hours so really it's all day computer fast charge as well candy you don't even know how you're you're you're stacking the deck she's asking about is it good for gaming oh my god little known fact about Joseph Harrison he is a closet gamer he is like a crazy gamer so I put that in your wheelhouse my friend well the great thing is as they go fullscreen on my game or this one that we have right here this actually has an updated video card as well called the Radeon video card and AMD is the processor that's built behind Xbox built behind a Playstation those specifically we're designed for gaming this can now handle all your games too so if you play battlefield or you play candy crush or maybe you play solitaire from time to time it can handle any type of game that's out there because there's absolutely zero hesitation in the performance well actually speaking of which I was referencing AMD in Hollywood isn't it true that AMD processors are used like in the Playstations and the X boxes and that's right so even though the switch uses a plus AMD processor chip it's a credit because it's really the medium so honestly Oh what color keyboard on the gold good question the oh they're all black except for the pink so pink in front of her so you'll see it as that's the only one that has that pink keyboard all of them have the backlit keyboard all of them have the full-size keyboard with a numeric pad they all have the extended trackpad down below but the pink is exclusive and only has range oh yeah absolutely otherwise you're looking at a black keyboard but remember they are all backlit which really helps with either visual acuity it just makes it easy to work a big thing for us though is HP did this only and exclusively for us they are America's Sweetheart brand they sell more laptops than anybody else so if you want the same processor that is used and your Xboxes and your Playstations or on the Jumbotrons in Times Square if you only got it for graphics and let's be honest everything that we do whether it's watching cat videos on Facebook or you know just check-in your emails whatever we're doing on our computer were it's some kind of visual medium so this makes it bright and brilliant I mean honestly it's so good it almost looks like a high-definition or like a 3d screen basically even a box art that's on here and this is access to the Windows Store if you want to download some of your favorite movies there's over 700,000 apps and games and movies right here Shannon so it really becomes that ultimate entertainment absolutely Debbie wants no SD card slot yes it does and also three USB ports in HTML you get a little rest when you back she's looking so pretty and she um I'll be back tomorrow night with bareMinerals at midnight I hope to see you then keep calling the thing I love most about shopping at HSN do I have to pick just one I'd have to say flex pay it allows me to get the things I want now and make monthly payment without any interest or fees I got a new mattress for the guest bedroom a fabulous cookware set for my sister's wedding and a little something just for me flexpay gives me the flexibility to buy what I need now without the stress of having to pay for it all at once and no interest be that layaway my singular goal is to improve the quality of people's lives everything we do is intended to be unlike any other company of our we just
