 from around the globe it's thecube with digital coverage of dell technologies world digital experience brought to you by dell technologies hi i'm stu miniman and this is thecube's coverage of dell technologies world digital experience happy to welcome to the program first we have a first time guest akanksha marotra she's a vice president of marketing with dell technologies joining us one of our cube alumni caitlin gordon she's the vice president of product marketing also with dell technologies caitlin welcome back akanksha welcome to the program thank you stu for having me all right so you know one of the big models we've been talking about for the last few years is is a change in how customers acquire things big thing we've talked about for many years this shift from capex to opex how cloud is impacting everything jeff clark in the keynote was was talking about it's the dell technologies on demand dtod i guess is the you know four-letter acronym we we use a concha help us uh understand a little bit from your standpoint you know what is it you know why is it important to your customer yeah yeah so so stu as you as you heard is as part of the keynote you know from from jeff and others earlier today we've been working really hard to bring the benefits of on-demand i.t to our customers um you know on private cloud public cloud and edge and certainly this year especially you know we've seen a lot of interest in this um covet has catalyzed customer interest and flexible consumption and as a service um you know as we talk with our customers and partners we hear this almost daily um it's required a level of agility that that candidly traditional capex based models simply haven't been able to provide i mean imagine taking your workforce remote over the weekend and the and the stress that puts on your infrastructure and so i think that's that's kind of forced i.t to consider some of these alternatives another factor has also been you know companies have been wanting to preserve capital right and and avoid large cash uh outlays and and having this type of flexibility and being able to pay for infrastructure as doors you're using it so you know gives them a way to do that so um i mean those are some of the customer drivers that we've seen um last year at uh at del tech summit around the this time last year actually in november time frame we introduced dell technologies on demand as our umbrella program for our flexible consumption and as a service solutions and really what it what it seeks to do is make it easier for customers to get the simplicity and flexibility of cloud you know along with the performance and security of on-premises infrastructure so it's giving them a range of consumption models that include both payment options as well as services that can they can apply on any one of the products in our portfolio from you know end user devices to core data center infrastructure to hybrid cloud solutions um and uh you know we announced that last year one of the things that you um you know heard about today and that we're announcing um you know over this event is that we're continually looking to make it easier and simpler for our customers um you know with various turnkey offerings and simpler offerings for them given the interest that we've seen yeah um i i want to key off of you mentioned uh the the impact of covet 19 and for your customers it's something we've definitely seen that the promise of cloud always has been to be highly flexible we can scale up we can scale down we know that some services out there aren't always as flexible as we might hope there's certain sas solutions where you're signing up for a multi-year offering and even for the cloud i might lock in some savings by buying uh something in bulk um so you know help us understand you know what what are the benefits that your customer sees the savings uh that that they get and you know is this truly you know cloud flexible which means i can you know burst up and scale as i need and i can you know if it reaches the point oh hey i need half the capacity for the next six months can i do that yeah yeah absolutely so um so stu we we actually commissioned idc to talk to a few of our customers so you know let me maybe share some of the benefits that they saw in broad terms and then i can i can maybe share uh you know a specific example of what a particular customer saw um so we had idc talked to you know several of the customers using dell technologies on-demand models um various geos and and various sort of you know sizes and what they found was that on average they saw about a 23 lower cost of storage operations per year which is great right you know lower lower cost of operations is always great ikea's always looking for those efficiencies especially you know in the current environment but that's not all i think that's just sort of part of the story uh what they also shared with us is that you know these types of models were able to help them become much more agile in how they work and change how they work um and what they found was that they saw 54 fewer incidents of downtime and and you know they were 92 percent faster in their ability to deploy storage capacity because they have that capacity on the you know in their data center available ready for that spike you know when their business saw it um so those are just some of the broad examples um of what our customers have seen another specific example that i would would share with you is a large multinational institution you know a financial services company uh we've been working with them for years to service their you know enterprise scale private cloud and then more recently they had us also you know manage their storage as a service manage utility and they've seen phenomenal results you know they've been able to get 50 more compute power at eight percent lower cost um and and you know ninety percent faster or reduce time and provisioning data uh it's it's it's all about the you know yes it's about the cost savings but really it's about the agility that the business gets right and as you know as as you started out right with covet um you know they really needed that agility and that flexibility and having these models um available ready to spike ready to go down right um have been able to provide that yeah and i think another thing we've seen is people rush to cloud because it promised that agility right and we've had those conversations before is there's a reality of what that means which it might not be the resiliency you're looking for it also might not actually be as simple as you thought it might be and we're seeing some of that come back on-prem whether you need resiliency or performance or security or you don't want to be really locked into a specific public cloud but you still want to have that agility and the benefits of really running your data center in a service oriented model and that trend has been picking up over the past couple years and as we've already said a couple times today we've seen that accelerate but also we starting to see more customers ask for it it's not just the big and more uh strategic and really aggressive customers that are looking for this more and more customers are kind of seeing that this is the end game and that's kind of leans into where we're going which is how do we make this more accessible to others yeah well caitlin you're using one of my punch lines uh that i've used for a number of years now is remember when we knew thought that cloud was inexpensive and easy to use it it's not uh and if we look at what customers are doing it's a hybrid model uh they're deploying in in multiple environments we're seeing the public cloud look more like the enterprise and the enterprise look more like uh the public cloud so these offerings of you know op acts flexibility and the like make a whole lot of sense so you you've said that you know you've seen a lot of growth especially this year any metrics you can give us on you know adoption i love the one customer example in the financial space anything else to kind of paint the picture as to you know how prevalent this is becoming yeah um maybe i'll i'll get it started so you know we've seen nearly you know 50 year and year growth um in the in the customer base um you know over our most recent quarter um and it's growing we've seen over 500 percent increase um year urine you're in signed contracts um customer demand in these types of models um you know has caused us you know to expand our offerings to you know into countries like brazil chile colombia india and china i mean we already offered about you know 50 plus countries and along with our partner network and even more so i mean those are just you know some of the data points around you know business traction um in the in the in the models that we have another um another proof point that um you know i could sort of point you to is that um in april we include uh we announced a payment flexibility program uh which gave our customers you know a number of promotions and options um you know to extend uh this flexibility into you know across our portfolio and into other parts of our businesses and just recently about a month ago we extended that and we've seen really good traction in that as well so um i think overall like you said um you know there's there's aspects about uh public cloud that customers really like and they tell us hey i want to be able to you know pay as i go i want to be able to um you know extend and contract the infrastructure as i'm using it i want a simple management experience but then as katelyn said you know they realize that oh but i don't want to you know pay for the refactoring and then the egress and the ingress charges and you know some of my workloads are better off on premises for performance locality security compliance reasons right and and therein lies the promise of as a service for on-prem infrastructure because really ik is looking for the best of both worlds and and this gives you that right you can use the um consumption models to to grow and shrink as you need it you can use the payment models to to only pay for what you're using um and um you know along with our partner network you can have it in the location that you want right so you you can sort of have your cake and eat it too yeah and i would just add on to that is that more and more the conversation is both about how can i consume that more as a service and pay for just what i'm using but also how can i spend less time maybe zero time and energy actually managing that infrastructure and how can i then allocate the time energy resources into running my business and investing in more strategic things so it becomes both an important financial conversation but even more so a conversation about how it can empower the business which really just changes what we're able to do for customers it's it's an exciting kind of transition to see this really evolve into really not talking about products anymore and helping our customers evolve their business well caitlin that's a really interesting point uh i want you to talk to us a little bit about the dell tech storage as a service you know how does that fit we were just talking about don't want to talk about products we want to talk about really moving to that full opex model so so help connect the dots for us yeah and so we're really excited about this this will be coming in the first half of next year as you probably heard earlier today and what we're doing here is we've really taken what we already have had in market and we've really upped that to the next level we've accelerated the simplicity of what we offer here and think of the experiences all starting in a single console where you just pick four things what's the type of storage you want what's the performance you want how much and for how long that's it and then now we're counting the time from then to when it's in your data center in days not months not weeks but in days and we're able to get you up and going and it's your data center of your choice whether that's on-prem in your own data center or litocolo facility we bring that equipment in we get that deployed we manage it for you you operate it and you simply pay for what you use so you're really in a quick time to value you're in a very simple model and you're not really responsible for managing infrastructure that's really on us and that moves you into being in a true opex model and it also enables you to accelerate what you're able to leverage that whether it's block storage file storage you can get up and running quickly and let us worry about how to manage the infrastructure and we give you the ability to operate what you need to yeah caitlin maybe if you could give us a little bit of color as to what happens behind the scenes to make that work because it sounds wonderful you've had the program around for a year these aren't trivial things that you're talking about all the logistics the management you know the the gear you know making sure that the physical and the power and everything is all set so you know help us understand you know the engineering uh the development and you know what this means from kind of services and go to market to make a solution like this work yeah in a lot of ways we're having to change our entire business to help our customers change theirs you know it goes from top to bottom and you'll get to hear a lot more about it when we're actually available next year but when you think about it we have a lot of the dna we have a lot of the experience we have the technology but we almost have to completely flip the script on ourselves of how we deliver it who our customer is what our then end user customer needs from us and what the role of things like our global services organization is what the role of our global sales organization is and how do we accelerate providing outcomes to our customers and get the rest out of their way and the fact that i haven't mentioned a product name but by the way we actually have industry leading products in pretty much every category so of course on the back end all of this is going to be powered by our industry leading storage solutions like power store will be in your data center but at the same time we will actually have worked to really mask that you don't even need to know that nor do you need to really operate much beyond what you need to to really run your business and that's really it's been an interesting uh work for us to just flip how we think about everything and you'll hear a whole lot more about it next year as we really bring this out into market but it's been really fun and a big learning for everyone excellent well yeah something something power is underneath there right right right caitlyn um all right want to let you both uh give us the final takeaway uh for the deltek on demand akongsha start with you and uh just give us the final takeaway yeah so i i think look um you know i you know back to kind of what we were talking about um we've actually been offering these types of solutions to our customers for a really long time you know through dell financial services we've been offering payment flexibility for over 23 years over 15 years and manage utility so the customer example that i gave you is a customer who's running storage as a service and has been for many years i think building all that experience listening to our customers you know feedback over that time period and over you know of course this past year we're looking to apply all of that to make it even more simpler for them to consume our infrastructure um you know in the near future and so storage as a service is going to be a really exciting proof point of that um you know the the the momentum stats and and some of the other things that i shared with you today and that you're going to hear about over the next couple days or another proof point of it but you know we're excited um about this and and looking forward to continuing the dialogue and you know with our customers with our partners and and with you yeah and i would i'll kind of play off of one of your words there which is this is all about simplicity for us is how do we take what we've been able to do for a lot of our customers accelerate that simplify it to a point where we can offer that for all of our customers and we're really looking to accelerate this first with storage and then get all of our offerings really into this model because it's really about getting our customers out of managing infrastructure get them the time energy resources to manage their business and simplicity is paramount to making sure that happens caitlin and congrats thank you so much for giving us the updates uh congratulations all the progress and definitely looking forward to hearing more beginning of next year thanks for joining thanks dude thank you stu all right i'm stu miniman this is dell technology world digital experience i'm stu miniman and thank you as always for watching
