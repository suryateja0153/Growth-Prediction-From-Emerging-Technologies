 when choosing a cloud service provider for your enterprise mission critical workloads there are four things that you should consider performance and predictability your cloud service provider should have service level agreements covering manageability and performance to ensure that resources are not oversubscribed or over provisioned deployment and migration options the choice between private public hybrid cloud zero downtime migration options and support for the broadest range of infrastructure choices including bare metal and the latest in high-performance computing GPUs network architecture you should look for a software-defined layer 3 network topology or isolated network virtualization which takes network and IO off of the server stack security a security first designed which reduces the risk from hypervisor is resilient to firmware based attacks and offers a comprehensive set of security solutions from core all the way through edge services in today's workshop you will learn what Oracle is the best place for your enterprise and mission critical workloads with one-click provisioning for Oracle and third party applications including over 4,500 certified ISP applications from our marketplace you can quickly bring your application into Oracle cloud infrastructure then dynamically scale that application horizontally and vertically and finally extend that application with rich past services including things like intelligent BOTS and mi driven analytics let's take a look at the demonstration to find out what makes Oracle so unique today we're looking at a retail organization that needs to scale rapidly due to increased demand for online ordering this organization needs to quickly port their application for the cloud as is support its existing infrastructure databases operating systems and process once in the cloud they need to elastically scale the app to meet increased demand set up high availability and disaster recovery configurations extend the app with cloud native tools rather than expanding their existing code base in this demonstration we will show you how customers can easily migrate existing on-premise at custom applications or is V applications into Oracle cloud infrastructure we'll walk through how customers can use intuitive open-source tooling to migrate custom images accelerate dev and test cycles leverage out-of-the-box integrations and analytics tools rather than retooling the existing infrastructure so imagine that we have John in the infrastructure architect who's looking to move his retail companies online storefront to the cloud first John needs to capture a snapshot of his existing on-premise application and import it into the cloud from there he's going to provision a virtual machine with that custom image and all necessary underlying networking and infrastructure the next step requires making this application highly available with a disaster recovery configuration we'll use open source tooling such as our sync to copy this VM to a separate region and then use DNS services and traffic management steering policies to create a failover mechanism should one of the primary nodes go down finally we'll leverage Oracle integration cloud Oracle analyst cloud and autonomous data warehouse to extend their current capabilities without having to expand their existing card base in conjunction with all of this we'll be leveraging security tools such as cloud access security broker data safe and others to make sure that the application is safe and secure as it's being moved to the cloud so ramier let's take a look at how this takes place within the Oracle cloud infrastructure console so I've already imported the custom image into you OCI from here it becomes a matter of spinning up the virtual machine and from here I simply need to supply a number of parameters to create the virtual machine with a custom image so I'll give it a name and then I'll choose an image your operating system now this is a major differentiator for work of cloud because we have a huge breadth and depth of images to choose from some of them are Oracle images so things such as our jde environments some of them are platform images such as Windows Server 2012 2016 some of them are partner images such as Altair PBS professional and others we also have different flavors of virtual machines to do search use so things like high performance compute GPUs bare-metal and others in this instance we actually want a custom image the OS commerce demo snapshot that I've imported so from here we have OS commerce demo I'll select this image and import it in well then choose an availability domain you can think of this like a virtual data center I'll choose a shape and then provision all underlying infrastructure so the virtual cloud network the subject that is going to be in whether it'll have a public or private address security rules route rules and others we're taking the liberty actually of spinning up this virtual machine from here we can see that it's already running an online once I'm here the next step to be cut is to validate whether the OS commerce application is running so we can see our storefront right here and I have a couple of different movie titles now that my OS commerce application is online and running the next step becomes making this application highly available with a disaster recovery configuration come on a persona perspective this would be something that would be highly important not only to John as the VP of infrastructure but also to anyone who's a CTO or C ISO making sure that that application is resilience to any type of underlying issue is critical the way that we're going to accomplish this is with a combination of traffic steering policies and DNS capabilities now the Oracle cloud of instructor console itself has a whole breadth and depth of DNS tools if I go under the networking console right here I can go down to DNS zone management and take a look at what the offerings are so from here I can see any zones that I'm currently managing I can see any load balancers that I have spun up I can manage any VPN cyclic VPNs that I have configured and I can also create traffic management steering policies that in this instance is what we're going to do I've already taken the liberty of creating a secondary node which is essentially a copy of the initial OS commerce instance that has been lifted and shifted to the cloud we used our sink to make sure that the data was copied between those two instances and the data integrity was maintained the next step will becomes if there is any issues with a primary node creating a policy that will send traffic to that secondary one so from here I can simply click create traffic management steering policy and I have a number of options I can choose things like load balancer failover geolocation steering ASN steering or IP prefix steering in this instance what I'm looking for is the actual fail option she's going to redirect traffic to the next highest priority node when that primary server is unavailable so in this instance I'll give it a name such as OS commerce name I'll give it a TTL in this case standard one of 60 seconds and then I'm going to start configuring my answer pool which essentially are going to have records that we're going to be using as DNS queries so in this case I'll choose something like primary note that it will be my OS commerce primary I'm going to choose an a record and just paste the IP address that I had from the previous tap so let's say it's 1:30 2.1 1011 dot 160 have this primary nage here and I would choose a secondary node for it fell over to so make sure secondary node create OS commerce secondary node and again choosing a record type of egg I put our data in there as well so let's do one one 32.1 11 12 1 6 2 let's say I can then choose the pool priority and attach a health check to make sure that I'm monitoring the availability of any given target within this failover option finally I've attached any domains should I so need and tag it with the appropriate resources once I've created this policy my application is now highly available and has a disaster recovery configuration all within a matter of minutes within the or quantum structure console again it is quite easy to provision and creates these highly available access or cover applications we be using Oracle integration cloud to map the existing data within the my school database that is native to the OS commerce application the destination data with an autonomous data warehouse instance now a huge differentiator here is that autonomous data warehouse instances - lastly scale up and down for CPU and storage they also have self patching self repairing itself securing capabilities to take manual labor out of the equation now I've already taken the liberty of mapping these two together and we've extracted all necessary rows columns and tables and inserted those into the autonomous data warehouse instance from here we can connect to Oracle analytics cloud where we can get deep visualizations into our data so within this console itself I have some sample visualizations such as sales by regions and clusters sales by seasons deal size what have you should you so choose you can also leverage prepackaged artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to get deeper insight into what's going on with your data finally we're using security products to make sure that the application is safe and secure as it's being moved to the cloud we're leveraging cloud access security broker to scan for malicious and suspicious user activity within the cloud environment we're leveraging data safe to make sure that any data that isn't being put into an autonomous data warehouse instance is masked and redacted appropriately finally at the networking tier we have taken the liberty of architecting our networks that nix themselves are not in the boxes which prevents against things such as hypervisor jackings and other malicious attacks as we've seen in today's demonstration Oracle cloud is the best place to run your enterprise mission clinical workloads we offer the broadest set of migration and deployment options in the industry including some things that are very unique to Oracle infrastructure that runs itself like autonomous Linux in autonomous database in our world-class database offerings such as exadata cloud service or exadata cloud app customer our superior network design offers a flat off box virtualized network that guarantees no over subscribing of resources offering you unmatched performance and predictability that's compared to other cloud vendors and finally security our second-generation cloud was designed with security in the DNA of the architecture rather than an afterthought we offer firmware that is resilient to attacks supply chain security encryption by default everywhere in world class security services such as Identity and Access Management cloud access security broker or next-generation web application firewalls we hope you enjoyed the demonstration today and we look forward to working with your team to move some workloads into Oracle cloud infrastructure
