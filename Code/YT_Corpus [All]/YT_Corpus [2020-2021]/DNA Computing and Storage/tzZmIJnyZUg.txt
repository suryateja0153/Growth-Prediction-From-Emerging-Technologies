 Welcome to channel of jetking, the king of skill development here we will learn all subjects in easy language because language should not be a barrier in studies today's our topic is basics of computer network the first question that arrives is what is computer network so when we connect 2 or more devices to each other it is called as a computer network next is what are devices so any thing that is used in the network eg: mobile, laptop, computer which allows us to communicate is called as a device now we will see the classification of network network is of two types first is basic type of network and second is broad type of network basic type has 4 sub types broad has two types peer to peer client to server so these are 2 types of network and their sub types now we will discuss the four types that we saw in basic network pan means personal area network that we use in our personal houses like the wifi or personal hotspot that is used into the personal area within 10 meters Lan is local area network when people make a network in a limited area with high speed it is used to bring 2 or more devices in a network  it works with in 10 meters to 100 meters approx 1km distance can be covered speed is high and not that costly next is man which means metropolitan area network this network is made when we need to join 2 different buildings with in a city it covers from 5km to 10km of distance costlier than lan and cheaper than wan wan means wide area network where we can connect 2 cities to each other or to countries to each other its the largest network which can be created it covers 10lakhs or even more than that now lets move forward to broad types of network this also has two types peer to peer client to server Peer to peer means there are various nodes connected to each other such as: the given figure are all nodes that are interconnected through a hub or a switch as they are connected to each other they can share data with each other or they can communicate with each other next is server to client in the above figure which has the server as its center  and the rest of them are the nodes or client  in client to server nothing can be done without the permission of the server if the client wants to install any application the client needs to request the server and then server will allow and provide the application and then the application can be installed  in peer to peer if any node is destroyed the whole network is not affected but if hub and switch stop working then it is affected in client to server if the server is destroyed then the client cannot do anything and without server the client cannot communicate with each other our last topic is benefits of network which means what is the advantage of it and why we should learn networking so first benefit is internet which is the biggest benefit if today internet would not be there where we would have been you people would not have been able to see this video we could not have been able to use whatsapp, facebook, instagram next benefit is data sharing data sharing is where we can send files send emails and all is a benefit of network third thing is storage we use cloud if we dont have enough devices to store data , we tend to use the cloud services like drive to store data last but not the least, resource sharing in schools and colleges we have seen that one printer is shared amongst all the devices and if we give a print from any it will print which is called as resource sharing we can use scanners, printers, cctv cameras this is all possible because of network and internet to learn such topics please like, share and subscribe and also stay tuned meet you soon!!
