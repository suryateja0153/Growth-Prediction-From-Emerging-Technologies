 bio computers use systems of biologically derived molecules such as DNA in proteins to perform computational calculations involving storing retrieving and processing data the development of bio computers has been made possible by the expanding new science of nano biotechnology the term nano biotechnology can be defined in multiple ways in a more general sense nano biotechnology can be defined as any type of technology that uses both nano scale materials ie materials having characteristic dimensions of 1 to 100 nanometers and biologically based materials a more restrictive definition views nano biotechnology more specifically as the design and engineering of proteins that can then be assembled into larger functional structures the implementation of nano biotechnology as defined in this narrower sense provides scientists with the ability to engineer biomolecular systems specifically so that they interact in a fashion that can ultimately result in the computational functionality of a computer topic scientific background bio computers use biologically derived materials to perform computational functions a bio computer consists of a pathway or series of metabolic pathways involving biological materials that are engineered to behave in a certain manner based upon the conditions input of the system the resulting pathway of reactions that takes place constitutes an output which is based on the engineering design of the bio computer and can be interpreted as a form of computational analysis three distinguishable types of bio computers include biochemical computers biomechanical computers and bio electronic computers topic biochemical computers biochemical computers use the immense variety of feedback loops that are characteristic of biological chemical reactions in order to achieve computational functionality feedback loops in biological systems take many forms and many different factors can provide both positive and negative feedback to a particular biochemical process causing either an increase in chemical output or a decrease in chemical output respectively such factors may include the quantity of catalytic enzymes present the amount of reactants present the amount of products present and the presence of molecules that bind to and thus alter the chemical reactivity of any of the aforementioned factors given the nature of these biochemical systems to be regulated through many different mechanisms one can engineer a chemical pathway comprising a set of molecular components that react to produce one particular product under one set of specific chemical conditions and another particular product under another set of conditions the presence of the particular product that results from the pathway can serve as a signal which can be interpreted along with other chemical signals as a computational output based upon the starting chemical conditions of the system the input topic biomechanical computers biomechanical computers are similar to biochemical computers in that they both perform a specific operation that can be interpreted as a functional computation based upon specific initial conditions which serve as input they differ however in what exactly serves as the output signal in biochemical computers the presence or concentration of certain chemicals serves as the output signal in biomechanical computers however the mechanical shape of a specific molecule or set of molecules under a set of initial conditions serves as the output biomechanical computers rely on the nature of specific molecules to adopt certain physical configurations under certain chemical conditions the mechanical three-dimensional structure of the product of the biomechanical computer is detected and interpreted appropriately as a calculated output topic bioelectronic computers bio computers can also be constructed to perform electronic computing again like both biomechanical and biochemical computers computations are performed by interpreting a specific output that is based upon an initial set of conditions that serve as input in bio electronic computers the measured output is the nature of the electrical conductivity that is observed in the bio electronic computer this output comprises specifically designed biomolecules that conduct electricity in highly specific manners based upon the initial conditions that serve as the input of the bio electronic system topic engineering bio computers the behavior of biologically derived computational systems such as these relies on the particular molecules that make up the system which are primarily proteins but may also include DNA molecules nano bio technology provides the means to synthesize the multiple chemical components necessary to create such a system the chemical nature of a protein is dictated by its sequence of amino acids the chemical building blocks of proteins this sequence is in turn dictated by a specific sequence of DNA nucleotides the building blocks of DNA molecules proteins are manufactured in biological systems through the translation of nucleotide sequences by biological molecules called ribosomes which assemble individual amino acids into polypeptides that form functional proteins based on the nucleotide sequence that the ribosome interprets what this ultimately means is that one can engineer the chemical components necessary to create a biological system capable of performing computations by engineering DNA nucleotide sequences to encode for the necessary protein components also the synthetically designed DNA molecules themselves may function in a particular bio computer system thus implementing nano biotechnology to design and produce synthetically designed proteins as well as the design and synthesis of artificial DNA molecules can allow the construction of functional bio computers eg computational genes bio computers can also be designed with cells as their basic components chemically induced dimerization systems can be used to make logic gates from individual cells these logic gates are activated by chemical agents that induce interactions between previously non-interacting proteins and triggers some observable change in the cell topic economics all biological organisms have the ability to self-replicate and self assemble into functional components the economical benefit of bio computers lies in this potential of all biologically derived systems to self-replicate and self assemble given appropriate conditions for instance all of the necessary proteins for a certain biochemical pathway which could be modified to serve as a bio computer could be synthesized many times over inside a biological cell from a single DNA molecule this DNA molecule could then be replicated many times over this characteristic of biological molecules could make the production highly efficient and relatively inexpensive whereas electronic computers require manual production bio computers could be produced in large quantities from cultures without any additional machinery needed to assemble them topic notable advancements in bio computer technology currently bio computers exist with various functional capabilities that include operations of binary logic and mathematical calculations Tom Knight of the MIT artificial intelligence laboratory first suggested a biochemical computing scheme in which protein concentrations are used as binary signals that ultimately serve to perform logical operations at or above a certain concentration of a particular biochemical product in a bio computer chemical pathway indicates a signal that is either a 1 or a 0 a concentration below this level indicates the other remaining signal using this method as computational analysis biochemical computers can perform logical operations in which the appropriate binary output will occur only under specific logical constraints on the initial conditions in other words the appropriate binary output serves as a logically derived conclusion from a set of initial conditions that serve as premises from which the logical conclusion can be made in addition to these types of logical operations bio computers have also been shown to demonstrate other functional capabilities such as mathematical computations one such example was provided by WL dito who in 1999 created a bio computer composed of leech neurons at Georgia Tech which was capable of performing simple addition these are just a few of the notable uses that bio computers have already been engineered to perform and the capabilities of bio computers are becoming increasingly sophisticated because of the availability and potential economic efficiency associated with producing biomolecules and biochemical a rapidly growing subject of research that is likely to see much progress in the future in March 2013 a team of bio engineers from Stanford University led by Drew endy announced that they had created the biological equivalent of a transistor which they dubbed a transcript or the invention was the final of the three components necessary to build a fully functional computer data storage information transmission and a basic system of logic topic future potential of bio computers many examples of simple bio computers have been designed but the capabilities of these bio computers are very limited in comparison to commercially available non bio computers some people believe that bio computers have great potential but this has yet to be demonstrated topic see also biotechnology computational
