 happy new year everyone let's celebrate the new decade and be a little hopeful about digital health by looking at the top 10 medical technologies of the future here we go if you're a subscriber of the channel you might have heard about most of the following technologies by now you know that we describe digital health developments their impact on your health medicine and healthcare in general so you know all that now for something completely different today we are going to use a scoring system to rank their place in the future of digital health because as we all know the absolute best way to measure the potential of future medical technologies is subjective numerical scores so I'm going to assign a score on a scale from 1 to 10 in three categories how close is the given technology from becoming real the potential impact it can have on health care and accessibility to the masses may the best technology win Health sensors and telehealth in the future as we look back on today's healthcare it will look completely absurd that when something goes wrong with our health we have to get into a car and drive to the nearest facility where we can receive care health sensors and telemedicine will change all of that and make patients the point of care even today variables are mainstream and the Apple watch or the ECG device cardia have such great health functions that have reportedly saved multiple lives by alerting users in time of a serious cardiovascular condition but in the future we will measure not just heart rate and step count but pretty much everything we can from blood pressure to respiration patterns an ECG and so on with a digit or two and with the rise of portable diagnostic devices such as mobile oz or sound scanners or medical tricorders such as this one here medical professionals will be able to obtain most of the information that's needed for an educated diagnosis at the patient's bedside so how close is the given technology from becoming real well many of these have already been available so I will give it a nine out of ten the potential impact it can have on healthcare can you imagine patients living their lives without measuring data that shape their treatment can you imagine how much information and data is will provide physicians with so they can make better decisions with the patient's so eight out of ten and accessibility to the masses it's a harder issue as many of these devices are a bit expensive or simply are not on the market yet so seven out of them the medical futurist index then is 24 mixed reality mixed reality is going to be a key component of the future of healthcare unlike virtual reality that shuts out the outside word and unlike augmented reality that only projects digital information on the real word mixed reality projects content that interacts in the real word environment now I want you to imagine a surgeon preparing for a complicated brain surgery in the future the hospital received the armored images and a mixed reality device renders it into a three-dimensional holographic image the doctor can take a look at the problematic area analyze it layer by layer and plan their entire intervention why they could literally zoom in and out of the patient before making the first incision imagine medical students study anatomy in groups by dissecting a holographic body without physical limitations or the formaldehyde smell so there are examples for using mixed reality even today but you won't see these devices going mainstream so I would give it a six out of ten the potential impact can be significant but it will not be a life-changer five out of ten these devices are expensive and wild costs go down it remains steadily unreachable for the masses five out of ten the magic curvature is the index is 17 surgical and medical robotics to stay with that brain surgeon for a second also imagine that they have a surgical robot at his disposal the doctor can practice and find the absolute best way to operate on the patient and let the robot support their procedure then then reaching absolute precision and no shaking hands some surgical robots could follow pre-programmed protocols and become semi or even fully autonomous in performing surgery deaths our robotics can become a perfect tool in the hands of physicians but robots can also disrupt healthcare in more ways machines don't need sleep or food don't have prejudices and definitely won't grant about why they need to complete the same monotones test for the thousandth time for example disinfecting a hospital room in minutes bringing medicine up to the tenth floor or provide elderly patients with companionship thousands of surgical robots work in hospitals today but there is still a long road ahead so six out of them the impact of automation regarding physical and repetitive tasks could be huge on the medical workforce eight out of ten but the vast majority of these robots are really expensive and unreachable in certain areas I will give it four out of ten the medical features index is 18 brain computer interfaces research has geared up lately in the area of brain computer interfaces to these brain implants today are where laser eye surgery was decades ago but a field will advanced significantly in the coming years there are numerous successful tests where brain implant therapies for people paralyzed by spinal cord injury or other neurological damage could restore some movement and function but we can go even further than that imagine a retinal chip giving you perfect eyesight cochlear implant granting your perfect hearing or a memory chip bestowing you with almost Lin less memory it's like something out of a science fiction novel while you see heartwarming examples in the news about paralyzed people being able to control their prosthetics or as of skeletons it's still an image from the far future therefore I give it three out of them regarding the impact on healthcare it's hard to determine but regarding the impact this technology can have on individuals with such health issues it will be a life changer so seven out of ten and knowing that one robot prosthetic costs about one hundred and fifty thousand dollars I would say it's not really available to the masses three out of ten the medical futurist index is 13 nanotechnology scallop shaped micro particles have already been shown to swim in the eye and perform procedures but what if nano particles and nano could operate as precise drug delivery systems just imagine a nanometer sized stool injected into your body that releases a medication but doesn't get attacked by your immune system how about injecting chemotherapy into cancer cells while keeping healthy cells untouched microscopic robots inside you could send warnings to your smartphone that the disease is about to develop in your body so you can try to prevent it in that scenario even the word symptom would be completely eradicated from our medical dictionaries nanotech is amazing but still pure science fiction 2 out of 10 for the impact it can have on people's lives and prevention I would say 7 out of them and for availability to the masses two out of them the medical futurist index is 11 5g the upcoming 5g upgrade of our telecommunications networks will lay down the foundation for the digital health evolution right now smart sensors and the Internet of Things tools are putting our networks under increasing strain but 5g will bring more speed and capacity to them which will open the door to a flood of innovative technologies in the future variables and pocket-sized connected devices will constantly monitor the state of the patience and high-speed 5g networks will allow smart algorithms and artificial intelligence to use the vast amounts of data gained from these variables to do real-time analysis on them and notify a patient's position in case anything is about to go wrong with them but what if there is a bigger problem that needs surgery 5g is fast Network can handle remote surgeries as the turnaround time for information between two points of network will fall to around one millisecond basically a patient with a certain condition could have a specialist halfway across the world to surgery on them 5g is coming this year as many operators are deploying their new networks so it's eight out of ten the impact will only be significant if healthcare providers start adapting it six out of them as if you become available this year many will get access to it in the most developed regions only six out of ten for accessibility the medical features index is twenty direct-to-consumer genetic testing if you follow this channel you know that I'm a big advocate for genetic testing and full genome sequencing in particular it's an oftentimes startling but absolutely crucial part of a responsible and health-conscious lifestyle phoo genome sequencing is basically a method of deciphering your entire DNA and looking at it through the lenses of our collective knowledge of how our genome affects health it can be a goldmine of information it can show you your risks for certain diseases that you would otherwise not know of and so you can create a preventive plan around it with your physician to shape your lifestyle in a way to keep you healthy in the long run for example if your genome report shows that you have a risk of diabetes you can change your diet and exercise more to try to prevent it from happening in the future it will be hard to imagine that there was a time when our diet and our lifestyle were arbitrary and not based on science many tests are already available but we are still waiting for comprehensive tests so for that it's eight out of ten the impact of genomics on every aspect of healthcare from medication sensitivity to nutrition will be huge it's nine out of ten that huge and then genome sequencing is still expensive even though millions of people have used simpler generic testing services so it's a hard question but for accessibility I will give it a seven out of ten the magical futurist index is 24 3d printing 3d printers have been all over the news in the past few years from printing weapons to printing entire buildings but their most impactful feature is yet to receive the spotlight probably the first thing that comes to mind in terms of health care is that 3d printing can be the solution for people in need of mobility devices such as prosthetics while traditional prosthetics are expensive an 80% of the words amputees don't even have access to facilities but they could receive one 3d printing will be a cost effective way to get modern customizable prosthetics for people in need another less obvious example of how 3d printing can distort healthcare is bio printing it is the creation of living tissues such as blood vessels bones or organs through 3d printing this can be an answer to the words organ shortage but printing organs is a bit more complicated than printing prosthetics but one day we might be able to successfully restore the function of damaged organs and maybe just maybe further down the line if one of your organs needs to be replaced and you send in a tissue sample to nearby printing facility and a few days later they could send you back a new functioning organ it FedEx the cost of review printers is going down fast but practical applications in medicine such as bio printers are lagging behind six out of them the impact would be obviously great eight out of ten and the accessibility is the real challenge here three out of them the medical feature is index is 17 and now artificial intelligence AI has an unimaginable potential we're in the next couple of years it will revolutionize every area of our life including medicine I'm fully convinced then if we redesign healthcare completely and for the better as AI will be able to mine and utilize vast amounts of medical data and our entire medical knowledge going back to 2,000 years it will be able to support making better diagnosis help design treatment plans and since it will be able to better understand the information it can gain from our DNA ai will help healthcare move from the traditional one-size-fits-all medical solutions to targeted treatments personalized therapy and uniquely customized drugs simply put AI will find answers to formerly insoluble medical problems and cure formerly incurable diseases what can I say there are studies already showing that artificial narrow intelligence based algorithms are able to support many of the processes I just described it's getting there even though if we still take years to fully enjoy the benefits of AI in healthcare so how close is it to reality I would say six out of them the impact no question about it the mother of all medical technologies 10 out of them the accessibility will be tricky depending on where the patient or physician lives five out of them the medical futurist index is 21 quantum computing quantum computing is hard to even define but if it's computing powers can make current supercomputers look like down the nation tools and there's no limits of how much it can disrupt our lives and healthcare in particular for example it will be able to sequence our entire DNA in probably under minutes which means the genetic testing will be a basis of Diagnostics the way blood and urine tests are today and the dead processing power quantum computers you'll be able to make reliable predictions about what might go wrong with the patient and what they can do now to prevent it based on analyzing the tens of millions of studies in real time quantum computers will also revolutionize drug design by launching the era of in silikal clinical trials when we don't test drugs on patients anymore and all that will lead to precision medicine and a perfect decision support system it's almost too good to be true and it is it still it's still a thing of the future even if Google has already shown its quantum supremacy so one out of ten eventually the impact will be almost as huge as in the case of AI nine out of ten but I'm afraid only those nations will benefit from it that we'll be able to afford quantum computers and there are not many of them three out of them the medical futurist index is 13 so let's see the final ranking Wow it seems health sensors and genomics on the top well these are the two technologies that can have the largest impact on our lives today and they already have evidence in the background so I guess it's understandable but make no mistake when artificial intelligence eventually comes it's going to blow them out of the water so in two weeks I will clear every confusion I will explain every basic details about that to make you an AI expert - happy new year and see you then each fly this video and you would like to hear more about advanced medical technologies please subscribe here
