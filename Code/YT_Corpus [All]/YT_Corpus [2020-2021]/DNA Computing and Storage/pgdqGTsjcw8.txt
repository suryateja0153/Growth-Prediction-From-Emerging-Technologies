 [Music] okay so hello and welcome back so we'll continue our discussion that we were having on plastic band and if you remember we talked about plastic band in India and some other countries so far now for the remaining part of this particular week we will be focusing most on China's policy which has an implication throughout the world including India so this China short policy we'll talk about that in a little bit in detail and how this is impacting our plastic waste management and not only plastic waste other waste management issues as well but for this course since we are focusing on plastic we will talk more about that we may touch upon some other waste stream too so let's get started so in terms of this China sort policy China has a study has put a national short 2017 which is the crackdown on waste import now what does that mean is as you know that what major manufacturing these days happens in developing countries emerging economies and China being one of the most important of those emerging economies there is a lot lots and lots of manufactured happens in China if you compare China and India Chinese are much ahead in terms of manufacturing we are we do lot of service industry that like soft wares and those kind of industry more in India but in China it's more factories manufacturing happens more over there so lots of factories so factory requires raw material and when you require raw material you need raw material from different sources and one of the source is coming from waste material so this waste material from developed countries like US Canada Australia New Zealand European Union once they have collected the recyclables those recyclables most like a a good portion of those recyclables used to end up in China for processing and resource recovery and that disorder used to go in Chinese manufacturing plants because that's where the demand are in terms of Manufacturing but as China itself is started focusing on recycling within its own country and with a huge population 1.3 billion people they started having their own recyclables up to us up to a good quantity so they drill the reliance or the dependence on the recyclables from the foreign countries from the developed countries are gradually going down so so now China wants to take your recyclables only if it's clean so they don't will they they want that it has to be clean not the dirty recyclables so if you don't do the recycling sorting and all that sort separation is not proper and there is a contamination in the recyclables they will not take it so that's what the whole concept behind this China saut policy and we'll discuss this in more detail so that's it's kind of they also call it second green fence so it's a second green fences as some people call it as a second green fence so what is that national short policy what are the different stuff is in there so there are 24 items of waste banned by China that they will not take it into their country 8 categories of plastic waste covering LDPE sgp epa tpv cps from living sources like most consumer so post consumer plastic waste which has tended has a chances of more contamination China says that will not going to take it so that says these are the waste band one type of paper waste which is the unsorted mixed paper unsorted mixed paper because see if you if you do a lot of sorting that requires lot of energy that requires lot of manpower that requires lot of money so it gets costly to make the waste sorted into different categories and that makes the waste of a good value that's the recovered material has a good value is of good quality and of course you have to invest money to do that so there has been a practice of rather than investing money say in Australia or in the US or in Canada many many of these municipalities since they could send those ways to earlier they were and to do those due diligence I may call it within their own jurisdiction was stepping out to be costlier than sending it off to China so that's that's what they were sending this mixed paper and we get those unsorted mixed paper even in India like I have seen that in there is one Krishna tissues plant nearby in near Kolkata area where I saw some of this waste papers mixed waste paper coming from UK coming from Australia and they produce the recycle those and they produce paper tissues and lot of other products out of that even packaging paper and all those things so but they they don't want mixed paper eleven types of textile waste so they don't want textile waste eleven types not clothing and four types of metal slag containing vanadium so those were banned so so they so these are these were totally banned they don't want those and they also put a new standard limiting all imported recycled material to a maximum contamination level of 0.5 percent which is pretty very strict regulation earlier it was their goal was to have 0.3% but then they settle for 0.5 percent so what does that mean say if we have 1 kg 100 kg of recyclable plastic or recyclable paper coming into China which is being sent to China for recycling and resource recovery out of the hundred kg point five kg 0.5% so it cannot be more than 0.5 kg of contamination so 99.5 kg has to be the clean paper so that's a good like a very very tough demand to meet by many of the unless these recyclable recycling companies in developing countries all those countries which used to send those plastics or papers and other recyclables to China is start putting a lot of efforts on there so there is a lot of debate lot of term is going on in in in the world in terms of this China banned or China's condition that you need to have a you can maximum you can have is 0.5% you cannot have more than that otherwise your Lord where your load will be rejected it will be sent back so that is creating a lot of investment NEET is going is happening or going to happen in recycling business in these countries like US Canada Australia New Zealand and European Union and other places so that's which whichever are used to so the countries which used to send their recyclables to China and but in meter in inin trim while they do all these things or in their own country they're also looking for alternative markets we'll talk about because of the aftermath of China banned is actually problematic for country like India because we will really start getting lot of these contaminated recyclables coming to our country which will be of have which will have a bigger environmental footprint so what does just look at the timeline what the date so they started they don't see these things doesn't happen overnight it takes time so started in 2013 so China implements the operation green fence policy they enforce existing laws via customs inspection 0.3% contaminated threshold but 5% in practice so they were saying that 0.3% will go there but up to 5% they were okay they were taking it July 2017 China files notification to World Trade Organization WTO to ban 24 categories that we just looked at in a previous slide or by September 2017 November China notifies WTO of a revision of initial filing adopting 0.5% to 1% contamination they as I sepsis threshold for the 24 categories those which were born my banned March 2018 entry into the force of 0.5% or 2 1 % contaminated threshold to be strictly enforced so this whole thing together is called national short policy that's what it's it's known as so around 0.5% is what they are trying to enforce so 2013 as I said the focus on quality they were more on trying to get better plastic 19th 2017 national sword is they've had to eliminate illegal wasted smuggling there was bans on 24 material including mixed paper and ply and mixed plastics which we saw that there is a contamination limit announced that 0.5% contamination limit they've also suspended license the Chinese government began limiting licence still to closed on mills in China which were not following these rules so in 2018 which was this past year in January 2018 bans came in effect March 0.5% contamination limit came in effect that there was a operation blue sky Chinese customs to inspect all loads at point of entry into China in effect through 2018 May 28 in suspended all inspection of US imports since the inspections are required all exposed to China stopped regardless of quality stressing markets across the globe so you cannot send this contaminated stuff to China anymore June June 2018 China allowed is shipment with the inspection and some sips on whether the water for non banned material so if you look at some of the other other like actions so it started now if you initially from 2014 if you look at the time line 2014 to 2016 then 2017 there was and then 2018 plus so 14 to 16 there was China's customs department is we're trying to strengthen the supervision of solid waste imports and crackdown on a smuggling waste which they used to get a lot of them there was impact on politics of polyethylene and polypropylene where average demand there was a growth in average demand Everage volume also grew and there was around six point five six point six percent growth and you see more volume of those material then in 2017 the so dashing the goal was to prohibit the smuggling of foreign garbage into China including waste plastic which we just talked about at any the the inform WTO that all imports to solid waste containing environmental hatchets are going to be prohibited and then there was a demand average demand growth in terms of polyethylene and probably propylene as you can see there was a growth in volume then a post sort action with a complete ban on the import of plastic waste with expect enough lift in the consumption of virgin Regent's material and more investment in recycling facilities so that's there was a growth of around 10% volume growth is 2.7 permit returned polypropylene demand growth was 7.7 percent and the volume growth was 2 million tons so with the ban on plastics recyclable so we got a lot of lot virgin materials coming into the market so more stuff getting into the mark of course somebody has to look at in terms of what is the real when we talk about this China short ban what is the real environmental footprint of this whole activity because it's not just what is not coming into China what is happening with those material now some places I have read newspapers reports or the some technical articles report which suggest that many of these are not going to the risa are to the waste-to-energy plants so it's not getting recycled it's going to the waste to energy plan so is it really a like is it good thing to do or should we hadn't been recycled that have been better so we have to come some of this would be a very beautiful kind of a lifecycle analysis can kind of exercise where we can see what is the impact of China short ban on on global recyclable industry and based on the actions that the global recycling industries are taking what is the real environmental benefit are we really getting bit environmental benefit or all of course China locally is may be benefiting from it but is it really helping the global environmental cause or or is it a positive development or is it a negative development and so that those things would be interesting to look at so if you look at the global economy and in terms of mainland China's share of global imports so in terms of the import 3% like iron and steel since China makes a lot of iron and steel by itself so over the past 20 years China has become the primary market for recyclables from across the globe by 2017 30 percent of recyclables from the u.s. we're exported to China as their economy grew the shipped finished goods and products and we filled the containers with recycled material to see back to China so that goods will go to us and big other big countries those containers those shipping containers will fill in the goggle in the recyclable waste and then bring it back to China for processing and reuse so as you can see iron and steel import was 3% and rest of the world is 97% then if you look at copper China was importing 55% well rest of the world 45% then aluminum 24% like more than one-fourth of the world nearly 1/4 fibers more than 50% plastic more than 50% so as you can see in terms of the recyclables iron and steel copper aluminum fiber and plastic plastic fibers and copper more and more was getting into China now in in once with this these rules come into effect we see that there was a kind of a declining trend in terms of xprize scrap exports to China in 2017 2018 these values are in metric tons and you don't have to worry too much about the values view what we are looking at is just the trend so if you look at from in this particular graph if we start from January 17 to March 2018 which is a period of around 13 14 months as you can see and this orange one is our the mixed paper the blue is the scrap plastic so let's look at the blue first and as you can so blue has a tendency of kind of going down I especially after we have China banned a sword is effective we see kind of a drastic drop and so that's the values going going going down and these values are in metric ton as I said earlier and similarly if you look at the mixed paper they also have it Endon have kind of eight that there was a Saab decline of mixed paper so thing is that why there is a decline this plastic and those recyclables material recycling facilities in u.s. is not able to keep it clean to the standard that China wants it so since they cannot keep it clean we kind of will not take it so only the material which was clean we're allowed the material which were not clean was not sent so that's export of recyclable has gone down now the question is what will happen to those recyclables in the US because viewers for the last two decades or two and half decades is or you I'm just using us as an example US Canada European Union Australia New Zealand all those countries for last two or two to three decades they have relied on China in terms of managing their voice in managing their recyclables now all of a sudden if it stops and there is no capacity to handle these kind of wastes any more left in US industry what will happen to those recyclables in the end trim they will probably like to go for some other markets like India mine Indonesia Malaysia which will which will looked at but at the same time it will force the local industry to grow in this particular area because that's where they have to start yeah they have to start like managing their waste within their own boundaries rather than sending it off so to five to five importers to China in 27 2016 you have a Hong Kong 43% now this Hong Kong business is most of it is actually coming from other developing countries through Hong Kong so because there are certain loopholes all the rules in regulation that's why it kind of makes a huge chunk of it goes through the Hong Kong but nearly 43 percent so that these 43 percent probably coming mostly from you Canada or European Union and other places so Japan 20% u.s. 17% Thailand 11% and that Germany is 9% so that's the importer of waste coming into China in China so the top five export destination for top five historical exporters so if you look at the historical exporters from Germany most of it goes to China part of it just goes managed in other European countries as well and India 6% the orange the yellowish orange pie is the Indian pie so you can see that it's around 6 percent for the German export German voiced export USA 5 percent for India China is 56 percent so that's a lot of 56 percent of their recyclables are going to China Canada a little bit 3% Hong Kong and is around 32 percent most of it will again end up to China so this as you can this of this number is a again pop most of it will end up showing up in in inch in China as well so as you can see China is kind of dominating 56 percent for 30 69% 56 percent and Japan again 17 percent and then they also have 8 percent here which part of it will it may end up over there as well Vietnam 26% Taiwan South Korea so now with China gone of this pie of most of for most part or the values going very low for the other destinations obvious destinations that you see is Taiwan Vietnam India Mexico those are the countries where you start seeing many of these recyclables being ending up so that's what's kind of a little bit of concern as because in India we don't have the infrastructure to deal with these recyclables if we get right now a lot of these recyclables coming in to handle and process so we'll have a lot of environmental issues associated with that as well so Mexico in terms of what they send to export destination for the toff i historical import sapporo mexico they're sending around 38% to china 55% to us because that's in the border area probably they are managing it in the United States Canada Taiwan and Hong Kong because the US has the capacity to man to manage that so that's probably why it is ending up over there if you look at the UK Germany 53% China 3% Netherlands 7 Hongkong 12 and France is 15% are 25% so Hong Kong is again Park under partly going through the China as well Germany because they are using they have a lot of recycling facilities and all that UK struggles with the waste management a little bit as compared to the other European countries so if they do send a lot of stuff to other European countries to manage so if you look at ranking of the World Bank regional groups based on the cumulative exports and imports of plastic waste from 1988 to 2016 so kind of from the very beginning to the very recent data so there are different regions have been identified a EAP is our East East Asia and Pacific ECA is Eastern and Central Asia na is North America LS C is Latin America and the Caribbean then there is some unspecified M ene is the Middle East and North Africa SAR is South Asia and F AFR is Africa so that's what you have the list on on your on your toe on the table on the left as you can see these are the different regions that is been identified over there so and then for each of those there is a trade value there is the mass and then the percent total and so this is on export then there is also one on imports where the same regions have been given mass and percent of total so if you just look at quickly on this particular table so for if you go by exports first so in exports as you can see our East Asia and Pacific kind of leads it so the ranking is also there on the leftmost on the both the table that's the ranking so forty four percent forty four percent is is the export from East Asia and Pacific and compared to if you look at the import East Asian Pacific also imports seventy five percent so although it's exports forty four percent but it imports seventy five percent so net actually becomes more of an import rather than an export so that's where we we have a kind of a gap almost thirty one percent gap between imports and exports so which is that's which not very healthy because that's what leads to a lot of problem in terms of foreign currency reserves and all that so next that ECA which is Eastern and Central Asia which kind of is in the middle on both the table in the second position on both the table and so import export is thirty two percent and the import is sixteen percent so what's that's that's actually better then North Africa fourteen percent is the export then five point two percent is the import then LSC which is a Latin American Caribbean and unspecified M ene so for each of those reasons you can see there is and this is for the export an import of plastic voice so it depends on your usage in this area for plastic as well so and for both the examples we see that there is a substantial amount of plastic waste which is coming from East Asia and Pacific being exported as well as important and there are other countries out there as well so being said that if you look at also the clunking of World Bank economic groups based on the cumulative exports and imports of plastic waste so here high-income group upper middle middle group lower middle group and low-income group based on 2015 GDP or geology and I which is the gross national income so if you can divide that what we see is this high-income group has nearly 87 percent values in terms of exports where it is happening so high-income group is able to spend more time in terms of separation of the garbage and all that and making it convenient for to be recycled then upper income is around ten percent nine point two percent lower made come is 2.8 percent then we have low income based on group that is it's on 0.1% so similarly if you look at the import part we have again HIC which is the high income group forty nine percent and that low income group is close to 0% or 1% so what does it mean is it essentially is trying to tell us that it if you look at okay financially the countries which are bit financially well-off they have more money to spend so and then those countries you see more progress those who are still struggling with poverty and all those kind of stuff they struggle in terms of delivering this waste management facilities so that's where we don't get the number so the numbers are pretty low our numbers are in the informal sector we don't have those numbers in a in a government database or any report which we can use now if you look at ranking of countries based on cumulative export for each plastic waste polymer classification so again from 1988 to 2016 so here if you look at PPS PVA PVC and other plastics so you have hong kong and hong kong which is gets a lot of business sell on that line so we have a cumulative net weight for other plastics in hong kong is thirty four point four million metric tonnes so and then p/e is around thirteen point six hong kong SAR is three point seven eight and then hong kong SAR another one is four point three five four PS and PVC so p thirteen point six 3.78 PVC is 4.35 and these are all million metric tons so that's in terms of the different ones then you have the US Japan Mexico Netherlands Germany France Canada Thailand and Belgium so as you can see in terms of the top ten exporters they do add up to around ninety one point two million metric tons for other plastic 56 point for melting million metric tons for polystyrene polypropylene after lean then we have polyester Alain and then we have the PVC so it's in terms of the polymer classification for premiere classification criteria from 1988 to 2016 we see that there are that there are different countries which are exporting of the garbage as well as the importing the garbage of plastic waste from different sources now if you look at the same similar examples based on who like for the European Union itself like Belgium Netherlands and then some other countries like USA Australia Germany UK Hong Kong and Thailand so as you can see over here from 2010 to 2020 17 we see that the biggest chunk actually coming from the gray which is the Germany then the yellow which is hung Thailand and as well as the Hong Kong so you and of course Belgium United States they are kind of pretty at the bottom over there so what does this mean is if you look at for each plastic type there are different countries which are using that two different levels and then they kind of get exported imported from one country to another now ranking of countries based on cumulative import of each plastic waste so if you look at that earlier one was on export now if you look at the import channel it's the pack most part then we have Hong Kong then US also imports certain types of plastic and we have India there we have Italy we have Canada Sweden Belgium so other plastics then paulius polyethylene PE again you have those similar names Hong Kong Netherlands Belgium Canada Malaysia similar polystyrene similar names are there previously although similar names are there so it basically is trying to tell you that although there are plastic waste people people are worried about the exporting of it but there are many countries that import these plastic waste fiber as well for usage different industry so let's look at this last slide and then we'll stop so if you look at they have to make an estimate of percentage of imported plastic to be managed in China from say 2010 to 2016 you look at your waste population waste generation rate percentage of plastic in waste stream and based on that we can a plastic waste generated is this much and then based on how much plastic is getting into China so that's the important recycle waste so we get a total recycled waste and out of that percentage of plastic whether is imported is around twelve percent so so that's we are getting a lot of plastic waste not from within the country but from also outside the country so and then with this China banned these things have got a little bit of disturbed so there is will be a lot of realignment going to happen it's already happening in terms of you know getting these back on track so with that let's stop in this particular video so we'll continue this discussion in the next video so hope you are enjoying the course so far and any question put it on the discussion forum and thank you and I will see you again in the next video
