 i wanted to talk a little bit about a system that's built here in australia it's on the border of queensland and new south wales it's on a river system called the barwin and it's literally inside a town called borona which is sitting right on the barwin river so in this town called bowona there is today an archaeological site it's the site of a series of fish traps it's the largest and oldest set of fish traps in australia it's nearly two kilometers long and it's a series of stones made in the shape of fishnets and what this entire system did over this massive piece of a river was create the capacity to trap fish whether they were going upstream or downstream and to hold them in pens in cool running water when the water was low and when the water was high and the reason that you did that here on this river was that it was a meeting place it was a place where multiple different nations gathered it was a place where multiple families gathered and it was a place where ceremonies and ritual and knowledge was built and exchanged and in order to make that happen you needed to have food at scale the most remarkable thing about this system archaeologists estimate its age to be 40 000 years old it is in fact the oldest known technical system built by humans on the planet the last time we have a recorded use of this system is in about 1915 so if you're sitting somewhere listening to this and you've built a technical system imagine building a technical system that would last for 40 000 years most of us are lucky if we built a system that lasted for 10 is also a system that suggests an understanding of technologies in this case lithics stone it's a system that suggests an understanding of the ecosystem and the environment and one that was changing over this period of time and it's a system that suggests a profound insight into how human beings work and for me those three pieces technical cultural and ecological are incredibly significant as we think about building technical systems we need to build them with multiple pieces in mind not just the technology but the ecological piece and the human piece it's a useful way of framing how the current technical systems should and could unfold you
