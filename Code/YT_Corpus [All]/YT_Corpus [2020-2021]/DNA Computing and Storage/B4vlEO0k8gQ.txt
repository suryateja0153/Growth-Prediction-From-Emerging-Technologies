 live from San Francisco it's the cube covering Google cloud next nineteen watch you buy Google cloud and its ecosystem partners we're back at Google cloud next 2019 you're watching the cube the leader in live tech coverage I'm Dave Volante with my co-host to minimun John Fourier is also here there's day two of our coverage hashtag Google next nineteen Mike Evans is here he's the vice president of technical business development at Red Hat Mike good to see you thanks for coming back in the cube great to be here so you know we were talking hybrid cloud multi-cloud you guys have been on this open shift for half a decade you know over a lot of deniers and now it's a real tailwind for you I mean the whole world is jumping on that bandwagon it's got to make you feel good yeah no that's it's a it's nice to see everybody echoing a similar message which we believe is what the customers demand and interest is so that's a great validation so how does that tie you know what's happening here what's going on at the show it's it's interesting and let me take a step back for a second I've been working with Google on their cloud efforts for almost ten years now and it started back when Google when they were about to get in the cloud business they had to decide whether they're gonna use KVM or Zen as their hypervisor and that was a time when we had just switched and made a big bet on KVM because of its alignment with the linux kernel but it was controversial and and we helped them do that and i looked back at my email recently and that was 2009 so that was ten years ago and that was that was early stages and then since that time you know it's just you know the cloud market is obviously boomed again that was sort of looking back ahead of this discussion and saying you know in 2006 and 2007 is when we started working with Amazon with rel on their cloud and back when it you know everyone thought there's no way a bookseller is going to make an impact in the world etc and as I just play sort of forward to today and looking at 30,000 people here and you know what sort of evolved I just fascinated by you know sort of that open source is now obviously fully mainstream and it's there's no more doubters and it's the engine for everything yep you know bring us inside so you know KVM the underpinning we know rel is you know core to the multi cloud strategy to Red Hat and there's a lot that you've built on top of it speak speak a little bit of some of the engineering relationships going on joint customers that you have and kind of the value as opposed to you know red hat in general is you're agnostic to where it lives but there's got to be special work that gets done in a lot of places relatives at Google yeah yeah there yeah so through the years we've really done a lot of work to make sure that rel at the foundation works really well on TCP so that's been a that's been a really consistent effort and whether it's around optimization for performance security elements so that that provides a nice base for anybody who wants to move any workload or application from on-prem over there or from another cloud and that's been great and then the other mate you know we've also worked with them obviously the upstream community dynamics have been really productive between Red Hat and Google and Google's been one of the most productive and positive contributors and participants in open source and so we've worked together around probably 10 or 15 different projects and it's a constant interaction between our upstream developers where we share ideas and do you agree with this that kind of so obviously kubernetes is a big one when you see the list it's it's Google and Red Hat right there okay give us a couple of examples of some of the other ones I mean again it's KBM is also a foundation or one that people kind of forget about that these days but it still is a very pervasive technology and continuing to gain ground you know there's all there's the the Kay native stuff there's the ISTE o stuff in the AI ml which is a whole fascinating category in my mind as well I mean III like history I'm kind of a little student of IT industry history and so I like to talk to folks who have been there and try to get it right but there was a sort of this gestation period from 2006 to 2009 and cloud yeah we're like you said it without bookseller and and then even in the downturn a lot of CFO said hey capex to OPEX boom and then come out of the downturn and it was a shadow IT and around that 2009 time frame it was a like you say a hypervisor discussion era you know do we gonna put vmware in in our cloud and homogeneity you had a lot of a lot of traditional companies fumbling yeah with their cloud strategies and and then they had the big data craze and obviously open source was a huge part of that and then containers which of course have been around since Linux yeah and I guess dr. boom I started to go crazy and now it's like this the curve is reshaping with AI and you know and it's sort of a new era of data thoughts on sort of the the accuracy of that little historical narrative yeah and and and and why that big uptick with with containers well so the a couple things there one the data the whole data evolution and this is a fascinating one for many many years I mean I write out for 19 years so I've seen a lot of the elements of that history and one of the constant questions we would always get sometimes from investor who why don't you guys buy a database company you know years ago and we would you know we did always look at it or why aren't you guys doing a hadoop distribution when that became more spark etcetera and we always looked at it and said you know we're a platform company and if we were to pick any one database it would only cover some percentage and there's so many and then it just kind of upsets the other so we we've decided we're gonna focus not on the data layer we're gonna focus on the infrastructure and the application layer and work down from it and support to things underneath so it's consistent now with the AI ml explosion which you know where Google's was a pioneer of AI ml they think they've got some of the best services and then we've been doing a lot of work with NVIDIA in the last two years to make sure that all the GPUs wherever they're run hybrid private cloud on you know multiple clouds that those are enabled and rel and enabled and OpenShift because what we see happening and NVIDIA does also is right now all the applications being developed by eight for AML are written by extremely technical people when you write the tensorflow and things like that you kind of got to be able to write a C compiler but so we're working with them to bring openshift to become the sort of more mass mainstream tool to develop a IML enable apps because the value of having rel underneath OpenShift and is is every piece of hardware in the world is supported right for when in every cloud and then when we add that GPU enable them an open shift and the middleware and our storage everything inherits it so that's the that's the most valuable to me that's the most valuable piece of real estate that we own in the industry is actually Ralph and then everything builds upon that and it's interesting what you said about the database of course we have long discussion about that this morning you're right though Mike you either have to be like really good at one thing like a data stacks or a Cassandra or a and there is zillion others that I'm not mentioning or you got to do everything you know like the cloud guys are doing yeah every one of them's an operational you know analytics deep Rd vas no sequel I mean one of each you know and then you have to partner with them so right I would imagine you looked at that as well I said how are we gonna do all that right right and when there's you know there's so many competitive dynamics coming at us and we you know for we've always been in the mode where we've been the little guy battling against the big guys whoever maybe whether it was or you know son IBM and HP UNIX is in the early days - Oracle was our friend for a while then they became then they became an enemy you know or not an enemy but and a competitor on the Linux side and Amazon was you know early friend and then though they did their own Linux so there's a competitive so that's that's normal operating model for us to is to be have this you know big competitive dynamic with a with a partnering dynamic you gotta win it in the marketplace yeah yeah I need a customer say come on guys right figure it out together figure it out we talked early about hybrid cloud we talked about multi cloud and to some people those are the same thing but I think actually you know different hybrid you think of you know on Prem and public and and hopefully some kind of level of integration and common data plane and control plane and multi cloud is sort of evolved from multi vendor how do you guys look at it is is multi cloud of strategy how do you look at high yeah I mean it's it's it's a simple it's simple in my mind but I know the words the terms get used by a lot of different people in different ways you know hybrid cloud to me is just is just that straightforward being able to run something on premise and being able to run something in any in a public cloud and have it be somewhat consistent or shareable or movable right and then multi cloud has been able to do that same thing with with multiple public clouds and then there's a third variation on that as you know wanting to do an application that runs in both and shares information which I think the worlds you know you saw that in the Google anthos announcement where they are talking about their service running on the other two major public clouds that's the first of any sizable company I think that's going to be the norm because it's gonna become more normal wherever the infrastructure is that a customer is using if Google has a great service they want to be able to tell the user to run it on their data or their app their choice so yeah so Mike you brought up anthos and at the core it's gke so it's the kubernetes we've been talking about and she said works with AWS works with Azure but it's gke on top of those public clouds maybe give us a little bit of you know compare/contrast of that from there to open shift because open shift lives in all of these environments too but yeah they're not fully compatible and how does that work sure so our anthos which was announced yesterday to high level of Commons I guess one is as we talked about at the beginning it's a validation of what our message has been it's a hybrid cloud is a value multi clouds of values that's a productive element of that to help promote that vision and that concept also macro we talked about a little bit it's it's it puts us in a competitive environment more with Google than it was yesterday or two days ago but again that's that's our normal world I we don't we we partnered with IBM and HP and competed against them on UNIX we partner with them was partnered with Microsoft and compete with them so that's normal that said you know we believe our with openshift having you know five plus years in market and you know the over a thousand customers and very wide deployments had already been running in Amazon and Microsoft cloud already re there and solid and people doing real things with it plus being from a position of an independent software vendor we think is a more valuable position for multi-cloud than a single cloud vendor so that's you know we welcome to the party in the sense that you know going on Prem I say welcome to the jungle for all these public cloud companies going on from its you know it's it's a lot of complexity when you have to deal with you know American Express's infrastructure Bank of Hong Kong's infrastructure Ford Motors infrastructure and it's it's a it's a right right you know Google before only had to run on Google servers in Google Data Center everything's very clean environment and one the Emporer enterprise customers have little different demands in terms of version allottee and when they upgrade and and how long they let things laughs there's a lot of differences but actually there was one of the things Cori Quinto it was doing some analysis with us on there and Google for the most part is if we decide to pull something that you've got kind of a one-year window to do you know how does Red Hat look at that I mean and I my guess is they'll evolve over time as they get deeper in it or maybe they won't maybe they have a model where they think they'll gain enough share and theirs but I mean we were built on on enterprise DNA and we've evolved to cloud and hybrid multi-cloud DNA we love again like we love when people say I'm going to the cloud because when they say they're going to the cloud it means they're doing new apps or they're modifying old apps and we have a great shot of landing that business when they say we're doing something new well right all right even whether it's on Prem or in the public cloud right they're saying when they say we're go to the closet they talking about the cloud experience right and that's really what your strategy is to bring that experience to wherever your data lives exactly so talking about that multi cloud or omni cloud when we sort of look at the horses on the track and you say okay you got sort of VMware going after that you got you know IBM and Red Hat going after that now Google sort of huge cloud provider you know doing that wherever you look there's Red Hat now of course I know you can't talk much about the IBM you know certainly integration but executive once said to me Stu that I've been we're like a recovering alcoholic we learned our lesson from mainframe we we are open we're committed to open so we'll see but Red Hat is is everywhere and your strategy presumably is to stay that sort of open nutria it goes last year I give to a couple examples of long ago I mean five even five six years ago when the cow stuff was still more early I had a to CIO conference calls in one day and one was with a big graphics you know Hollywood graphics company in the CIO after we explained all of our cloud stuff you know we had nine people on the call explaining all our cloud and the guy said okay he goes let me just tell you right that guy's something the biggest value you bring to me is having rel as my single point of sanity that I can move this stuff wherever I want I just attach all my applications I attach third-party apps and everything and then I can move it wherever I want so realize that you're bigger and I still think that's true and then there was another large gaming company who was trying to decide to move 40,000 servers from on from their own cloud to a public cloud and how they were going to do it and they had they had to do you know the head of servers a head of security the head of databases the head of networking the head of nine different functions there and they were all in disagreement at the end and and the CIO said at the end of the day said Mike I've got like a headache I need some vodka and Tylenol now so give me one simple piece of advice how do i navigate this I said if you just write every app to rel and JBoss and this was before open chef no matter where you want to run them rel and JBoss will be there and he said excellent advice that's what we're doing so there's something really beautiful about the simplicity of that that a lot of people overlook with all the hand waving of kubernetes and containers and 50 versions of kubernetes certified and you know etc it's it's it's so I think there's something really beautiful about that and we see a lot of value in that single point of sanity and allowing people flexibility at you know it's a pretty low cost to use rel as your foundation open-source hybrid cloud multi-cloud omni cloud all tailwinds for Red Hat Mike will give you the the final world weird bumper sticker on Google cloud next or any other final thoughts no I to me it's it's great to see 30,000 people at this event it's great to see Google getting more and more invested in the in the cloud and more and more invested in the enterprise cloud and I think they've had great success in a lot of non enterprise accounts probably more so than the other cloud and now they're coming this way they've got great technology we've our engineers love working with their engineers and now we've got a more competitive dynamic and like I said welcome to the jungle we got Red Hat summit coming ups too right early May is that fully back in Beantown Dave oh that's nice okay I'll be in London I'm gonna write out summit in Boston and may I could yeah Mike thanks very much for coming back it was great to see good to see you all right everybody keep right there Stu and I went back John Ferrier is also in the house watching the cube at Google cloud next 2019 we'll be right back
