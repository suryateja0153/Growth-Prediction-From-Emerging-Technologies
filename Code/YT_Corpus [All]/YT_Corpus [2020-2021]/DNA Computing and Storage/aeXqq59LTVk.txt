 from our studios in the heart of Silicon Valley Palo Alto California this is a cute conversation live and welcome to this cube conversation here exclusive coverage of Google next 2019 I'm John for your host of the cube big Google Cisco news we're here with Katie who's the vice president of the data center after compute for Cisco and Kip Compton senior vice president cloud platform and solutions group guys welcome to this exclusive cube conversation thanks for spending the time I'm great to be here so Google next Asli showing the way that enterprises are now quickly moving to the cloud not just moving to the cloud the cloud is part of the planet for the enterprise Google cloud clearly coming out with a whole new set of systems set of software so their relationships Google anthos is the big story the platform you guys have had a relationship and previously announced with with Google your role in joint engineering integrations talk about the relationship with Cisco and Google what's the news what's the big deal here you know we're really excited I mean as you mentioned we've been working with Google cloud since 2017 on hybrid and multi cloud kubernetes technologies I'm really excited about what we were able to announce today with Google cloud around Google clouds new anthos system and we're going to be doing a lot of different integrations that really bring a lot of what we've learned through our joint work with them over the last few years and we think that the degree of integration across our data center portfolio and also our networking and security portfolios well ultimately give customers one of the most secure and flexible multi cloud and hybrid architectures one of the things that we're seeing in the marketplace I want to get your reaction to this kit because I think this speaks to what's going on here at Google necks and the industry is that the companies that actually get on the cloud wave truly not just say they're doing cloud but ride that the wave of the enterprise cloud which is here multi cloud is big conversation hybrids and implementation of that cloud is big part of it the data center certainly isn't going away seeing a whole new huge wave you guys have been big behind this at Cisco you saw the results are with Microsoft their stock has gone from where it wasn't really low to really high because they were committed to the cloud house committed is Cisco to this cloud wave what specifically are you guys bringing to the table for enterprises oh we we're very committed we see it as the seminal IT transfer transformation of our time and clearly one of the most important topics in our discussions with CIOs across our customer base and what we're seeing is really not as much enterprises moving to the cloud as much as enterprises extending or expanding into the cloud and they're on Prem infrastructures including our data centers as you mentioned certainly aren't going away and they're really looking to incorporate cloud into a complete system that enables them to run their business and they're looking for agility and speed to deliver new experiences to their employees into their customers so we're really excited about that and we think sir this multi cloud approaches is absolutely critical and it's one of the things that Google Cloud and Cisco are aligned on I'd like to get this couple of talk tracks one is the application area multi cloud and hybrid but first let's unpack the news what's going on with Cisco and Google obviously anthos is the new system essentially it's just a cloud platform but that's they're calling it Google's anthem how is cisco integrating is this because you guys had great integration points before containers was a big bet that you guys made you certainly have under the covers we learned that Cisco live in Barcelona around what's going on with hyper flex and ACI programmability dev net developer program going on so good stuff going on at Cisco where does this connect in with with Google because you got containers you guys have been very full throttle on kubernetes containers kubernetes where does this all fit how does customers how should customer your customers understand the relationship of how Cisco fits with Google Cloud what's the integration so let me let me start with unpacking it with at a higher level right philosophically we've been talking about multi cloud for a long time and Google has a very different and unique view of how cloud should be architected them they've gone down the open-source kubernetes path it's they've embraced multi-cloud much more so that we would have expected that's the underpinning of the relationship now you bring to that our deep expertise with serving Enterprise IT and our knowledge of what enterprise IT really needs to productize some of these innovations that are born elsewhere you get those two ingredients together and you have a powerful solution that democratizes some of the innovation that's born in the cloud or bond elsewhere so what we've done here with anthos with Google hyperflex with Cisco - Cisco's hyper flex with our security portfolio our networking portfolio is created a mechanism for enterprise IT to serve their constituent developers who are wanting to embrace containers a readily packaged an easily consumable solution that they can deploy really easily one of the things we're hearing is that this the difference mean moving to the cloud versus expanding - and with the cloud and two kind of areas pop up operations operations and developers yep people that operate IT mention IT democratizing IT certainly with automation scale clouds a great win there but you got to operate it at that level at the same time serve developers so it seems that we're hearing from customers it's complicated you got open source you got developers they're pushing code every day and then you got to run it over and over networks which have security challenges that you need to be managing every day's a hard core ops problems meets frictionless development yeah so let's talk about both of these pieces what developers want they want the latest frameworks they want to embrace some of the new the latest and greatest libraries out there they want to get on the cutting edge of this stuff it's great to experiment with open-source it's really really hard to productize it that's what we're bringing to the table here with Antos you know delivering a managed service with Cisco's deep expertise and taking complex technologies packaging it creating validated architectures that can work in an enterprise it it takes that take that complexity out of it secondly when you have a enterprise IT operator let's talk about the complexity is there right they've got to tame this wild wild west of open source you can't have drops every day you can't have things changing up there you need a certain level of predictability you need the infrastructure to slot in to a management framework that exists in the data center it needs to slaughter into a sparing mechanism to a workflow that exists on top of that you've got security and networking at multiple levels right and then you got physical networking you've got container networking you've got software-defined networking you've got application level networking each layer has complexity around policy and intent that needs to marry across those layers well you could try to stitch it together with products from different vendors but it's gonna be a hot stinking mess pretty soon driving consistency drive across those layers from a vendor who can work in the data center who can work across the layers of networking can work with security we've got that product set between a CI is just watch cloud providing those security and networking pieces are container networking expertise hyperflex as a hyper-converged infrastructure appliance that can be delivered to IT stood up its scale-out it's easy to deploy provides the underpinning for running anthos and then then now you've got a smooth simple solution that I take and take to its developer and say hey you know what you want to do in containers I've got a solution for you and I think one of the thing that's great about that is you know just as enterprises are extending into the cloud so is Cisco so a lot of the capabilities that Katie was just talking about are things that we can deliver for our customers in our data centers but then also in the cloud with things like a CI anywhere bringing that a CI policy framework that they have on Prem into the cloud and across multiple cloud so they get that consistency the same with stealthWatch cloud we can give them a common security model across there on Prem workloads and multiple public cloud workload areas so we think it's a great complement to what Google is doing with anthos and that's one of the reasons that we're partners if I want to get your thoughts on this was one of the things we've seen over the past years as a public cloud was a great greenfield people you born the cloud no problem and Enterprise to want to put workloads in the cloud and kind of eliminate some of the compute pieces and some benefits that they could put in the cloud and grade but the data center never went away and a large enterprise there it's never going away yes we suppose we're seeing but it's changing how should your customers be thinking about the evolution of the data center because certainly computes become commodity who can use some cloud from compute Google's got some stuff there but the network still needs to move packets Heflin you still got a store stuff you still need security there may not be a perimeter but you still have the nuts and bolts of networking software these roles that need to be taking place how should these be customers be thinking about cloud compute integration to the data on data perimeter so it's a great point and you know what we've seen it's actually cloud makes the network even more important right so when you have workloads and SAS services in the cloud that you rely on for your business suddenly the reliability in the performance and latency of your networks more important in many ways than it was before and so that's something many of our customers have seen it's driving a lot of interest and offerings like SD win francisco but to your point on the datacenter side we're seeing people modernize their data centers and they're looking to take a lot of the simplicity and agility that they see in a public cloud and bring it home if you will into the data center because there are lots of reasons why datacenters aren't going away and I think that's one of the reasons we're seeing hyperflex take off so much is it really simplifies multiple different layers and actually multiple different types of technology storage computing networking together into a sort of a very simple solution that gives them that agility and that's why it's the centerpiece of many of our partnerships with public cloud players including anthos because it really provides a cloud like workload hosting capability on Prem so the news here is that you guys are expanding your relationship with Google what does it mean can you guys summarize the impact to your customers and the industry well I think that I mean the impact for our customers is that you have two leaders working together and in fact they're two leaders who believe in open technology and in a multi cloud approach and we believe that both of those are fundamentally more aligned with our customers and the market than other approaches and so we're really excited about that and what it means for our customers in the future you know and we are expanding the relationship I mean there's not only what we're doing with Google cloud Santos but also associated announces who made about expanding our collaboration actually in the collaboration area with our WebEx capabilities as well as Google suite so we're really excited about about all of this and what we can enable together for our customers you guys have a great opportunity I always say latency is important and with low latency moving stuff around that's your wheelhouse KD talk about the relationship expanding with Google what specifically is going on let's get down and dirty is it is it tighter integration and said policy is it extending hyperflex into Google Google coming in what's actually happening in the relationship that's expanding so let me let me describe it in three ways and we've talked a little bit about this already the first is how do we drive clout like simplicity on Prem so what we've taken is hyper flex which is a scale out appliance dead simple easy to manage we've integrated that with anthos which means that now you've got not only a hyper-converged appliance that you can run workloads on you can deliver to your to your developers a kubernetes ecosystem and a tool set that is best-in-class it comes from Google it's managed from the cloud and it's not only the kubernetes piece of it you can deliver the service smash pieces of it a lot of the other pieces that come as part of that Antos relationship then we've taken that and said well to be enterprise-grade you've got to make sure the networking is enterprise-grade at every single layer whether that is at the physical layer container layers virtual machine layer at the software-defined networking layer or in the service layer we've been working with the teams on both sides when working together to develop that solution and bring that to market for our for our customers the third piece of this is to integrate security right so stealthWatch cloud was mentioned we're working with the other pieces of a portfolio to to integrate security across these offerings to make sure those flows are a secures can be possible and we detect anomalies we flag them the second big team is driving this from the cloud right so between Altos which is driving the community the environment from the cloud our SD van technology Cisco's SDRAM technology driven from the cloud being able to terminate those VPNs at the end location whether that be a data center whether that be an edge location and and being able to do that seamlessly driven from the cloud inner side which takes the management of an infrastructure tries it from the cloud again a Cisco innovation first in the industry all of these married together with driving with infrastructure from the cloud and what did it do for our eventual customers well it gave them now a data center environment that has no boundaries you've got you've got an on-prem data center that's expanding into the cloud you can build an application in one place deploy to Nalanda have it communicate with another application in the cloud and suddenly you kind of demolicious bonder ease between data center and the cloud between the data center and the edge and it all becomes a continuum and no other company other than Cisco so if I see if I hear you're saying and you're what you're saying is that you're bringing the software and security capabilities of Cisco in the data center and around campus etc SD went to Google Cloud so the customer experience would be Cisco customer can deploy Google Cloud and Google Cloud runs best on Cisco that's kind of is that kind of the guiding principles here to this deal is that you're integrating in a deep meaningful way where it's plug-and-play Google Cloud meets Cisco infrastructure well we certainly think that with the work that we've done and the integrations that were were doing that Cisco infrastructure including software capabilities like stealthWatch cloud will absolutely be the best way for any customer who wants to adopt Google Cloud Santos to consume it and to have really the best experience in terms of some of the integration and simplicity that Katie talked about but also frankly security is very important and being able to brain yet consistent security model across Google cloud that workloads running there as well as on Prem through through things like self watch cloud we think will be very compelling for our customers and somewhat unique in the market you know one of the things that's interesting TK the new CEO of Google and I had this cogent onion in green she had Enterprise chops at VMware Google's been hiring a lot of strong enterprise people lately and you can see the transformation and we've interviewed a lot of them I have personally they're good people they're smart and they know what they're doing but Google still gets dinged for not having those enterprise chops because you just can't have a trajectory of those economies of scales overnight you can't just buy your way into the enterprise you got to earn it this is a certain track record it seems like Google's getting a lot with you guys here they're bringing they're bringing clouds to the table for sure for your customer base but you're bringing Cisco complete customer footprint to Google cloud that seems to be a great opportunity for Google I mean I think it's a great opportunity for both of us I mean because we're also bringing a fantastic open multi cloud hybrid solution to our customer base so I think there's a great opportunity for our customers and we really focus on at the end of the day our customers and what do we do to make them more successful and we think that what we're doing with Google will contribute to that can you talk about real quickly summarize what's the benefits to the customers customers watching the announcement seen all the heightened on the buzz on this Google next in this relationship with with Cisco and Google what's the bottom line for the customer they're dealing with complexity what do you guys solve and what's the big takeaway for your customers so it's three things first of all we've taken the complexity out of this equation right we've taken all the complexity around networking around security around bridging two to multiple clouds packages in a scale out appliance delivered in an enterprise consistent way and for them that's that's what they want they want that simplicity of deployment of these next-gen technologies and the second thing is as IT serves their customers the developers in-house they're able to serve those customers much better with these latest generation technologies and frameworks whether it's containers kubernetes is do some of these pieces that that are part of the anthro solution they're able to develop that deliver that to that to their internal stakeholders and do it in a way that they control they feel comfortable with they feel them secure on the networking works and they can stand behind it without having to choose or have doubts on whether they should embrace this or not the end of the day customers want to do the right things to develop fast to be nimble to act and and to do to the latest and greatest and you're taking all those hurdles out of the equation it's about developers it is running software on secure environments for the enterprise guys that's awesome news Google Nexus Asli gonna be great conversations while I have here I want to get a couple top tracks there I think important around the themes we're covering around Google next and certainly challenges and opportunities for enterprises that is the application area multi cloud and hybrid class let's start with application you guys are enabling this application revolutions that's the sound bites we hear that your events and certainly that's been something that you guys been publicly talking about what does that mean for the marketplace because certain everyone's developing applications now you've got mobile apps you've got blockchain absolutely all kinds of new apps coming out all the time software is not going away it's a renaissance happening how is the application revolution taking shape how is and what Cisco's role in it sure I mean our role is to enable that and that that really comes from the fact that we understand that the only reason anyone builds any kind of infrastructure is ultimately to deliver applications and the experiences that applications enable and so that's why you know we pioneered you know a CI is application centric infrastructure we pioneered that and start focusing on the implications of applications in the infrastructure many years ago you know we think about that and the experience that we can deliver at each layer in the infrastructure and Katie talked a little about how important is to integrate those layers but then we also bring tools like app dynamics which really gives our customers the ability to measure the performance of their applications understand the experience that they're delivering with customers and then actually understand how each piece of the infrastructure is contributing to and affecting that performance and that's a great example of something that customers really want to be able to do across on Prem and multiple clouds they really need to understand that the entire thing and so I think something like app D exemplifies our focus on the application it's interesting storage and compute used to be the bottlenecks and developers having to stand that up cloud solve that problem that's right do minimun and I always talk about the cube network the bottleneck now with a CI you guys are solving that problem you're making it much more robust and programmable it this is a key part for application developers because all that policy work can be automated away is that kind of part of that enablement it sure is I mean if you look at what what's happening to applications they're becoming more consumer Erised they're becoming more connected whether it's micro services it's not just one monolithic application anymore it's all of these applications talking to each other and they need to become more secure you need to know you know what happens who can talk to whom which part of the application can be accessed from where to deliver that when my customers tell me listen you deliver the data center you deliver security you deliver networking you deliver multi-cloud you've got app dynamics who else can bring this together and that's what we do is whether it's a CI that specifies policy and does that does that programmable delivers that programmable framework for networking whether it's art art technologies like the tration like after nameks escape mentioned all of these integrate together to deliver the end experience of the customers one which is if my application slow tell me where what's happening and help me deliver this this application that is not a monolith anymore it's it's all of these bits and pieces that talk together talk to each other some of these bits and pieces will reside in the cloud a lot of them will be on Prem some of them will be on the edge but it all needs to work together and robbers don't care about that they just care about do I get the resources do I need and you guys kind of take care of all the heavy lifting underneath the covers yeah and we do that in a modern programmable way which is which is the big change you know we we do it an intent-based way which means we let the developers describe the intent and we control that via policy that's better prizes they want to get invest more in developing building applications okay track number to talk track number to multi-cloud it's interesting during the hype cycle of hybrid cloud which was a while I think now people realize hybrid cloud is an implementation thing and so it's beyond hype down getting into the reality multi-cloud never had a hype cycle because people generally woke up one day and said yeah I got multiple clouds I'm using this over here so it wasn't it wasn't like there was no real socialization around the concept of multi cloud they got it right away they can see it they know what they're paying for so multi-cloud has been a big part of your strategy at Cisco and certainly plays well into here what's happening at Google next what's going on multi-cloud why is there relation with Google important and what do you guys see multi cloud going from a Cisco perspective sure no I mean I think you're right I mean the latest data we saw or have is 94% of enterprises or using or expect to use multiple clouds and I think those surveys have probably more than six points of potential error so I think for all intents and purposes it's 100 percent I've not met a customer whose unique cloud if that's a thing and so you're right it's an incredibly you know authentic trend compared with some of these things that seem to be hype I think what's happening though is the definition of what a multi cloud solution is is shifting so I think we started out as you said with a realization on wait a second we're all multi cloud this really is a thing and there's a set of problems to solve I think you're seeing players get more and more sophisticated in how they solve those problems and what we're seeing is it's solving those problems is not about homogenizing all the clouds and making them all the same because one of the reasons that people are using multiple clouds is to get to the unique capabilities that's in each cloud so I think early on there were some approaches where they said okay what we're gonna put down like a layer across all these clouds and try to make them all look the same that that doesn't really achieve the point the point is Google has unique capabilities in Google cloud you know certainly the the tensorflow capabilities are one that people point to a DBS has unique capabilities as well and and so as as your and so customers want to access all of that innovation so that kind of answers your question of why is this relationship important to us it's for us to meet our customers needs we need to have great relationships partnerships and integrations with the clouds that are important to our customers which is all the time and we know that Google cloud is important not just Google cloud which I think in this relationship it's got my attention because you create a deep relationship with them on a development side providing your expertise on the on the network and other areas you're experts at but you also have to work with other cloud that's we do you're connecting clouds and in fact we do I mean we have we have solutions for hybrid with AWS and as your already launched in the marketplace so we work with all of them and what our role we see really is to make this simpler for our customers so there are things like networking and security application performance management with things like app dynamics as well as some aspects of management that our customers consistently tell us can you just make this the same like these are not the areas of differentiation or unique capability these are areas of friction and complexity and if you can give me a networking framework whether it's SD win or ACI anywhere that helps me connect those clouds and manage policy in a consistent way or you can give me application performance the same over these things or security the same over these things that's gonna make my life easier it's going to be lower friction and I'm expecting it since you're cisco you'll also be able to integrate that with my own prime environment so we've come hard to simple and easy is a good business model absolutely you guys have done that in the past and you certainly have the with from routing evering up the switches into storage KT but talk about the complexity cuz this is where it sounds complex on paper Bo and you actually unpack the technologies involved you know in different cloud suppliers different technologies and tools throw in open sources of the mix is even more complex so multi cloud all those sounds like a simple reality the complexity is pretty significant you just share your thoughts on it is and that's what we serve we excel at in complexity and distilling it down making it simple one of the things that we've done is because each cloud is unique and bring some unique capabilities we've worked with those vendors along those dimensions that they're really really passionate about and strong in so for example at Google we worked on the container front they think are you know maybe one of the pioneers in that space they've certainly delivered a lot of technologies into that domain we've worked with them on the on the cube flow front on the AI front and that we're one of the biggest contributors to the to the open source projects on cube flow and we've taken those technologies and and then created a simple wave firkin for enterprise iit to consume them so what we've done with the anthers but Google takes those technologies takes our networking constructs whether it's a CI anywhere whether it's other networking pieces on different parts of Edwards SD van and so forth and it creates that environment which makes an enterprise IT feel comfortable with embracing this technology you said you're contributing the cube flow what people don't look at Cisco and would instantly comes with the reaction that you guys are heavily contributing into open source can you just share you know the level of commitment you guys are making to open source just get that out there and why why are you doing it yeah for us some of these technologies are really in need for incubation and nurturing right so goop flow is early it's really promising technology people in fact there's a lot of buzz about AR and you can fit into cube flow significantly yes gr we're number three contributor actually behind Google okay so you're up there top three yeah below this and why it's just getting more collaborative or multi cloud work again it comes back to our customers we think who flows are really interesting open framework for AI and ml and and we've seen our customers that workload type is becoming more and more important to them so we're supporting that because it's something that we think will help our customers and in fact cue flow figures into how we think about hybrid and multi cloud with Google and and the Antho system in terms of giving customers the ability to run those workloads in Google cloud with TP use or on Prem with with some of the incredible appliances that we've delivered in the data center using GPUs to accelerate these work and also certainly is compatible with the whole multi-cloud mish exactly that's yeah so you'll see us work we're committed to open source but that commitment comes through the lens of what we think our customers need in one so really again comes back to the customer for us and so you'll see it's very active in open source areas sometimes I think to your point we should be louder about that talk more about that but but we're really not there definite definite create that Suzy we've been working on has been a great success I mean we witness it firsthand seeing that the Cisco live which is packed house and get developers to helping on the network it's a really well it's a huge shift I think it's natural as you see Cisco shifting more and more towards software to see much much more developer engagement and we're thrilled with the way definitely networking guys and your target audience gravitates easily to software it seems to be a nice fit so good good stuff there third third talk track hybrid you guys have deep bench of tech and people on network security networking security data center and all the things involved in the years and years of an enterprise evolution whether it's infrastructure and all the way through the facilities a lot of expertise now hybrid comes onto the scene with a little hype cycle people now get it you got to operate cross clouds on Prem to the cloud and now multiple clouds so what's the current state of Cisco Google relationship with hybrid how does that fit here Google Next and beyond so let me let me tease that in the context of some history right so if we go back say 10 years virtualization virtualization was the buzzword of the day you know things were getting which lies we created the best data center infrastructure for virtualization in our UCS platforms completely programmable infrastructures code a very programmable environment that can pack a lot of density or virtual machines right roll forward three or four years storage and compute were we're getting unruly or completely there was no Plex city that we solved we created the category of converged infrastructure became the leader of that category whether the work we did to the EMC and and and other players roll forward another four or five years we got it to the hyper-converged infrastructure space with the most performant HCI appliance on the market anywhere right most performant most consistent deeply engineered across across all the stats again took that complexity took on took our learnings and DNA in networking and and managed it together to create something unique for the industry now you think to other domains come together now it's the now it's the cloud and on-premise that comes together we see similar kinds of complexity complexity and security complexity in networking complexity in policy and enforcement across layers complexity frankly in management right and how do you make that management much more simple and consumer eyes we've taken that complex at the end is telling it down into developing a very simple appliance so what we're trying to develop deliver today to the customer is a simple appliance that they can stand and procure and set up much in the way that they're used to but now this appliance is scale out it's much more clout like it's managed from the cloud so it's got that consumer and modern feel to it now you can deliver on this a container environment container development environment for your for a developer stakeholders you can deliver security that's plumbed through and across multiple layers networking that plumped through and across multiple layers in the end of the day we've taken those boundaries between cloud and data center and blown them away and you've merged operational constructs of the old data center operations to cloud like operations yeah everything's there's a service you get micro services coming so you didn't really lose anything you mentioned democratizing IT earlier you guys are bringing the hyper flex to a CI to the table so you now can let customers run is that right am I getting it right that's right it's all about how do you take new interesting technologies that are developed somewhere that may have complexity because it's open source and it's changing all the time or it may have complexity because it was not built for a different environment not for not for the on-prem environment how do you take that innovation and democratize it so that everybody all of the hundreds and thousands and millions of enterprise customers can use it and feel comfortable using and feel feel comfortable actually embracing it in a way that gives them the security gives them the networking that's needed and gives them the way that they can serve their internal stakeholders very easily guys thanks for taking the time for is awesome conversation one final question let get your both the way you know on here at Google next 2019 we're in 2019 clouds going a whole nother level here what's the most important story that customers should pay attention to with respect to expanding into the cloud taking the advantage of the growing developer ecosystem as open source continues to go the next level what's the most important thing happening around Google next and the industry with the cloud and for the enterprise well I think certainly here at Google next the Google clouds anthos announcement is going to be of tremendous interest to enterprises because as you said they are extending into the cloud and this is another great option for enterprises who are looking to do that yeah and as I look at it you know suddenly IT has a set of new options they used to be able to pick networking and compute and storage now they can pick cube flow for AI or they can take kubernetes for for container development anthos for an on-prem version their shopping list has suddenly gone up we're trying to keep that simple and organized for them so that they can pick the best ingredients they can and build the best infrastructure day they can they can do it - thanks so much Kip comp the senior vice-president cloud platform and Solutions Group and KD vice president the data center compute group Francisco it's been exclusive cube conversation around the Google Cisco big news at Google next 2019 I'm John for thanks for watching [Music]
