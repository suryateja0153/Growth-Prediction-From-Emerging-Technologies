Willett yeah yeah I mean in it I don't know if anybody watched the video but this this individual in 2010 came up with an idea of saying bitcoins out there I mean Bitcoin was selling for like six ten cents a Bitcoin or something he said you know if you could if you could put something on top of Bitcoin I don't even know if we use the term smart contract but he did say if you can put an application on top of Bitcoin it was before Vitalik boot around camera along with ethereal he said you could raise a lot of money and he went to conference after conference and tried to convince people and there's even this one feedback where somebody said to him in an email exchange you're probably breaking the law this can't be legal but he couldn't get anybody to adopt this idea and he's not wealthy now either he missed the whole ICO wave but he was basically kind of the inventor of this initial coin offering saying that the technology of Bitcoin even the scripting language was enough that you could maybe raise money on top of Bitcoin with an application layer and we'll we'll sort through now I'm gonna see if I can do a little video for you this shouldn't be too hard for me so this is a two minute video of all the icos that have ever happened and and elementa syv shown you this picture but you know there wasn't much where we are we in 2015 now nothing so you see the first ICO that they mark in there is is a theorem itself raised 18 million dollars yeah I apologize it's only gonna take two minutes but you're gonna see the whole history of icos and and then there's nothing it's really so you can see no country no official sector is really focused on this in 2016 but then there's gonna be a big offering in the middle of 2016 anybody know who that is Dow 168 million and it fails its spectacularly fails 50 million of its stolen and it leads to the etherium fork and things like that but still not a lot and then by the summer of 17 Katie bar or the door tezo sand quarter billion dollars fall coin a quarter a billion dollars and then oh I pulled the one that finished in 2017 I'm sorry so there's the the final chart that goes all the way through August now some say that it's not twenty eight billion some say it's twenty three billion because there's no really good figures but es raises 4.2 billion and telegram raises 1.7 billion huge amounts of money and this isn't a period almost all of this was raised in in about twelve months from June of seventeen to June of eighteen coal at twenty five billion in that twelve months and now it's trickling off now it's less than a half a billion dollars a month but that twenty five billion in twelve months compares to venture capital and Simone you might help me but venture capital worldwide is about a hundred and fifty billion a year and in a twelve month period and I think the figures range from 125 two hundred seventy billion but so it just gives you a sense in this twelve month period it's give or take twenty percent of the size of all venture funds twenty to thirty percent roughly of all venture funds then again it's tailing off but it's significant if you can come up with an idea in these 12 months and raise the money junior will its idea you know this was this was the moment so what our initial coin offerings what's the more detailed characteristics well number one their proceeds that help build a network that's what Vitalik Butera actually did back in 2013 is when he published in 2014 is when he went live but he was raising 18 million dollars hired a law firm big big law firm and I can't remember its Perkins or Skadden Arps but a big US law firm partnered up with a Canadian Joe Lubin who saw this potential in a 19 or 20 year old kid who has great great writing skills you know a lot about Bitcoin he had been writing about it for a number of years but he also had a great idea moved off to Switzerland for regulatory and other reasons set up a foundation for tax and other reasons and did it in a very professional way but you can look at their sources and uses you can go back to the original offering and say they were willing to say what they were gonna use the 18 million dollars for law fees and Counting fees and the usual things you do when you start something so its proceeds to help build a network but just like that moment it was before the network could be used so there was pre functional we're gonna show statistics later but anybody want to take a gander in the last three months so this isn't back 2014 I'm talking about third quarter of 2018 what percentage of token offerings were offered before the network is functional fully functional st. Joleen 99 anybody else want to take a a argue argue with a lien just because he's a computer scientist Tom all right 95 all right so we go to a market so 95 99 does anybody want to say that more than 5% were functional no all right I'll give you the number later it's in between the two of you it's in between the two of ya so it's raising money before something is functional it's like raising the money for a Broadway play before you've got the actors and the script or it's even worse than that you don't even have the idea but usually you have an idea usually what percentage of icos are marketed on just an eye yeah anybody I have that statistic later - right right yeah but view what do you think I would think maybe obvious an idea maybe sixty percent sixty to seventy percent Sean ninety all right no it's in between the two yeah Rahim is a little closer it's about seventy five percent just an idea or at least is defined by a certain tracking Center so it's usually you have an idea you market it you raise some money or at least during these boom periods in the last fifteen months the development while open source is largely centralized but in fact in the last quarter in the last three months well over half isn't even open source technology any longer partly because it's so based on just an idea that people aren't publishing their source code until later they will eventually publish some source code but at the moment of the initial coin offering a majority don't even have open source software at that moment even though they say later they'll publish this software but even if it's open source it's highly centralized please I'm gonna sell something these are the points you should use open source so there's a movement in technology and software development certainly was just started in the 1990s but it may have even been earlier but now it's very prevalent where you publish your software and everybody can see it so it's transparency in software that's called the open source movement in in the blockchain technology when Satoshi Nakamoto first published Bitcoin software in January of 2009 it was open source when it meant everybody could see the computer code and you could even it's actually was published under an MIT license which meant you didn't have to pay any fee to use it zero fee you can copy it you can use the Bitcoin court software that's that's the definition that's kind of the best definition of open source because it's with an MIT license but it's it's truly open that's what I'm referencing here and the relevance is is that though there's a big open source movement in a lot of fields and and in blockchain and certainly in Bitcoin and the theory of network is open source many many developments and initial coiny offerings don't publish their code until months later they raise the money they're still developing their code did with me put their money in before the code is published why do investors put money into any investment Sabrina what's it what's FOMO but you're missing at all right oh by the way Sabrina and talita I announced that anybody that was here today got double credit for participating right before Thanksgiving so just to let you know lived by that so fear of missing out why else do people invest in any investment even if you're just investing in Apple stock or to get returns to get a profit to take risk and a return British in one of the reasons I mentioned that one strategy of putting a body in an ICU is kind of going to the board and understanding so I thought that that is kind of a pre-requisite for the investment I also happen to attend one second right here where there was a company for the Rockets which is founded by a well I got picked test they kind of evaluate these sports and run some simulations to verify whether they are doing what they're supposed to be doing so I thought that it's kind of a prerequisite so you assume that you could always read the code to make the investment in the fall of 2017 and into the spring of 2018 I would suggest that wasn't always the case in fact it usually was not the case I think if these things are to persist my prediction is you know you'll see more and more rigor in this marketplace oh I skipped promotores the people of starting it keeps some of the coins for themselves this is not that different from any venture capital round when you're raising money and you're selling equity or selling a preferred stock in something and you're you know this any of you taking a ventures course or if you worked in it you're gonna keep equity for yourself as well so this is just how much do you keep for yourself how much do you sell the public but just translate it to a new form of capital raising instead of it being applied to your equity you're applying it to your your this new form of fundraising they're fungible and transferable meaning you can sell them sometimes you can't sell them for a number of months technically speaking sometimes you can't sell them until the platform is is functioning but often you can still sell them by private agreement private arrangements in aetherium let me just mention something on a theorem when a theorem was first sold for 12 months the only record you had that you were purchasing aetherium was the email return from either Vitalik or others who said yes you're purchased it it wasn't even that you had a private key for 12 months you had an email confirmation but you could based on that email confirmation cell the right to the what later you would be issued and more specifically feels like you're not even getting the token you're not getting rights like that seems like a second order like really far removal from like even close to any form of a utility network is this an answer to this set yeah so isn't it because like a nerdy you execute mean like right now the coins aren't considered as a security and if you are doing ico then you can only sell it to the credit investors or bare selected if you are facing the US and you can do something how do we been like outside the US and so I think staff is like trying to see if like coins can at some point they can be security so like I think the purpose of sadness to I guess like you know like expand to cut basically investor base so that like more people can purchase so so you its GE right Sergey he's answer delved into the regulatory but I'm gonna say I'm gonna take it up a level from the regulatory what you said was accurate but there's a it's selling something for future delivery because the token currently is not usable just in the last quarter I'm talking about the last quarter of 2018 three quarters of the icos that were started or launched were just on an idea so they hadn't yet written the code you a token wouldn't even be usable so you have some economic basis to say I'm trying to sell you something that will be a future delivery when Vitalik buddha ran even did aetherium you got an email it was not called a simple agreement for future token so what's aft is but it was a simple email for a future token I mean it was in essence an economic arrangement where you exchange Bitcoin for an email and that email some 12 months later you would get a private key when the Genesis block happened and most of these still had to deal with that economic arrangement then a law firm here in Boston took an arrangement that was handled in securities offerings and they created something and they put out a in essence a legal white paper if you wish called a simple agreement for future tokens saft to try to address they thought they thought I think they were wrong by the way but they thought they were addressing a bunch of regulatory issues that somehow the saft this this would be maybe have to register under the securities laws in the US but when you finally got the token maybe later it would not have to be a registered security and they were trying to do a two-tiered arrangement but even before you got to the this Boston law firm that did this you still had the economic reality that you were trying to raise money today to get a token later and then the lawyers sort of got involved just try to I would say they were trying to get between the wallpaper and the wall of regulation and say we'll register the first thing we'll give it a fancy name we'll call it a saft we won't register the second thing when you finally get the token twelve months later I think they'll probably end up mistaken on that but I think that was the background then we hit a couple other points scarcity is usually but not always foster through some monetary policy then we go back to Nakamoto consensus and Bitcoin what's the monetary policy there anybody remember that monetary I call it monetary policy but it's the control of the supply of the money supply so what's the money supply algorithm in Bitcoin Halon half there's a reward the Bitcoin monetary policy is a reward of anybody remember the reward today twelve and a half coins today it started at 50 coins every how many minutes ten minutes on average but every two hundred thousand blocks it haves so somewhere out in the 22nd century it will cap at 21 million coins but way before that the monetary policy it's it's slowing and slowing and slowing the growth rate so embedded in the algorithm of Bitcoin is a monetary policy is it immutable how many people would say that's that's hard-coded and immutable not a hand how many people would say it's actually not immutable so what can change it the lien you didn't raise your hand either way yes I'm listening what has changed so elites pointing out not everybody will go along with the new monetary policy but I would note one aetherium they've changed their monetary policy two or three times and they haven't had to use a hard fork so they've changed their block reward and then changing a block reward by lowering the block rewards by consensus they effectively are changing their monetary policy because they're changing there in essence their inflation rate but most initial coin offerings have some algorithm some built in what we'll call money supply policy or monetary policy but not all of them do some if you read them closely they can issue as much as they want whenever they want and so forth but I'd say the majority have a monetary policy if this space if this world really took off a lot of monetary policy economists would study it but there's not a lot of deep research yet on what works what doesn't work it's kind of a playground or a sandbox if it were to ever take off as to exploring monic hard monetary policies Sean may go away started a Kickstarter so this looks like Kickstarter to you but doesn't just Kickstarter give you something else there's a big difference which is that Kickstarter you fix the price and you let the market determine the quality right and you arguably you fix the quantity and you let the market determine the price that's a big difference in those two and and the fact that there is serve a secondary market you know yes you can I mean I would argue it's a lot harder right and but it also is the case that you know what you know if I'm selling a new widget I know I'm gonna sell it for the early birds for 30 bucks right that's that's the price right here you're letting the auction is for the price not important yeah so there are similarities to Kickstarter there's similarities to other crowdfunding mechanisms but there's also some real distinctions in terms of one of course this is all digital assets and Kickstarter often there's a service or a good a physical good or service you're getting but also what shamone does Hugo were you and then only on the secondary markets do the prices change isn't that the case you want to spit in ICO they'll be like oh here's a thousand coins for point one three four point one F that I guess varies based on the price fluctuations like in u.s. dollars if you're still thinking US dollars but like since you're using ether to pay for the ICO you're saying it's not really that prices variable until it gets to the secondary market but I would contend that one big difference between most of what's done on Kickstarter not everything but most and here is here the investors really are looking and anticipating profits and returns when I think of most people that are going into Kickstarter they're getting one product one one unit of something as a reward and they're not looking for a significant profit or appreciation they could may be modest but not super early birds yeah so there's monetary policy and this last point that purchases really are anticipating profits through appreciation so that's kind of what I think of now howtoav valuate I see oh so you're not gonna be surprised by my first one it's what we've talked a lot about in this class assess the viability of the token use case like does it have make any sense does it make any sense do you need to use an append-only log with the consensus among a bunch of parties they can write to a ledger so append-only logs and consensus throw a bunch of cryptography in there too but and do you need a native token you know those basic fundamental economics that we've talked about a lot this semester hopefully we'll save you all from investing in really bad AI cos but beyond that which i think is over 50% of what you should do read the white paper I tell you if anybody can read the telegram The Telegraph white paper that they raise 1 point 7 billion and please tell me feel free to tell me what they are gonna use that money for because I've read it a number of times and I wouldn't I wouldn't invest in it because it felt like they could raise the money and do almost anything they want with it I mean it they're an incredible company they've got hundreds of millions of users and they have incredible resources to draw upon but I'm still not sure what they're using the the what I will ultimately be able to use the coin for what service I can get from the that and what they're using the money for so I would say read the white paper and if there's source code which is less than half the time their source code have somebody you trust read the source code if you can't read it you know who's the team just like any venture capital investor you want to know who's the team what's their history what's their experience and so forth but I kind of start with the economics and the white paper for before I get to the team and the website is their venture capital involvement and who and what which ones now VCS often will take part of the at this stage will part of the equity and also part of the coin round so they're doing high bred investments it's very rare in now in November of 2018 that a venture capitalist will only take a part of the token round in late in the 17 they were still some that were just getting on the on this parade and taking parts of the top reap basically the pre round of the tokens but now they want they want part of the actual equity and tokens right but their first investment is either a preferred or an equity you look like instrument winning investor like five to ten years and here's like and then adjust what is the observation is this might shorten the time frame for venture capitalists I would say yes during this 2017 2018 period I don't know if that will persist but yes I think that for a venture capitalist saying well I can be taken out by selling the company I can be taken out of my investor determine how am I gonna sell my investment my take out I can take the company public I can sell the company or maybe I can ICO and if you can do it sooner and what happened a lot in in the fall of seventeen and into eighteen as many venture capitalists change their standard contracts and their standard documentation when they were investing in in startups to say also that they could participate in the IC around and that they could participate in the early rounds but if you're assessing an IC o---- and you're thinking about investing in it you want to know what venture capitalists are backing it and then a big thing that folks look at I put it fifth on the list as you can say is what's the community how many reddit posts medium posts how many are people were following in Bitcoin talk etc etc etc there's eight or ten of these these talk channels and I don't know the ratios anymore but it used to be like if you could fly you could you could get to like seven to ten thousand folks following you on reddit and medium and everything you knew you could raise a successful ICO like in the heyday if you could get your numbers to a certain following then that was enough momentum to raise your fifteen to thirty million dollars I think that's probably a little less so now what Tom this is just like a definition of the greater full theory right but not people believe that your your token is valuable right but if you're a momentum investor and you're just saying or if it's FOMO investing is Sabrina said you know to see how big the community is and is there an interest in it does this have a following is I set up neither maximalism realest I'm just I'm not know not trying to but this is a real economics if you had a hundred thousand people following in a community probably more likely it's a successful IC o---- in terms of raising money doesn't mean it's gonna be successful as a token later on here actually if you have that the person who's publishing the white paper has nothing posted he has never been there then he raises a little bit of suspicious you have to go on and do some more research on the paper it is a it is a way to see whether there's other people even tuning in and showing interest and it could be the greater full theory just because you know if Tim Draper or Mike Novogratz is invested who are both very savvy investors I'm very successful investors you might say do I want to be in or does that my time to say it's not to be in because they've already gotten the best of it either way I mean there's still good investors what's their monetary policy you know again how is it housing an effect can they is it one of the majority that has a fixed monetary policy or is it one of the minority that has no monetary policy at all how do they distribute the tokens and I mean in two ways basically some will actually disclose a cap table a capitalization table of the tokens the same way you can think of a capitalization table of equity but who owns the tokens pre sale and post sale so that's what I mean by token distribution are they keeping 10% for the founder or 80% for the founder might change your view on all of it but also token distribution is how are they selling it during what's usually a 30 to 60 day period or 15 to 60 day period the longest that I am aware of is three hundred and fifty days Leo sold over three hundred and fifty days every day was a was a form of a Dutch auction it was a remarkable way that they sold 4.2 billion I doubt that anybody who did iOS at the beginning thought they were gonna raise over a billion dollars in fact they might maybe nobody thought they'd raise over a hundred million because they started in the summer of 17 but they didn't a distribution over 350 days most they were done over 15 60 days or so please captive similarity how Ric owes encounter for like do they go as equity on our revenue what's where do they fall so terrific question how or ico proceeds accounted for women who's our accountant Aviva all right no idea from Aviva I'm gonna try to answer it but anybody in a way what's the debit and what's the credit what's that you know if the t-account right we got T account over here is cash right cuz you receive cash when you sold something what's the credit item question mark what's that you think it's retained earnings yes do you think it's just retained earnings they're selling nothing right so the question is is it earnings is it a revenue item when you sell it or some people book it as revenue so there's two ways you can book it you can you could also book it as a liability but but it's either a deferred revenue or a current revenue all right what could motivate you to book it as a deferred revenue instead of current revenue is if you what's that taxes so some book it is deferred revenue scuzz they don't want to book taxes and God knows whether that's really the right way to book it and others book it as right as a revenue item right now but I don't know of anybody whether they're booking is deferred revenues or current rep that wants to book it to trigger that it's a security so most most law firms that I understand that they're not they're not accountants but they don't want their clients to book it in a way that will make it look more like equity so it's either deferred revenue or current revenue some I've heard of call it a liability but I think that's the minority I don't know if it takes too much time to go through a use case to make these examples tangible if I'm I'm promising to deliver good then they the company is getting birthday tokens right how do you put it back again in the market so the question is what is the use case there's some use cases the token is issued and it's really for the community and some tokens come back to the company so a file storage file coin for instance they issued they raised 250 some million dollars the equivalent of and in that case I think the token would be used within the community rather than back to the company so even like etherium when you use a theorem as a form of buying computing power it doesn't go back to the etherium foundation so the the the most dominant and that's why it really should be booked as current revenue because it's not even that the software provider is providing a service later the most dominant use case is like in aetherium that you're using the earth for other people in the network it's a monetary unit that's not coming back there are some where it comes back and then it's it's basically return to the corporate Treasury you so it's two different use two different models about lost year are you with me all right one way is is that it gets returned to the company that's the more narrow case usually it's you're selling a token that will be used and I'll give it to a lawn because the lawn gives me file storage Milan will give it to Tom because Tom gives the lawn file storage in aetherium it literally keeps going around and it doesn't get returned - it never gets burned and never gets extinguished and hand it back to the company the pricing strategy on that first issuance depends then on the value of if it's storage from the one you will story in theory it's its own theory I I think that a lot of this has been on speculation and a FOMO and things like that and a bubble account or eighteen month of bubble but on theory yes it should be to be an equilibrium it should be a discount to the future value of storage because today you're buying a token that you might be able to use tomorrow but because there's a probability weighting that you won't be able to use it if they don't complete the software if they don't complete the roll out it should sell it in equilibrium it should sell at a discount to its eventual utility value that would be where it would be an equilibrium [Applause] they're not determining what one unit of boy is good for right usually not some way papers do but usually not it's not just maybe think okay one unit will buy you one terabyte of storage now of course the balusters by size will depend on the electricity cost electricity and hardware and all that's not in the future I don't know in the supply system this is very hard to pin down the fundamental value of that coin in it like outside of how tennis care how big maybe it will be and all that stuff because here like you know the coin and they and the service that you get here you're asking let me say you're asking absolutely the right question it's one that I've been kicking around a little bit with a couple other faculty members in the finance group here with Antoinette and Leonid who have done a lot of research in this area and we're all like we're not sure exactly and these are some of the most world-class talented finance faculty like how do you really get to the value of a token one when they're so little written in these white papers about the specificity and I gave one reading which was Christians reading and I apologize cuz it has a lot of formulas and everything but you know he grapples with this where is it in equilibrium where what's the equilibrium price and the equilibrium price should be some discount to that future value of the service or the good and if there's more uncertainty of what that service are good it's almost has to be a greater discount and yet it appears that the market has been pricing it at of a premium too and I think I mean if you didn't take anything from Christians paper that's what I was trying to you know that that the market has been at a premium even though it probably should be discounted and that's why issuers that's why entrepreneurs have tapped into it because it's a form of cheap financing it's been been a remarkable area of cheap financing we look or enjoy like 50.1 it's actually whatever and it's no longer saft yeah wouldn't if it actually ever comes out so it's the idea that final point at that point would transition this to like realize revenue and then if I pay Zhaan you know three five coins or whatever the unit is for storage that he books at as like income and is taxed on that where's it has there been any thought is dead how dot if dawn is selling false yes he would have to book income as I understand it and that that you you're transferring a coin just like you're transferring a URL where a yen or a dollar and at the time the the the IRS has spoken to this five six years ago it's it's marked to market value the day that you you know in essence deliver the service and receive the coin I mean I'm not entirely sure what happens if you get the coin a day later but it's basically the mark market value at an exchange rate that day but back to Fiat always translated back to the fiat currency in in this case the US dollar I don't know I try to figure that out by next Tuesday because we get I cos twice I'll dig in and try to answer and if anybody else knows but the revenue models are very with thousands of these whether in essence file coins entire revenue model was the ICO no the second big piece of the revenue model is retaining some ownership so so let's look at ripple the company ripple the company though they did their Genesis block back in 2013 they basically distributed 20% of their tokens and kept eighty percent and subsequently they have been slowly selling and they're now down 61% but their revenue model and XOR P is an essence selling the XOR P they only came up with a real use case of XOR P in 2018 in a prototype called X rapid there had X current which was a messaging system prior that didn't need to use x RP at all so for four years you had no use of X or P as I understand it zero use today it's the second highest value cryptocurrency it's passed aetherium with the fall-off of the value of aetherium in Bitcoin and 18 billion dollars I couldn't tell you what it's worth I can tell you that's what coin market dot you know calm or cap says they're worth but but their revenue model is selling x RP in that case and so many of them the revenue models or the up ice the initial IC o---- keep a bucket whether you keep ten percent or in that case it was eighty percent and then try to monetize and sell it over time and even in aetherium which was in essence an IC o---- they kept about nine percent in the etherium foundation they're down to one percent ownership in the etherium foundation so they don't receive and when aetherium moves around the network the etherium foundation and vitalik bit around don't receive any of that but I'd have to look at file coin to see whether in essence they burn any in essence does any of it go back to the issuer I don't think so but I'll check take this and then we'll move on in a couple statistics so who regulates the ICS we're going to talk a lot about on Tuesday after Thanksgiving when we can thank and eat some turkey so can we hold that for Tuesday but it really it really is depends on the jurisdiction here in the u.s. it would be the Securities and Exchange Commission but because most of these are our really non-compliant securities offerings and last Friday the SEC put out a release I mean they put out many many releases but last Friday so maybe we'll put that up Sabrina and Thalia if you remind me I'll shoot you a link and we'll put it into canvas but it's only two or three pages but for the first sign that really talked about illegal securities offering so they use the word illegal and and they're starting to get to the place where they're shutting some of these down that we're not necessarily you know scammy or fraud II but they're just saying you didn't register but generally speaking it would be securities regulators if it's regulated and some jurisdictions it's not so this is the most important thing can you assess the value bility a token use case you remember my little slides but again it's the strategic questions and these are the same questions I'm asking you to think about in your final papers basically what's the value creation proposition or pain points what are competitors doing how our competitors facing off in this and if you're looking at any IC o---- just think about the competitive landscape some of them are quite populated with a lot of competition false storaged foul coin is not the only one so you look at the others and see how they're addressing the same issues and really why is a blockchain technology or native token even the solution and then you get digging into it why do you need an append-only log what verification encrypt and networking cost iraq actually addressed what transactions are actually recorded on a ledger i mean these are the basic building blocks that if you take anything away hopefully it's this like one-page of questions to have some critical skills as you go off and somebody says well I've got this great blockchain idea or great tokens and then not to forget all the door and challenges that we still have scalability performance privacy security network coordination and interoperability I know and you say there's no challenges of interoperability but so you know these these I'm not going to re-review but they're gonna be in canvas if you want to grab them I mean this is the same conceptual framework for an ICO or even in a permission blockchain which I sense a lot of your thinking about doing so some statistics and then we'll close it out and these are just fun charts that will all be in canvas and I just went around finding different websites I don't know that you can trust any of these numbers but they're the best numbers out there so here here are some of the industries 23% is infrastructure that's five billion dollars of race but most of that most of that I think is the EOS I think that's called an infrastructure project infrastructure because AOS is trying to compete with etherium finance communication trading and investment payments you see some some consistency a lot of financial sector use cases gaming and then you're down to two and three percent slices so they're just a little sense of some of the industries and again this will all be in canvas here's published i cos we peaked at about 500 a month four or 500 a month in February through April we're down to about 200 a month now now this means published that doesn't mean they've necessarily raised we're just under about 5,000 that have been published maybe 3,000 give or take of race of money and only about half of those actually exist today or that you can find them somewhere in you know so forth the market this is the third quarter based on a website called ICO rating they publish a quarterly report I'm not saying it's completely exhaustive 1.8 billion I see are raised down 78 percent from q2 just to give you a sense of the size but 1 billion dollars of blockchain vici raised in the same quarter ICO surpassed VC investment in blockchain in the third quarter of 17 before that VC raised was higher and I think it's coming back and I it's a reasonable shot that in one or two more quarters the VC number will be higher than the ICO number but this is just a hunch as to where where we're headed some other statistics of the 600 that this this is one quarter about two hundred a month or 600 for the quarter that they tracked 84% on the etherium platform almost every data source I can find rages from 80 to 85% so it's still highly focused on a theory and platform and I would say as the as the ICO boom comes off it's probably also one of the reasons the etherium the price and valuation of aetherium has come off as well just because of the relationships only four percent of these 600 or 24 of them got listed on an exchange that they raised enough money but look at that 57% raise less than a hundred thousand a piece so it's highly concentrated in a small 67% of the dap i cos were unsuccessful now whatever their measurement of unsuccessful they didn't raise money or they raised a little bit of money but the website went dark that's all within three months and again I can't speak to how they measure success but 76 percent were just an idea this is again based on ICO rating and one point three seven percent what you were at one percent your five percent but 1.7 percent had their code so three percent we're either fully ready or had their source code so you want to read the white paper if you're really curious but 76 percent you might say how can you raise money on an idea this is really pre fun and this is even after the markets kind of the bloom is off the Rose this is this third quarter 2018 here's the industries again for the third quarter exchanges and while its financial services trading so it's deeply financed a little bit health care and so forth and let's see if I think I have one or two more of these oh this is how they've done this is interesting to me this is the returns in the third quarter now I know this is actually before the sell-off for the last week and a half the only sector that went up is I don't even know which I cos these are the marketing and advertising everything else got clobbered I've been around markets for a long time three or four decades when you get this type of return picture there's gonna be fewer icos rather than more icos because you know it just keeps cutting down the investor enthusiasm I don't think it's FOMO anymore what's the opposite of foam what's that so all right so study questions for next Tuesday is just we're gonna go back to I co is talk a little bit about the scams and frauds we're going to talk about the Securities and Exchange Commission we've already talked a lot about their design features so it's it's going to be like going back to some of the regulatory things I'll try to look up on the foul coin questions as well we will drop one more reading in which is just this quick two pager from the sec from last Friday that's maybe worthwhile looking at and this is the best thing I could do to say Happy Thanksgiving I know it's a Bitcoin turkey blockchain Turkey and the like but well I do think it's an interesting thing I see OS or new means of crowdfunding and there's been so many different ways to raise money over centuries it's this is not equity it's not debt it's something else I don't know how much of it will last three and five years from now but the idea that you could pre-fund an idea a deferred revenue or some sort but it's kind of not your revenue is an interesting evolution in in the markets of finance but I think if you can't assess the viability of the use case and figure out what really is the benefit of the token economics it comes back to is there really a benefit to having a native token on a network for a good or service for file storage for ride-sharing and so forth then I think this will just be looked back decades from now people will look back and say well that was kind of a small little odd thing that happened back there in the 20 teens but it might be I'm not I'm not I'm not all the way at a zero I think there might be a reason why folks want to have a native currency and native token to jumpstart a network and to motivate a network over time whether it's like swords and skins and shields in a gaming site the majority by SEOs though have failed already and because they keep failing so fast by I don't know by the end of this year or certainly by the middle of next year over 90 or 95% of them will have failed like if you take the whole total so it's pretty clear it's gonna come down there's gonna be less and less probably in this IC o---- thing it doesn't mean that that blockchain technology is over it just means that this kind of this wave I think will diminish so happy Thanksgiving is there a question before we all go to Thanksgiving and airports and trains quick questions this any ice ownership of the company sighs it's purely fort okay we'll talk about this Tuesday the question is can you ever have an ownership right in in a token the the answer is yes you could structure to have voting rights governance rights dividend rights they're up a handful that have done that but after the DAO or Dow issuance which did give some governance rights and cash flow rights the SEC spoke to that in a paper one year ago or 15 months ago there's very few of them most of them are what you would call either utility tokens or service tokens where you have a right to get a service or a good usually from the rest of the network rather than back I'll check on file point but but the answer is yes you can do it but it's a rare case that does it so thank you Happy Thanksgiving thank you for all being in this class [Applause]
