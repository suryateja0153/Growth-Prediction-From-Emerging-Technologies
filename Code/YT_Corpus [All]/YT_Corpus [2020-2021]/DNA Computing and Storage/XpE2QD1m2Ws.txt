 sure why do we need to store information in DNA or why do we even need a new storage medium for this data when we have already things like hard drives or magnetic tape or flash drives the estimate right now is that we're creating so much data that by 2025 we'll have generated a lot more useful data then we'll have the ability to store so we want to provide a solution for that gap between the useful data that we're generating and our ability to store and so why did we land on DNA that was pretty simple actually because DNA is the medium that nature had settled on to store its most precious information so it's got incredible information density it's about a million times higher in the amount of bits that you can store in the same volume as compared to flash drives right now I know so it's got a extremely long shelf life so the stability of the molecules extreme if you store things in DNA will last for thousands of years and high since you're using enzymes to copy the information you can go from one copy of the information to a billion copies literally a billion copies in a matter of one or two hours and at almost zero cost so that could enable totally new applications for data storage the ability to have so many different copies of the same information at a very low price the short-term goals for the company is to complete this machine that we've been working on for the last year and a half and what it is is a machine that will enable us to store about a terabyte of information for 24 hours per 24 hours and we can do that at a cost that's about a million times cheaper than what's been possible before with DNA so with that machine we're looking for pilot customers and partners so got large companies and government agencies that will use this machine with us to store some of their data into DNA and will retrieve portions of it back as its requested the goal there is to figure out if this tier of data storage this new medium can fit in their existing solutions and also for the partners to influence the direction of our development in developing this totally new technology platform but a longer-term vision for us really isn't just to stay a storage company but to be able to turn DNA into a computational medium the advantage of doing that is DNA is a medium that stores the data but it's also the place where competition happens so if if we're able to do highly parallel computation on this medium using enzymes there are other DNA molecules we can solve problems that's not possible to solve using classical computing and we can also save a lot of energy in doing that because the medium that the data is stored in is the medium that the computation happens in instead of as opposed to traditional media where the storage medium is different from the place where computation and memory is done you [Music]
