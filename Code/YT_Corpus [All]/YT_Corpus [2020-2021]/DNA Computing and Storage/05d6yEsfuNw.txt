 there is no doubt that the demand for public cloud solution is rising at an extensive rate and this translates to growing opportunities for public cloud providers as well and two of the major cloud players of 2019 are Amazon Web Services and Google cloud platform. Hey guys this is Shubham from Intellipaat and today we're gonna compare both of these cloud Giants and discuss which one to choose so without any further delays let's get started. First let's take a brief look over both of these cloud services starting off with Amazon Web Services where according to their official website Amazon Web Services is a subsidiary of amazon.com which provides on-demand cloud computing platforms to individuals, companies and governments on a paid subscription basis similarly Google cloud which is offered by Google is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products such as Google search engine and YouTube now let's look into the history and talk about the establishment of both. AWS was launched in 2006 thus having more experience in cloud domain than Google or any of the cloud computing providers and it successfully meet the on-demand needs of enterprises in regards to cloud computing platform. On the other hand Google cloud was launched in 2011 which is no doubt a third competitor after Azure and is quite a reliable and cheap cloud computing platform for businesses but still the question remains how are these two cloud services different and what are the factors that we need to focus on while comparing AWS and Google cloud that we shall discuss while we move ahead. Sarting off from the basic and discuss the first factor that is the availability zones we are all aware of their establishments now we all know that the AWS was the first one of its kind right which means a AWS is hosting a multiple locations worldwide and of course is true for Google as well but here also the difference occurs in the numbers of region and availability zones talking of numbers AWS has 55 availability zones worldwide with 8 more on its way whereas Google is having 18 availability zones with 3 more on the way which is no doubt is quite lesser than AWS. Now let's move forward and talk about the next factor that is the market share. If we check this graph right here which clearly depicts that how AWS is leading with 40% of public cloud market share worldwide on its name whereas azure on the second place with 30% of market share and Google cloud is on the third place with 10% of market share and the other cloud providers are at 20%. right? also if you check the Google Trends graph and compare the popularity. These are the stats where you can easily figure out that how interest for AWS has been surpassing Google cloud worldwide in the past 12 months also if we check their search results and trends according to USA same cases here as well where there is more interest for AWS than Google cloud in case of India here are the results still aws is more trending than Google cloud. These are the results from past 12 months and have been waiting and relatively increasing with AWS on first and Google cloud on third place from past decade and guys according to a recent report by CNBC even though Google cloud is lagging behind AWS and azure with 5.44 billion dollars and six billion dollars respectively they have crossed a 1 billion dollars per quarter of revenue by 2018 which is actually a good number for beginner who just recently entered into the public cloud market it is just taking time to cope up with other cloud providers because of being a late comer in the cloud domain we can say also Google suite now has four million paying customers said by sundar pichai sounds convincing right? Now what we can conclude from the fact that AWS is on the first place as a cloud provider is that due to its more experience and implementation in the cloud domain it obviously has a bigger community support and trust across its clients. This is the reason why aws has more high-profile customers like Netflix Airbnb Unilever BMW Samsung's Xiaomi Zinga etc no doubt I haven't seen too many experienced reports on Google cloud but almost every feedback or reviews are checked about them were good enough says that share the same infrastructure that of Google search engine and YouTube that is why many huge companies are having faith on them and some of the major clients are hsbc PayPal twentieth Century Fox Bloomberg Target Domino's etc. Don't think it's quite impressive for a public cloud provider like Google to be on third place with such huge revenue even when they are relatively new one compared to a title holder such as AWS now after discussing the establishment in the market let's talk about what each provider has to offer in terms of services and then discuss about their integration with the open source tools. So the services which I am going to compare here comes under the following domains: compute, database, storage, security, networking, monitoring, development and Internet of Things so aws covers up like 200 plus services whereas Google Cloud have been catching up with it with the lesser number of 60 plus services. In these domains some of the services that AWS covers are Amazon Web Services ec2, rds, s3, Iam, VPC, cloud watch, cloud 9, IOT core and many more. Similarly Google cloud covers the services like cloud engine, cloud datastore, cloud storage, cloud Iam, cloud DNS or we can call it Google cloud DNS stack driver monitoring, cloud SDK, cloud IOT core and many more. No doubt with a lesser number and also both of these cloud providers have better relations with the open source communities both AWS and Google cloud can integrate with multiple open source tools like docker, ansible, github, jenkins,kubernetes, tenserflows etc and more importantly they are both friendlier when it comes to the Linux servers. Now another factor is its down time and speed so having a matured infrastructure the maximum downtime phase by AWS in 2015 was of 2 hours and 30 minutes whereas having a progressing infrastructure Google faced a huge downtime of 11 hours and 34 minutes in 2015 and that is why when you compare the reliability in both this is where AWS comes out to be a preferable choice talking about its speed well this is where Google cloud platform takes the lead. Let us check from the basic demonstration that how quick both of these services are when it comes to launching an instance now I've opened up my account on AWS management console as well as on the Google cloud platform so we'll start off from launching an ubuntu machine so we'll start from ec2 in AWS which comes under the compute domain so click on ec2 and launch instance and select the Ubuntu server I'm gonna select the T 2 dot micro because it comes under the free tier eligibility and we need not configure anything here and simply click on review and launch it it will ask you for a key pair so we we are going to create a new key pair here so like let's keep it as demo aws okay and download the key pair so it will download it for you and launch the instance. So now it is initiating the instance so you can see it is on the pending state and even after that it is running so it will also do the statistic where it will be initializing it for you so let's see how fast here the compute engine is so this is how your Google dashboard looks like we'll go to the compute engine and click on VM instances there are already three running instances and will click on create instance and select the Ubuntu machine here ubuntu 8.04 and select and we need not configure anything here no keep nothing and simply create the instance let's wait for an instance to launch okay this is on the running state but still the status checks is initializing okay and you cannot connect to it currently so let's wait for our Google instance to launch. So guys now you can check that launching an instance here is quite easier as well as it is faster than AWS management console okay from this I can easily conclude that Google cloud platform is way faster than AWS when it comes to launching an instance or even deploying an operating system even in terms of VM size so guys now let's move it and check their pricing models in case of a double is a very basic instance which includes two virtual CPUs and Ageing your prom will cost you around 69 dollars perma and when compared to GCP with 25% cheaper rate it will cost you around fifty-two dollars per month also the largest instance offered by a double uses of 3.84 TB of ramp along with 128 virtual CPUs which will cost you around three point ninety seven dollars per hour and in case of Google this is where Google takes the lead with a whooping number of 160 virtual CPUs with a 3.75 TB of RAM which cost you around 5.30 $2 per hour which I believe is much cheaper in terms of virtual CPUs provisioning as compared to AWS and my new guys CCP has been catching up quickly as prior to March 2017 the largest VM on GCP only had 32 CPUs and prior to 2018 this is the growth rate that we discussed here now let's move ahead so what are the job trends in AWS and Google cloud so this is again a frequently asked question by most of the learners in the cloud domain if we discuss the job trends and both well check this graph here which shows that starts of the job posting in previous four years the green line is for the job trends in aid of your solutions architect and the orange line is for job trends and Google Cloud solutions architect you can easily absorb from this graph that there has been arised for the jobs in aid of this whereas in case of Google it is still rising since it's a new cloud provider in the industry as we discussed above Google may take some time to rise to that level since AWS already reading in the market shares with 40% of it that means there are greater number of jobs in case of AWS as compared to Google with 10% of the shares so it only concludes that there are a greater number of jobs in case of AWS but I would like to say this doesn't mean that Google cloud does not have that potential or capacity to reach to this level incoming future because the kind of services Google cloud is providing right now are doing quite well so as who do you think is the winner here AWS or Google cloud well most of you must have figured out from the above starts at how Google cloud is rising at an advanced rate and as always at the 3rd place after a double initial no doubt Google cloud may surpass AWS in a short someday which makes it very difficult to declare one of them as the winner as Google have many advantages over AWS like pricings and speed however AWS has been a consistent pioneer in the cloud services it's more mature infrastructure causing less downtime easier makes EWS a preferable choice for majority of the users so guys thank you so much for watching this session I would love to hear from you guys that which one of them is better according to you and why please reply to us in the comment section below see you again yeah
