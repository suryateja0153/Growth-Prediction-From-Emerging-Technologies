 [Music] welcome to segment 2.9 in the cisco CCT data center series in this video we're going to discuss the cisco nexus switch family in this video we are going to discuss the cisco nexus which family overview and then we're going to look at the three thousand seven thousand and nine thousand series nexus switches alright this is going to be the next so the nexus family overview the 1000 b which is a virtual switch and it's largely deprecated VMware actually removed all of the API support and now there is a nexus 9000 V but the 1000 V is deprecated a 2000 series that's the faxes we already discussed those and the 3000 series switches actually have a number of specialized series within them but they're most known for their ultra-low latency line that's used in high frequency trading networks all right so the 5,000 line which support a fiber channel Fibre Channel over Ethernet there they've been very popular used for a wide variety of things in the data center but just prior to recording this on May 5th 2020 a lot of the line within the 5000 series switches went end-of-life then the 7000 series they're the larger chassis and module based systems and then the Nexus 9 case are pretty much rent to replace everything I've heard people say that they're going to replace everything but that's not going to be the 2000 or the 3000 I don't think the faxes are going anywhere I don't think they're gonna come up with 9000 series switches to replace the faxes or you know rename faxes to be in the 9 KS and the the Nexus 3 KS have such specialized use cases I don't think they're gonna replace those either but I think it is pretty clear that the Nexus 9 KS are going to replace the 5000 series and the 7000 series so the Nexus 9 case have everything they have the chassis based systems there they're the ACI switches they have top-of-rack switches on to the Nexus 3000 series so the main concept of the Nexus 3000 series is that of the which is the application-specific integrated circuit so ASIC performance is integral to the performance of devices and as a result of that cisco has focused on building a lot of their own Asics however Cisco's Asics cost a lot more than third-party Asics and so for that reason for a number of the lines in the 3000 series they use merchants silicon which just means Asics made by other companies than Cisco aka Broadcom and then the 3000 switch family consists of the through the 3000 series the 3,100 3,200 3,400 3,500 and 3600 alright so I just wanted to note that the the naming convention is slightly different than for all these other data center products that second digit usually denotes the generation so if that second digit is higher then it's also a newer product that's not the case with the 3000 series each one of those series with the second digit means something specific alright so here is just a brief summary we are gonna in a little bit we're gonna go out to the website we're gonna look at the specific models but here's just a good summary of what's what so the 3,000 and 3100 series those are mostly top-of-rack switches the 3200 series focuses on high-density the entire goal of that series is to cram as many high-speed ports into as few of rack units as possible the 3400 series offers programmable Asics and telemetry the 3500 series is the ultra-low latency ones that are used for high frequency trading this is the only line of the three case that uses Cisco Asics all the other ones use merchants silicon to keep them cheaper the 3500 series switch is for customers that aren't really caring so much about cost and it's more like just give me the absolute lowest latency possible and then the 3600 line has really really deep buffers we're going to take a look at the numbers when we go to the to the Cisco documentation but the main use case that makes sense for the 3600 would be content delivery networks that you know our delivering a bunch of video alright so now we're out here on Cisco site now if Google search Cisco Nexus 3000 series and that brings us here so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go down and compare models alright so for the most part we can just ignore the Nexus 3000 since these are pretty dated now if you compare the difference which is here in the 3100 series the main thing that differentiates them is interface type you do have some interface speed differences as well moving on to the 3100 Zee now this is a 100 gig switch if you look down here the maximum of 100 gigabit ports so there's 32 ports that can all go 100 gig so I know we talked about breaking out ports before that's what this is about so you could take the 32 ports and use breakout cables that would allow you to break them out into you know a number of more connections at the lower speeds ok back to the the 3100 s here so the naming conventions that we talked about before all pretty much apply so you've got the second two digits are the number of downstream ports and then when there's there's two letters after it the first one's going to be at the type of downstream port and then the type of upstream port so P means sfp+ Q means Q SFP t means Ethernet all right on to the 3200 series so this is the one that really focused on having a high concentration of high-speed ports if you look at the ones with the C here C means a hundred gigs so this is 32 ports of a hundred gig and this is 64 100 gig ports so 64 100 gig ports in Toorak units is a lot of high-speed ports all right now moving on to the 3400 lines so this is the line that offers the programmable Asics and telemetry one thing I wanted to note about this line is I know that the 3200 line is supposed to be the the high density of super high-speed ports but if you look at this here these each also have 128 or you know capable of doing 120 100 Gig ports and can do 30 to 400 gig ports which is also a lot of high capacity in not a lot of our use especially this one right here so one are you of 30 to 400 gigs along with programmable a6 and telemetry capabilities I'm I'm guessing that it's not a cheap switch that kind of makes me want to put it in CCW and find out okay so then the 3500 series this these are the ones that are pretty much designed for the high frequency trading networks with the ultra-low latency alright so switch latency this is the key stat for for this line sub 250 nanoseconds I'm not sure how that compares to other switch lines but I know it's a very small fraction they might not even show it for the other switches oh there it is switch the latency okay so this is pretty low to 450 so you can see it's about half of that yeah so they probably only show it for the ones that that have low latency so I'm not sure how that compares to just like a you know your average nexus but I know that that is a very low number okay so the 3600 series here this is the one that has the massive buffer space alright so 16 gigs of buffer space across 36 ports that's crazy 8 gigabytes of buffer space now let's just compare that to the other lines buffer space are they gonna show the buffer space alright so shared buffer space 7 D Meg's 20 20 to 22 Meg 70 Meg's you compare that to 8 and 16 gigabytes I mean that's massive so yeah like I said the these are the switches that I would guess really specialized for you know content delivery networks for video video delivery all right now on to the nexus 7000 series so these are chassis based systems that are used as the core in data centers and overall Network cores there's two families within the Nexus 7 case there is card backward compatibility and that means that you can take the 7,000 cards and put them into the 77 hundreds but not vice versa obviously you can't take the newer cards and put them in an old hardware because it's not going to know what to do with it they are supervisor based systems so the supervisors are basically the brains of the operation there they perform all the routing operation redundant supervisors are pretty much always required in these just because they are 100% necessary for operation and then there's the concept of fabric modules I'm not sure if this is the exact right phrasing for it but it basically provides back-end networking for the chassis for the line cards that you put in there so we're gonna go see later and documentation for the 7 K series but in order to run certain line cards there is a requirement of how many fabric modules you have to have in the chassis in order to get it to work so it's very much a capacity concept if you wanted to really max out your chassis with line cards you're gonna need to have an adequate amount of fabric modules in there to accommodate them all right so I've googled Cisco Nexus thousand or Nexus 7000 series switches and here we are at the datasheet alright so I googled Cisco Nexus 7 K it takes us straight to here now if I could draw a line down the middle on the left you're gonna see these are the older models the Nexus 7 thousands and these are the 77 hundreds here now I don't know if you can see this notice that you can see the vents on the sides of the seven K's now remember these are older and these ones were designed for side-to-side airflow I don't know if this one is so much but you can also see that the 7700 s the newer ones are they don't have any things on the side that's because they're designed for front to back airflow and this one here is the 77 10 this are the the 70 10 this one's just a little bit different it has this this thing up here looks like a mini-fridge or something but it's what as far as cable management all right so now we're gonna go do a view models comparison and the first thing we're gonna look at is supervisors it kind of goes chronologically from right to left here so Nexus 7 K came out first and then it had a supervisor one then it came out with supervisor two which was then followed by supervisor tui and then you can see that the the 7,700 came out came out at about that time and started at supervisor tui and then there's the supervisor 3e that was derived from the 2e so it's just important to note that certain supervisors go into certain chassis alright so now we're going to look at the line cards so the main distinction that I want to make here is the difference between m-series and F series so like I said before the the Nexus 7 case can function as normal enterprise network core as well as data center core the m-series are going to perform more of the I guess we could look at it like the route switch or the enterprise networking core functions whereas the f-series the F stands for fabric and that's going to be more of your your data center functionality it's going to have more of the the data center features so depending on what you want to do in the chassis is going to dictate what line cards you get alright so now let's talk about the naming convention on these f-series modules n7k is going to be for the 7077 is going to be for the 7700 that part's pretty self-explanatory so the F is going to be because it's an f-series type then the next digit is gonna be the generation number then the next two digits after the generation is going to be the number of ports so you can see right there it's 48 and the next two letters after that is going to be port speed and type so here the X would be defining how fast it is and then the port type would be key which would be again P stands for SFP+ and then you've got this other number here right so let's just focus on this 123 what does that mean so what the 23 means is it's referencing the fabric modules I know told you before that in order to run certain line cards you need to have the fabric modules in the chassis in order to basically give it the the backend networking support so what this means the first digit here is the generation of fabric module that's required and the second number is how many it needs so this would need three second gen fabric modules this would need this line card here would need six of the third gen alright so now we're look at the chassis page here on the main difference here other than whether or not you're gonna go with the 7000 or 7700 it's gonna be the amount of space that you have for i/o module slots and the only thing that I really want to call out here is that this number here tells you how many slots you can have however the number of Supervisors takes a number out of there so basically the supervisors require a spot a slot and the only other thing to note is that the 7702 it would be one way to refer to that only has two slots but it only can have one supervisor which means that you could only put one module into it so before when I said that redundant supervise there's almost always required you're always required I guess I was incorrect because this one you can only put one of them in and then you have one spot for a module slide so the 7706 has four module slots because it's going to have two supervisors so supervisor redundancy you can see that everything has yes except for this one all right so now we're going to move on to the nexus 9 k series like I said before it's pretty much meant to take over the five K and the 7 K functionality and with that we're just going to move right into a model comparison on Cisco site all right so I have google-searched cisco nexus 9000 and takes me right here so you can see by the picture that they're gonna have stuff in all shapes and sizes so you've got like your 1 & 2 you units over here and then you've got the larger chassis based systems that are probably gonna or are going to replace the nexus 7 k ok so I've scrolled down a little bit here and I'm going to I'll click on compare all models okay so here we have the nexus 9500 chassis we can see it's a modular chassis again this is going to replace the seven case so here's the supervisors it's the same type of supervisor and module concept at the seven K's head I also know it's a lot of these can can be the 9,500 s can function as a CI spines okay but it's not all of them on most of these like when you go into the specifics it will say whether or not it can function in ACI mode let's see here alright so this is just going to be the supervisors so let's compare these these are the 100 gig modules can they function as a CI mode usually it tells you okay yeah so a lot of these 9,500 s can function as a CI spines so none of the 95 hundreds so it let me just back up real quick so in an ACI spine leaf architecture the spines I guess this is probably the wrong way to say it but it's more of an aggregation role and the Leafs are going to be more of the access role so the Leafs are definitely the access role and so you couldn't use a 9500 as a leaf so that's gonna be no on all of them and you can see a couple of them here can function as a CI spines these are gonna be the line cards that go into the 95 hundreds these are modules my 40 gig modules alright so you've got a difference in speed here and then you've got some of the 10 gigs that can also function as a CI spines actually it all says no that's interesting because if you look right here it says an X OS and a CI and then when you go into here it says yes to nx-os mode and then no to everything with regard to ACI so that's kind of weird but whatever some of the 9,500 s can function as a CI spines or you can now we're gonna go down and look at the 90 300s real quick so they're mostly organized here by speed but they are organized by a function a little bit yeah so it says usage do one's it looks like these ones are meant to be they can be both a CI spine and leaf so these ones are probably like one of the main use cases for them is for a CI and so a CI I know we haven't talked about that and we're not going to sets a massive configuration it's kind of an advanced configuration topic alright so all these ones can also function in a CI alright so these are one ten and twenty five these can also all be a CI and these as well so yeah so the 9300 switches really are are really made for ACI and then the 92 hundreds if you look at it so what's the difference between the the nexus 92 hundreds and the 90 300 what's the difference here well to me if you look in here it can do pretty much everything I mean it's got the higher speed models it's it can do pretty much everything that that the 93 hundreds can't accept the only operating system mode is nx-os which means that it can't do a CI so to me that's like if you if you wanted to data center switch that you knew was not going to be used for a CI you could go with a 90 200 so yeah so it would look like here we go so top of rack top of rack aggregation access access type of rack management switch okay so those are the other functions other than being an ace yet all right well that brings us to the end of the long exhausting topic of next two switches we went over the Nexus family overview and then we went through the 3000 the 7000 and the 9000 series lines I hope you enjoyed it if you did give a like and subscribe and I will see you in the next one [Music] [Music]
