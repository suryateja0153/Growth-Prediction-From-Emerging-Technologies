 I'm going to be demonstrating trying to use compositional techniques to build molecular designs that can be used for single molecule magnets so basically what I do is first I try to select organic molecules that I can use to form a compound with a metal so what I do first is to move into a 'SciFinder' on the internet and then just sketch whatever molecular I want to do so that I can see other variations of it that are either have been published or are just there but have not been published so with that I can then look at what property these ligands might possess by running series of calculations on them to look at their electronic structures and if these electronic structures are of interest then I can move to the lab give it to a synthetic chemist to synthesize this molecule and then use real-world machines to test those properties and see if what I bring out from my computation is actually something which words I have fabricated so right now I'm going to kind of move to the lab to demonstrate how one or two skills that I might need. So this is a typical organic ligand that we are going to be using today to form a complex that we can now test its property be its magnetic property or whatever it is so I've drawn this inner on ChemDraw and all I have to do is to see if there have been a report about this and I just go to search and try to search this on 'SciFinder' and then gives me different modification of that particular ligand. So today looking at this I can see the existence of some sort of a minus sign in there so that means that I could use this to react with a metal and they can exchange that sign so that's the reason I'll be using this particular one which is the saccharin to complex with copper to get a metal complex because of the copper in there I'm sure that we can look at the magnetic property. As a scientist you look at properties, you try to judge from the properties is there any other way I can apply this compound that I've made to solve whatever human problem. So this saccharine is usually used as a sweetener, it can be used on your toothpaste it can be used and so many other things that you want the taste of what you are trying to give out to your consumer to be very sweet and all that but because of the concern that it might have carcinogenic effects people I begin to drive away move away from this but that doesn't mean that the molecule is completely useless. So can transform this molecule by forming a complex with other metal and then trying other properties of the molecule like magnetic property, which is what I'm going to be doing today so I'm going to be reacting this compound with copper, a copper sulfate so I can form a complex that I can now move ahead, characterize and then look at what property it will have, basically electronic and magnetic property.
