 (upbeat electronic music) - We see LoRa as the DNA of the IoT. For our DNA, you have the D or the device, because LoRa connects a device to the cloud. - LoRa is a wireless technology that is made to equip unlimited number of device, to connect them to the internet. - From the small devices that surround us that don't have unlimited power, taking that data and transporting it to the cloud. That's been the missing piece. - All equipment in the city needs to be monitored in a wireless way, to be efficient, to be low-cost for people who run that. And that is done thanks to our technology. - It's long range, it's a long battery life, and it's low cost. - [Olivier] You can last ten, twenty years on battery without a problem. - [Patrick] Normally, in an urban environment, probably a mile to a mile and a half. In a rural environment, easily ten miles. - So few gateways will equip a city while it's used widely, millions of units per year in connecting devices, metering, for instance to the cloud or to applications. - For meter and space, a lot of the meter are buried in the wall or on the ground. So you need a very reliable connectivity solution. Instead of sending people up the floor to read the meter, the customer can just do a drive-by and read the meter from the first floor, even from the street. So it saves a lot of manpower and time. - We are driving a more integrated solutions for devices in terms of working with the sensor providers, MCU providers that continue to drive our road map to provide the best solution and lower-cost solutions every year - LoRa was made for IoT, addressing multiple-use case so we have a lot of innovation to be able to equip a lot of objects that have value that people can monitor remotely and you can recover valuable assets. It's really at the DNA of the IoT (driving electronic music)
