 At Hewlett Packard Enterprise, we deliver high-performance computing solutions designed to meet the demands of today's most complex data-intensive workloads. Take our HPE Superdome Flex family. These systems can accelerate production and discovery time by managing data-intensive jobs in one single shared memory node, also known as FAT node, rather than breaking jobs into smaller pieces so they can be distributed across multiple small nodes. Featuring a unique modular architecture, HPE Superdome Flex and HPE Superdome Flex 280 have the unparalleled capability to scale up compute performance and shared memory, while offering single system simplicity. These systems are helping universities, research institutions and manufacturers tackle the most demanding jobs. Here are a few examples. In Big Data analytics, the single system compute power and shared memory of the platform, along with the system's capacity to accelerate data ingest, enable customers to unlock deeper insights faster. In computer-aided engineering, through the use of advanced simulation technology, HPE Superdome Flex has been instrumental in improving the design of wind turbines, aircraft and race cars. And in genomics, this powerful platform has played a key role in DNA research. They will predict, diagnose and treat disease. In these and other areas, the exceptional performance and single system simplicity of HPE Superdome Flex helps you solve complex data-intensive problems at scale, complete more jobs in less time, gain insights faster and reduce the risk of jobs failing due to memory exhaustion.
