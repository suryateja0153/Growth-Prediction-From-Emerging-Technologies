 hello and thank you to everyone who is tuning in today during this very challenging time my name is Mike Dallas from the chrome enterprise customer team and I want to welcome you all to this session as we are all aware with the spread of koba 19 the new normal now requires most employees to work remotely and we want to do our part to help you all stay connected productive and secure in this session I'm going to share with you a set of chrome Enterprise Solutions along with some examples of how customers are leveraging these solutions to keep their businesses up and running securely even while working from home as part of the session we'll cover three main components first recapping today's challenges then it will cover where Chrome enterprise can help along with some customer examples and finally how you can get started the recent Cova 19 pandemic has mandated that organizations take unprecedented efforts to enable their employees to work remotely this recent Gartner survey indicated that 88% of organizations have encouraged or required employees to work from home regardless of whether or not they have shown Cova 19 related symptoms even before this year's events remote working has been a growing consideration for employees and employers alike in fact since 2005 working from home has grown by a hundred and seventy three percent amongst non self-employed population in the desire to work remotely continues to increase a report by zapier found at ninety five percent of US knowledge workers actually want to work remotely and seventy percent of them would be willing to quit a job to do so as a result IT teams are facing a range of technology access and security issues as they grapple with enabling their remote workforces these include things such as getting devices properly set up configured and in the hands of their employees that need them the risk of an increased attack surface as a result of employees using their own devices and home Wi-Fi networks increase of cybersecurity and phishing attacks posing as pandemic information links that ain't a plant malware on devices and finally end users struggling to get access to the information data and systems they need to be productive for organizations to be successful in this remote worker model they need solutions to focus on these three core areas first delivering a secure and user experience that enables the same productivity as before second providing access to tools to provide not just connection but collaboration and finally allowing IT to remotely manage these endpoints and the end-user experiences when enterprises build an environment that facilitates these three core areas any type of worker can be effective in a productive mobile worker as this picture depicts this range of workers can be info workers such as those in sales marketing finance and even developers all the way over to frontline workers where we have seen a dramatic growth over the past three months for example with health care clinicians and remote contact center agents for many years we have embraced the enablement of remote workers here at Google on the back of our cloud-based solutions across our hundred thousand-plus global employees we will walk you through some of these solutions in a bit but as you can see here we are used to working remotely with 30% of our meetings involving two plus time zones in two fifths of those attendees joining from different locations so now let's dive into where Google and our chrome solutions can help enable this remote worker world we now live in along with some customer examples to bring it to life Chrome Enterprise provides you with a complete cloud-based platform to enable mobile and remote working it does this by providing five unique pillars that have always been core tenants of the platform but now more than ever have become paramount to operate today's environment in the foreseeable future we will walk you through each of these but in summary it starts with being able to deploy quickly and manage remotely from a cloud-based management console to delivery apps end-users need in the most secure way possible and as we enter troubling times economically capital expenditure and ongoing operating costs have become core requirements for customer evaluations getting endpoints to your remote users so they can be productive has never been more critical in any and all organizations we're working with today with Chromebooks gone are the days of imaging a device businesses can deploy Chromebooks quickly with cloud-based profiles that download user policies apps settings in bookmarks within just minutes couple this with one of our premier resellers Xero touch deployment services your devices can arrive already enrolled set up an employee can sign in without any IT configuration with most IT workers also being remote these days managing endpoints and end-users is essential to keeping your workforce productive with Chrome's cloud-based management console IT admins are able to manage the organization's browser and device fleet remotely with over 300 plus policies these policies include a broad range of capabilities from being able to set network settings push Wi-Fi settings and certificates that enable users to access the corporate data they need to be productive in addition admins can also set up whitelist of applications browser extensions or bookmarks that will likely be needed by these workers now the breath in the Chrome enterprise approach to security is impossible to cover in one slide but I'm gonna give it a try here each device that is deployed provides IT with remote management and control that ensures applications are trusted and harmful apps stay out of the hands of your end-users in addition the platform comes with many deep security capabilities to provide your workers including things like regular security updates that download in the background over any Wi-Fi or LTE connection the ability to remotely disable devices in case they are lost or so on built-in antivirus protection to protect against any phishing or malware attacks encrypted on device storage as well as verified boo and of course Google Safe Browsing that automatically alerts users of malicious websites she also mentioned that if you ever want to dig more into our security capabilities we are always happy to set up a security briefing with you and your team now for remote working to be successful employees need secure access to the apps and data they rely on on a day to day basis with chrome enterprise employees can easily access and use any cloud-based service or app through there fast and familiar Chrome browser windows applications through a virtualized desktop or virtualized app in a browser using any of our key partner solutions such as citric - VMware Cameo now remote meetings and communications is essential right now and Chromebooks allow end users to seamlessly access G suite office 365 Microsoft teams zoom and hangouts me and lastly users have access to a complete ecosystem of apps from the Google Play Store including remote collaboration apps like Cisco jabber WebEx and bondage TCO is always a consideration for any solution but today we're finding that more than ever upfront and ongoing costs are at the top of the list of any and all organizations we speak with over the years we work with many customers as well as ES G's economic validation process to complete a proven TCO model that you can fully customize to your organization situation as you can see here in the diagram this model has shown that save upwards of 482 u.s. dollars per endpoint per year these cost savings come from not just the reduced acquisition costs and hardware and software but also decreased operational costs like deployment and ongoing support maintenance as well as improved uptime and less data risk due to our every six week Chrome regular update process now to bring these set of capabilities to life we now want to share a few customer stories that have taken place over the last few months where chrome devices have been able to meet the urgent needs of both IT leadership in their mobile workers our first example is a city that was one of the early hotspots of Cova 19 and that an urgent need to support the working remote requirements that were imposed just a couple of months ago they selected Enterprise Chromebooks because of the ability to deploy quickly and allow business continuity for their 2000 city employees within just 48 hours as a result their city workers were able to access the applications they need like Microsoft Office 365 to stay productive and help serve their constituents our second story is a very common use case for Chromebooks even pre koba 19 but now more than ever and that is the rapid deployment of Chromebooks as mobile fin clients in this case we had a financial services company that needed a quick and secure access for their office workers as they were moving to work from home model along with speed and access security was a key driver given their heavy regulatory environment and requirement set in this case the team implemented our manage guest mode capability to optimize the user experience on Lenovo Chromebooks in concert with Citrix across over 11,000 endpoints now as you can imagine there's been a dramatic increase in organizations moving their on-site concepts and our operations to home based models here's an example of a large auto sales organization they needed to quickly pivot their entire contact center literally over a weekend solution included the ordering and white gloving of 2600 HP Chromebooks along with implementing G suite and a couple of our premier partners in ringcentral and Citrix workspace to complete this end-to-end remote contact center solution as well we continue to see this need for remote call centers in each day and are glad we can help here as we all know healthcare organizations across the globe are under extreme pressure including this example of Australia's largest medical insurer with 4 million plus members due to unprecedented call volume this organisations primary requirement was to scale up a work from home contact center in a matter of days for their nursing staff to virtually assist their patients they turn to Chrome OS as their platform a choice and we're able to deliver 1,000 plus HP Chromebooks ready to go out of the box for these remote nurses so they could access the applications they needed such as over 365 as well as Citrix for accessing any in all legacy applications IT not only found the deployment quick and easy but also commented that being able to deploy these devices such that no data is stored on them was critical to comply with their security standards as a result which is often the case with our customers they are now looking at three other use cases to expand their chrome footprint within the hospital network in order to deliver customer experiences like the four we just ran through there are two key areas that complete the Chromebook solution set first of which is the hardware options that you can choose from as you can see here the Chrome device portfolio has a variety of form factors to choose from with all the leading OEMs represented including Samsung Lenovo a Sura seuss HP and Dell in terms of form factors we have every option to match your use case from premium and lower end clamshells to two and one devices with stylus options all the way to ruggedized Chromebooks or tablets along with our desktop options that are delivered through our chrome box form factor and finally comes to set up and delivery chrome services partner ecosystem is here to help first we have global coverage that can help ensure delivery to any location including your workers homes second these partners can do everything from basic pre-employment to white glove setup of pre-configured networks applications and bundling any required peripherals now we realize some customers may not have the option or the budget to purchase Hardware right away but still want to enable many of these core tenants of the Chrome enterprise platform and for those customers we have Klat ready from one of our premier technology partners Neverwhere based on Google's open source chromium OS never wear cloud rarity transforms any hardware you already own and delivers both the chrome base end-user experience as well as native integration to the Chrome Enterprise Management Services in other words you can take your existing fleet of devices convert them to never wear cloud ready and manage the devices through the same chrome management console we discussed earlier in addition to policy control cloud ready like all of our Chrome based solutions comes with regular updates that are deployed automatically via the cloud without any disruption to your end-users here we have an example of a Health Network that unfortunately is also located in one of the COBIT hotspots that has leverage both cloud ready as well as Chromebooks they initially came to us with a need to deploy clinical workstations and most recently has fallen up with the need to enable remote workers over the recent months these six thousand clinical workstations are a great example of the rapid deployment of cloud ready on their current Hardware assets with future plans to integrate with citrix improve ADA and epic in addition with the recent pandemic they are now implementing a seuss Chromebooks with Citrix as home devices for their non-essential employees both of these solutions together give an IT the ability to support their workers with a low TCO whether they're at the hospital or at home without sacrificing their security protocols or productivity with many people at home Chrome browser has become everyone's desktop a choice with this in mind the final solution we want to share is Chrome browser cloud management or CD cm C BCM is a free set of capabilities that is enabled within the same management console for Chrome OS and all of your google cloud services the beauty of c.b.c animus that allows IT to centrally manage all Chrome browser endpoint policies across any and all operating systems you may use today the set of controls and reporting capabilities can help you ensure a consistent user experience across all your remote workers trusted access to data apps and cloud services even if they are off the network as well as providing insights into device information in Chrome extensions that your workers are using even while they were remotely here we have an example of C BCM having a dramatic impact on global coffee franchise that was challenged with securely managing their thousands of browser users across Chrome OS Mac and Windows instead of trying to do this across a variety of IT tools and reports that often resulted in inconsistent experience for their users as well as being time consuming and cost intensive for IT they chose to implement and standardize on CD CM this has allowed them to centralize their processes ensure a consistent and safe experience for their global user base and lastly provides significant ongoing cost savings to the organization now we've covered a lot of capabilities of the chrome enterprise platform and how they've helped organizations during this hectic time before we close out the session we just 101 brew and summarize the three main solution areas we discussed first of these and arguably the most effective end-to-end solution being Chromebook Enterprise which is our managed Chromebook offering that combines the best of hardware and software it can be applied to any type of remote user from an information worker accessing cloud or virtualized apps all the way to a remote contact center rep or even a health care clinician is the cloud-ready solution from Neverwhere which allows you to leverage your current hardware assets and effectively convert them into chrome devices this is a great option for those organizations that are budget constrained but still want to implement most of the core tenets of chrome enterprise lastly but certainly not least given its so foundational to the platform is Chrome browser cloud management which enables you to manage your endpoints and end-user policies no matter what OS you may be running this includes managing and reporting on your Chrome extensions as we close out this session we wanted to make sure you know how to get started and get form in more information about the chrome enterprise platform in the solutions that we think can help you first you can start a free trial of Chrome Enterprise if you already have Chromebooks this allows you to access the Google management console and enroll up to 10 devices configure the settings and apply policies to users in those devices second we've compiled a list of resources in a remote work toolkit these resources have how-to guides and videos that can help you quickly deploy Chromebooks to your remote workforce lastly you can contact our sales team to get more information or get connected with one of our premier resellers to purchase devices and the rest of the components of the platform and lastly on behalf of the chrome Enterprise team here at Google we wish you all safety and good health over the coming months and beyond and thank you again for joining us today
