 But in 2018 actually it was very encouraging, where we saw a lot of clients starting to do real pilots. They picked use cases, in some instances, multiple use cases within the same organization, and right now we are seeing a lot of these organizations moving into production because of the successes they’ve seen. They’ve understood the power of the technology, the implications and impact, and they’re now moving those pilots into production itself. It’s been a good, fast progression I’d say, but we still see clients somewhere between pilot and production. We are actually seeing clients targeting two or three core areas, for them to do experiments in pilots. First, improving business processes, in some cases like I mentioned, multiple business processes by multiple lines of businesses at the same time. But a lot of these business processes, the end outcome is about improving customer experience. So it could be a business process in the call center, or it could be about improving products itself. Providing additional services latched on to existing products. Everything is focused on improving customer experience as an outcome. The second type of pilots, or category of pilots we are seeing is directly impacting customer interfaces, so you can improve customer experience. A lot of this is work in the areas of sales and marketing for instance. And the third category we are seeing especially in a lot of the regulated industries is focus on risk and regulation, reducing fraud for instance. Because indirectly it does help in improving customer experience.
