 [Music] how will we hold artificial intelligence accountable for the mistakes that they make the mistakes can come from two different sources one can actually just be coding errors made by the people who are creating the system the other of course are deliberate decisions made by the people who are building the systems in either case as he systems come to inform and advise more and more of our lives their propensity to make errors will only go up self-driving cars would be the obvious example but the number of places that machine pal ability can cause enormous damage just boggles the mind of course human fallibility can also cause the same amount of damage if not more and we managed to make progress in advanced civilization even with high lethality people therefore presumably we will work it out with artificial intelligence as well if you're interested in artificial intelligence visit Kagome comm or check out my new book the fourth age smart robots conscious computers in the future of humanity
