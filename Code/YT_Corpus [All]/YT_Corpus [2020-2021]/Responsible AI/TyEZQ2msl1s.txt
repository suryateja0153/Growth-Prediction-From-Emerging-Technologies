 so the name of our panel is cross collaboration on AI in Europe but of course the underlining theme is when Europe compete so I'd like to start this session by asking a question of the audience Kai-Fu Lee who was the former head of Google China wrote a book called AI superpowers and in that book he said the AI race is between the US and China and Europe will not even have a seat at the table how many people in the audience believe that's true raise your hand okay okay so today during our panel we are gonna talk about why your belief in Europe is justified so without further ado I'd like to eat ask each of our panelists to talk about what they personally are doing in their day job to help further collaboration on AI in Europe and then we're gonna get into a discussion about the challenges the opportunities oh you're up might differentiate itself so let me go down the line let's start with you Andreas okay yeah so Andreas as a managing director of a large innovation center and entrepreneurship Center in Germany and I was ahead of apply which is a national initiative in Germany to accelerate the adoption of AI and in that obviously there are quite a few multinational companies and so in the one hand we have these companies to get started on the very practical questions on AI and in Germany but also then connect them across Europe so what we did was to form a European initiative on AI with now 11 institutions in seven countries to really work collaboratively on AI and like with very very practical things I connect our startup ecosystem in these countries or simply to help each other if someone develops something one country to help it like push your push it on to the other countries in Europe this is like in addition to what governments are doing this is just like complementary yes it's it's a it's a nonprofit organization it's in addition to like the the governmental approach is very much based on on impact on output and on this like more innovative approaches from the startup ecosystem Evelina let's now turn to what you see your role Europes making it mark in here yeah thanks I think my mic is working right yeah so I work at Peltarion which is a Swedish AI company focusing on deep learning I would describe us as a hybrid between a start-up and scaleup so our two founders have actually been building AI business solutions for about 15 years but in 2016 and thanks to the AI spring we've been growing from 2 people to 80 people and we're we have built platform which makes it easier for companies to get started using AI in their businesses without having AI experts or its own infrastructure so so my role at etherion is leading the the legal department and I'm also involved in the AI ethics issues that we're looking to both internally and externally and as part of the collaboration we have been looking into how we in the Nordics can collaborate with each other not only companies but also with governments politicians and academia well that's a great such way Rannia who is the co-director of the office of artificial intelligence yeah yeah what's what that office does so yeah so I am the director for enterprise and technology at the Department for business and about two years ago the UK started on a journey on putting the UK at the forefront of AI and data big ambition and we decided to develop what we call the office for artificial intelligence which I am the director for and what it does is tries to bring together all the initiatives all the work our plan our strategy for AI in in the UK so it has a domestic and international role it has spending powers it has the ability to design the future of where the UK government is going in AI ambition as I said has been quite large and we focus in three key areas for the first year the office has been a year old and the areas we focused on initially has been skills very strong emphasis on building the skills of the UK population especially high level scale speech these masters etc the second area of focus for us has been data how do we share data and we'll return back to that with some innovative models and the third area for us has been leadership what do we put in place to ensure that across the whole of the UK the different organizations jointly lead and leverage best experience so like Sweden we announced a I console which will be chaired by Tabitha Goldstaub anybody knows Tabitha yeah and it will be a partnership between academia government and the private sector to get us to the next stage where we go next and I'll say a little bit more about all of that when we progress okay thanks so much so that's that's a great situation Petri because educating the population ai is also something very dear to your heart so please tell us about what you've been doing in Finland okay so I am Petri Myllymaki my background job is a professor at the University of Helsinki are working in AI and machine learning more recently we established a Finnish Center for AI which is kind of a part of the national area strategy and the idea was to have a competence cluster bringing together the best expertise in AI in the country not only universities and research institutes but also companies cities other public organizations and so forth and we are supposed to our mission is to produce impact in not only in science that's kind of easy for me as a professor but impact in education not only university education but educating the whole population and then economic and societal impact in general so this is the mission it sounds a little bit like what Oh AI is doing what we are kind of we were founded by two universities and the research center of national research center of Finland well so it's a little bit different and you're now challenging other countries in the Nordics and you are hoping this whole movement beyond Europe right yeah so the kunafa in in education we one of the instruments is is an massive open online course called elements of AI and we started with a mission to educate 1% of the finnish population we started last year reached the goal very early and now we are up to 175,000 people enrolled we are approaching 2% of the finnish population and and we challenged just recently sweden yes who was Minister promised that Sweden will beat Finland in this friendly game and and now the even bigger challenge is to educate 1% of the world's population in this is very kind of elementary basic skills of AI we also call it like AI little literacy for all for all yeah thank you very much so so quantum black as you said is an advanced analytics firm that helps companies across sectors improve their performance through using advanced analytics we are founded in London 10 years ago but are now 400 people across the world but a bulk of our work is still in Europe and we also do quite a lot of research into AI in the UK AI in Europe and one of the big blockers we see going back to your question about the US and China is that we although we're creating quite a lot of Technology in Europe we're not adopting it diffusing it into the business community as fast as we could be and so that's where we see ourselves helping and playing is across Europe helping businesses understand how they can adopt diffuse and use this technology to scale it in a way that can really help us drive our European economy so that's let's get now into the heart of the matter like what are the challenges that we have to overcome so we we have to get businesses on board we have to get governments on board and we have to educate the population so what much of each of you see as the biggest challenges and what would you recommend in terms of solving them I think like what I see often is that there is a misunderstanding of what it means for a company to really adopt AI I had a discussion with one of their CIOs of a car manufacturer in Germany and he said that like AI for him is the biggest transformation challenge the company has ever faced and and this is a part that it's not just adoption of a technology it's cultural change its organizational change programs it's a new ecosystem of partners to work with so it's a really like transformative approach from companies and people don't understand that and what we try to do is to like help each other to talk to each other to define best practices because all the companies have the same challenges and if we actually work together then we are faster I mean like if you compare us to China to the US and they spend much more money on on AI and so what we can do is to like spend the money more efficiently and that means to just to really collaborate and to learn from each other and that's what we're trying to do and that's what I actually see as the main challenge in Europe yeah I totally agree with you I think what we see those big investments by China and the US and we see that they implement the technology faster than ever before but in the Europe I feel that we are pretty much at a standstill and as you say we invest a lot of money but it's not super clear how that money is used wisely and and also I think that it's important that US and China see AI as a growth engine but here we tend to okay so US and China is seeing a is a growth engine but here here we tend to focus more on the technical and ethical issues and I think for Europe to harness AI it will require a change of long-standing practice assumptions I mean we as people when we encounter new technology our natural tendency is to set up an innovation lab a future that which looks into new technology for a couple of years and that's a great way to so I think what we should do is test it small-scale evaluate where it matters each part of the organization I'm fine I think my mic is working and so I think I completely agree with all of this and I will add two more areas that I think are really important the first for us is understanding public understanding of what AI is I don't know how many of you have heard or have seen magazines describing AI and the first thing you see in the front cover is Robocop and you know as much as we liked it and enjoyed it back then that's not what AI is so educating the public sometimes educating our own policymakers educating ourselves was put some very strong foundation so really like what Finland and of course we're watching the ice hockey game between Finland and Sweden and we have similar plans the second thing for us which is very related is talent and so it's a huge competition for talent across the world so how we are able to not only attract talent share create partnerships where people can actually build new research new capability whether it is at a deeper research level or at company level will be is quite significant and it is a big challenge when you consider how many opportunities exist because AI spreads like fire whereas Allen doesn't really do that it has it takes a long time to create that capability and I mentioned partnerships because for me partnerships is really really important we have a lot of institutions in the UK from which we gather the best in order to be able to deliver and I like to call it as we are swimming you know we have a lot of different bits and pieces of the AI console we have the UK resets an innovation organization which is hugely funded for us to do fundamental research we have the office for AI the Center for data ethics and innovation and all of that is like it's it's swarming is literally gathering together and bringing the best so how we do at a large scale globally I think will be quite important how we build that partnership to be able to solve problems together and deliver yeah I'd like to bring up one additional dimension which is like AI is of course it's a technology and it's already here but it's not ready actually the the current AI techniques are pretty old I did my master's thesis on neuron networks in the 80s so and they haven't developed I mean the basic principles are still the same and the success is mostly based on we have mostly based on other issues like increased amounts of data and computing power but that me I would say that we haven't seen anything yet so people are working fiercely to develop new types of AR technology so the big boom is is still to come so how to create impact based on this kind of new type of technologies I think the traditional pipeline doesn't work where the researchers in their ivory tower they publish first papers and then maybe somebody reads them and maybe applies them in some domain and then there's some business innovation or some service innovation and then finally at some point there's a kind of implementation this is too slow and if this doesn't work so what we try to account accomplishing the Finnish Centre for AI is to bring all the players together from day one so immediately when there's a kind of a need for kind of new technology that kind of is not even published yet it can start propagating through this kind of or not not the pipeline but more like a spiral I feel I'm what a fantastic point I feel like I've maybe sat at the rind of the line but the one thing that I would kind of endorse and add is that the opportunity kind of both from an economic and from a societal point of view in Europe and indeed the UK is massive so by about 2030 we could boost our economies by 20% through the proper adoption and diffusion of AI but I think the important thing is we see it as a growth challenge at the moment I think a lot of companies here as a point solution for cutting cutting costs or making themselves more efficient but actually the real kind of benefit is through innovation and reimagining business models using new technologies or indeed ones that already exist and so I think there's that challenge that we have to give to ourselves as nations is how do you become innovative with this not just more efficient so you've all brought up great points I have a lot of lot of questions so one of them is how do we make sure that Europe it's great that we have all these different country initiatives and it's important that you're pulling resources together nationally but how do we decide how do we decide as your the European Union like where to put our resources and our focus what are your appiah Europe's they are strengths and how do we how do we focus the research and the efforts in a way that will make commercial sense because European research programs kind of have bad rappers being unwieldly taking years and not really leading anywhere so how do we change that dynamic decide okay you know Europe has strengths in how this data so let's let's be number one in AI for help who's going to decide that and then how do we harness all these different national efforts and pull them together so so that we we have a global solution I think actually that that is the key question if you compare ourselves to to China for example or to the u.s. there are like large institutions which are like pushing specific topics they said on the other hand you of the large organizations if we look at Europe we have a like a history of and the question is how do we get the strength out of this diversity of the like the variety of when use and and also that is potentially doing couple of things at the same time in different places because we are not as coordinated as for example the Chinese wantonness in this regard so for me the question is yes on the one hand we need to find a way of how to like steer and produce visions for us as Europe as a whole which on the one hand is the European Commission is pushing forward to like high level expert group and the paper on trust of the eye and on the other hand we need to simply accept that we have different national initiatives that we have even like in Germany every state has its own state initiative there are large universities have them again their own activities so we have these very large single players in Europe and the only thing we can do is actually try to connect them and to believe the systems are allowed and I think that's the approachable for yeah and I don't agree and I think we need to convince the government's and about the value and a growth that we could achieve if we work together so if we have those regional or national initiatives we should collaborate and I also think it's important to see Europe as an ecosystem of policymakers academia startups investors and see that every party has its role and that's important oh sorry I don't need this so we I think there are a couple of things here the first one is that we have very strong values so both in terms of how we use our data how we collect the data how we grow our data so I think that's something we shouldn't forget and I think we have a very strong ambition and quite a long track record of adopting technologies in Europe which our thing is is quite important and we do a significant amount of course here in the UK another third thing I would say is that we have institutions that actually produce some amazing research our universities our universities our centers for excellence our deep research in the UK we have 8 of the top universities in the world so we do have strengths in terms of our people who have strengths in terms of our values and the data that we collect I don't think we should forget that is not so often highlights it is that the scientific I mean a applications in the world if you count the number of so the expertise is here the base is solid then regarding the data we own it I mean like citizens own their own private data or comms they can decide what to do with but then like public data maybe medical data is governed by public organizations and then the business data is owned by European businesses and now the big decision to make is whether we give this data away or do we keep it to ourselves and we have the technology to refine the data ourselves so now it's time to make the big decisions that kind of they they decide who will win the arms race and I mean as anyone in the wackiness space at the moment knows I think the trust agenda is huge and still yet pretty poorly defined and I think Europe has a huge opportunity to really shape what it means to be responsible and trusted when it comes to AI it's it's difficult it's hard to do in the abstract it's hard to legislate for because the space is so fast-moving but I think this is an area where we really have an opportunity to work together and actually stand out separately from either the US or China maybe to add one I think the last time I was in Brussels to meet like a commission of the European Commission I think what he said is really important he said there are we have one challenge and in Europe we have countries that are small and we have countries that are small and don't know that they are small and the last ones are the the main challenges for us in Europe and I think what AI is now really pushing and we had this discussion about Kyuubi is that we now think of a China about us and we need to think as Europe because every country it's too small to compete against China or the US and it needs to be a European approach and I think that's very important so I'd love to get into that discussion now as because I think a lot of people would agree that we need a third way we need an alternative to the US Internet giant's who have kind of proven that they do not respect data privacy and have no government oversight and the Chinese who are using AI to control the population so there is this opportunity in Europe where we tend to be more human centric to develop not just legislation like GDP are but also the actual technology to encapsulate European values and protect the common values you know the European share like democracy and data privacy and human rights and that if somehow you know people feel like well there's European technology inside that their rights are protected and I think that could be you know hugely powerful as a brand if if we and and also maybe inspire our young people to stay here and not go to work for the Americans or the Chinese so maybe we can expand a little bit on you know what what would need to be done to actually make that a reality yeah I'd like to start with the point about attracting and retaining competence within Europe because we know that the new workforce Millennials are Purpose Driven and we can't compete with salaries outside of what we see in Sweden which is we have companies that have strong values of working towards solving real world problems and I don't think that I qualify us in the know but purpose-driven as well and that was my number one reason for joining interion so I think in order to attract and maintain competence we need an environment which allows a company's tech companies to grow and to actually make the employees part of solving real problems regarding the fragmentation I think this is one of the main challenges it's challenging to try to produce europe-wide solutions that everybody would adapt that ideally we would do that but we could start by maybe nationally doing individual solutions like human centric AI in Finland and in Sweden and so kind of an example that you can build for example but the public services based on AI this way and then just everybody adopts the same model it's much faster and kind of then we can decide in in a way we decide that let's not give the data away we can each country keep it within Europe okay okay and so I think there is another dimension to it which is the goals that we set which is very similar to the Millennial issue so we can think a lot about the data about the talent but if we're purposeful Purpose Driven and we ought to focus on some of the big things one of the things we've done in the UK's to start thinking about global challenges and issues that affect quite a lot of people how we solve those global challenges has no borders in many ways so for us over the last couple of years what we identified as big moonshots or big objectives to solve are things like mobility aging population AI of course and and data and clean growth so focusing on the end goal of achieving all of those things which are not unique to us are not unique to Europe and are not unique I think to any country create this kind of purpose focus that we can target our attention on we're solving and then how we choose to solve them I mean I can just talk from quantum blacks perspective we are building both our tools and our protocols now so they build in fairness you know they make sure that they eradicate bias we make sure that what we do is transparent and I think the key is not to have those things as an afterthought but build them into the ways that you are working and we've just actually kind of launched one of our first open-source tools a data pipelining tools to share that back with the community because I think it is hard at a governmental regulatory level to get a above under kind of ahead of all of this so I kind of feel as practitioners it's our job to be able to create the case law if you like and then share it back with the community that we're in so that's how we kind of trying to try to tackle the question of how is there a third way in terms of AI if I may say I like this discussion a lot and maybe if you want to keep the best talents in Europe we need strong hubs that kind of attract them and what are these strong hubs they have to be some kind of appealing to these best talents there has to be a lot of other talented people a lot of resources made computing power interesting problems and also partners maybe if you just want to do good science you we have a lot of scientists here maybe you want to have a start up we have a process for that maybe you want to cure the cancer with the medical doctors okay go for it and I'm not a marketing person so this is not the way to market buttons like we could have a slogan like these hubs could say that if you just want to make money go to America but if you want to save the human coin I think you really I know so actually that's specifically what I also like about um the the approaches in the Scandinavian countries also if you look at Norway like as in Finland as in Sweden they they really connect the AI purpose-driven to the sustainable development goals and so in in Norway they have the the SDGs and they actually know that what they're doing they always connect to at least one of those and I think that's a very strong storyline which really fits to what you're saying to to other Erica remarks on on ethics and AI so one is like we in Germany we combined like almost all the large companies as well as couple of tech partners and universities and now if you start a conversation with them on ethics in AI the ones who really deal with it at the moment are large American tech companies so so yeah that's Priya run actually and and and that's I think that the problem if we really want to like take and and keep AI attics in Europe we should start get going on that because I thought what's happening is that other companies other nations are actually feeling also these topics with some content of what they develop and what they think it's right and and we need to start going and not just discuss on that but really put this into practice as well and then comes to my third point like if we talk about this and if we like start regulation on these topics we really need to see that this regulation is also thought through and and then potentially and forced so if you talk about GDP and and we talked about privacy as one of the key values in Europe then we shouldn't stop about just thinking on the application of AI if a neural network is trained in China and then used in Europe with GDP our compliance that's a competitive advantage for the Chinese companies because they don't care about the training of the models in China and if we like apply this regulation in Europe on training and on inference and in like you know the global globalised world they actually just have this as a regulation for the application in Europe and we don't care about the training in China that's a problem and like competitive disadvantage for us in Europe as well so we need to think about the whole system and not just what's happening in Europe that's an excellent point I just I wanted to point out a couple of things one is weirdly in Brussels when the high-level committee on AI is to having these discussions right now we've invited American tech companies in to be part of the conversation and basically kind of instill their influence on our legislation we wonder whether that's a good idea that's one to I going back to what what Petri had said I did want to point out like we have huge amounts of talent in AI in Europe and and if you look at Silicon Valley I mean the heads of AI at Facebook and many of the other companies are European and so then the challenge is you know how do we keep the talent here and maybe it's what you said like you know you want to work for you might make a better salary in the US but if you want to work for humankind if you want to help preserve the way of life in Europe then then come here to work on AI but I think we still have to look at how do we ensure not only that we keep the talent here but that when you start building world's beating companies like deep mind how do we make sure that they're not sold off to the Americans with Chinese before they become you know as big as the Giants in those countries yeah and just want to answer a couple of things and then connect to it and Ray said the first one is how do we keep people here and I I don't know how many of you were this morning at an excellent breakfast session but I thought I was quite touched and I thought it was quite amazing because he focused on diversity and women in AI so if we want to keep people here and if we want to ensure that people see a different kind of offer than we need to offer a diverse offer we need to be pioneers in ensuring not only women but the greater what the data have have a user how we use the data how developed the algorithm so we do all of these things we set an example and we are leading the way the second thing which I thought it was also amazing I don't know how many of you again I'm plagiarizing with pride and went to steward Russell's lecture this morning and steer was talking about ethics and what really was amazing was that he kind of punched and finished his session by saying we have to stop having codec sessions that have ethics here and they have you know European whatever AI and ethics are one thing and when we should talk about AI we should talk about just AI and assume we will be ethical and as Sherman will be have the rules and all the things we need to do so I think it's quite important we can change the Nardo can change the way we talk about this and we have the power to do it sorry can I just add about such boring panel about the scaling of issue which is apparent in Europe so I have been wondering I'm not an expert in this but like it's the only solution to kind of to create a unicorn scale of company since then the option seems to be that it's either American or Chinese company that is an european company but shouldn't there be a different model to collaborate and maybe european companies without becoming this monolithic alphabet style of companies maybe they could form ecosystems and they would have their own data and some karva have kind of a share their AI and their data this is challenging but I think like if we can build this type of models that would be also a core of European way to go so being the head of one of the large European innovation centers and entrepreneurship centers a couple of words - to that so in in Germany this is a recognized problem that the the companies once they get large they got sold to Chinese companies at the moment that's really a challenge also US companies and there is actually no large investment coming from from German companies but also not from from European companies so there are quite a lot of activities around that topic also on a European level there are now some efforts to build very large venture capital funds like a couple of billion euros to invest in tech companies across Europe so this is a topic which has at least some parts being been recognized as a problem and there are now the first step to try to solve that I still believe we will have some challenges in that because most of the money is in in the US and is in in China and then we also need from a political perspective we need the will to create these companies within Europe and to keep them within Europe and make them large here so we need this verb which is still not there yet as much as it is in the US and in China so I take a different view in that in some ways in that I think that we need to have a diverse economy that has sizes all sides of businesses and the more diversity and the more ability for businesses to start and grow well will eventually get us there we have 16 unicorns that started and in the UK London is the second country sorry the second city in the world for creating AI businesses and our basic capital they are specific businesses in the last year went up 17% what will happen in the future how they will grow what they will do it's it's quite important but it's also very important to have the right foundations and the right conditions for businesses to be able to start and then and grow so I think we should not forget that what you've just said without getting into the politics of brexit I mean you have underscored the importance of the UK in a field how just how do the panel see UK working with the rest of Europe going forward specifically on a well so you're totally right if you talk about London and the unicorns in AI which is something that most of the other countries envy you for so I was just in in Sweden to talk rise and ignite Sweden and the Swedish ministry is about but the start of landscape there and it's a different picture in almost all the other countries in Europe than it is here and specifically in London and that's again like Tabitha was the moderator on our last panel with all the different European a I initiatives together in unique in May in March and we had a presentation saying okay that's like the European landscape and we're pretty well in Europe compared to China compared to the s and and there was like in in almost all cases around 32 foot to 50 percent but the impact was from from the UK so it's really important to think about Europe as a whole and for us it's it's really important to consider this as a European approach independent of the countries I mean we also count in Norway Switzerland and so it's not about the European Union it's about Europe and I think we actually need to - - look at this from a I mean to your question about brexit and I won't go into the politics but I do think the biggest threat that it poses to us in this instance is that it disrupts us from getting on with being great at all the things that we've been discussing and actually I think if we take the perspective of what's going to shape both the UK but also Europe in this space in the next 20 years or so it's not brexit its technology in its AI and it's everything we've been talking about and so I I really think it's incumbent upon us to do the things that we've been talking about today all of which can happen regardless of the politics and make sure we kind of stay firm to that and not be disrupted by anything else that's going on looking from the University point of view for me it's impossible to think of Europe as a kind of lab science community without UK and I just hope that nothing basically changes at least in science I will not talk about brexit in particular but what I would like to say is that I think under as you're right we have a very diverse European market in terms of how we start businesses what we do how we invest we play a very big role in the UK but I honestly believe that we have quite a lot of instances that will not go away of us partnering of us learning from each other and the problems that I mentioned before did not recognize borders so it's not that they will we know we're going to hang it down and start solving things on our own so I'm very much in the Helen camp and the reason why myself and quite a few of us and sit in panels like that and talk about these things is because it's really important for the world not to forget that we continue to do the things that need to be done it is not just all about an above brexit thanks now I'd like to turn to the topic of data and I want to throw two questions out you feel free to answer either or both depending on how you feel but first I wanted to bust this myth that you know China wins automatically because of the massive population and they've got data on billions of people because in fact the way AI works is you it's not the quantity of data is having enough data and having quality of data so so so let's talk about the fact that you know Europe has enough data it can leverage it properly and the other thing I want to wanted to talk about is ownership of data and data privacy and do we need in order to fully realize our potential going forward do we need to wean people off of US Internet giant products and make them understand the value of their own data so who wants to I'll go with the first if you want so I think you know when it comes to really exploiting the opportunity here data is just from my perspective one part of the kind of the opportunity or the challenge if you like certainly with the businesses that we work with across Europe you never go into a company and they say gosh I can't you know use these technologies because we don't have enough data I mean that's not what you hear we we can't use their technologies because we struggle to recruit the right talent we struggle to change the culture we struggle with our infrastructure there are many many different hurdles and it's not you know that don't just pertain to data so whilst I think yes of course data quantity and quality is important I've been by no means think it's the kind of blocker if you like to reaching opportunities that we've got today so in terms of quality and quantity of data that that's my perspective I would like to echo that and also say that for us for me and Trust is very important issue and this is where we started off this conversation so it's not just data is how you trust people who want to share data to do that in an ethical and in a way that aligns with with values so we started doing quite a lot of work and I know we're not the only country and in in the concept of what we call data Trust's sharing arrangements that could potentially enable people to share data public to private private private of public to public and we are doing quite a lot of work with an organization called open data Institute who is developing our first pilots on how we create these institutional arrangements that we broadly call data data Trust's and data Commons something that will enable us to do that and solve problems across the economy when it comes to data I think what is what is key in many European countries it is the industrial basis and in the industrial base production data research and development experience knowledge and data so it's not so much about the b2c domain like face recognition as in cities in China surveillance of students who are not attending school classes like these are nice some nice use case sorts of the Chinese are very proud of actually if you're there and they talk very proud of these total surveillance use cases but I think in Europe it's also about industrial use cases and they are data production is not so much of an issue it's then about sharing data and they're really like the challenges come in because companies don't know how to value the data and they're so infrastructure billion ensuring these kinds of information once we solve this I think that's against something we can really build on in Europe and yeah actually create like the AI ecosystem on the industrial knowledge on and what we have here in Europe yes I completely agree that I mean governments can decide how they are want to utilize their data companies can decide they can build this kind of a sharing models and agreements which is not easy but it's not impossible and then talking about individuals we we are pretty much used to this I agree type of operations that we just use and service and give all our data without any compensation compensation directly it's kind of undirected but it doesn't have to be like that for the rest of humanity I mean like there could be alternatives like we were earlier toying with an example that kind of we go to supermarket and there's some normal banana fair trade bananas we have an option why don't we have options like normal search engine fair trade so you are a marketing to keep in mind I think if you look at AI applications you have specific use cases which are totally fine because it's in your like individual company or application area and then there are a couple of other use cases which require an ecosystem like if you if you talk to Alibaba the head of FAI and Alabama they always talk about this city example I don't remember the city said it might be one true where they like they are very proud of not installing any new sensor but just based on software algorithms they went down from the fifth like most crowded and polluted city in China or in the world down to place 50 because they connected the traffic lights with the emergency system with a school system is like every is connected and they somehow came to this more global optimal in an optimization with different stakeholders working closely together and to get this type of new applications and new new Optima it's it's really essential to work together with lots of different individual stakeholders and that I see much more difficult in Europe because like everyone follows their own interest and it's really hard to really get everyone on a table to come to this global Optima you can think of health care and so if you want to have a really really efficient healthcare ecosystem there need to be kind of a vision of what we want to do and every stakeholder needs to participate in that and doesn't like just I try to protect their own in that use cases the Chinese are really good at solving challenges I can just okay a great point and I do think that that is a challenge but I as we're we're almost out of time I'm going to sum up what I think are europe's strengths and so we've talked about the human centric approach and how europe has an opportunity to define itself with ethical we've also talked about the role of government and actually you know one strengths that europe has compared to the united states is that because we believe in universal healthcare the governments have been able to collect lots of data about the population as opposed to the US where everything is private and they they don't have that data so while it may not be easy you know i think governments do have a path forward to come out ahead by using a with with healthcare and this could be a key differentiator for Europe we also have a huge industrial base here in Europe and if the companies are convinced that you know a real implementation not just testing around the edges but real implementation of a I can help them further their business and they can really harness their their industry expertise that that too could become a strength for Europe so I'd like to end the panel by asking the audience who here believes that Europe has a good chance to succeed in a raise your hand please give a nice round of applause
