 good evening delegates and welcome to the data science festival hosted by techias i'm albania the senior academic counselor at tech is and before we begin session i'd like to introduce you to our programming school based out of santa clara tech is offers specialized and certified data science and web development courses with one-on-one round-the-clock mentorship for seven days a week the idea is to educate train and offer placements to our students in the it sector within three to six months a few points to remember before we conduct a productive and successful session and to allow our team to moderate the session smoothly one to ask abhijit the question please type your question in the q a box yeah as you can see on the screen please type your question in the q a box and rpg will answer them accordingly secondly we will be streaming live on facebook and youtube for anyone who misses the session right now um all the questions that will be asked out of which three would be nominated the three best questions to be asked and the three best social media posts that tag tech is will be selected and will win amazon watchers offered by tech is we would also like to inform you that after the webinar we will be conducting a one-on-one career counseling session for participants interested in beginning their career as data scientists or web developers a google form link will be shared in the chat box to sign up for the mentoring session with that said i now have the immense pleasure of welcoming abhijit ashok a data scientist at microsoft having achieved his major in data science from harvard university he will talk to you through the session and provide you insights on the following things one how to develop the key basic skills for data science two how to crack a data science interview three what is the life of a data scientist and finally four what makes a data scientist a good data scientist now over to you abig to conduct um the meeting forward thank you very much thank you so much uh can you see me and hear me clearly yes we can thank you uh it's a pleasure to be here thanks for having me and everyone on the call thanks for attending and i hope this can be a very informative session to everyone involved uh so as i'm talking through i'll uh i'll show you like a very small deck there's not much just a couple of slides to help you understand the process better let me just share my screen are you able to see my screen okay so let me just go to the presentation node all right so uh i'm gonna start by explaining what my career roadmap so far has been and i think this is relevant because i'm someone who actually like fell into data science by accident and then decided to make something out of it as opposed to someone who like planned to go into data science from the get-go and had like a overall roadmap to get there uh so i grew up in india and i started my college in 2010 i went to college in bitspilani goa campus i don't know how many of you know the college but it's one of the major private institutions in india and uh in india there's this there's this like mad craze towards the engineering and the medical disciplines over everything else so uh i i was part of that rat race as well when i was in high school i wanted to study english literature of all things and that was something i was passionate about but then given the indian society uh there was like hardly any support from anywhere and it didn't even register in my head that oh that is something that i could actually go to school to study study work and um i got like pushed into that rat race of engineering and i decided okay well i mean this is what's in right in front of me so might as well make something out of it and i basically did a dual degree program where i did a bachelor's in engineering electronic electrical and electronics engineering to be specific and a master's in mathematics over a period of five years from 2010 to 2015. now pretty soon uh in my first semester itself i pretty much figured out that i had like no interest in engineering and the rest of the four years were more of like me trying to sort of like survive in that atmosphere so because i knew that i did not relate to anything that i was like seeing there and in order to like perform well in order to get good grades it seemed that i had to like put in way more effort than what a lot of other people had to put in just because i did not relate to any of those and did not come naturally to me uh so i basically tried to survive over the next four years and the the only courses where i got like really good grades for pretty much my humanities electives like creative writing and stuff like that where i did not even have like think about it i could just like go and give the exam as opposed to the other engineering subjects where i actually like studied a lot and ended up with like really really average grades so it was a really difficult time mentally to sort of try to chart out what the future looks like and it was like a very big question mark and towards the end uh the last year like 2014 to 2015 was the last year of my time in college and by definition as part of the program that i was in i had to sort of make that a full year a year-long internship and uh you basically there was like a huge list of companies that the college had affiliations with and you just had to give like a preference list and based on your performance in college so far they would like allow you to like certain organizations with whom you'll be working for the next six months or the next one year uh so i i was pretty sure that i couldn't do anything like tech oriented so i just like searched searched out all the non-technical options in that entire list like finance marketing business analytics whatever as long as it was not tech i was in for it and i basically put them all on the top of my list and uh but my college basically like dropped me into this hardcore electronics company for whatever reason in spite of all that and then the people at the electronics company said that okay they wanted to talk to me to assess my skills before i actually went to them and we had like an interview call where they understood that i didn't really know anything and they they basically i didn't really know anything that they wanted in an intern that was like going to them uh and then basically they later told me that uh you know you don't really know the skills are like really poor and we don't really you don't really know anything that we require you to know so you might you should ramp up a lot before you come to us if you really want to like make something out of the time here and i basically told them that look you know this is what exactly happened uh this was not really up on my priority list but you know given that i i am here right now i'll pretty much do my best to make sure you're not wasting your time with me uh but then after hearing that they went to my college and said that okay this guy's not even interested so don't even like send them to us so now i was in that weird limbo where my college was like go there and they were like don't come here and i i was pretty much in wondering whether i even would have an internship because if i didn't have an internship i could not graduate because this was part of the curriculum and these grades had to go into my grade sheet so i was wondering whether i had like drop drop a whole year for nothing and then try again in a year and uh it was a very tough month not hearing anything from the college either uh but then eventually on the on the final day where they were like publishing the entire allotment list i found out that i've been assigned to the analytic analytics company called new sigma in bengaluru india uh at that point in time my understanding of data was just data entry like some numbers in an excel sheet is what i knew about data at that point i did not know that something called analytics existed something called data science existed nothing of that sort uh and then at that point uh i stepped into new sigma anyway because i was like if some internship is better than nothing and i went there and that is actually where i got introduced to data analytics and data science in general uh it was like it was like finding something out of nowhere and i started like feeling passionate about it i started relating to data science in general and it was a really interesting time because all those mathematical formulae that i that i saw in college that i never thought i could make any sense out of started making sense because now it was in a very application oriented setting because i knew now what linear algebra was used for in reality and what multivariate calculus was used for in reality so in that sense giving a context to those complex mathematical equations definitely helped me gain a sense of what data science was and gauge my passion for data science in general and an idea that i got maybe like six to seven months into my internship and idea that i got uh was basically developed into my very first research paper like a year later um and at that point in time i was getting pretty sure that hey data science is something that i'm feeling really passionate about and so that i'm feeling that i'm able to relate to so this is probably what i should be building my career in even though it was something that i fell into by complete accident and uh at that point although the challenge was that apart from this like one internship that that had something to do with data science remotely i had nothing else to show in my resume or to sort of like express my interest in uh being a data scientist so i knew that data science is still like a fresher's entry into data science is still like kind of like a problem compared to a lot of other fields so i knew especially and this was like five years ago so it was even more challenging back then so i kind of knew that if i jumped into it directly uh there would not be much of an opportunity for me there so instead i tried to look into analytics like business analytics and because it was like related to data science in like some way or the other and i thought as a business analyst i could slowly slowly grow into this role of data scientist and that's how i joined uh zs associates uh but at zs associates my business analyst or the team was in the project i was working on was like the farthest it could be from anything to do with data science it was a very like pure consulting oriented kind of projects that are that i was falling into so because of that it was kind of uh challenging for sure uh to sort of like figure out the next step in my career path so i talked to the hr i talked talked about the interest to move into like the data science team but they were like they discouraged me in the beginning because uh they were like you just like joined the company it's like too early to like switch over and when that happened i saw i was sort of like again requested them to sort of reconsider and they were they were like we'll look into this like after a year so if you like really do well in a year then after a year we could probably like switch you over uh and then there was like a lot of there were like a lot of competitions organized by the data science team of the company within the company like kaggle kaggle kind of competitions uh and i participated in a lot of them and i put in like a lot of extra hours after work to do those competitions and also a lot of other different projects that came my way like the ones you see on the slide right here in the 2050 to 2017 range um so at the in those two years i definitely did sacrifice my work-life balance a lot so uh even cs as such it was a consulting company the work hours were really long and even outside zs especially like for example safe city safe city was is a non-profit that uses data as a tool to fight gender-based violence so uh safe city was a was an organization that i got involved with in 2015 um i i personally am a feminist so it is a course that i really really relate to and i helped safety set up their data science did data team from scratch back in 2015 and i was with them for 2017 until 2017. so basically at that point i was pretty much saying yes to whatever came my way and then trying to figure out how exactly to get those done later which is not something i would advise people to do like definitely you should take care of your work-life balance and mental health like as first priority uh so this was something that i had to do at that point in time so unless it's absolutely necessary that you sacrifice your work-life balance please don't do it it's never worth it at the end of the day so after a lot of this happened i switched the roles a lot in between and i was doing like juggling like multiple projects at the same time to sort of build my own resume and my own profile in data science so that you know i'll have like a strong career and people would take me seriously but along the way i realized that i was learning a lot by myself but i did not really have a mentor of any kind and without a mentor it's kind of difficult to know whether you're going in the best path possible you might be going in a right path but there might be like better paths out there for you to like explore and learn from without a mentor it's kind of difficult to understand uh what that's going to look like and even more than a mentor a kind of like a structured learning approach was important at least i felt that it was important for me at that particular point in time which is when i decided to apply for grad school in data science specifically and in late in late 2016 i applied for grad school and in 2017 i started my masters which was like my second masters at harvard uh focusing on data science majoring in data science with a focus on healthcare and following that healthcare thread right there i interned at the mount sinai health system in new york city in 2018 the summer of 2018 where we did like a computer vision project for global health and which is a really interesting uh scenario as well but over the course of period of time i figured out that it's probably too early to focus on one particular field of data science as such i chose to major with like a focus in healthcare because zs associates focus on like the healthcare field a lot and that was what i had most experience in before um but then through the course of my time at harvard i understood that it's perhaps like a bit too early to focus on one particular field when data science is just exploding and there's like so many new applications coming up every single day which is when i decided to sort of be more uh generic in terms of the kind of work that i wanted to do post harvard and then there was like a health issue by which i had to extend my time at harvard by a semester so instead of finishing my classes in december 2019 i finished my 2018 i finished my classes in may 2019 uh but because of that uh i wasn't even planning to apply to like microsoft in the first place where i'm currently working now uh but i got like an email like actually a linkedin message from the microsoft hr in january of 2019 um where the hr was like hey this is there's this like pretty new program ai focus program that we're having at microsoft and maybe you should like look into it and apply and i was like i wasn't even planning to apply because i was pretty sure i wouldn't get in but now that someone has like shown interest in me i should probably like give it a shot and that's how i just turned in my resume and there was like a there's like a phone interview the there was like they're like six rounds in total and there was a phone interview that mostly focused on my on my resume so far and because it was an ai role and applied ai rule they were interested in my research aspects as well so we talked a bit about my research projects in the past as well but mostly it was like very resume oriented and then i had like four in-person rounds at the microsoft office in cambridge massachusetts their their research center is right here which is where i am right now and uh the four rounds covered mostly uh the mathematics behind machine learning uh data wrangling and uh the problem-solving approach like they think about case studies but in a very very data science focused format like hey this is the problem that we need to solve and how else how how exactly would you go about thinking about the data the wrangling of the data et cetera et cetera so after like six rounds uh my offer came in became like about two months later and i joined microsoft at the end of july 2019 and i've been working there so far and it's been like a bit over a year and at microsoft i'm part of as i said it's like a very unique program and part of this very specific and unique ai program called the microsoft ai development acceleration program or made app in short it is a very interesting program where it's a two two year program so it's still a full-time employment it's a full-time role it's not an internship or anything it's the full-time role uh but the advantage of this program is that you do not have to like commit to like a particular microsoft team from the get-go you can work with like four different microsoft teams over a period of two years on like projects uh on like five to six months long projects and uh after after the two years you can make a call as to which team you want to join permanently based on the fit that you see in yourself with that particular team or the kind of work they do in that team whether they're new to data science whether they have like a very set preset data science team already whatever your priorities are you have time to like sort of shop around and explore before you actually commit to a particular team and in the course in the course of that time while you're exploring and shopping around you have a great opportunity to create a build ai and integrate ai into a lot of different microsoft projects so i'm done with two of my projects right now and i'm in my third project right now we just started like two or three weeks ago and so far i've been working in microsoft azure the the microsoft azure cloud space so far all of my projects have been recorded regarding ai in some aspect of microsoft azure or the other and my life as a data scientist every day it kind of varies by the team that you're going into and it definitely varies a lot by the company you're going into uh or even like if you're doing research the lab you're going into because uh there's no one single definition for what data science is it means different things to different people in different companies so at least in my own team my my work is like mostly surrounding like modeling of course but modeling comes in much later there's a there are a lot of other aspects involved in the planning of a project and creating like a really good data science project that will cover in the next slide uh but it's a lot of like working really closely with software engineers and program managers as like one single unit so we work data scientists work with software engineers and program managers on a daily basis to ensure the project success because all three verticals like pretty much go in parallel and uh there's a lot of interaction uh it's a definitely a lot of like thinking through because like by definition ai problems are pretty vague uh and oftentimes the projects that we get are ideas that the team has but have don't really have an idea how exactly to go about implementing them so a lot of times we are starting pretty much from scratch so we have to like think through the problem and iterate through a lot of different data science routes and data science road maps to take the project forward uh but one good thing that i see here uh in in my role at least is that i don't really have like a very sad schedule as such so as long as i show up to my meetings uh actually i'm there in my meetings and then my work is done on time which my work what exactly my work is is something that i decide so how exactly i need to do the project is also something i get a lot of freedom to decide so in that sense i'm really glad to be working in my current role at microsoft i'm not saying all teams at microsoft are like this this is like probably like a very unique situation to the particular team i'm in or the kind of teams that i've been interacting with but i have a lot of freedom to decide how exactly i want to do my project and the managers are more of like coaches rather than people who direct you to do things so no one's going to like come and tell you hey today you have to do this and tomorrow you do you have to do that it's more of like you telling them how exactly you're thinking about doing something and then them giving you suggestions then that you can you can you're free to like refute those suggestions if you want to uh if you have like a valid reasoning for them so there's like a lot of freedom there and that's what i enjoy about the work environment the most uh especially like in a field like data science where there are like a lot more questions and answers and there's never really one right answer and there are like a thousand different uh directions to go in it's all it's always really helpful for people to be allowed to work in their own comfort zone since different people work in different ways so for example we are we're advised by our managers to uh put like a hard stop on a work day at 5 00 p.m no matter what you're doing and just like continue it the very next day but i know that i cannot do that because you know if i stop something midway i'll keep on thinking about it that night and i won't be able to sleep that night so i know that i won't be able to put a hard stop so uh to make sure that i won't i'm not getting overwhelmed i take breaks in between the day like sometimes when uh around like maybe 12 to 1 or like 2 to 3 p.m or something i just if i feel overwhelmed i just like stop working during the workday i take a break i like watch something since especially now since we are home uh you know we have a lot of freedom to like you know switch on the tv and watch something in the meantime and then before i get back to work again so i get a lot of freedom and i think generally if you choose your company right if you choose the kind of place you want to be at right uh you should be able to get a lot of leverage in like sort of arguing for uh getting your getting your kind of like work freedom the way you want to do your work uh remember that especially when you're going into data science interview they are interviewing you for sure but you you should be interviewing them too in the sense that uh you should be looking for how sure they are in their data science journey because there are a lot of people who want to just jump up on into the data science bandwagon because they want to claim that they're doing data science and they're doing machine learning when in reality they have like absolutely no plan as to how to get that done and um they have don't really have any data like a data scientist cannot do anything without like good data or at least data i mean if you have some data you can make something out of it but without any kind of data or any kind of like pipeline to get that data the data scientists cannot really do anything and most people don't really understand that a lot of people think that data sciences data science and ai in general is just like magic where you can like snap your fingers and get things done which is really really not the case so whenever you're going into a data science interview make sure you interview them as well as them details about their five-year roadmap for how they see the growth of data science in their own company ask for what their data looks like how much data they have if they don't have enough data right now do they have plans in place for gathering that data later and there are like a thousand considerations like this that you should ask them before deciding to join the company and uh the one one good thing about joining the big names is that they have like infrastructure set up already they have a plan set up already and it gets really easy for you to like onboard and start working which is not probably not the case for a lot of like startups and smaller companies uh but at the same time if you're working for a startup uh you have the freedom to like set things up from this from scratch by yourself so uh you get like a lot of like freedom with regard to infrastructure choices and like tooling choices and a lot of things like that as well so it depends on what you're looking for but if you are an entry-level data scientist and if you are going into uh if you if you are going into like your first job as a data scientist and if you are going to be the first data scientist at that particular company uh i would advise not to do that because especially if you're like just starting off you need some really good mentorship in a an extremely vague and exploratory field like data science and uh you should probably go to a place where you can get that mentorship maybe for like uh two or three years or three years at the very least before you can probably like start thinking about uh doing things on your own or maybe stepping into a company where you can set up their data science infrastructure by yourself so that basically covers the the roadmap section of this uh we'll uh talk more about like questions and answer more questions right after i finish the next slide hopefully there's more will be more information that will be coming out uh through that now here in this slide this is this is the last slide uh i want to introduce you to the subtle side of data science so in this in this slide right here you'll see the big blue box that represents data science split into two sections on the left you'll see some of the common terms that are used in uh that you hear about in data science in like big blue circles the general perception uh computer science data wrangling statistic machine learning math so when you think about data science you think about it as like a combination of all these things which is not wrong at all on the surface this is exactly what data science is these are the skills that you would need to basically excel in data science but if you go one layer deeper on the right side of that blue box you'll see that big red circle right there uh if you go to one if you go one layer deeper there are like a lot of considerations in there that will take you from a very generic data scientist who knows what they should be doing to a really good data scientist who can actually create real meaningful impact out there be it research or industry so let's look at this is not an exhaustive list of course this is just basically something i filled out based on my own experience and let's actually go through them one by one first of all you see one the first point is domain knowledge this is something that is discounted a lot by a lot of people and domain knowledge is one of the most important things to have in data science and of course domain knowledge is not directly related to any of the things that you see on the left but knowing the domain knowledge is really important in the early stages of a data science life cycle because although we you tend to characterize data science by like let's say machine learning machine learning modeling only comes in in the last like 20 of a particular project the remaining 80 percent the initial 80 percent of that entire project is basically you know data preparation data exploration data wrangling like exploratory data analysis uh statistical analysis and a lot of such things because you need to understand the data that you're working with in order to do something with it because um feature engineering uh feature engineering if you don't know is the process by which you like transform the data into a form that is actually useful for a machine learning model to directly gain information from so if the machine learning no machine learning model is not able to like grab information from my data set directly you sort of wrangle the data into creating more columns slash more features through which the machine learning model can gain more information extract more information out of it and give you better results so in order to do that feature engineering you definitely need a lot of domain knowledge uh for example if you're doing let's say let's say like a pharmaceutical project and there you're working in working on this project where you need to predict whether this particular person has taken this particular medication in the past or not or taken this particular test in the past five years or not so even you need to do something like that you have information about their entire medical history and everything now depending on what this what the condition that you're looking for is you may need to look for related conditions and if if someone has taken the medication for a related condition in the past five years it's more likely that they would have taken uh the medication that we're looking for as opposed to someone who has not taken the related medication so then for that you need to know what the related medications are and that is basically coming from doing knowledge and without that domain knowledge you're losing out on that particular aspect of the entire dataset that could have given you a huge jump in your results that you're otherwise missing out on like you can you can throw in like the most complex machine learning algorithm on machine learning or deep learning algorithm on top of your data but will give you like really really poor results if your features are not really engineered and it's really difficult to uh engineer really really nice features without this domain knowledge so whichever project whichever data science project it is initially you'll probably spend like a good amount of time just studying the domain like if whether it's like iot internet of things or like pharmaceuticals or like entertainment or real estate or whatever it is you'll probably spend a good amount of time learning this domain before you can actually like apply and create good features and get really nice results now going to the second point uh research versus industry this is also a consideration that you should be having in your having in your mind before you're choosing your data science career path because they work pretty differently uh and in in research you basically have you're not you're less time bounded in a way and you have more freedom to like explore further and uh you your target is basically like getting a model that can give you like really really really good results whereas in industry while the results are like really really important another there are like other aspects that can come into play like the latency of the model like if it has to run in production if the model has to run in real time they're like latency considerations like the entire execution of the model in real time cannot take more than two seconds so in research you might get like a model with like let's say 99 accuracy but it takes like an entire hour to run through the entire data set whereas in industry that may not really be acceptable they're like in the industry might be like okay we are okay with uh restricting the restricting the results the accuracy to like 90 percent or 95 but we want it to run in two seconds and there are like a lot of other considerations that come in you know stakeholder management and uh the general organizational direction organizational priorities that come in the industry whereas in research it's just like hey here's the problem that we are trying to solve and let's come up with like the best way to solve it so depending on what kind of what kind of like a work environment and what kind of like a career environment you prefer you need to give it a thought as to whether you prefer to be in more research-oriented roles or where you prefer to be in more industry-oriented roles my role right now i would say it's it's applied ai so in that's in that sense it is industry but it is also it also has a very strong research component to it uh because the problems we get are by default really big so we need to do a lot of literature review and stuff to identify existing methods before we actually build on top of them so my current role is a combination of both those exist as well although they're kind of rare so in general it's advisable to uh debate between industry and research before you choose one per year career path that's best suited for you number three uh better coding practices so we don't usually think of in think of this in data science because we are mostly just considered concerned about getting the ultimate result getting like a really good result but there are especially when you're working in the industry a better coding practice data scientist having a better coding practice is really really helpful uh when it comes to taking your model into production because what happens is you as a data scientist uh create you like work on python or r or whatever you create like a prototype you run a number of like tests to test out the algorithm on like different kinds of data and you're like okay now i'm confident that this particular model is like good enough it gives the results that are good enough for what we're looking for and then what happens is you're the software engineer who's working with you often takes up that particular model that you created and puts it so creates like a pipeline and put plugs that model into that pipeline and you know puts it into production and make sure it runs smoothly and everything and in some cases you are the engineer too like you're both the saw data scientist and the software engineer that depends on the company and the team and in those cases you are the person who's taking in into the pipeline too so if you ensure that you have really good coding practices early on it will save everyone a lot of trouble later when it comes to optimizing the code and making sure the code runs smoothly and everything like some uh a change as simple as like rather than writing the code in like one go splitting the code up into a lot of different functions and then running all those like recursive functions and running all those functions with like a single single code command called uh that changes that saves a lot of time for software engineers later when they when it comes to putting the code into production so this this is like another consideration that we often don't think about when we think about data science but it's like really really useful to create impact using data science number four is fast changing state of the art and uh data science as i said earlier is like very vague very exploratory is very nascent too so a lot of research is obviously happening in data science at the moment uh state what is state of the art today won't be the state-of-the-art like two months from now or three months from now it need not be the state of the art two months from montana so because of that uh continuously updating yourself with the latest knowledge is very very important uh if you can if you can attend like the latest conferences keep keep yourself updated with the latest and greatest of what is happening in data science that's like really really advisable uh but at the very least uh if you can like pick up like a few papers every now and then when you're like relaxing just you know just give it like a read through maybe like read like a section a day or something uh to keep yourself updated with what's new and what is what is the algorithm that's doing better than what you implemented two months ago uh that's gonna help you keep yourself updated and keep yourself relevant in the field of data science for sure uh number five data security and responsible ai when you're learning data science when you're learning machine learning this is not something that you often think about and this particular aspect of it is really really important when it comes to the legal issues in the both in the industry and in research because as this is particularly important when it comes to like let's say healthcare data when it's like really really sensitive information uh the information you're getting is like definitely de-anonymized and has like multiple layers of firewall and like password protected and whatnot but along with that there will also be considerations that oh you should not like put it into this particular cloud or if you need to put into this cloud you need like all these other permissions and all this is part of the responsible ai where you're making sure that uh the data that you have in your hand is secure and you're not doing anything to compromise the integrity of the data of that data and compromise people's privacy and anything other sort so basically before you even start doing a data science project in the industry you may have you may have to spend like a lot of time like a lot of weeks sort of sifting through all these problems sometimes the permissions can take a lot of time so you need you might be like blocked by that so all these are issues that uh that are not ideal like you would probably you know obviously like like to just jump in and just like just go at it just start picking up the data and start exploring but it's not something it's not that easy when it comes to industry and there are like a lot of considerations like this you have you might have to work through before you get your hands on the data but obviously these considerations are really really important and uh uh they they totally need to be done to make sure like everyone's identities and everyone's personal data is really secure next is inclusive practices in data science projects so uh this is something that i've been thinking about like really only very recently as well before that this was not something that i had in my considerations as well so the biggest example of this like i wouldn't say the biggest but one of the examples of this is this particular slide itself so the colors that i used in the slide the blue that i've used here the red that i used here the green that i've used here are everything are those other colors that i've sort of like put in keeping a color blind friendly palette in mind so when you think about data science we often uh create like a lot of uh visualizations while we are exploring the data even when you're trying to explain data science to like other people we create like a lot of visualizations and obviously visualizations require a lot of colors and even presentations there's a lot of color everywhere in presentations and there might be a lot of uh visualizations and slides where colorblind people might might find it really difficult to understand what you're trying to say because if you're trying to differentiate between two colors but if those two colors look the same for them uh they don't really know what the difference is right so uh the colors that i used here are colors that would give a an adequate contrast even for like color-blind people so one very good check for that like once you're creating a visualization once you're creating a presentation one good check that one of the engineers in microsoft told me about is that just convert it to grayscale convert it to black and white and if you can actually like differentiate between what you're trying to differentiate in black and white as well that is probably like a rough check that okay this is probably kind of colorblind friendly but even otherwise there are a lot of colorblind friendly palettes available out there it's integrated into like most of the major softwares at the moment um and we need to sort of make sure the data science project not only the outcome of outcome that's coming out of a data science project not only like the model and the product that uses that model but also the processes of creating that model and getting that model of production all the all the documentation all the presentations or the visualizations even even like the meetings so you'll notice that when i started explaining this slide i actually explained what was on the left i explained that there's a blue box with data signs and blue circles and like a red circle and everything that was pretty intentional because i did that for uh the image description so you know people who are blind who people who cannot see the slides will be able to sort of listen to their image description and sort of try at least try to understand the kind of situation that we are talking about here so these are the kind of practices that would make your data science projects more accessible to a wider population and you know we're in the 21st century now and i definitely think it's high time we start incorporating these practices into data science in general next is the the data in itself and the data can come in like all shapes and sizes we often expect like a very clean data to come into the picture uh especially like uh when you talk about machine learning uh the supervised machine learning requires like a certain kind of data set and you expect that you get that data ready-made uh in the exact format that we want very clean no missing values and no wrong information and anything and everything and you can just like go jump in directly into data exploration and deciding what model to use and everything it never works like that in real life there are a lot of data issues that you'll have to deal with in the beginning and it can be frustrating for a lot of people because a lot of people come into data science uh you know with understand looking at all the fancy algorithms are going around you know you see computer vision you see face recognition you see self-driving cars and you get really like google translate you get really excited about it and you start working data science and all those things all the algorithm the algorithm part of it doesn't really come until like much later as i said earlier like the last 20 percent so until then there's a lot of work that you need to put into getting your data there and it can be frustrating for a lot of people i know i'm also like not the biggest fan of that face but i know how important that face is to get like a really good result in the end and you should be like involved you should be like ready to go through that face before you get to that final product and last but not the least as i said earlier take care of your work-life balance and attention to mental health as i said the field of data science is very vague and very exploratory because of that it's possible that you can end up like researching algorithms for hours and hours and you can lose track of time and eventually you might pretty soon you'll feel like burned out because of like how much a work you're putting in and how much of mental exhaustion you're feeling because of that and also like number of iterations that you would go through to like improve the model uh that can also become really overwhelming pretty soon um so it's really easy to like lose control when it comes to a field like data science so make sure you pay attention to your work life balance uh pay attention to your mental health uh plan your days properly so that you are not overwhelmed if there is an activity that helps you like take your mind off of it please please definitely do that and different things work for different people so i don't have like a guideline of what you're supposed to do but you should like find it out for yourself and make sure there's like a healthy balance of what data science gives you and what the other aspects of your life give you in your daily life uh so that's pretty much all i had from my end so maybe uh i can i'm hoping to like give in a little bit more information based on the questions you've been asking so far i see like a lot of questions in the q a box
