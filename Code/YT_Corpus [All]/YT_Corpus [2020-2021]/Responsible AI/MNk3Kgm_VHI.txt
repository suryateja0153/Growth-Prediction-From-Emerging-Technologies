 STEWART BRAND: Luigi asks: The issue of trust between humans and autonomous systems is not a new one. what sort of features or AI interactions might increase trust in both directions? IAN MCEWAN: Well, it's a very good question, I really don't know the answer. What would increase our trust? I wrote a short story in order to get going on this novel. It's a fivefinger exercise. And it's written from far in the future looking back when artificial humans have become so stitched into life. And they served on juries, and they served in the military. They had rights and responsibilities. And gradually we went back to 19th century anti-slavery laws, and using much of that language, in order to say you cannot own such a person. I mean owning another human being is, I think, a bad in itself. And then it became non, very non-pc, to ask someone when you're sitting at dinner with some strangers, to say: are you real? It'd be extremely rude. And my narrator in that short story had lived that transition. That it would be just as intrusive as if you were to say it dinner loudly, "I hear you've got a colostomy bag. Bad luck." To say of someone, "Are you real?" is sort of physically intrusive. Because you've already accepted that they are conscious, so what should it matter? And so it starts with a man who's with his girlfriend. They're making love and he feels he has to ask her. And the story really is all about her answer. And I I think coming back to this question: That would then be, once we passed that point of even not even wanting, let alone daring, to ask, then we would have reached the point of total trust. BRAND: Oh, interesting. MCEWAN: That would be the the meeting point.
