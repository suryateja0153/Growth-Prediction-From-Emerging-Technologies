 okay so this talks can be split into three parts I'm going to introduce how satalia thinks about AI and builds AI solutions for large organizations at scale then I hand over to David and Charlotte to talk in more detail about the case movie that we have and I just want to thank everybody who's been part of that project I don't got some PwC people in the room some satalia people in the room just massive thank you for the past several years working on this project has been a really great experience okay so before we get into AI and definitions of AI on how satalia thinks about AI want you to take only take you through this technology stack and I'm gonna make this quite interactive so hopefully aren't still nice and warmed up but the first question I want to ask you all can they never tell me what data is what is data anybody what is data very good excellent unprocessed information so it comes from the latin word artem which means given things is stuff it's the fabric of our universe it's ones and zeros it's bits inside in bits and bytes so if I say to you two-one-zero to a zero this is data if I say that it's a date of birth or sort code or how much money I have in my account it becomes information and one of the biggest challenges that we have in computer science it's taking all of this stuff all of this light and sound and text and figuring out what you actually mean so if I tweeted right now my laptop is sick what does that mean my laptop is I'd have to do the arm movement sick huh what does that mean if you're under 21 probably means it's very good if you're old like me it means it's very bad so how you interpret data is very important for them the decisions that you make so for me data symbols it's just stuff that imagine if I give you a spreadsheet and in the spreadsheet it has three columns as a column which is the date a column which is a temperature on that date and a column which is a number of ice creams I sell on that date date temperature ice cream cells what do you do with that information what do you do with that spreadsheet what do you do with that spreadsheet fine analyze say okay so let's draw a graph so if we have increasing temperature along here an increase in ice cream cells along here what would our graph look like I know you can do this come on what does the graph look like good yes we see some sort of trend going upward this is descriptive analytics were organizing information to find patterns to know things about the world and I would argue that knowledge is organizing information to know things we know that when it gets hotter outside we sell more ice creams we could do something really cool now we can do a thing called linear regression which means part of line through it and now what we have is predictive power okay so we have predictive power so if tomorrow is 22 degrees outside I can look at my model and I can see how many ice creams I need to manufacture and I can take this model of the world this knowledge and I can put into a factory and I can now have my factories manufacturing ice creams based on this knowledge but can anybody tell me why we sell ice creams when it's hot outside why do we sell ice creams when it's hot outside it's not a trick question yeah okay so I'm inside it's hot outside not usually in the UK but imagine it's hot outside what's the first thing that happens huh I'm inside it's hot outside huh what happens I go outside and why do I go outside vitamin D we like the Sun it's a scarce resource in the UK then what happens we get hot and then what happens we buy an ice cream or do with the ice cream to put it down our pants what do you do the ice cream eat it and why does eating an ice cream coolers down thermodynamics okay to expect a computer to understand that narrative from this line is impossible it doesn't understand that humans like vitamin D and we can cool ourselves down in lots of different ways which is why it's super important you bridge people are really good at finding patterns from data with people have domain knowledge with people that can understand and interpret those patterns so I would argue understanding is interpreting knowledge to create then at the right narrative at around the world and actually your domain experts going to say Daniel your model of the world here is wrong because if tomorrow is the hottest day ever ever ever ever what's my factory going to do if tomorrow is a hottest day ever come on it's going to manufacture lots and lots of ice creams but what will really happen if tomorrow is scorching hot hottest day ever huh nobody's gonna go outside because you can't reach an ice beam fast enough to cool yourself down so the model of the world looks more like this and and as I said one of their challenges is trying to interpret the world perfectly so we can make good decisions and I would argue that wisdom is utilizing our understanding to make good decisions and this is data-driven decision-making it at the moment every company that touches this stack is calling themselves an AI company it's okay to do that you get more clients and you get mony from VCS but this isn't quite AI I just want to talk about the top of this pyramid right right right now talk about decision making it turns out that humans are not particularly good at decision making and I'm gonna ask you a few maths questions now so imagine these are all staff members I don't know if anybody has staff members then can recognize any of your senior staff members with these five pokemon but imagine we know everything about these staff members we know their skills their preferences we know why whether they're male and female and what we want to do is we want to orientate we want to line up these staff members that satisfy some rules so for example you're not allowed to have the same colors touching or flying Pokemon I've got to be the right of walking Pokemon can anybody tell me how many possible combinations RR of these five staff members so we're looking at one combination I can flip two around I get another combination flip another two around again another combination how many possible combinations do I have good yeah five times four times three times two times one five factorial that exclamation mark will end in schools got 120 possible combinations some of which will satisfy the rules many won't but only one will be the best one okay let's make the problem a bit more complicated so I've got 15 pokemon can anybody tell me how many possible combinations are don't say 15 factorial that's cheating how many possible combinations Millions yeah okay so there's over a trillion possible combinations to expect a human to solve this problem of wasting our time in fact one rule to take away with you today anything more than seven don't use a human for okay whether you're trying to figure out how to spend marketing money or allocate staff or Route vehicles anything more than seven humans are useless and actually industry don't have problems of this size they're problems of this size so can anybody tell me how many possible kids 500 pokemon can anybody tell me how many possible combinations are guess okay it's a big number so it's a number that's over a thousand digits and just to put this number into context and this is how many atoms are in the universe okay and I would argue that you could probably solve problems up to about seven if you're a smart human being you could probably hire quite a smart computer scientist graduate computer scientist that can solve problems up to about 50 or 100 but if you want to solve problems like this at scale you need a different set of skills I'm going to talk about in a second but just I want to just drum this problem home imagine I I've got my ice cream van and ice cream bandits got to deliver ice creams to these 24 points around London and actually humans are quite good at solving these spatial problems so if we wanted to draw a path around these 24 points that save us the most amount of petrol maybe we'd start here and go here and after a few minutes we'd have quite a nice path around those 24 points but how long will it take a computer to get this the shortest path the optimal solution seconds milliseconds okay play this game already it's 20 billion years so if you put 24 times 23 times 22 did it into your calculator you get this number and if you can have a computer that could look at a million routes a second that could check a million routes a second it would take longer than the age of the universe 20 billion years to go through every single possible one and say this one that I looked at 20 billion years ago this one's a shortest one you should do that one and if I had another point of the map I've now got 25 times 20 billion years 5,000 billion years if I had another point on the map it's 26 times 5,000 billion years these are exponential problems we hear the word exponential a lot when we're thinking about AI about AI that's this they can they can solve problems exponentially but people fail to realize that we have thousands of these types of problems in industry are exponentially difficult and we have human beings solving them most of the time so when satalia thinks about building systems we think about these three things yeah first of all is the data available to help us find the insights using machine learning using data signs to find the invite insights that we need from the data but ultimately we want to make decisions and decision making is traditionally an optimization problem and I would argue that organizations right now are going through that digital transformation they're getting all of their data together they're throwing lots and lots of machine learning experts at in data scientist at it to try and find patterns but they're failing to realize you have to leverage that understanding to make good decisions and I would argue that there are only about 3,000 really strong optimization experts around the globe it used to be called operations research a matured in academia or about 20 years ago then everybody about machine learning but actually it's about 3000 people in the world that are really good at solving these problems at scale and if you build a system that has these three things you give data do you put it through a model it makes a decision tomorrow you give it the same data it makes the same decision same data same decision you have an automation but can anybody tell me what the definition of stupidity is okay make it making the same mistake over again and expecting a different answer I would argue that most systems in production are autonomous and are stupid in fact there are actually two definitions of AI what I think is a popular one but a little bit weaker than the second one so the most popular definition of very high is getting computers to do things that humans can do and the reason why this is popular is because humans are the most intelligent thing that we know in the universe and when we start to get machines to do things that traditionally only in the domain of human beings like understand natural language and recognize objects and images we then attribute that as being intelligence when we start to get some machines to do things that traditionally only the main domain of human beings we call that AI and the reason why I think that this is a bad definition is because benchmarking humans against machines is a silly a silly thing because humans can find patterns of about four dimensions if I throw a ball at you in five dimensions you're probably not gonna be able to catch it humans can no machines can find patterns in hundreds of thousands of dimensions if I asked you to solve problems beyond seven you're going to really struggle and computers can solve problems hundreds of thousands of different elements so benchmarking humans against machines I think is a weak definition the stronger definition of AI for me comes from the definite definition of intelligence is a very very elegant definition of intelligence which is goal-directed adaptive behavior goal-directed in the sense we're trying to achieve an objective we have an objective or an optimization problem we're trying to trying to achieve whether it's to root as its sell as many ice creams as possible or to allocate our staff as effectively as possible you have to have a goal behavior is how quickly and frictionlessly can I move towards that goal but the most important word in this definition for me is adaptive if your system is not making a decision and then learning about whether that decision is good or bad and then changing its own internal model of the world I would argue that it's not strong AI and I've seen very very very few enterprise systems in production are able to make a decision learn about whether that decision is good or bad and adapt its own internal model that for me is the true paradigm of AI systems that are able to adapt in milliseconds as opposed to months or years and with the project with PwC we've solved this component we've solved this we can optimize staff at scale and the next challenge is how do you then look at whether those staff will work well together whether they work well in teams work well with clients to then ultimately be able to optimize them better in the future so ultimately we want to build adaptive systems what a building adaptive systems it is extremely difficult and I think I'm gonna hand over now all right Thank You Daniel that's all right Daniel has talked about the enormity of the problems that are out there and Charlotte and I are gonna go into some depth about the enormity of the problem that we have solved and the thing that we took from an idea through proof of concept and I mean proof of concept we didn't actually know whether we could do it to pilot to production in the UK across our firm in two years and two months and I think you'll agree with me when when we're done that that was a terrific accomplishment and that's why I'm so proud of the entire team many of whom are here both from POC and satalia and will be available afterwards for the Q&A so the problem that we solved is this one so we solved the problem of scheduling over 4,000 people to over 8,500 projects or as we call them engagements in the UK firm and the good news about a constrained optimization problem is that when you solve it when you get it optimized not up to mole because you never you never get it perfect and you get to have more of all the things that you want and less of all of the things that you don't want so what we wanted is we wanted to maximize demand fulfilled we wanted as far as possible every single one of our projects to be fully staffed if possible we wanted to distribute the workload evenly amongst our people to improve their quality of life and their opportunities we wanted to minimize the travel time which is also a quality of life issue it's also an environmental issue it reduces our carbon footprint and it's just a cost unnecessary necessary travel is great we're all here unnecessary travel is just waste and the fourth one is actually really interesting Midway it wasn't one of the ones that we started out to solve midway through the project someone had the bright idea of adding this one I sorry I don't mean that sarcastically it actually was a bright idea and they said look there are gaps in the schedule there you know you know Susan is free half a day here Fred is free for two days there what if we could clump the free time and this was one of the things that we added that was incredibly successful we ended up with Charlotte was at 11:00 on average 11 weeks of free time as the single blocks of a week or more per person which was fantastic now it's a hard problem to solve not only because of all the permutations and combinations you're talking about but we also had a whole bunch of constraints now those of you who are the optimized optimization experts in the room will know that it's not really a clear binary thick line between whether something's an objective or constraint you can talk about some of them either way I'm not talking about that I'm talking about the way we understood the problem not the way it was implemented right so what we did is we said we want to accomplish these four things and at the same time we have to deal with all of the constraints we work in a number of regulated environments we have to conform with a whole bunch of regulations and laws we have a whole bunch of business rules that we've put into place to keep our quality where it needs to be to treat our people well etc and there are some things that are just a bad idea like putting me on an audit when I'm not an accountant I mean when I joined the firm eyes that was really worried about the the numeracy test that I had to take and my boss said don't worry don't let your team down but don't worry none of us have passed it so we had originally we thought there were 30 of these Charlotte will tell you more about how it ballooned so what we had to do with each one of them each objective at each constraint is we had to state that in English and we first thought there were 30 when we got into it we found that that the English wasn't that clear it wasn't rigor enough rigorous enough to build something around so the first part was simply getting the language really really accurate so that there were no contradictions and there are no gaps then for each one of the goals objectives our goals and objectives the same and constraints it had to be expressed mathematically that to be expressed in code and I'm going to click that so you can't take a picture because I don't think it's real anymore it's an old is an old version but every one of them had to do that and then of course all of those pieces of code had to work together so we did that and it worked in fact it's working right now we've just completed another cycle and is running as we speak I was in the office one day and someone came over and said David do you have a minute I want to show you something and they showed me this and it was really clever because we have lots of clever people and they do all kinds of clever things and they said we've created a game and the reason this is so clever is because it's really hard for us to understand the enormity of the problem Daniels thrown some numbers at you I've thrown some numbers at you but it's still really hard for us as people to understand how hard this problem is so this looks like a really simple problem you've got four people you've got one week you've got three locations okay and what you need to do is you need to make sure that every shift is assigned everyone gets a day off and everyone is qualified I looked at this and I said great idea to create a game great idea to help people understand what it is it's too simple they said try it it took me six minutes it's supposed to take two right I stared at the screen for three minutes trying to figure out what what what to do with it because there there are a bunch of things that make it non optimal that I'm not going to go into today but it was a massive experience for me to really understand how you know your rule about seven and most people when they play us it takes them two two and a half minutes I've seen one person do it in one minute the computer always does it in one second and it always gets the best result so the reason I wanted to talk about this is partly because it's a really good anchor to all those really big numbers that as daniel said we really don't understand but also because this was a game that we first modeled in Excel we then built it in Zink mini Zink Charlotte keeps me honest minis income Python in about two weeks so as much as there are a whole bunch of massive big complicated optimization problems that are out there that take the kind of effort we're talking about today there are also little ones that probably don't take a lot of time probably don't take a lot of effort and are probably worthwhile doing so to tell you how we got there I'm going to turn over to Charlotte someone who is one of the one of the many people who did all the real work and all the hard work please welcome to Charlotte burn so to take a look at our journey today and PwC Ensenada have been working together for over two years and it's been a really exciting and transformative journey for us as a business our project has gone through three main areas such as the proof-of-concept through two pilot through to a full production row light however over the two years there's been a number of other and stage gates and lessons learned for us some of which I'll take you through today so two years ago when we decided to work with satalia we knew we wanted to do something around workforce optimization what we weren't sure is what exactly we wanted to do so we brought them in and we started collaborating and running some workshops and understanding the art of the possible with their technology while also speaking to number of different areas in our business and understanding their processes and pain points from this we established some selection criteria over the complexity of the technology the impact we wanted to have and how difficult of a challenge we were willing to take on from this we picked an area of the business that was most there in terms of operational and data readiness but was also one of our most optimal areas of the business already which had a real challenge for us in being able to increase efficiencies but we thought if we're able to create efficiencies in this part of the business we'll be able to create it across our whole network once we decided on the use case we began carrying out research with two separate business units in our organization each business unit while they collaborate they work and operate somewhat independently and have their own kind of rules and procedures and ways of working and what we were trying to do is build a single solution to solve this problem from multiple so in doing this we needed to drive change trying to drive change in within areas of the business without having any benefits research or even knowing if it's going to really work at this point was a significant challenge going out of this research we captured about thirty of those constraints David spoke about and to bring into a proof of concept where we accounted for the business rules the operations and and and organization processes we applied weightings and prioritizations to each of these for a proof-of-concept we ran the schedules through our solution in parallel with the businesses usual manual process so that we would have a benchmark to begin being able to measure the opportunity at hand one of the key learnings from the proof-of-concept was the 34 the 30 rules that we had developed worse effectively not enough there is a number of nuances within the businesses that weren't clearly defined business rules or formal processes they were just simple ways of working and behaviors that we hadn't accounted for and once we accounted for these refine the solution and added more rules it took us from 30 to over 60 rules in our most latest release during the pilot when we were creating and through after the proof-of-concept was successful and it gave faith in the product and thought it was able to produce schedules that we were able to use within the business it also gave us something to begin to measure what success looked like we took this through to the pilot where we removed the manual business process for two business units which account for approximately 800 staff within our organization we ran these schedules and we run these schedules probably I think about 18 months ago and from this we took some key lessons one was the data and we integrated into over seven source systems and 100 data points a number of these data points are individuals within the organization were responsible for maintaining and when people are responsible for their own data and what you're inputting and quite often you're working with with incorrect or historical data but once the business and people on the ground realized the impact that this was having on their day-to-day lives where they were going to work the teams and portfolios work that they were getting and the quality of our data significantly increased overnight so after a successful pilot to two business units and eight eight hundred people we decided to challenge ourselves as a project team and go from two business units to four taking it from about 800 people to 1500 and we started refining the rules adding new parameters that we needed to and in order for being acceptable by the business and four months before go live we had a very senior and ambitious member of our team say we've done it successfully for - I don't want four let's go for thirteen taking it from 800 people to over four and a half thousand and with four months notice and no move in the go-live date so this was a real challenge for us in scaling off what we had built not just in terms of the business rules and parameters but the infrastructure we had built custom api's to pull all consume all of this data into the solution when you're pulling data for 800 people that's one thing but when you're scaling it overnight to four and a half thousand the number of data points we were pulling from and this had a significant impact and we had to refactor and parts of the code and all of the API is to ensure that we could consume it and how we needed and the challenge to roll a 213 business units was that we ended up rolling a 211 and this was because we felt that there were two that simply weren't there as we got closer to go live in terms of data and or operational issues some might see this as a slight failing however I see this as a success for us as a project we could have put those areas of the business live and through the tool but taking that understanding of the impact of the technology and what it will do to your organization and being able to decide when it's not right with something that we're quite proud that we took that call to do it and at the moment and back in the office we're doing a another annual planning process that's going live hopefully by the time I get off stage to another ten of our business units within the organization the future so what what are we planning to do moving forward in our collaborate with satalia and at the moment we're looking at how we can build a more dynamic real-time solution and that we can use that we can use on a daily basis to create updates to reflect the ever-changing dynamic and organization that we have a PwC walk an optimization do for you so what we've managed to solve over two years is an insanely large workforce optimization problem and that has taken by taking two years as you've seen from the from the tool that David showed in the game there's a number of much smaller problems in every organization taking Daniels rule of seven that AI and optimization can be used to solve so maybe for some of you here it might be useful to take away and start where we did back two years ago in those workshops and simply sitting down and analyzing your business and how it operates and trying to identify any areas of challenge and having a think if AI or optimization could solve some of these problems for you so that brings to an end our presentation for today but we will be here on stage I don't believe there's a talk after ours so if anyone has any questions and feel free to come up to us thank you you
