 [Music] hello everyone my name is rajan shep and i lead product management for ai and industry solutions here at google cloud thank you for joining us this year has been really hard for all of us but it's been really inspiring to see how people and organizations have been coming together to help each other during these times now as businesses start to refocus on the future and things start to improve we believe that many organizations and industries will be able to apply many of the lessons that they learn during these times as they build their businesses we're already working with many of you and are looking forward to working with all of you across industries to reimagine how we can successfully use ai to generate value for your business and we're at a very exciting point in time for ai i've said in the past that over the next decade every organization will be transformed with ai and today we're going to focus on the big question of how from working with top enterprises customers around the world we've learned that the how actually comes in two flavors first in solving common problems that businesses face these could be problems that are unique to your industry that we can solve by integrating into key workflows or they could be common problems across industries for example things like providing great customer service with your contact centers or keeping up with document heavy processes and the second thing is by equipping your teams to build the best ai solutions to solve your unique problems and so today i'm going to share about how ai is driving solutions to common problems and then i'll introduce one of our engineering directors ting liu to discuss how ai can solve your unique problems and throughout we're going to be sharing example stories of how customers are realizing value today so for those of you who are hands-on with the technology we're going to show you some cool improvements to our products and ways that you can make an impact with your companies for those of you who are trying to understand how ai can better be right for you we hope that we can spark some ideas about ways that you can be successful so before we get into the how i want to talk a little bit about the why why should you be thinking about ai and also why work with us on this so based on the trends we're seeing it's important to build out those ai solutions sooner rather than later the organizations that embrace ai will have a competitive advantage and the window for being ahead of the pack rather than getting left behind is closing mckinsey recently published a study saying that companies that fully absorb ai in their value-producing workflows by 2025 will dominate the 2030 world economy with a 120 increase in cash flow growth soon every organization will have an ai team just like we all built web teams back in the 90s and that makes the question of how we equip you even more importantly so to truly unlock the value of ai you first need to really focus on the business problem in not the technology and it really helps to work with companies that have already engaged with customers to deploy ai at scale so they can help you overcome the roadblocks that you're going to face in in the process that's why we're working so hard on this google cloud ai can help you with those roadblocks and we can partner with you to solve those identifying business problems there are really three reasons you should be thinking about google here the first is because of our leadership both in ai research through google research and also in practical applications of ai through google products large enterprises trust us to the advisors to their most critical transformation projects in addition to the innovations we're making on the software level we're actually innovating all the way down to the hardware for example we just delivered record-setting performance in six out of eight benchmarks in the latest round of the ml perf benchmarking released in july the second reason is that we bring our heritage and experience of deploying ai in production across google in products like google photos gmail and many more to help enterprises realize the value in ai our teams and ecosystems support the largest brands in the world to infuse ai in production to build new revenue streams and to drive operational efficiency and the third reason is trust from an enterprise and the trust that they are able to have with their employees and customers is a top priority for us we're driving leadership in responsible ai through ai principles and recommended governance practices are things that we are practicing internally and we're also working with customers on later king is going to share some examples of how customers are using the platform to identify and resolve complex issues things like bias in models during development in the evaluation phase so as i mentioned the first flavor of how organizations will be transformed with ai is through solutions to common problems so let's get started with our horizontal solutions and how business decision makers who care about how ai can use them to gain a competitive advantage and optimize their business operations the first solution that i'm going to talk about is context center ai we've taken our world-class conversational ai speech and natural language and we've applied it to the contact center space so that you can improve customer experience and operational efficiency at the same time you can try it for yourself with the multiple cci demos now available in our next on their demo area it first easily plugs into your existing workflows and we have full integrations with telephony providers like avaya cisco genesis twilio and 5.9 so that you can take advantage of your existing investments and relationships ccai also helps expedite customer requests through virtual agents it helps assist live agents and it also offers a layer of insights we're continuing to invest in ccii and today we're launching agent assist for chat in addition to voice interactions and we're also announcing the ability to create a custom voice that represents your unique brand now dialog flow is the technology that's the core of ccai today i'm excited to announce dialog flow cx this new version of dialogflow offers customers the best virtual agent tool on the market it's optimized for enterprises with large contact centers designed to support complex conversational architectures and it's truly omnichannel so you can build this once and deploy anywhere both in your contact centers as well as digital and social channels dialogflow cx is truly state of the art and will make it possible to give your end customers an improved experience with more intuitive conversations so one customer that's really redefining the possibilities of ai powered conversation using contact center ai is verizon i had a chance to sit down virtually of course with said the vet who's the executive director of customer service technology from verizon and i'm excited to share the conversation with you now thanks for being here today to share your experience i am looking forward to our conversation so first of all can you tell me a little bit about why you were considering this transition of using ai in your contact centers happy to be here and thanks rajan we at verizon have consistently focused on improving our customer experience and to that end have been leading the charge on digital transformation for a few years now we consider this transition as a way to improve our customers experience but we also realized that we had to find an efficient way to do that there are two areas that we focused on the customer facing experiences on digital chatbot and ivr and the agent-facing experience with assistant guidance capabilities we were looking to cloud ai to deliver a more consistent conversational experience for our customers and better equip our agents with the tools and information to support our customers so what were some of the key factors in your decision to select google in particular and contacts in your ai yeah we anchored on the two areas that i mentioned the customer facing digital experience and the agent experiences on the customer facing experiences our journey started several years ago as we look to enhance the support for our customers with the introduction of a chatbot as the bot evolved we saw a huge opportunity to take that experience to the voice portal and make it a great experience and also for our agents we saw agent assist was able to help our agents help the customers questions we evaluated several solutions over a span of two to three years and ultimately picked google for our contact center transformation program for a few key areas an advanced nlp synthetic voice that can help in the voice portal and ability to automatically create dialogues and lastly we also wanted to make sure that from a scalability standpoint that the partner that we chose is able to scale to our needs and that's where we thought google can come in and help us we've started the journey and we are seeing good results that's great and so what was the implementation like we had to look at several factors and we actually came up with a i would say a rather meticulous plan around it given the breadth of our customers needs we had to pick and choose the right use cases and on the technology side of the house we had to decide which experiences have systems already tied to it like do we need new apis to be created or if you can use existing apis so that was a big decision complex decisions had to be made when it came to measurements we had very stringent analytic requirements and lastly business continued to evolve which meant we had to continuously adjust the plan it was almost like they say you know building the engine while running it as well that makes sense so what kind of results have you seen so far after implementing ccai we are in the process of rolling it out to a wider scale but we've onboarded a few use cases already and early results are promising on the digital bot the auto dialog creation engine is able to create five times the depth of the conversation so it's a lot more on human-like and as a result of that customers are engaging with our bot lot better on the agent assist side about 30 percent of the agents have you started using the tool and we are seeing almost 75 percent of those agents giving us very high rating for the experience i mentioned these are early days but we're looking forward to more improvement in all our uh kpis so now as we look to the future what's your overall vision for customer experience we want to be sure that the customers have the best possible experience we can continue to improve and iterate on how customers and agents can reach the information they need quickly and easily to that end we are exploring additional ways our assistant can enhance the customer and agent interactions and bring the convergence of physical and digital channels together ultimately we want our customers to have the best experience and what they call as ambient experiences and that's our goal and that's what we're working on at verizon well thanks so much for your time today cyan i really appreciate the conversation thanks for the opportunity appreciate it it's so great to hear about the value that verizon is seeing earlier this year we had a chance to use contact center ai to help organizations that are overwhelmed with the influx of demand to their contact centers when we launched a rapid response virtual agent we made it possible to quickly build and implement a customized contact center ai virtual agent to respond to the common questions that people had due to covet 19 over chat voice and social channels so to learn more about ccai check out the ccai state of the union breakout the next horizontal solution i'm going to talk about is document ai document ai makes it possible to unlock insights from your documents with machine learning and use these to their fullest degree by extracting structured data from these unstructured documents customers are able to make better business decisions whether it's things like processing invoices more quickly and accurately knowing each of your customers or reducing things like mortgage processing time and many many other use cases one company that has reimagined their document strategy by leveraging document ai is the industry-leading mortgage services provider mr cooper they're challenged to manage domain-specific mortgage document types and they've classified over 100 million pages they've trained over 130 critical mortgage document labels and they've achieved over 92 percent accuracy in these classifications using doc ai they can trust their content will be accurately classified earlier this year we used the power of dot ai to help the response to kova 19. we developed the ppp lending ai solution to help lenders accelerate and automate processing loan applications for the paycheck protection program the document ai ppp parser api made it possible for lenders to help with the large intake of volume of ppp loan requests by using ai to extract critical information from the loan documents submitted by applicants we also released some exciting updates for document ai this year ranging from form parser which is a new way to extract text as well as spatial structures from documents to the invoice parser which is a specialized api that's highly accurate in processing invoices to learn more about document ai take a look at the document ai overview breakout or try the unlocking insights from document ai demo on the next on their site and also the demo for document ai on our website these horizontal solutions are solving problems that are common across industries but sometimes needs can differ and we need to consider industry-specific solutions as thomas mentioned in this opening keynote we're investing in specialized solutions across industries and have worked with customs like macy's fox and cardinal health in addition we expect that the movement to e-commerce will continue to accelerate with a consistent omni-channel experience moving from a nice-to-have to a must-have our customers are struggling to optimize their merchandising and supply chain as well as the product discovery to drive conversion we're building out solutions to address these needs including things like demand forecasting product search and recommendations ai in july we announced that the recommendations ai is now available in public beta and it's already being used by companies like sephora and haynes in healthcare cobit 19 has forced institutions to rethink how they can provide high patient-centered care outside of the traditional care settings we've seen and we expect to continue to see a huge uptake in the use of remote collaboration and telemedicine tools covet 19 has further highlighted the need for better infra interoperability of healthcare data to enable remote care as well as the ability to plan forward how healthcare organizations need to respond we formed a strategic partnership with mayo clinic combining our cloud and ai capabilities with mayo's clinical expertise to jointly develop solutions to transform healthcare in financial services we see a strong need to streamline processes particularly those with complex document management processes such as lending for example today we're excited to announce two new solutions designed to make this easier for financial services organizations the first is lending doc ai a solution built specifically to help financial institutions process mortgages more quickly and efficiently it automates many of the routine document reviews so people can focus on the more complex decisions the second is prepare to pay doc ai ai for procure to pay helps enterprises automate one of their highest volume and highest value business processes which is the procurement cycle we provide a group of ai powered parsers starting with invoices and receipts that take documents in a variety of formats and return cleanly structured data another area that companies like hsbc are starting to look at to transform and modernize is their end customers experience and also helping better manage risk and we're working with them on solutions like aml anti-money laundering and kyc know your customer in media and entertainment and gaming we see customers with a large amount of data and especially things like video and media files companies like fox sports are starting to use and make use of massive amounts of content and with their video content they want to make it possible to search and also do interesting work with that content in manufacturing we expect to see more distributed manufacturing lines and to make it safer for workers and also more efficient for organizations companies like kyocera are using our ai in defect detection and we're creating offerings like adaptive controls to drive energy efficiency and optimization in buildings and factories now that i've covered how ai can solve common problems that your business is faced with both problems that we see across verticals and those that are unique to your industry i'd like to pass it over to ting liu one of our amazing engineering directors to talk about equipping your teams to build the best ai solutions and to solve your unique problems thanks rajan as russian shared we recognize that there are unique business problems that you need to solve and we are invested in bringing you the best of google air technology so you can build solutions to solve those problems as well customers tell us that their teams working on ai are composed of various skill sets from ml engineers to data scientists to developers so we have built tools for everyone on your team i will highlight a few ways that we enable these different groups to build out unique ai solutions first ml engineers developing ml into production involves more than just building the model it involves data collection feature extraction resource management model versioning monitoring and much more the set of operations that require to deploy and manage production models is referred to as ml ops and it can easily become the bottleneck for an organization as they build more models we enable organizations to scale and streamline their ml development in a repeatable and reproducible manner with our ai platform today we are announcing new capabilities and services within our ai platform that will simplify ml ops starting with ai platform pipelines we announced a hosted offering for building managing ml pipelines on ai platform earlier this year we are pleased to now share that a fully managed service for ml pipelines will be available by october this year with the new managed service users can build ml pipelines using pfx pre-built components and templates that significantly reduce the effort required to deploy models today we offer a continuous evaluation service in our platform that samples prediction input and output from deployed ml models and helps users assign human reviewers to provide ground choose labels we are also pleased to announce a continuous monitoring service that will monitor the model performance in production to let you know if it's going stale or if there are any outliers skills or concept drifts this will simplify the management of models at scale and will be available to our users by the end of this year the next announcement is the foundation of all these new services our new ml metadata management service this lets ai teams track all the important artifacts and experiments they run providing a curated ledger of actions and detailed model lineage this will enable users to determine model provenance for any model trained on ai platform for debugging audit or collaboration our ml metadata service will be available in preview by the end of september our customers have told us how important ml ops is to them and we will continue to invest in mlr's capabilities such making it easy for customers to organize share and serve ml features at scale second we are improving the agility of ai data scientists and developers giving them one place to go with the ai platform today we are excited to announce that by the end of september the ai platform will include automl as an integrated function in the workflow this combines the best of no code and code based options to build custom ml models faster with high quality to hear a deep dive on this take a look at the creating value with ai platform breakout we also offer some tools designed for data scientists to give them the resources to achieve a competitive edge one example is notebooks which is now ga and we run the largest number of notebook instances in the world notebooks now supports important enterprise security features like vpc service controls access transparency and cloud iam and has a smart analytics framework to run spark jobs and manage hadoop clusters on dataproc we have also integrated kaggle kernels to our notebooks so kaggle users can now seamlessly move their notebook instance to ai platform for more compute and storage options third we continue to hear from customers and analysts that it can be a challenge to hire ai talent though we offer developers with limited ai expertise great tools through our platform such as pre-trained apis and other mail technology to enable an organization's existing teams non-ai experts to build ai applications with high quality and realize the value of ai both customers and analysts have highlighted our leadership in state-of-the-art models and we are continuing to invest in these models for instance we recently upgraded our ocr model which achieves high quality recognition as well as the automl image classification model customers are doing amazing things with these developer tools from making maintenance of their wind turbines safer by automating the evaluation of equipment to translating highly domain specific financial analysis as quickly as the markets move many organizations across regulated industries and those seeking hybrid and multi-cloud solutions have expressed interest in using our air technologies on premises last week we announced that our organizations can now use entos to enable stp capabilities on premises bringing our air technology to you in a more flexible way as organizations increasingly serve global users it becomes imperative to overcome language barriers and we at google have a long history of empowering users across the world through our technologies thousands of nations use our language and speech services to connect meaningfully with global users at scale with ease earlier this year we announced the media translation api which organizations can use to translate audio from streaming input in real time to provide a seamless experience for users one customer that's already started using this api is oneplus a large chinese smartphone manufacturer who is using it to provide real-time streaming translation for video chat to ensure their customers feel effortlessly connected one company that has been putting all of this together and using ai to build a more curated shopping experience for their customers is etsy their marketplace includes more than 65 million seller-generated listings they are using ai to build sophisticated workflows to help buyers find exactly what they are searching for and to deliver enriched recommendations that better reflect their buyers unique styles and tastes lastly across our portfolio we're committed to our investment in explainable ai and have been releasing things like feature attributions on ai platform prediction notebooks and automl tables in november last year we launched explainable ai and model cars this april we launched a new image attribution method called x-ray x-ray is a new way of displaying attributions that highlights which regions of an image most impacted the model instead of just individual pixels this means the air platform explanations now offer two methods for getting attributions on image models integrated gradients and x-ray we will continue to invest in explainable ai so that you can trust the platform and the solutions you build we're committed to continuing to build the best tools for all our users to solve your unique problems back to your writing thank you tay you know i remember 10 years ago brainstorming with some of my colleagues about what computing would be like in 2020 at the beginning of this next decade and we used to think about all kinds of crazy futuristic ideas like imagine if a computer can answer questions for you and help you find what you need imagine if a computer can help you do things that are right now manual and repetitive imagine if a computer can use all the information that you have to help you make a great decision at that time these all seemed like science fiction now this is a reality and we've seen this in action with many of the enterprises we work with and that you've heard about today but this is only the beginning of the transformation we're looking forward to helping you get value out of ai today we also want to partner with you to imagine what your business looks like next year in five years and in 10 years every organization will be transformed by ai in the next 10 years and the question that we all need to answer is how and how can we help [Music]
