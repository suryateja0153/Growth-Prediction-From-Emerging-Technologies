 A startup out of MIT CSAIL is working to make mass transit feel like teleportation. Think push a button, get a shuttle or bus. Routable AI is an on-demand vehicle routing and management platform. It offers a 10 times efficiency improvement routing on-demand shuttles and buses to take ride-sharing to the next level. You share your ride request. Routable AI optimizes the ride using specialized algorithms to calculate the most efficient route. And everyone enjoys lower wait times, cost, and reduced traffic. Drivers can give more rides and receive clear repositioning instructions when they are ready to start a new trip. The technology could significantly improve mass transit by making complex technology available to transit providers, ride-sharing companies, and more. Co-founder Alex Wallar first presented his algorithm in a 2017 paper, which showed that the algorithm could speed up service by 20%. And the number of taxis in New York City could be reduced from 14,000 to less than 3,000. In the face of COVID-19, routable AI adapted the algorithm to help hospitals and shelters allocate beds for those in need. Routable AI is one example of how research can move from academia to an industry application and across sectors. [music playing]
