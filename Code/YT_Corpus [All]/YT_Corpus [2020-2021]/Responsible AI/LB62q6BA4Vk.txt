 If there was one thing you would advise organizations to think differently about AI, what would it be? One thing, well I would say AI is not a hype. It's really real. It is there, it is achievable and it is already impacting a lot of people's lives. So if we think about the explosion of AI for global health in high income countries, we're seeing so many opportunities and so many diverse datasets, you know being able to leverage the use of wearables such as IoT devices, so many exciting trends. But what are the trends where you see the most relevance for low- and middle-income countries. The trends for low- and middle-income countries are pretty much the same, but the global health challenges we try to address currently are really unprecedented. We can really deliver health and care in the digital era and transform the way we do that thanks to all the possibilities there are. And I think AI is really the most promising revolution we see that can transform or reimagine the way we deliver health care around the world. But we know that in many cases actually it is the low- and middle-income countries that can be left behind and not really be able to leverage these technologies, so what do you see as the risks of that actually happening? So true, the low- and middle-income countries are those that can benefit most from it, from the digital revolution and the AI revolution, but are also at the biggest risk of being left behind and we have to work all together to make it happen that countries start to invest in the infrastructure for data and digital solutions, but not only in the infrastructure also in the capabilities to use that infrastructure then and to use the data to build beautiful AI solutions.
