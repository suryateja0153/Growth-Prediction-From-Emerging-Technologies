 when you look at technological development this is an ever ongoing thing and you always have to see what does a particular technology bring in terms of value not to quickly jump on every trend there is I mean we have seen many hypes in the last five years and not every hype not every new technology actually brings value to ports and terminals one thing we definitely see is the need to connect equipment assets people to systems to get our data to know what everything is doing where it is busy what our technical state is for instance to ensure that it becomes that the operational availability increases but also that people are out of harm's way think of geofencing solutions and they are communication technology whether it's Wi-Fi whether it's 4G or 5G what are other technologies to locate assets and people in a very precise way will have increased importance one of the challenges there is of course reception in an environment with a lot of steel a lot of reflections as we get higher and higher and we'll see stacks increasing in height we'll see even a trend of highway warehouses for containers coming I expect to see some upcoming press releases from various companies working on this making the application of that technology actually more complicated so there is quite some challenges and as we go from 3G to 4G to 5G it actually becomes more difficult because the technology is even worse in let's say travelling around corners so quite something also for the telecommunication companies and providers of those kind of technologies to provide solutions in a harsh and complex port environment with a lot of disruptions a lot of disturbances of signals
