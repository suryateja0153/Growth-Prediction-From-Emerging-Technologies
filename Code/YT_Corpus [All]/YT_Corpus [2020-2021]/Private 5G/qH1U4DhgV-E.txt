 the oppo reno 3 and oppo reno 3 pro look incredible and I'll be sharing all the details right after this if you're new here I want to stay up to date with the latest tech please hit subscribe followed by the Bell so oppo are going to be launching at the Reno 3 5g on the 26th of December this year and that's going to be alongside the Oppo Reno 3 Pro we've now had plenty of leaks including benchmarks and specs so we'll be covering all of the details today we'll start with the cheaper model the oppo reno 3 5g the oppo reno 3 5g will feature a full screen display but unlike the pro it's going to be sporting a water drop not the display is reportedly going to be six point four inches it will be an AMOLED display with a resolution of 1080 by 2400 and that's going to provide a density of 411 pixels per inch it's expected to be a 90 Hertz display protected by Gorilla Glass 6 and it will come up with an in display fingerprint scanner the selfie camera will reportedly be a 32 megapixel shooter with a wide-angle lens and an aperture of f28 we're expecting eight gigs of ram up with the choice of 128 or 256 storage but unlike the pro which we'll be using the snapdragon 765 g the ocarina 3 is going to be using it the mediatek mt6752 set the oppo reno 3 5g has appeared in a benchmark showing a score of three hundred and seventy nine thousand eight hundred and thirty nine in antutu well this score is higher than the likes of the redmi k 30 pro in the vivo x30 pro their scores are actually average scores so we need to remember that this is a single scoring and the average scores are always lower it's still however looks like promising results for the device we also had a leaked screenshot for the oppo reno 3 5g that revealed that the phones gonna be fitted with a camera capable of images of six thousand nine hundred and twelve by 9216 resolution and an aperture of f-18 this of course indicates that the phone's going to be equipped with a sixty-four megapixel primary sensor and people are speculating that it could be Samsung's gw1 the phone is expected to have a quad camera setup but with the additional ultra wide time-of-flight sensor and Mac Rowlands battery capacity is expected to be four thousand milliamp hours and it will have a Buch flash charge for and it's gonna ship with Android ten in the form of color OS it should be launching in a blue and white color and we're expecting it to also retain that the three and a half mil audio jack and when it comes to launch who are expecting the launch price to be around four hundred dollars we also have the more expensive oppo reno 3 Pro 5g reports are suggesting that the oppo reno 3 Pro is coming with a 6.5 inch AMOLED display it's going to have a full HD plus resolution of 1080 by 2400 and this gives us a four hundred and five pixels per inch an aspect ratio of 20 by nine and it's reportedly gonna have a 90 Hertz refresh rate the phone is going to have an in display fingerprint scanner and it's going to be protected up by Gorilla Glass six the selfie camera is going to be a punch hole selfie camera and this is expected to be a 32 megapixel sensor for the rear cameras it's reportedly going to be different than the standard oppo reno 3 we expect the same 64 megapixel primary sensor but for the quad camera set up on the oppo reno 3 Pro we're expecting a 13 megapixel telephoto an 8 megapixel ultra wide and a 2 megapixel time-of-flight sensor so the main difference is here being that the pro has a telephoto lens in place of the macro when it comes to hardware we're expecting the oppo reno 3 Pro to be the first phone powered up by the new snapdragon 7 6 5 G system on chip we're expecting this to be coupled with eight gigs of RAM and again a choice of 128 or 256 storage this will unfortunately be ufs 2.1 however the vice president also confirmed on Twitter that the oppo reno 3 Pro has a 4050 milliamp hour battery with VOOC for flash charging in it's of course gonna ship with Android 10 in the form of color OS both SIM slots on the oppo reno 3 pro will apparently support 5 G as well we're expecting the 128 gigabyte version to launch at four hundred and sixty nine dollars with the 256 512 and of course with the launch being in December it won't be long until we have all the details and of course we're also expecting this standard Reno three 5g to be lost alongside this device as well as the opera no three we had more exciting news from Oppo yesterday opera revealed a new prototype phone with an in display camera and no physical ports the prototype shown had no visible seems ports or openings even for its charging well this is great it of course restrict users to wireless charging only so it won't be suitable for everyone well there weren't any videos documenting this event we did of course have Oppo showcase there in display camera sensor a few months ago so we know they've been working on this technology for a while given that they continue to show off their prototypes it's suggesting it that maybe we could see something concrete from them next year not only did they showcase their in display camera but they also announced we have an upcoming Oppo folding phone but the other folding phones we've seen it's also going to have an adaptable OS that changes depending on how the user wants its orientation and it's gonna be interesting to see their take on a foldable phone unfortunately they didn't give anything away on design or specs we didn't get to see the device either so it's still very unknown right now of course as any more information comes to light about any of these devices I'll be sharing with you guys straight away but as always I'd like to know your thoughts in the comments who out there is waiting for the oppo reno 3 and are you waiting for the oppo reno 3 or the oppo reno 3 pro 5g and when it comes to folding phones what do you think operas design will be but thanks for watching the video if you liked it smash a thumbs up if you didn't hit the thumbs down twice and I'll see you guys in the next one
