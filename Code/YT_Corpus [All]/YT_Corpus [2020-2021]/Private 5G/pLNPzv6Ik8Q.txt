 today we're reviewing the google pixel 4a  5g and that's coming up right after this. If you're new here and want to stay up to date  with the latest tech please hit subscribe followed   by the bell you can also keep up on facebook,  instagram & twitter by clicking the links in   the description. so after plenty of uncertainty  throughout the year we now have the google pixel   4a 5g to review now this review is for you guys  and after a week of use it's time to tell you   the good and the bad before we get started though  please like the video if you're a fan of google   let me know in the comments what device you're  watching this video on but the pixel 4a 5g is here   and to be honest it's better than i expected  it to be it's been a very different strategy   for google this year and i think it is actually  for the best they're now using the pixel to try   and cater for the whole of the smartphone budget  range from the pixel 4a at the bottom end the 485g   in the middle and then we've got the pixel 5 at  the top thanks to the changes though it's now   easier than ever to pick the right pixel for you  and today i'm going to try and help you do that   we start off with the unboxing it's the same  packaging that we used to and no different to   any of the other recent pixel if we open it up we  first get the pixel 4a 5g and i have to say it's   a great looking device although the bezels  are slightly thicker than that of the five   next we've got the manual along with the sim tool  followed by the power plug usb cable and usb-a   to usb-c adapter the usb-c cable what makes life  incredibly easy is you can connect your new pixel   to your old android smartphone and it's going  to transfer over all of your apps your data   and your passwords all you need to do on your new  pixel 4a 5g is simply put in your google password   if we take a look at the design first you  can see we've got a full screen display   and then we've got the punch hole selfie camera  in the top left the thing i like here is just how   thin the bezels are although unlike the pixel 5  there is a larger chin at the bottom than the top   so they aren't symmetrical all the way  around if that is something that bothers you   we get a 6.2 inch oled display with a full  hd plus resolution of 1080 by 2340 and an   aspect ratio of 19 and a half so this gives us 413  pixels per inch it's a 60 hertz always on display   with hdr support and one million to one contrast  ratio and is protected by gorilla glass 3 it's a   full 24 bit color depth with 16 million colors  so it provides us with a bright vibrant display   experience that we've pretty much grown to expect  from any smartphone the punch hole in the top left   is for an 8 megapixel selfie camera it's a fixed  focus 1.12 micrometer sensor with an aperture of   f 2.0 it's got an 83 degree field of view and it's  actually the same selfie camera you'll find on the   4a and the pixel 5 and actually the whole of the  pixel range this year have many specs in common   on the back the most notable change is of course  the return of a physical fingerprint scanner i'm   incredibly happy to see this return and it just  makes unlocking the phone so much easier i can   press the button the phone unlocks in seconds and  there's no hassle at all with the 3d face unlock   and the solid radar chip in the pixel 4 and the  4xl were a good idea in theory in practice they   just didn't work no apps really adopted the new  technology and all it really did was took away the   biometric security from many of our favorite apps  the fingerprint scanner is indented so we can find   it easily it works every time and it works quickly  you'll also notice we're back to a dual camera   setup along with the led flash now the main sensor  is a 12.2 megapixel and 1.4 micrometer sensor it's   got dual pixel phase detect autofocus optical and  electronic stabilization it's got an aperture of f   1.7 and also a 77 degree field of view now i could  praise this camera before i'd even use the phone   as it's actually the same primary camera we had in  the pixel 4 the 4xl the 4a and even the pixel 5.   now while many might complain that that's lazy  and they did want to see a new camera in actual   fact there's not really any need compare the pixel  phones to another camera phone on the market and   they do still do a great job they're consistently  praised for good photography so there's no need to   change something that works and something that  works very well great news for me however is   that the secondary camera unlike the telephoto  we saw in its predecessor is our 16 megapixel   one micrometer ultra wide camera it's got a 107  degree field of view and an aperture of f 2.2   and this allows us to get our 0.6 times zoom while  some people do prefer the zoom i much prefer the   wide angle as i think i can zoom in post and to  be honest zooming on a smartphone just doesn't   tend to work full stop the camera allows for 4k  video at 30 or 60 frames a second and we get 1080p   at 30 60 120 or even 240 for those who care about  dimensions it's 144.7 by 70.4 by 8 millimeters and   it weighs 151 grams we get 8 gigabytes of ram with  gig storage which while it doesn't seem like much   google do give you the option for unlimited photos  in google photos as long as you store them at high   quality and this is free for all pixel users it's  all powered by a snapdragon g which is slightly   better than the 4a 730 now the 765g is a fully  capable chipset and it's plenty powerful enough   for general use and of course all of your  photography and for those casual gamers you're   still able to play all of the latest 3d games and  it just helps bring the cost down for google which   makes a cheaper phone for you well it is a little  bit faster than the pixel 4a chipset to be honest   there isn't really that much in it apart from  of course this chipset has the advantage of 5g   onto the 5g it supports sub 6 gigahertz  bands but it doesn't support millimeter wave   and it of course will support the usual lte  bands and lower now while i would have loved   to have given you a 5g speed test at this point  unfortunately my network doesn't give me 5g   so i cannot do it now battery capacity for this  is 3885 milliamp hours and it supports 18 watt   fast charging but there's no wireless charging  personally i was hoping for a little bump in fast   charging is this is the same as the predecessor  but we've also got extreme battery saver on the   pixel 4a 5g so you've got a normal battery  save and then if you need it you've got the   extreme battery save which basically stops most  of your apps and it even slows down the processor   now this can supposedly deliver up to 48 hours  battery life but i haven't had a chance to fully   test it yet we've got stereo speakers thanks to  a cool speaker and a bottom firing speaker here   and i actually prefer the speaker on the 4a5g than  i do to the pixel 5. if i listen to them both side   by side then they are very similar but the pixel  4a 5g actually sounds slightly better than the 5.   now there's not much in it and i think what it's  actually down to is the pixel 4a 5g has a larger   body than the five and this might be helping with  sound production it's gonna be interesting to   see if anyone else shares this opinion but to be  honest as i said it's very close and i would say   they're just average mobile speakers they're not  bad but they're also nothing special the pixel 4a   5g has dual microphones for video recording and  calls so the additional microphone helps to get   better audio and also helps with noise suppression  we've of course got bluetooth 5 dual band wi-fi   and the pixel 5 it comes with android 11. when it  comes to general use it's great it gives us the   stock android experience we're used to in a much  improved body it's fast and responsive although   it is only a 60 hertz display and it's great that  we don't get all of the bloatware that you would   find in many other manufacturers firmware for your  general use in even gaming it's going to work very   well and because it's google we get at least three  years of software updates and that is guaranteed   now most of you watching this video  have probably used stock android before   so you know the good experience it brings but  the most important thing to most people here is   going to be the camera and as you might expect  it's incredible it gives us the beautiful pixel   photography that we're used to and it's no  surprise that given the same primary cameras   of course software updates do continue to improve  that performance so we will be taking a look on   here we can go from 0.6 times zoom all the way up  to seven times zoom using the slider in the camera   app and this works for both picture and video now  as we've got an ultra wide instead of a telephoto   this is unfortunately all digital zoom as most of  you guys that know that watch a lot of my videos   i hate digital zoom so i won't be using it but if  you want to see why this is the reason we zoom in   we lose all detail we get camera shake and it  looks more like a painting on the other side of   that i am a huge fan of this 0.6 times ultrawide  personally i always need more in the frame while   other phones out there are giving you three four  five or even six different cameras i think pixel   have the right idea give us two cameras but make  them good now i've only had this phone for about a   week but as you can see the quality of the photos  is great and no different to any of the others   we get great dynamic range we've got more natural  color tones and incredible sharpness and detail   i've taken loads of photos in daylight and night  and you can see the high level of detail and   colors and they're actually true to form as in  what i saw in real life and not oversaturated   as i've said i stay away from the zoom and  personally if you do want to use some zoom   then i'd suggest doing it in post as it's  no different to using the digital zoom   on the pixel 4 a5g we've got the live hdr plus  with exposure controls so this means that what   we see in our viewfinder is exactly what the image  is gonna look like so we know before taking the   photo i've even tried some close-up shot for  those of you that may be missing a macro lens   and as you can see it's even done a great job here  we've got great focus all round although there is   a little bit of loss away from the center when it  comes to the portrait bokeh shots it's also done   an incredible job here and really found at the  edge of the subject we've got all of our in focus   and a nice clean cut blur background the great  thing about the pixels is that as well as giving   us this bokeh image we also get the standard  unblurred image and can switch between the two   next we move on to the nighttime photography  and google's night shot mode is incredible   it really brightens up the images and gives us  better qualities than we'd even be seeing with   our eyes the downside is it takes a little bit  longer to shoot the photo but only a few seconds   now the light mode really does make it look like  you've taken a picture with a huge flash or you're   holding some sort of huge light and it brightens  things up without noise this video here shows you   the area i was in and actually the light level  that i was seeing and you can see it is very   hard to see you can see from all of the night  sight photos though there's a huge difference   between normal and night mode and it brings in so  much light in detail and surprisingly there's not   really any noise that you'd expect from adding  this much brightness when it comes to video   it also has great performance here it gives us  incredible detail natural looking videos and great   stabilization best of all we've now got 4k  videos at 60 frames a second even on the 4a 5g   but you can see from the video that everything  stays nice and in focus there's no camera shake   even while i'm walking and again while recording  videos that we can change between 0.6 to 7 times   zoom and it's great that we can switch between  lenses while recording and it does it in a   relatively smooth fashion unfortunately for  those that wanted to in the standard camera   while you're recording you can't then switch to  the selfie camera you do have to stop the video first give it away now when it comes to the 765g chipset many seem  to think that you're not going to be able to game   but they're actually wrong phones have become  very powerful these days and while you won't see   the same high scores in synthetic benchmarks and  you'd get for something like an 865 in real world   use they're great even for gaming i first tested  it with pubg mobile went straight into settings   turned up the graphics and the frame rate to high  as that's all of the game supports at the moment   and there would no need to make any changes from  this as when opening it up it plays perfectly   as you can see it runs perfectly smooth runs great  this is expected because i did this on the 5 and   it's the same chipset again i installed  call of duty mobile put it on max detail   there was no need to change anything as the  game looks great and it runs buttery smooth   i like the punch hole camera being in the  top left again because it's not noticeable   my hands actually covering it up most of the time  and it just makes it for a pleasant experience   finally we head to asphalt 9 where again it  worked perfectly in full detail but i have to   say there was a little bit of frame drop and i  had this on the pixel 5 and the 4a as well so i   was expecting this when i drop it down to medium  it runs much better this frame rate is higher   but again it was a little bit different as i  just come off a 90 hertz display you do notice   that 60 hertz experience now for those of you  who do care about synthetic benchmarks i ran it   through geekbench 5 where we got a single core  score of 598 and a multi-core score of 1 623   to put that into perspective the 5 scores 585  single and 1563 multi the 4a got 551 single   and 1651 multi and finally the pixel 4 xl gets  706 single 2 354 multi now of course the pixel 4   xl going to top the list because of the snapdragon  855 and some of you may be wondering why this 4a5g   gets a higher score than the 5. well i think the  reason is because they're both the same resolution   they both got the same chipset but this is a  60hz display whereas the pixel 5 is 90 so i'm   assuming the pixel 5 is needing more power for  those frames and where it's losing its score   now battery life for the phone is great some worry  about smaller batteries but it easily lasted me   the day with general use and with 18 watt quick  charging it doesn't take long to charge back up   when i go walking as i always tell you guys  i use two separate apps one to guide me one   to record my walk and both are using gps  on top of that and taking lots of photos   i haven't needed to use battery save or extreme  battery save but i'm glad that there is a backup   now overall it's an incredible device and while  i do like the pixel 4a 5g i think the pixel 5   is the right choice for me i like the size of the  pixel 4a 5g and i actually prefer it to the 5 but   i've just gotten so used to 90 hertz displays and  wireless charging that i would be stuck without it   of course it's now great that there really is a  pixel for everyone so if that's not the case for   you it doesn't matter we're now at a stage where  there are so many pixels and they are all quite   similar so while it may get confusing i'm going  to quickly break it down if we look at the pixel   4a the 4a 5g and the pixel 5 they will have the  same primary sensor so they're all going to take   very similar photos and the only difference is the  4a has the single camera whereas the 485g and the   pixel 5 have the dual cameras now the 4a is at  the bottom pricing at 350 pounds or 350 dollars   but it's incredible value for those who want  a cheap phone that still takes good photos   we've then got the pixel 4a 5g at 499 pounds  or 499 dollars and then finally you've got the   pixel 5 which is 599 pounds or 699 dollars now  between the 485 g and the 5 there are only a   few differences while there are a few creators  dismissing the 5 as i said i do quite like it   the 485 g has the 6.2 inch display over the pixel  5 6 inch and that is an advantage for me but   apart from that the pixel 5 you get a 90 hertz  display you've got gorilla glass 6 instead of   this gorilla glass 3 you get wireless charging and  reverse wireless charging and it's also ip68 water   resistant whereas the 485g is not that being said  especially in the usa with 200 cheaper it is a big   saving going for the 4a5g so if those features  don't appeal to you then definitely go for this   so that's pretty much it for today's video i mean  the links to this are down in the description   below but as always i'd like to know your thoughts  in the comments who out there is going to order   a pixel and if not what phone are you waiting for  but thanks for watching the video if you liked it   smash the thumbs up if you didn't hit the thumbs  down twice and i'll see you guys in the next one you
