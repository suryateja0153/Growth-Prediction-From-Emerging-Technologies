 Hello and good found me on our YouTube channel Today we will talk about the King of Specifications and the so-called King Me because Samsung was thinking about putting the best data transmission technology on the best of the trick Storage space to say and in the head and Very much RAM in a mobile device And it&#39;s called the s20 ultra 5 Let&#39;s see what this is and of course To tell you impressed And I&#39;m not from this device In addition to the phone in the box we find a charger 5 wo pair of headphones USB type c branduite akg And the charging cable and And transfer data from USB type c On USB type c The hardware part of Samsung did not rush and crammed into everything he had better A dynamic windmill screen of 6.9 features 2k resolution plus aspect 2 20 per 98 density to envy 511 pixels per inch The display is hdr10 plus compatible and supports a refresh rate of 120 pounds In full HD resolution And 60 maps in 2k resolution processing power is provided by an exynos chipset 9 990 on seven nanometers plus the current model has 128 GB of storage space And a huge capacity of Aram 12 gigabytes Instead, these specifications can go up to 512 GB internally And the aberrant amount of 16gb rum It&#39;s good with all that processing power you could say that you have a haircut for the next 2 3 or maybe I can Four years because if you look at the evolution of the Android system over the last three years, it&#39;s not good So Suddenly I would tell her so I mean if you have a 3gb Ram phone and a cent processor You could do multitasking between Facebook WhatsApp social networks something Netflix youtu Phoebe Greek music Summer ogyoutube music plus messages calls notes and so on without any Problem Maybe you&#39;ll feel like one Little lake On an older processor like the snapdragon 810 but I doubt it Because if you reset the phone And installing the applications on the clean lets you do it The last ups and downs he has and so on Note that this is not a bad phone Now let&#39;s talk about other interesting things that Samsung has Like Gorilla Glass 6 face to face on the back Dressed up With aluminum frame Which gives it an added elegance Because glass plus aluminum The perfect recipe for some time now we also have ip68 protection To water and And dust on the battery side we A huge capacity 5,000 milliamps Supports Power delivery 3.0 And reverse charge Novaci so practical I charge my cell phone from this phone The Novaci Which means I just have a pretty interesting thing It&#39;s a device that has it all And if You ask me what&#39;s missing Missing 3D touch The one he had now I have some versions On the home button And she was doing it. Why don&#39;t you have a jack on With amazing experience of use but do not put it in Faget Boot I call you in the car I have an old car and for a long time I do not have bluetooth nor do I have an FM modulator an auxiliary cable There of poverty I have And I have a very expensive phone which is probably more expensive than the car anyway but after I want to listen to the music Poke and I are there At least with the doctor&#39;s hand I do not like this And somehow if they had And the jack plug seemed to me Phone overkill Burning movie everyone and Future proof for two to three light years You would also like to emphasize that Samsung DEX It works extraordinarily well on this device But the fact that it is a glass device Very big Massive Weigh somewhere 222 g It&#39;s good It&#39;s very shiny And it slips And then you run the risk of escaping very easily so I recommend Not just buy a bag, buy a sock bag on this phone because I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be sorry if you get off the ground and you can Something These are the first impressions I had about Samsung From my point of view not the overkill phone It is now what They tried ASUS To deal with that gaming phone instead, that was in another area A different Market another user area and of course with another target You 20 It may of course be oriented towards gaming as well And to the office and And to home use And to Whatever everyone can use a s20 It doesn&#39;t scream gaming Instead it&#39;s as big as a ping pong palette and will break your pocket in two Both literally and figuratively As for the software Samsung has not made much difference in the meanwhile fool us with some Live wallpaper that are washed through on this disc Positive and showing as much aesthetics as possible Of course we also have an ultra Sonic fingerprint sensor under my belt It is similar to the one found Note 10 S10 S20 And so brother that it&#39;s an Ultra sensor Sonic&#39;s not a sensor Standing but not as fast as a classic sensor capacity Let&#39;s see, too And what software do we have Obviously we have Android 10 What are we doing, Bob? Phone The informative software One my 2.1 Android 10 What the And Security match on March 1, 2020 So we have slim Quality recently As for safety with this It&#39;s good I shouldn&#39;t Let it be a problem Let&#39;s go too Geekbench 5 History Let&#39;s see, too Lying down 945 points in singles with times and 2832 Points in Multicor Look here I wanted to get a juice You know that Samsung is launching on the market A snapdragon version and an Etno version It&#39;s good If you search the internet Because I don&#39;t Handheld right now Cystone s20 ultra with snapdragon you will notice that Some differences between Sexy nose Snapdragon Of course in the user experience Sound everyday life Let&#39;s just say that The difference will not be observed but on paper and in synthetic tests You will always notice a difference between Sip the satire of Samsung versus Sets from somebody It&#39;s a different thing more An aroma We are saying as Americans say but it is not a bad thing but when I pay a lot of money For a device Why one works better We&#39;re going further I&#39;m trying to say that So none of them go wrong in the end It&#39;s just an observation you shouldn&#39;t worry about In the idea of Something happened with the needles Good on the connectivity side we also have XD wifi So the new technology is faster than the needles That means the obvious dual band 5g Health and so on We have NFC Bluetooth 5.0 and And of course Dudu It also works in low energy OTG And on the connectivity side Invited in what What about USB We have 3.2 Ipc It is And faster than 3.0 or 3 Point not though In very little Trouble I saw phones with 3.01 Most have The second conversion of Bidam is finally questionable because you do not stay up all day To transfer data from the phone laptop Best option This way, on the other hand, it will help you a lot when you use it The obvious DEX we Akg tuned speakers One of them is Here at the bottom We have a grid Its main fox and at the top where the call speaker is It is dubbed Speaker Case So we have an arrangement Esthero this quality Very good to the speakers altogether if you are thinking, this is a phone with absolutely nothing Special It just has species Daughter&#39;s aunts Somewhere in the stratosphere it leads Well, that&#39;s the equivalent of the mountain Cell phone why it has Top specifications to the maximum How much And in terms of size Nothing thinks on a phone so big that it&#39;s right is thicker than A traditional phone but Still if If you think about it Here&#39;s how it looks in comparison With a IPhone XS Max with everything With the cover I already have a holster Skin laid On the phone It&#39;s neither very thick nor very thick Thin and look how Looks like size Remember the old Galati A9 from 2008 The first 4-room phone was an act Order DEX Expensive for Nothing at all Special Here&#39;s what Galati looks like A9 long S20 Ultra Basically it is About the same Pension but with a larger screen and of course with a thickness consider If you could get used to it Such a With those who have it Or finally the size Of course a phone in the 71st area Because those are How big Even if we have 6.9 inches diagonally and entering the phablet area the advantage is that we have These Edges Very very Very below As the last addition We still have here Punch hole that hides the selfie camera Obviously the selfie camera is not extraordinary And the cameras on the back but it has some species And the daughter of your top 40 namely Megapixel f 2.2 and is capable of being movie 2160p 30 compared to the rear cameras The selfie room is in the kindergarten We call it that Why Because the sensor And on him off Back It is 108 m Let&#39;s talk about the room too Main of this phone Use Nona technology well It&#39;s basically a term Invented by Samsung home and name the new arrangement Pixel why It&#39;s good so far one normal Quad beer was using Two on two pixels That&#39;s what they used 4 pixels To make a pixel Big With correct information Samsung uses a 3-in-3 arrangement 3 in length 3 in width This means 9 pixels Which are used To create a Larger pixel With a brightness Good and of course A level of detail And That&#39;s right Titu&#39;s bigger in what it means The information is received Received from the outside Now let&#39;s talk about that too Main specifications 108 megapixels f1.8 Then we have a room with Paris It is 48 mg XL f3.5 The phone is a room Optical Zoom 5X Or hybrid Zoom 10x Twelve Mega Selly f 2.2 A super Wide room With super steady video technology So you can practically shoot The room Super yps landscapes Without making your picture like that Food Shaking hand Winter in the mountains He dies of cold Further we still have a room of 0.3 mg Pixel and that room you It&#39;s a tymo Flight camera It basically helps you for To create the effect Depth Let&#39;s talk too And about the quality of it Phone Photo quality and Here Omnis doubt And I&#39;ll show you Ten friends doubt Obvious I was shot How many cadres with him And I noticed a certain behavior of the room Behavior I encountered in the 20th century In contrast, I did not meet at s 10 and here I am not talking about About quality About How good the photo looks About that Sometimes The room It tends not to hit the white balance In the conditions where you sleep a bit the phone The image becomes either yellow or very cold blue And I don&#39;t exactly understand Why he does so Working rooms is capable of capturing a fairly high level of detail In sincere exchange As long as I have Tansa It did around this room I was expecting to get behind in a big way compared to the S10 clearly see some improvements The colors are vivid Very well reproduced and in combination with the phone display you have a Samsung experience However, I noticed some behaviors that they were not very pleased to meet The camera tends to over-expose the subject when the light falls directly on Asu On Yar, this is remarkable in direct sunlight You have to use Edge compensation Say it to balance it properly The frame a second behavior It is observable when you want to capture a rich frame of detail And textures The room makes the clergy in the Focus area and around you can see The effect And what about white pumping or better said Blur In contrast, if the subject is in the Focus area The room will capture details Surprising and the effect of the blur will highlight You The point of interest of the framework Overall it is a very good room And worthy of a flex and 2020 And I could say yes It can be beaten in the yard and Mate 30 pro and With iPhone It&#39;s good marketing says 100x Well Zuzu Practically There are 10x Hybrid zoom Because we use that room Telescope in combination With a zoom Digital But the moment it passes And by 30 x the law of fridays The details are very noisy It gets lost and of course you will have to use a tripod Because if you moved p The room You&#39;ll see with How they tremble Basically yoongi Micu more yesterday a Iager thibaut look what What can he do But in terms of technology It&#39;s good to see Of the step they have Made Samsung This omission is fine you must You give yourself credit Because he hasn&#39;t seen it like that before That&#39;s something Where Mobile device And here I am talking Simply From the perspective A sensor Which is How much Manga But that&#39;s not all for You that Samsung s20 ultra does not get rid of so easily will You will have to compare it too iPhone And with Google pixel With Huawei Mate And let&#39;s see Why is he and To be honest I was thinking there are comparisons Sleeping mini Note 10 And he has a room Pretty good And In her turn Pretty Flexi Obviously none of them It&#39;s rooms Does not have That technology That&#39;s it I&#39;m curious In the mode Standard The level of detail That&#39;s who I am Until next time Do you know what to do Do not forget to Check by Description for useful links and
