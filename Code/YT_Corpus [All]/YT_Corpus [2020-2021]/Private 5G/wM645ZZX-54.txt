security measure   before we get started though please like  the video if you're a fan of samsung   let me know down in the comments what device  you're actually watching today's video on   so the first news of today is about the release  date of the samsung galaxy s21 we've had many   reports saying it's coming early this year and it  now looks almost certain that the phone is going   to be coming in january route my galaxy uncovered  a listing in the database of an indian regulator   for a samsung device with the model number smg991b  which according to all of the info we've had so   far is for the standard galaxy s21 as we know with  these things when certification starts to appear   it means the launch is fast approaching now next  up we've got news about the galaxy s21 displays   there are many out there who are still claiming  that they're all coming with curved displays   but that's not actually the case the standard s21  and the galaxy s21 plus are going to have flat   displays while the ultra is the only one in the  series to come with a curved display ice universe   further backed this up a couple of days ago when  he told us that we do have flat displays on the   s21 and the s21 plus he states they've already  been trial produced so there's just no way that   they're going to further delay by changing the  screens and as we've got certification coming   through now it means that they are set on the  design and hardware and are ready to launch or   they wouldn't have certificated now in these  times there are a lot of new leakers that have   no track record and they are making unrealistic  claims so just be careful when you do see these   next up we've got a brand new leak about biometric  security on the galaxy s21 and it's a very   interesting one at that while many do not seem to  be a fan of bixby samsung are now reportedly going   to be using it for a voice biometric system it's  going to be part of the new assistant in something   they're calling bixby voice now bixby voice is  going to allow users to unlock their galaxy s21   by saying hi bixby voice biometrics seem to be  relatively safe considering many banks use this   form of security on their phone services and  while we did see this in the past it actually   disappeared now given the current situation where  masks are causing a problem for face unlocks   and also as we approach the colder weather gloves  can stop fingerprint unlocks as well then voice   biometric security could be very useful of course  while it is secure it also has some huge flaws   for instance if someone has a voice recording  of you then it can be used to unlock the device   but realistically it's not a bad method for those  that want it for the time being it's reportedly   going to be exclusive to the galaxy s21 but as  usual it's expected that over time this is going   to be added to the older devices in the range  as it's just a software update and no additional   hardware is required now we've pretty much had the  full leak of specs and design for the whole of the   galaxy s21 series so for those interested we're  going to run through them now to help you decide   if this is the right phone for you for my regular  viewers you guys have already seen this so just   jump to the next video but if you're new here  then hit subscribe now and we'll get right into it   so first up we've got the galaxy s21 this is  the smallest of the range and of course the   entry-level model it comes with a 6.2 inch dynamic  amoled display with an expected resolution of 1440   by 3200 and this gives us 563 pixels per inch and  it of course comes with an in-display fingerprint   scanner it's going to be a flat 120hz ltps display  and it's not going to be capable of 120 Hz at a   quad hd plus resolution we get a triple camera  setup consisting of a 12 megapixel main sensor   a 12 megapixel ultrawide and a 64 megapixel  telephoto camera it's powered by the five   nanometer snapdragon 875 in north america and  the exynos 2100 globally and they're both going   to be 5g compatible we're expecting similar ram  and storage configurations to the predecessor so   this is going to be roughly 8 gigs of ram with 128  storage and expect micro sd support it's powered   by a 4 000 milliamp hour battery with 25 watt fast  charging support it's coming with 5g bluetooth 5.1   and wi-fi 6 and color choices are going to be  phantom violet phantom pink phantom grey and   phantom white it will of course ship with one  ui 3.1 and this is based on android 11. next up   we've got the samsung galaxy s21 plus now this is  the middle of the range it comes with a 6.7 inch   dynamic amoled display with an expected resolution  of 1440 by 3200 and this gives us a pixels per   inch it's going to be a flat 120 Hz ltps display  so again this means we don't get the full 120 Hz   at a quad hd resolution we get a triple camera  setup consisting of a 12 megapixel main sensor   a 12 megapixel ultra wide and a 64 megapixel  telephoto it's powered by the snapdragon 875   in north america and the exynos 2100 globally  and both are 5g again we're expecting similar   ram in storage so that's 8 gigs of ram with 128  storage and microsd support it's powered by a 4   800 milliamp hour battery with 25 watt fast charge  support and it's coming with 5g bluetooth 5.1 and   wi-fi six the color choices are gonna be phantom  silver phantom black phantom grey or phantom   violet and it is of course gonna ship with one  ui 3.1 based on android 11. finally we've got   the most premium model the samsung galaxy s21  ultra the galaxy s21 ultra is coming with a 6.8   inch dynamic amoled display with a resolution of  1440 by 3200 and this gives us 511 pixels per inch   it will of course have an in-display fingerprint  scanner and it's a 120 Hz adaptive ltpo display   meaning we can use 120 Hz at its full quad hd plus  resolution and the display is able to adapt the   refresh rate from 1 to 120 Hz and this massively  helps with efficiency we get a quad camera setup   consisting of the 108 megapixel hm3 as the main  sensor we also get a 12 megapixel ultra wide and 2   megapixel telephotos for three times and 10 times  optical zoom it's powered by the five nanometer   snapdragon 875 in north america and the exynos  2100 globally and both are 5g compatible we're   expecting similar ram and storage configurations  to the predecessor so on this it's gonna be 12   gigs of ram with 128 storage and micro sd support  it's powered by a 5 000 milliamp hour battery and   there are rumors of 65 watt fast charging support  it's coming with 5g bluetooth 5.1 and wi-fi 6 and   the color choices are a little bit more limited  on this as we get phantom black or phantom silver   it will of course ship with one ui 3.1 based  on android 11. so that's it for the whole of   the galaxy s21 range as i said when it comes to  pricing there are many rumors of a cheaper device   but at this time i'm just not going to believe it  until i see it happen it's looking like a january   launch for the s21 series so it shouldn't  be long until some information comes forward   and as soon as it does i'll be sharing with  you guys straight away as always though i'd   like to know your thoughts in the comments  who out there is waiting for the galaxy s21   and what do you think of this new voice unlock  but thanks for watching the video if you liked   it smash a thumbs up if you didn't hit the thumbs  down twice and i'll see you guys in the next one
