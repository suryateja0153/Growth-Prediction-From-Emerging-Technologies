 hello i'm paulka with comscope here in germany as in other markets around the world 5g offers both opportunities and challenges 5g introduced new frequency bands like 700 megahertz and 3.5 gigahertz to support them operators must add new antennas to towers that are already crowded even before 5g antenna size restriction often forced network planners to compromise on network performance now with even more bands to support the question is how do you maintain network coverage and build extra capacity one solution a slimmer base station antenna that supports more band while occupying less space meet comscope's fully integrated 5g ht8r beamformer antenna within its slim for 30 millimeter by 2.1 meter design are two low bands four side by side high bands and an 88 r beam former making this the highest density antenna on the market delivering optimum performance for all bands in a slim profile and for added flexibility commscope has a top box concealment solution that allows you to add hd8r or a massive mimer unit from any vendor to an existing 430 millimeter antenna the concealment solution attached to the top of the passive slim antenna gives the appearance of an all in one unit with innovation like our slim base station antennas and concealment solution comscope helps make your 5g transition smooth and seamless for more information i invite you to watch our other videos on these topics then contact our local commscope representatives and discuss your 5g deployment needs thanks for watching and have a great day
