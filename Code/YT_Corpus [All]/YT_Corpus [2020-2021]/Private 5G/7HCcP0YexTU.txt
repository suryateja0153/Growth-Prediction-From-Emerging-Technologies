 single bloody phone around here that doesn't have a notch in it Shami me mix three all screen nice no not sweet snapdragon 855 processor oh nope looks like they're reserving that for the 5g model but it's got a slide it's so satisfying what an innovative idea having the phone slide like that why didn't anybody ever make a slider phone before feels good smart deploy allows IT departments to reimage

flagship and it is readily apparent as soon as you open the box we even get this note from Xiaomi CEO Li Jun on the road of exploration we will constantly invest constantly strive and constantly break through we are willing to devote an additional 100 percent even if we only improve by 1% be friends with our users be the coolest company in the hearts of our users yeah sure it flows a lot better in Chinese next we've got the phone itself and then finally in the last compartment of the box you get a shockingly complete accessory package the headphone dongle kind of sucks it's a little thin and the case is unexceptional at best but they included a 10 watt wireless charger it's like a $50 value now on to the phone this thing is pretty it's got smooth curves a rear that's surprisingly easy to hold on to and a thicker profile that tickles me and exactly the RET sorry what was i talking about right phone sorry so one thing you'd expect in a device that is shoes the modern thin is in design trend is a bigger battery but the mix 3 actually loses 200 million powers of rated capacity over its predecessor on the right edge we've got our volume buttons and a lock button and then on the Left we've got an AI button that can be set up to launch pretty much anything you want through a combination of single press double press and long press activations I'm gonna let that sink in for a moment Samsung are you guys listening that's how simple it is to make proper use of an extra button so the thickness actually makes room for the slide but we're gonna get into that later first let's talk about the screen it's a 19 and a half by 9 aspect ratio 1080p AMOLED panel that gives the mix 3 a staggering 9 3.4% screened to body ratio that means that it is unmatched by all but the Oppo find X which also used a sliding mechanism for itself you can the difference here is that unlike the motorized find X the mix 3 is all manual but in actually a good way it feels a lot like those old slide phones with the built-in keyboards and it's both satisfying in the hand and solid with no wobble or anything like that to feel concerned about it now I was worried about the motorized design on the find X so honestly I'm actually happy to see this more pragmatic approach show up even if it doesn't quite have the sex appeal so the way it works is it gives you this visual cue when you slide it by pulsing along the screen edges and it'll emit a configurable audio tone just in case you need your phone to sound like you've unsheathed disord when you're taking a selfie for some reason what's cool is that it isn't all for show so you can actually turn the slide into a gesture that performs an action of your choosing Samsung are you guys taking notes on this though this approach does have its flaws so if you like using your phone for more than one thing like say for example taking selfies and also engaging in video calls chances are that you'll find Auto launching an app as annoying as it is helpful and it would be nice to have a black list of apps where when they're open it doesn't just take over what you're doing now on the plus side if you choose to take a selfie option which is what I've got going on here it will even work without unlocking your phone pretty nice speaking of which the mix 3 does have face unlock but unlike the find X and the iPhone 10 for that matter the whole experience does feel a little less magical and seamless because you have to manually slide the phone in order to expose the sensors the good news is that unlike the iPhone 10 Xiaomi didn't feel the need to remove the rear fingerprint sensor so if you prefer that way well then you've got good old-fashioned fingerprint sensing that is virtually instantaneous and pretty darn accurate so much so that it's actually possible to accidentally unlock the phone just by brushing against it in your pocket and that level of responsiveness is system-wide even though the writing is on the wall for the snapdragon 845 SOC that our mix 3 is equipped with now on our 6 gig model everything that's butter smooth and even opening apps from a cold start is quick and painless and it can only get better from there if you spring for the top-end model you get a whopping 10 gigabytes of RAM to make sure that there's always some memory available for task switching though that's most of the nice stuff that I can say about the software experience it's no secret that me UI is not my favorite Android skin but its latest iteration did at least get a couple of things right the system theme is consistent feeling it looks reasonably pleasing and jemmye apparently didn't get the memo that and rape I dropped the quick access to system-wide audio sliders which is just fine by me and actually while we're at it the camera app is pretty competent too there's plenty of manual shooting options here to control things like exposure ISO and white balance along with a number of shooting modes you got your night mode your 9 60 FPS slo-mo and a bunch of what Xiaomi calls AI modes AI portrait AI beautify AI studio lighting AI scene detection and AI background music that's a weird one the cameras themselves are arranged in a two front-to-rear configuration with the primary front camera using the new sony IMX 576 sensor that's set up to make use of super pixels essentially simulating a larger physical sensor with its massive resolution to reduce the incidence of noise and improve low-light performance as for our testing well it I don't know sort of worked it's a little weird so our low-light photos weren't especially noisy but there was definitely a lot of smoothing going on more than you might expect even on an Asian phone that's got all the beauty enhancement that you would expect from it as for the rear shooter well it's kind of the usual Xiaomi experience if you're a full manual operator then there's plenty of options but if you just want to pick up and snap and get something usable every time you're still gonna want a pixel or an iPhone or if you're on a budget I guess a 1 plus interestingly it does seem to handle highlights very well as seen in our living room shot here but it's processing tends to over brighten the image beyond what looks natural I mean these days when it comes down to is that software processing is far more important than the specs of the camera and that's an area where Google and Apple still stand out though I am rooting for the s10 to be a big leap forward for Samsung's processing also I've got some more bad news along with the lack of headphone jack is another missing feature that I've come to expect on high-end smartphones stereo speakers why have all of this screamed for watching YouTube TV shows and movies on the go if you're just gonna put a single downward firing speaker without an amplified earpiece speaker and it's not even a fantastic one now with that said you are getting a bit of a discount at between five hundred and sixty to 600 bucks on gearbest the mix threes main competitor is the oneplus 16 and it doesn't give up much in comparison at least on paper specs are very similar now the front fingerprint scanner on the 60 is a BFD and 1 plus as oxygen OS is in my humble opinion miles ahead of me UI but that's almost a completely separate video and anyway to counter that Xiaomi not only supports wireless charging which one Plus does not they even throw in the aforementioned charger so I think for a lot of people it's gonna come down to style which is I guess how Samsung and Apple keep managing to charge a lot more for phones that frankly don't have much on their Chinese competitors at this point the iFixit protec toolkit is designed to help you tackle almost any electronics repair challenge it
