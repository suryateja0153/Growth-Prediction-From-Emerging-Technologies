 as operators deploy 5g networks they realize the criticality of a standalone 5g core that is open multi-vendor-ready easy to deploy and fast to innovate on so what if you could deploy a new 5g core in under 60 minutes with the hpe 5g core stack in less than an hour you'll be able to deploy a fully featured cloud native 5g core on any telco cloud environment with a simple four-step process in the next few minutes i will walk you through each step so you can see how our automation techniques and easy to use tools make commissioning 5g core simple and fast the first step is quick i check to make sure i've got the prerequisites loaded on my deployment control node vm which includes docker python and ansible so i can trigger the playbook after i check that i've included all parameters i'm ready to deploy the hpe 5g core stack deployment toolkit on the deployment control node this part of the process is automated and as you can see it's really fast my second goal is to provision a 5g core stack slice we begin by provisioning a set of files that includes network function images instantiation workflow helm charts and descriptors of the slice after these files are assigned the kubernetes native continuous deployment framework image will be the engine that drives this process for us once again the deployment process is automatic and all of the heavy lifting is done for us here in jenkins we can now see the name of the job we'll instantiate in the next step like in the steps before our toolkit does most of the work the slice descriptor depicts what will need to be deployed including backing services network functions and associated configurations in order to deliver the 5g purpose our slice is targeting we visually track the stages as they are completed in jenkins and via the open shift platform you can see what has been successfully deployed you can view in graphical mode or switch to list mode to see that everything is running now that we know everything is running it's time for our final step we use a set of test tools to validate if the slice is up and running and confirm the 5g service you've created can hit the targets it's been built to execute these intuitive dashboards show 5g traffic is being processed and monitored through automation and this pre-tested toolkit we've been able to deploy a 5g core in less than an hour fast automatic reliable this easy four-step process utilizes continuous deployment for quick validation that saves both time and frustration learn how you can benefit from the 5g core stack [Music] today you
