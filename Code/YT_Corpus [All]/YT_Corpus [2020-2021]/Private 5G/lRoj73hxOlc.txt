 Thank you Mr. Speaker. The Secretary of State will be aware that many countries such as the US, Australia, India and I think Japan have banned Huawei, but is he also aware that Vietnam are developing their own network. How is it that this country could not do the same thing? [SECRETARY OF STATE] I don't think that there's any reason why we can't but we've got to make sure we provide the investment, provide the right market structure and level playing field and also engage in some of those international relations and networks and partnerships that can make sure that we've got either a homegrown alternative for the future or one that's worked up with our most highly trusted partners.
