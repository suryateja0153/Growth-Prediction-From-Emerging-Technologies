 so so what what I'm going to talk about today is the whole problem of how do you get visibility and assurance secure services in a 5g network this is what netskope does as its core business and as you all know 5g introduces a lot of new components new architecture new way of designing things and all of that creates uncertainty around how are you going to monitor and measure services and the risk here is if you don't do it right then obviously you are risking your customer experience which you really don't want to do if you want to retain and grow your subscriber base so we feel that this is an important area where careful thought has to be put in to see how you want to monitor assurance security services so let me start with that to talk about the challenges as I said 5g presents a quite a new architecture in several dimensions and to start with on the radio side because of the use of higher frequency bands you know the rand network becomes denser because of the shorter range and also in these higher frequencies delivering consistent service quality is is challenging because there are susceptibilities to environmental conditions building attenuation and so on and furthermore if you've got a role industrial applications which we believe is a main driver then they will demand more committed levels of service if you look inside the core then we see a lot of disaggregation and distribution going on not only the ran gets distributed in a cloud sense between the baseband unit and the radio unit you also see control and user plain separation you see something like core network slicing which is a feature that allows you to virtually carve up your network to deliver different rates of service and also you see the introduction of an edge cloud which is where the the user plane will recite in many cases and how do you look at your data sources from different places and correlate them to give an accurate service level view is is a new challenge that wasn't there in 4G because that was a very centralized architecture third point clearly is what RedHat mentioned was cloud native implementation I think for the first time you see in a big in a major 5g network the introduction of virtualization and cloud native technologies using containers and virtual machines and a combination of those there is going to be increasing reliance on open source software as we heard from the Red House Red Hat gentlemen and and because of the new architecture and a new software supply chain that is going to be deployed they will be new security vulnerabilities and visibility visibility challenges in this architectures so the bottom line is how do you secure any sheer services in such a dynamic and complex environment so let's take that problem statement and and talk about it so as I mentioned in terms of the main drivers I think what we are seeing in the industry is that the enterprise and industry verticals will drive 5g at least initially because on the consumer side there is not a whole lot of excitement to use you know just the smartphone so until some new devices show up like AR we are and so on I think for operators to grow the top line they will be looking to expand into the enterprise sector especially where there is a lot of demand for enterprise IOT utilities manufacturing transportation health agriculture smart city all of these either they have a low latency requirement or they have a high availability requirement or in some cases if you are using video to transfer information that's going to require higher bandwidths and each of these verticals will run in a dedicated slice because to offer different grades of service to different industry verticals you have to use this network slicing feature and and here and you have to show that that these SL A's are being met within each slice so this is going to be the key to the success of enterprise IOT is how how well the operators are able to provide SLS and enforce them and make sure that the customers are getting the performance that they need for their applications so let's talk about the edge because we feel the edge is the new place where lot of the services will get deployed as you know it's going to be built on in a micro-services architecture it's a what we call the edge as a micro datacenter it says mini data center that can reside right next to the RAM or a little bit deeper into the network but the bottom line is it's much closer to the end-user but because it's an edge with limited resources and constrained environment the footprint of how much horsepower you can put there will be very limited and that's a reason why you have to be extremely efficient in using a container type environment and distributing the user plane functionality you may also need some of the applications to be hosted right there especially if they require low latency and and of course in an edge when you're deploying them in hundreds of different locations automation is going to be key otherwise you're not going to be able to manage such a large deployment of edge data centers and of course security becomes very critical because these are environments which are not as secure as your core data centers are and and you have to be very careful in detecting attacks and be able to mitigate them very quickly so the three things I mentioned here are low latency high bandwidth and giving the assurance from a service and security point of view some of the examples that we have seen are you know in the CV 2x protocols which is about vehicles autonomous vehicles connected cars you really require 10 millisecond or less latency for lines availability because these are mission-critical they can impact lives eHealth remote diagnosis patient monitor they are also time-sensitive services from on the bandwidth side especially when you're doing fixed broadband you're looking to deliver ultra high definition video and and you need to be able to buffer content there like a small CDN to be able to give the right levels of service and also to reduce background cost and for all of these applications the application layer visibility is key it's not enough to monitor your infrastructure in terms of CPU usage and memory and so on but you actually have to look at the flows on your service and application layer because that's where the latency and the throughput guarantees have to be enforced and to do that you really need a predictive environment where you can avoid the problem and and through automation be able to take corrective action before they become impacting to your service from a challenges point of view and quickly mentioned three areas you really need to be able to provide pervasive visibility because of a distributed environment all the way from Rand to the edge to the core so you need a monitoring of different footprints are lightweight all the way going down to the edge and high throughput high measurement processing in the core so you need flexible instrumentation you need to be able to do a surance and automation a real-time so there has to be a way to stream these KPIs in real time into an automation platform so actions can be taken in in a timely fashion and from a security point of view I think the most critical aspect is you don't want these attacks the persistent threads to proliferate in your environment and create a havoc you want to be able to have early warning indicators early detection so you can catch them and stop these before they become detrimental to your network so all of these can be done using technology that we provide so from a let's count point of view we have a technology that looks at network data which we call smart data it's looking at wire data which is your network packets and be able to extract your service layer metadata in real which is the real intelligence and we do this in a vendor-independent way and we can do it in a universally available fashion across your entire infrastructure the technology works cross-domain in other words you can look at the service across any cloud infrastructure whether it's vm based or or container based any network any cloud any workload sorry and and be it pervasive and n to n so which is very critical if you have a distributed mesh network between the edge and the core your control plane is being serviced in the color you use a plane is at the edge we need to be able to put it all together in a consistent fashion our solutions work across traditional IP services we have also implemented capabilities for monitoring IOT devices and IOT sessions and we provide full workflows for service assurance security assurance and customer experience there are two components to a solution there is a visibility part which is what sits in the infrastructure looking at network traffic and we provide a service layer metadata right at the source of where the packets are board for the control and user plane highly optimized cloud native implementation so we can do this using as few resources as possible running in both VM and containers Anwar in many public and private cloud and more importantly everything can be orchestrated from a central automation platform the analytic side which is what we use our ingenious brand and our Arbor brand it is for providing consistent work flows across end-to-end service correlation SLA management subscriber analytics threat analytics and also exporting our data to close loop automation platform for making corrective actions so I just end with this one more slide before I end so here I'm showing an end to end of 5g network all the way from edge to the core so the instrumentation is deployed in either container format or VMs across this distributed cloud architecture and all the data in a unified data model product to the ingenious platform for doing your end-to-end correlation across this multi cloud environment and 5g to conclude what we are seeing in the industry is that service providers are deploying five G and H cloud to deliver new services with speed and agility that seems to be the name of the game especially the width and wide invent has changed everything is being offered as a service so the speed and agility is very key and our solution is uniquely positioned to help customers migrate to fight G in a non-disruptive fashion because one thing you want to make sure is as you are moving to a new solution you still have your services running on your Fuji network and you want to be able to make sure that your services are not negatively impacted so our solution based on wire data cloud native reduces the barrier to implementation from a cost point of view real-time metadata used on multi cloud platforms and all the use cases around service security and customer experience all of them come together to help our customers navigate this difficult environment
