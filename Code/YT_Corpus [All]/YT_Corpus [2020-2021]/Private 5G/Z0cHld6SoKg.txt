 If you're planning to live-streaming an event outdoors at a stadium in a hotel or just out in the middle of nowhere You may have trouble finding an internet connection Some venues just aren't equipped with the proper networking and internet speeds to support high quality streaming So what do you do when you want a live streaming an event, but you don't have access to a router or even decent Wi-Fi? in this video, we'll go over three ways you can live stream when you don't have a reliable internet connection nearby all ranging from really complex to really simple. Let's dive right in Alright, let's start with cellular bonding, Simply put cellular bonding is a way of combining two or more cellular connections into a single super-strong internet connection So that you can live stream with more bandwidth This gives you the freedom to live stream from virtually anywhere You can get a cell signal The better your service is the better your live stream is gonna look, cellular bonding devices allow you to stream using multiple service providers like AT&T Sprint and Verizon to give you the best results This is one of the most reliable options for wireless streaming, especially if you're at an event with a large crowd and there's a ton of people using their phones to text, send photos or even livestream it themselves When that happens the cell towers in that area gets barraged by all those users So it's not really a great idea to rely on one cell connection, because cellular bonding is more reliable It's also a little more expensive So the cost will vary depending on the device you use and how many different service plans you want to pay for. for the best bang for your buck We recommend using the LIVE U solo, the LIVE U solo in combination with their LRT Bonding service allows you to stream using a combination of two cellular connections, a Wi-Fi connection, and a hard-line connection so you can pretty much cover all your bases. If one of your connections goes bad or cuts out completely, you can still stream reliably from one of the three other sources. It's pretty cool! You can use the LIVE U solo to stream to BoxCast and then we'll push your stream to all your social destinations, websites, smart TV apps, etc. make sure to check out the link in the description to learn more about the the LIVE U solo along with all the other options that we recommend Now onto option two streaming with a mobile hotspot This will be less expensive but also a little less reliable Using a hotspot device like a verizon jetpack or a NetGear Nighthawk will allow you to live stream using a single cell connection, which hotspot you decide to go with should be based on who? Provides the best cell service in your area as well as how much data you're planning on using To give you a rough idea of how much cellular data you can plan on using we made this simple chart, here we chose two and a half megabits per second as the standard bit rate because it seemed fitting for a basic 720p livestream at 30 frames per second But if you want better video quality expect to use more data, mobile hotspots aren't the best option for live-streaming but they're useful for when you're in a pinch and can be really handy if you can't get access to Wi-Fi or Ethernet And now onto our third option Broadcaster for iOS, this live streaming app is great If you just want to pull out your phone and start streaming right away The broadcaster app gives you the ability to stream 1080p video at 60 frames per second directly from your iPhone or iPad so if you've got the bandwidth, you can get some really incredible video quality broadcaster also uses HEVC compression so you'll stream in higher quality with the same bitrate that you normally stream in, having this type of compression is Especially useful when you need to get the most video quality out of a limited connection, and because it works exclusively with the BoxCast platform, you can send a single live stream from your phone and push it to as many social media destinations as you want all at the same time, it's pretty powerful so these are my recommendations but it's important to note that none of these options can replace the reliability that comes with a strong hardline connection, whenever possible try to get a Ethernet access and have more upload bandwidth available than you'll actually be using especially if the live stream is mission-critical To learn more about the wireless streaming options we discussed today check out the links in the description.
