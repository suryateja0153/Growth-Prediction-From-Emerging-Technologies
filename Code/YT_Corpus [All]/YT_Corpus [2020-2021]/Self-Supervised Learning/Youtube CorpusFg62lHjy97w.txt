 hello i'm ruslan gusceno and this is a quick overview of my phd thesis devoted to computational design of curved surfaces we consider topics from perspectives of interactive design data-driven modeling and design of smart materials we explore scales from building architecture to tabletop devices in every work we deal with shaping doubly curved geometries from flat shells which is desired in many scenarios for example to build stunning facades made of pre-baked glass panels this example motivates our first project a recent low-cost alternative to baking glass shapes is called bending approach we use physical simulation to predict shape and stress of such panels for a given boundary frame multiple suitable panels may exist we acquire such data to train a multi-modal deep neural network and speed up the estimations it is then integrated into a common architectural design tool providing an immediate feedback on visibility of the panels additionally automatic optimization can be performed now return from the externally loaded shells to those that self-transform such shells can be integrated with flat fabrication technologies bringing them to free form surfaces they are also efficient in storage and transformation to achieve this we need a mechanism both storing the energy and defining the curvatures locally and we need a dedicated algorithm to replicate a global target shape our first method enables encoding of geometric information this mechanism called curve-ups consists of tiny disconnected tiles and pre-stressed elastic sheets once released a continuous shell forms to assure its stability we need to configure the tiles properly our optimization approach starts with the course user assisted stage then local physics-based refinements are made these methods allows high-precision realization of complex geometries the next method enables encodement of both geometric and temporal information this shell helps to carefully follow some morphine sequence to avoid potential self-collisions to reach this goal the user specifies deformation rates across the shell the unit cells composing the shell are then individually programmed to a specific special temporal transformation the shell's actuation is started by placing it into hot water our method allows realization of extremely complex shapes prone to multiple self-collisions additionally our shells have great load-bearing capabilities and we envision the application in consumer good design overall our contributions facilitate the design and fabrication of conventional objects as well as open door to the new types of self-control devices thank you for watching
