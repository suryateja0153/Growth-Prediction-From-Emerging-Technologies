 in this paper we present an approach for disentangled uncontrollable face image generation where 3d imitative contrastive learning this work is done by researchers from Tsinghua University and Microsoft Research Asia nowadays state-of-the-art game models such a style can can generate high-quality face images that are even hard to distinguish from real ones however the process of mapping a random noise to an image in game isn't predictable given a random noise we don't know what kind of face will be generated and multiple face attributes will be changed simultaneously if we switch from one noise input to another therefore we seek to generate face images with independent Latin rivals such as identity expression lighting and post to make the generation process controllable our method is related to previous works in different domains such as this in tango representation learning and conditional face generation however none of these masters achieves generative modeling of multiple phase factors in a disentangled interpretable fashion there are several challenges to achieve our goal first when idea interpretable semantically meaningful representation in order to achieve precise control of facial properties we also require multiple factor variations to be fully disentangled and what's more we want to treat our model from an unconstrained dataset without any label for any facial property to tackle these challenges our idea is to incorporate 3d price into Ken training we introduced we do phase parametric model and an image rendering process the imitative contrastive learning framework is proposed to utilize this prize specifically we start from multiple independent variables CI sampled from normal distribution then we use Network VI to map each CI to another space with column de space where each variable has physical meanings of identity expression lighting and posts respectively an additional random noise is introduced to account for other properties such as background here identity and expression ribose represent the coefficients of a 3d mm face model the lighting rival is the satirical harmonics lighting model parameters and the post rival contains three Euler angles in 3d these variables fully depict the geometry and appearance of a 3d face and we can obtain an 2d face image using rendering to obtain each we I will use a sweetie-face reconstruction network to extract identity expression lighting and post coefficients from training images and train a we AE with VI as decoder after that Layton vectors in lambda space are fed into a generator G for face image generation to generate realistic images we first used a standard of reserved loss in addition we want face images to be generated following the desired properties of the lambda space variables therefore we render in a face image using the lambda space ribose and apply imitative losses which enforce the generated image to mimic the rendered one the imitative losses minimize both pixel level differences in perceptual distance more details can be found in your paper to enhance disentanglement we further reinforce the invariance of each factor on the generated images in a contrasting manner we alter one legend wearable while keeping others and changed I require the differences on the generate image pair relate only to that letter I bow the ablation study shows that using imitative losses alone - now that sheave said his factory disentanglement adding our contractive losses can greatly improve the performance we test our method with the style constructure and trade on the FF HQ data set after training we can freely change the four factors including identity detailed facial expression lighting intensity direction and the desired post end goes the factor relations are highly disentangled changing one factor does not affect others as shown in the figure a key ingredient in style gun is the input space to W space mapping we analyzed the W space in our current model and found that it is also trained in a disentangled manner more details can be found in the paper we can also use our master to embed a real image into the disentangle Latin space and edit it we demonstrate this by real image post lighting and expression manipulation in summary represented a no approach for this entangled and controllable phase image generation learned with unlabeled data this is achieved by an imitative contrastive learning framework leveraging 3d prize we also obtained a disentangle representation for phase images which cannot be achieved by various methods thank you
