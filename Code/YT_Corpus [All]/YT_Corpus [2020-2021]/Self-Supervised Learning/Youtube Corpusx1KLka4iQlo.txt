 welcome to my presentation here I'm presently the unsupervised inter-domain a patient for somatic a segmentation through self supervision this work is done by VAP an English in France from RM u s-- actually and Enzo Kwan this work is supported by Bosch cymatics impatient aims at sine each pixel in the image to a somatic class recently completion neural network based documentation models have achieved during mark book progresses to Train such a network require a large amount of data however annotations for semantic sanitation are difficult to be collected since they're expensive labor-intensive and time-consuming more recently for the realistic dataset such as GTA 5 rented from simulators with precise and patience have been utilized to Train second patient networks however the model training from sensor data are hardly transferable to real data due to the cross domain gap existing supervise that updation approaches have been proposed to line the gap between the source and target domain this approaches either work on the feature level or image level to learn the domain environment features however existing approaches have only considered the distribution gap between the source and target domain which is caught enter domain gap here we found that there is a large distribution gap among the target baby self which is called entry domain gap here and this work proposed to step domain adaptation approach to minimize the inter domain gap and the entered domain gap altogether our philosophy is shown here we first conduct the inter domain adaptation from this adaptation we separate the target domain into an easy and hard split using the entropy based ranking function in the next step we utilize the CD labels from the easy images and adopt an entry domain adaptation to align the domain gap among the target data this is the framework of the proposed model which consists of three parts namely and enter the math patient and entropy based ranking system and there enter domain adaptation the first step is enter the medication which is based on common unsupervised domain the patient approaches in this world will utilize the entropy of predictions from segmentation outputs to align domain gap the inter domain adaptation consists of a generator and discriminator the generator is to generate the entropy map for the input image and the discriminator is to predict the domain label for the entry while the generator is - for the discriminator the second step is the entropy based the ranking system given an unlabeled target image the prediction map and the entropy map are generated by the trained inter domain generator to separate target domain into an easy and hot display we take advantage of the entropy map and a proposed ranking system for all the target images on this basis will introduce the hyper parameter lambda as a ratio for the target domain separation the third step is the intruder meditation which consists of an entered domain generator and discriminator to align that intro domain gap we propose to utilize easy split predictions from the inter domain generator as pseudo labels and we train a generator and discriminator in the same way as in the inter domain the patient part we conducted we at a patient experiment from the gta5 to cityscape data sets and here are some qualitative results on the cityscape validation images which shows that our model utilizing bossy inter domain an entry domain adaptation outperforms the model only using entered omega patient we also provide the visualization of samples from the easy and hottest plate with their second patient predictions based on the proposed ranking function the qualitative results of three benchmark data sets highlight the effectiveness of our model against existing state-of-the-art approaches further experiment on digital data sets shows that our model can also be extended to digit classification tasks in conclusion we present a self supervised adaptation technique to minimize the enter domain and codomain gap our model can be combined with existing domain adaptation approaches for the future work we extend our model to the video segmentation task thank you for listening to my presentation and welcome to access our code and get up
