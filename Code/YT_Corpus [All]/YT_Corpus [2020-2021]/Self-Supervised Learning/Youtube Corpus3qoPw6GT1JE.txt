 my name is han yan i'm glad to present our newest paper one ring to rule them all certifiably robust geometric perception with outliers this is joint work with luca colony and mit too much perception is a task of estimating geometric models from virtual measurements it covers a broad spectrum of problems and finds extensive applications in robotics and computer vision modern geometric perception works as follows given some visual measurements the front end performs feature extraction and matching to establish correspondences although many correspondences are typically correct the frontend almost always detects incorrect correspondences that we call outliers therefore the backend performs robust estimation based on fast heuristics such as ransack and gnc these heuristics oftentimes give reasonable estimates but if there are many outliers they fail moreover when they fail they do not give any notice to the system hence if not handled carefully this leads to catastrophic damages to both machines and human life our goal is to design a set of algorithms that are certifiably robust which not only outputs estimates but also verifies if the estimates are correct or incorrect these algorithms will safeguard our autonomous systems towards this goal we propose the first general framework for designing certifiably robust algorithms in particular we study robust estimation using the truncated least squares estimator we first show that a family of trs problems can be reformulated as polynomial problems which are equally hard but exhibits special structural sparsity then we provide two perspectives to design certifiable algorithms in the primal perspective we leveraged lasers hierarchy of mormon relaxations plus basis reduction to relax the pop into semi-definite programs solving the stp simultaneously returns the estimate and the certificate in the dual perspective we first used existing heuristics to obtain a candidate estimate but then we use sum of squares relaxation and darkness rest for splitting to verify the correctness of the estimate to obtain the certificate show results of primal relaxation on three problems single rotation averaging shape alignment and mesh restoration these figures show that our relaxation is tight and produces accurate estimates even in the presence of many outliers across all applications now i show the performance of duo certification blue bars plot the frequency of when the fast heuristics returns correct estimates and green bars brought the frequency of when certification returns an optimality certificate we see dual certification certifies all correct solutions and rejects all incorrect solutions moreover certification scales to large problems beyond the reach of current stp solvers finally we demonstrate successful applications on satellite post estimation thank you please check our paper and code for more details
