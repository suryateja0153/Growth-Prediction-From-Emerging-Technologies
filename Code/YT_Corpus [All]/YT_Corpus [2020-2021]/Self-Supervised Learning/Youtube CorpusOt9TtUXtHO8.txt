 hello everyone my name is sinki lee a phd student at the university of north carolina at chapel hill in this talk i'm going to present our you become 2020 paper titled intermittent learning on-device machine learning on intermittently powered system we envision a future where batteries embedded platforms will be an effective alternative to battery powered systems without a battery they harvest energy from the environment to a human body such as the sunlight kinetic vibration and so on and they are perpetual maintenance free and environment friendly for example an earable device harvests energy from body heat an outdoor mobile device harvests energy from the sun and the heartbeat monitoring system is powered by the human heartbeat in this paper we introduced the concept of intermittent learning which makes energy harvested in battery systems capable of executing lightweight machine learning tasks intermittently their ability to run machine learning tasks inside the energy harvesting systems pushes the boundary of batteries computing as these devices are able to sense learn infer and evolve all prolonged lifetime two properties of intermittent learning make it unique and hard a problem to solve first when energy is scarce um an intermittent learning system needs to decide the best action for the movement so that its overall learning objective is achieved second since not all training examples are equally important to learning an intermittent learning system should smartly decide to keep or discard examples at runtime and thus be able to eliminate a large number of unnecessary on energy wasting training actions unfortunately none of existing intermittent computing platforms consider these issues and thus they are not effective in learning when we execute machine learning tasks on them [Music] this animation shows how an intermittent learning system executes a machine learning algorithm with harvested energy given the machine learning algorithm it is forced to divide it into sub tasks such as science future extract and learn and they are executed intermittently whenever a sufficient amount of energy is harvested we propose an intermittent learning framework for intermittently power systems that want to execute an end-to-end machine learning tasks which involves data acquisition learning and inferring this feature shows a high level diagram of the proposed framework there are three main modules corresponding to energy management machine learning and task planning the first one is energy harvester this module monitors the energy generated by the energy harvester such as piezoelectric rf or solar panels and it generates an interrupt that triggers an intermittent execution of learning tasks whenever a sufficient amount of energy is generated the next is learning algorithms we have developed a library of machine learning machine learning algorithms which contains specialized implementation of commonly used unsupervised or semi-supervised algorithms for an intermittently power system such as k nearest neighborhood k-means and a neutral network these algorithms are split into small pieces of code so that they can be intermittently executed the last one is dynamic action planner this module is the heart of the framework which is responsible for selecting the right action at the right moment in order to advance the learning task toward achieving it to desire the learning objectives it contains implementations of intermittently executable method and algorithms to schedule actions to select what to learn and to evaluate the progress of an intermittent learner toward task compilation we implemented three intermittent learning applications that monitor learn and classify air quality indices human presence and a vibration pattern these systems are powered by solar rf and piezoelectric harvesters respectively and they perform better release on device training which achieves 81 percent 82 and 76 percent of classification accuracy let's take a look at the air quality monitoring system more closely the air quality learning system detects and notifies abnormalities in air quality dices such as the uv eco2 and tvoc by learning their normal levels on harvested solar energy unlike sensing systems that just report the absolute sensing values it learns the evolving status of air quality and provides environmental context-based notifications which is smarter than reporting just simple index values the system has been deployed in the real world and active since 2018 and we have a website showing the real-time status of the system which is updated every 10 minutes for the demonstration purpose we use an additional gateway devices that raise the classification results from the batteries learner and sends them to the web server thank you
