 AWS Transit Gateway helps you simplify and scale by connecting your Amazon Virtual Private Clouds and on-premises networks to a single gateway. Your journey to the cloud started with just one VPC but that number soon grew to tens, hundreds, or even thousands. And when you add VPNs, multiple accounts, and AWS Direct Connect things can get complicated. Transit Gateway solves this by streamlining and centralizing your network. Think of it as one big cloud router -- helping you keep up with growth or scale and manage what you have now. It even connects across AWS Regions, sending all traffic over the secure, available, and high-performance AWS global network. Plus, Transit Gateway network manager gives you a single view of your entire network -- from the AWS cloud to your SD-WAN devices. It also supports multicast without the need to buy expensive hardware. Streamline and centralize your network so it's easier to manage and easier to grow with AWS Transit Gateway.
