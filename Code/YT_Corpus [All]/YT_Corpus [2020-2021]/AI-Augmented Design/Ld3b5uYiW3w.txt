How do we turn it into MVP by two-and-a-half months time? [MUSIC]  I didn't come into this project to be a disruptor, but I just came in to being very creative about the whole system and the channel with no stone unturned.  Disruptions just about challenging the norms. Through digital natives say our generation really knows that everything constantly changes.  But now, fashion is actually creating that movement.

What it can do is empower them to do all the things that they otherwise would not have been able to do. [MUSIC]
