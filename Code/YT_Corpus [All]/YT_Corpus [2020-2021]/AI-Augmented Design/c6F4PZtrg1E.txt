 The foundation of what we're doing is really data-driven, and if you think of how humans learn, we are also biological data-driven systems. And so, from a research perspective, artificial intelligence is, in essence, trying to replicate this data-driven process of learning. Now, one of the challenges is, you know, how do you rapidly retrain an individual that's just lost their job, or how do you get students to go in a new dimension and learn a new concept or theory that they may not have been trained in? And I think this is really where immersive virtual reality has the potential to enhance the quality of content delivery and the scale at which our content can be disseminated.
