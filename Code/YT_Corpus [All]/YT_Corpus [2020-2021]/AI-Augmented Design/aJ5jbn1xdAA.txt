 [Music] when safety deadlines and compliance are the priority having immediate access to accurate engineering documents is mission-critical whether you work in engineering construction or operations managing those assets requires a robust solution that supports concurrent revisión tracking audit ability of reviews modifications and approvals transmittals and secure collaboration you need a solution that keeps things on time and avoids expensive claims and costly delays Open Text extended ECM for engineering is built on the secure and compliant Open Text ECM platform the solution provides rapid access to project and design data for individuals while sharing it securely across the extended Enterprise it is integrated with applications already used in your enterprise so you can leverage critical design documents throughout the entire lifecycle of your asset from design to operations with maximum efficiency leveraging the simplified handover you can now automate the transfer of as built engineering documents from project to operations so you are not dealing with truckloads of files our solution manages a single point of truth putting consistency and control first to speed up the design cycle and provide operations with up-to-date information it also streamlines document control processes while maintaining detailed transmittal histories that's important when change requests or claims arise bill to streamline projects of any scale and tailored to accelerate production revenue the solution lets you design and build the future with focus alignment and compliance open text extended ECM for engineering find out more at the link below
