 [Music] you in my background I worked first after graduating in computer animation as a game artists working on titles like gangs of London Sony's London studio but then I quit to study classical arts when I realized that the artists I wanted to be has to study traditional traditional media and so I took two years out to focus on figurative painting and enjoyed it so much I thought I would become a professional portrait painter working in oil but more recently it's actually exploring the overlap between these two disciplines in a way so traditional arts and video games and what is most relevant to the talk today is a sketch club that I organize here in Zurich where we have different cosplayers come every two weeks so have maleficent in the top right next in in a week or two we have a Harry Potter coming someone dressed as Harry Potter and what the the session is about is more of an animation approach to drawing where you just have one minutes two minutes or five minutes to capture the essence of the pose so what is the the dynamic energy of this character so when we look at these drawings a bit more closely you can see that every line has a value it might be describing the costume and something about the the figure a cultural reference but more importantly a straight line has a supportive value a curved line feels more dynamic and it's these nuances this understanding of what is the aesthetic value of each individual line which is the foundation of my work and I'm very happy to sort of to share with you the endorsements that I've received for the two books that I write one one endorsing is from Mark Foster the Hollywood director who highlighted the transmedia value in storytelling of these concepts that I'll share with you today as well as the phone acid or neon who's one of the founding members of the Assassin's Creed franchise who you also highlighted the universal storytelling structure of my work and what that structure comes down to is is really very very simple it's the circle the square and the triangle that's what I like to do at the beginning of my presentations is to ask all of you if you were to pick one of these shapes which one would you identify yourselves with and it's not you don't have to call it out this is just something very personal for you to decide knowing that it is a very subjective that the feeling you might have in in deciding which one might feel very subjective at this moment you know is sometimes very difficult to us for us to to understand you know what what am i as a presenter asking of you to define it becomes a little easier if I asked you if you had all the money in the world or some of you might have enough to buy your dream car already which shape would see the car aligned with would it be something like a Porsche or a Volkswagen Beetle a hammer or a Range Rover or something very edgy like a Lamborghini and that becomes a bit more easier to say okay Emma I mean definitely a posh kind of person a hair for instance it becomes even easier perhaps so more objective when we decide I won when I asked you to simulate the gestures you would do when signing a contract or signing something you know autographing a book for instance the idea is that if you just hold your hands out so maybe for those of you who don't feel too self-conscious about it you can even try it now so just try to simulate the gestures and then the idea is that's you know if you had actually written this down or perform this while drawing and have something to look at on a piece of paper you could then say is my signature more aligned to the circular-shaped concept to the horizontal and vertical lines or is it very triangular you know and that sort of says something about your physical tension as well so you're projecting something about yourself outwards through lines and this in a ways this experiment becomes very interesting when we start to study signatures by other people so if I could ask you to for those who don't feel self-conscious for those you do please don't worry about this just to sort of simulate drawing copying the gestures of the signature now so and while you're doing so you know what are the feelings that you feel the physical feelings that you feel while doing that performance okay yes yeah and the accuracy is not important it's just the the general flow of the lines as if you are drawing that you know making a copy or studying a character in a way it's very similar whereas try doing the same for this one so of course this one feels very very different and much more jagged and what's interesting is that what you've just done is you've simulated Barack Obama's signature versus Donald Trump's and so by performing harassing so by performing these gestures what you've done is you've physically empathized with each of these characters your figures real-life figures that you may never have the opportunity to meet them but by simulating their gestures through their signature you've experienced something about their personality you've embodied their characters and so in the context of storytelling which was the main topic of tonight's as a revenge what we could do is you know in a very simple way sort of line these signatures up and just treat them as a simple narrative the line you know becomes a narrative and if you imagine starting with Barack Obama's signature going to Donald Trump's and returning to barracks is sort of like you have a start a very relaxed starts we have a moment of tension and then a restoration of the norm afterwards okay as more as that comment was more loaded than I then I pictured it in my head when I when I put this presentation together so that so what we have you know what we're looking at now again is this shaped language the circle square and triangle and so the question is what is shape language for all of us and has a very ancient root so even the ancient Greeks who of course cemented the platonic solids which we still use in modern day 3d software sort of like cinema 4d Maya they were trying to theorize you know what is our world made of just like the atoms are in our understanding of atoms is today and so we had the five classic elements here are three of them and when they were thinking so which of these platonic solids you know this these component parts of our universe represent water they thought it's the sphere and the sphere in a very tactile sense there's something that rolls around is very you know is a very dynamic a very dynamic shape so they thought okay this is the sphere must be water you know if we were to be able to zoom down at a sort of microscopic level they theorized that the cube is earth because of its it has the largest mass and it can also tessellate very easily so there was a natural conclusion but also a tactile conclusion and that they associated with this shape and lastly was the pyramids associated of fire and again this was a tactile conclusion because fire has a very painful stinging sensation when he touch it and the pyramids situ has these sharp points that we feel you know when we interact with this object as this platonic solid and so we already see this relationship emerging between a shape language physical experience and tactile sensations you know this is what interaction is about when we're designing video games virtual reality augmented reality of course we're sort of in some way detached from the virtual experience but we want to embody it especially in an artistic context but the interesting thing is that we don't even have to interact with things physically to sense some way to have a physical empathy towards them because our bodies are sort of the way we function is that we have mirror neurons that's fire away every time we for instance on the left enter a space or appreciate a piece of Arts that is sort of full of very curved and dynamic shapes then our body starts to response to on a very subconscious level and this can be very subtle to the point that of course you're not even aware of it whereas if you enter a space which has very jagged shapes or an artwork which is very aggressive than our body that the muscles can even be triggered relating to what the action of the figure that you're looking at is doing and just to prove or sort of give you a sense of a heightened sense of how these mirror neurons work is an example of like a parkour experience and for anyone who's watching is has very severe vertigo you might want to look away but for those who can just hold on long enough to feel the sensation so what that highlights for those who especially for those who have vertigo is that you're not there you're not the person doing the jumping but your body is responding physically to what you're seeing and those were what the mirror neurons are doing when you look at arts which is very curved or has very static horizontal and vertical lines as very sharp your body naturally responds to this but how can we go a step further and into this tactile space but just to sort of continue the this discussion of like what is shape language or where does it come from it actually comes from nature so we have here some things which objects which have been evolving for thousands or millions of years and have arrived at natural solutions that make them efficient in this in the doing the things that they have evolved to to do so on the Left we have a dolphin and of course a dolphin as full of curved and fluid lines which make it as aerodynamic and fast as possible if that dolphin was shaped like a Minecraft character very boxy nose then of course he just wouldn't be efficient we can't replace the the curved lines of the dolphin with any of the the two shapes it just wouldn't work a tree as heavy as this one that has to grow vertically to keep its balance you know to stay upright of course the minute it was tilted to give a more triangular to reference the triangular shape concepts then of course it would fall over this efficiency is the balance is necessary for it to grow as tall as it does and King line teeth have naturally evolved to cut things and slice through things efficiently because they are efficient at doing that that we can't replace sharp teeth with marshmallow shapes and expect the same effect and engineers throughout history have noticed this you know we can go back to the ancient Sumerian cultures you know the cartwheels are round you know this this can't be changed you can't escape that Stonehenge or the stones at Stonehenge is still standing to this day despite being you know over two and a half thousand years older BC and the oldest known sphere I think it's four hundred twenty thousand years old this collectin sphere of course as a sharp point this is you know sort of ancient engineers referencing nature to arrive at solutions that's nature offered us for engineering challenges so how does this fit into art you know shape language is something that's around us everywhere but it's a hidden art form somewhat and it sort of relates to composition in in design and so here we have a painting by Raphael so it's and what I want to highlight is that yet on the Left there's the cultural content and on the right is where I'm gonna sort of place the the craft what things that belong to this painting in the craft category and so what is cultural content so the cultural content here is Mary which is something that is very specific to a particular religion and not all cultures will be aware of it even the halo above sort of above the two figures you know there's also something that is very unique to a particular religion and also something that can is not objective is something that's you know not Universal and even though the fabrics of the the characters you know they're very specific to this periods we will never understand the meaning that the value of these fabrics in the same way that the artist did at the time you know is his choice and may be very localized to his region in in the world and even the oil paint itself is of like cultural content value because the oil paints that Raphael was using is very different to the one that we use now you know and maybe some people have never had any contact with oil paints in this form at all so these are all things which come under cultural contents whereas the craft craft is something that is more objective and more Universal is it comes in the form of the composition and the structure there's the shape language that the artist has chosen on which to construct and place these these items those are the the cultural contents so nothing in this image has been randomly positioned the artists would have spent months if not years arranging and manipulating every single aspect of this image to create this circular motif so that includes you know you can include shadow shapes contour lines fabric elements decorations and you know these are all geared towards specific functions which I'll cover it in in the moments but the idea is that these are not things that you should be aware of if you haven't studied classical arts that's Raphael broke this circular-shaped concept this primary one deliberately so that you would still you would focus on the cultural content and be immersed in the narrative without being aware of the construction and in in a film so an analogy in film would be that when you're watching The Lord of the Rings or something like that you don't want to see a cameraman or a camera person or a microphone dip into the the frame because then you become very aware of the the craft or sort of how this is all being staged and so it's important that this is always remains hidden this is where it's works at its best and what we're doing is we with sort of some deciding on how to deliver the cultural content while not making it explicit nor making it central but you may have noticed that there's an additional shape hidden within here and that's one of the triangle so which is also sort of embedded within this compositional structure and this is to highlight that shape language is what I will focus on and I'll sort of discuss the nuances shortly but there's also possibilities to create compositions that use cultural content as well so of course the Holy Trinity being here the central shape within this composition but it's important to highlight that shape language still overrides cultural content so people will still what can have the the value of shape language modulated by cultural conditioning but if we place two paintings side by side with very similar contents and in some way magically ignore the triangle in the left painting then you'll notice that the the left painting still hasn't a much more delicate rounded effect than the one on the right and and this is just a highlight that the composition itself is you know we still return to our ingrained responses to two circles squares and triangles and it's something that I will reinforce with other examples as we go and sorry before I forget that this is stuff that because the the compositions are usually embedded within the painting and sort of just beyond your perception how they're working on you as an untrained viewer is at the pre-attentive stage of cognition says the idea that they they remain just out of your conscious perception but your subconscious is is very aware of those sort of on a much more primal level so what are the compar the functions of composition so one is just pure simple visual simplification painting here by Rubens is incredibly complex so many figures and details meshed together and so what the composition does is it gives you a very simple visual statement which is which enhances the emotion and your focus on the artwork itself so here I have an example sort of like a something for you to try if I could ask you to just focus on the circle on the screen and just think about what your eye is doing in in what should be happening is pretty much nothing that should be a very comfortable experience that your eye is not tempted to shift away from the circle whereas if I add vignettes this experience becomes even easier you know your your eyes even less tempted to go away and move away from from this circle and so this is the equivalent of creating a very simple composition like the ones in the Rubens or the Raphael example where you're you're immersed in the the painting you're held there by this hidden structure and especially if vignettes are added and you're not tempted to sort of think about what's around the painting you know that the painting has captured your attention whereas if I ask you to focus on one of these shapes in this image so just just one of them you'll notice that your eye becomes very irritated it's sort of just subtly tempted to to move away and explore the rest of the cameras and this is the equivalent of an artwork that has no compositional structure at it's just for simplification purposes so it's just a chaotic scene and the what this does is it creates a lot of work for your audience they then have to sort of navigate it and orientate themselves around the cultural contents because you have not offered them a simple guide with which to work with so we have visual simplification another is that a visual guide in a sense that anything which is sits along the compositional structure we'll get more attention than things that are not so the artists can use that to direct your attention to specific areas of interest and these are of course complemented by just other aesthetic contrast contrast of color contrast of value that you can complement if that but in a sense is a visual guide that's very useful for us as designers but most relevant to shape language is that a composition allows us to create have a holistic shape structure so holism because is just thinking about heavy air how everything fits together but thinking about the the shape and that you choose for this experience of course has aesthetic value due to something which is aligned with a circle square a triangle or something that is purely of cultural content value but in a sense this is these are really important techniques and the old masters you know later the groundwork for this and so it's important that we don't ignore this and just to sort of highlight this is not something that belongs to the Renaissance and and periods of of old even Kandinsky who is one of the the pioneers of abstract painting who painted in in ended up painting in just circles squares and triangles said that the contents of a work of art finds its expression in the composition so in the some of the tensions inwardly organized for the work so this is sort of just thinking about how everything combines together sits together so the next question to ask is you know I've shown you sort of some Europe as a European classical European art so we this may be good to ask like is this are these concepts of composition and in particular shape language of worldwide aesthetic value so we'll start with Buddhist culture and originally Buddha didn't have a human form it was just he was presented by things which were associated with him so in this case we have his footprints but the ancient Greeks invaded Asia so this is the ghandahar region so it's modern-day Pakistan and Afghanistan and what suddenly in at this time are the the human representations of Buddha and this is a particularly interesting image because Buddha's protector God has referencing directly Hercules from ancient Greek philosophy so law but returning to shape language what is particularly interesting about Buddha's pose is the shape in which he's being constructed so you can see this is a triangular shape of a very flat space and it's very symmetrical so there's a lot of stability but this triangle has been rounded at the corners and everything about his drapery and his facial features are very rounded so we have a triangular shape a balanced one symmetrical with rounded corners and rounded shapes and Buddha's pose this one is an aid to meditation so the function of this statue is to encourage you to sit in this pose you know especially if you've done if you do yoga then you'll understand that this this poses encourages you to bring stability and calmness into your physical body his Buddha's protector gods on the other hands has a much more triangular pose and as this this figure evolved and went further into Asia and on to Japan turned into the Neo gods which stand out sides temples in in Japan as to two figures but you can see that the shape language of the pose of this character is much more tilted and skewed to one side what's interesting that the Zen monk Suzuki Chaisson encouraged his followers to adopt this pose in the same way that Buddha encourages you to sit in a particular calm way but with the the Neo the idea was that whenever you needed to feel aggressive and have power in you whenever at times of needs at the times of stress then this pose would give you that energy and so again it's a relationship between shape language and an sort of the this embodiments of sort of and physical empathy towards something which you may not even be interacting physically through touch but the relationship between physical gestures and shape language and the cultural content then of course we when we will none of us will understand the the meaning of all the other symbols within this artwork the same way that's a Tibetan monk which while painting this so in reference to the barack obama and donald trump signature thread you know you could also imagine sitting in a pose like the buddha then getting into an aggressive style post and then back again and we have the semblance of a narrative or some sort of something that is embodied and actually changes your mood and this is also something which is true that the way we stand that we project ourselves also changes how we feel on the inside is lama carts too we we have shaped language here at work and islamic arts also had a very strong influence from ancient greek culture because the ancient greeks invaded south as well and what is interesting is that they they of course there's its unlined conic there's there's no figurative work in islamic arts but it was still an arts founded on the study of nature so in the same way they took the things which were universal to to all cultures in reference to the dolphin example and the the sharp teeth but it was a symbolizing alice perfection the primary shapes but intricately combines to illustrate others infinite complexity so we still see you know the same shape language at work here and it's no surprise that the most important architectural objects in islamic culture is a cube it's sort of like the solid stable everlasting shape that it represents as an actual form and in all these examples in buddhists the buddhist examples that I gave and also here that yours is not that ancient Greeks dominated you know the culture just drifted in one direction we can see here a Christian painting and there's a Persian rug and and also if you look at if you ever see representation of Jesus with gestures like this they're also in reference to two Buddhist culture shifting slightly away from religion and sort of worldly cultures we can also perceive shape language in sort of everyday experiences that we have so this is a Volkswagen Beetle websites you know we can start at the logo for the Volkswagen but also the the vehicle itself you know which which shape does it align to is very easy to see of course is the circular shape concept but everything about it is is based on the visual DNA from the the shape of the the lights the wing mirrors even like the sockets for the the door handles are all tuned to this visual DNA that is is part of the the identity of this vehicle and when the graphic designer was constructing this this image they also chose a bridge which echoes the visual DNA of the vehicle so in a way that's in reference to Kandinsky now that the message here is that this vehicle exists in is is built for this city in a way this is the subtext but as a designer we always have to be very aware of the visual DNA and make sure that it's saturates the whole experience so if what would would you what would you expect to happen if I press the arrow for the carousel for the images to shift you know even what kind of animation would you implement would it be something that's very sudden and aggressive of course that is going to be something with a ease a slow in slow out animation that's somehow references that the shape language and this is exactly what happens so it's not too fast very delicate we have another screen and the shape language of the environments mirrors the original image which is in reference to the car itself what about the male testosterone of the Lamborghini you know how you know can we see the similar concepts applied here so starting with the logo in the top rights is definitely more triangular and the vehicle is it's just one ball of angry muscle a Hanoi because vehicles today's vehicles are designed with faces embedded within and so you can picture the lights of the vehicle as being the eyes and the badge the Mo's the the bonnets being like the tension lines that you get when you're very angry but everything you know even the teeth so it's almost like a shock there's this vehicle but everything has been sharpened and very very different to the Volkswagen Beetle but also the setting you know we have a very jagged environment so the message here the subtext is that this the angry driver of this angry vehicle there's in a very dangerous place and this is the the weapon to to drive to survive what about if we click on the carousel then of course we're going to get a suitable aesthetic experience that somehow conveys the the speed of this vehicle but also the aggression and this you know you can see it's just no ease in or out the animation just happens instantly in reference to Google our hosts a kind house for today you know this is a space in in Dublin which I found on the Internet I haven't been there before but you can see that a space designs to be inspiring and relaxing and to encourage creativity has been saturated with curved round shapes from the weave of the carpets which doesn't necessarily dictate how you move through the space but at least visually softens the experience or encourages you in some way to move in that manner the soft edges of the sofa the ceiling fixtures the coat hanger the choice of the plant pots you know everything is being shifted towards the circular shape concept whereas compare that to the Denver Art Museum which you can see in the inset is from the outside just looks like a blade stuck in the ground you know something that you could 3d print on a small scale stick on a stick and threaten people with whereas inside just think about what the tactile experience is of running your hand down that staircase it's going to be very different to the sofa in the Google Dublin office if we shift media to comic book design and so what I'll do now is I have a series of comic and film anime examples and I'll give you a bit of a head starts to try and find the the compositional structure within these artworks and you'll see it's even though you're looking for it it's still sometimes hard hard to find but in this case what we have is you know comic book frames are usually vertical setting in increase the tension value of this scene fight scene between these two space cowboys the the frames are tilted the speech bubbles of course are much more angular but what's most important is this triangular line of movements across from right to left it being a Japanese coming and so here we can see that the the line again is the the narrative if you change the line and place these the gestures of these figures and are much more curving fluid motion then it would look more like a slapping and a gentle graceful striking experience rather than sort of a zigzagging threatening punch in the dolce & gabbana adverts you know we have this composition embedded there as well but in this case it's much more on the cultural content side because embedded in within this is a the motif of Cupid where we have triangles a triangular arrow sort of pointing at the heart shape on the right in Akira Kurosawa's work you know Akira Kurosawa's the most one of my celebrated directors in the world and he very greatly inspired people like George Lucas because the way he constructs the images in in a way very decadent he just spends as much time as he needs micro positioning every single actor and prop within the image to create these beautifully simple compositions which are as simple as the old masters you know like we saw with the Raphael and so in this case we have a very this kind of zigzagging wave and you can see that even though the characters which are supposed to representing dead soldiers on the grounds each one of them has had their leg positions in a way to lead up to this figure which is jumping off the the platform and so you can imagine just it's a hot day and the director saying please can you move your right leg 10 centimeters to the right a bit back you know and this is the kind of work that is involved in in creating this this sense of simplicity this engaging simplicity and it sort of highlights that simplicity is very hard to achieve complexity is is the equivalent of just yet you can arrive at complex things very easily but to gets very simple designs takes a lot of hard work in guardians of the galaxy as well here we have the advantage of post-production techniques and so on and which can even adjust the the gestures of the the actors because it just means that the axes also have to know where to stand and what the concept art is developed for the the scene in advance what is going to be a real prop what is going to be digitized and in this case we have a tilted Square which is a combination of gestures of the actors foreground props background props and some sort of semblance of the vignettes sometimes it's sort of also subjective you know you can't really say what the director was really thinking but there's a definite tilted square there embedded within that if you've watched Pixar's up then you'll know that Karl is the sort of the stuck character the one who finds it hard to move on and of course what shape is best suited for that it's no doubt there's the square and Elly is the dynamic character the one that brings the dynamic energy and impulsive sort of decisions to the relationship and if you read through the art of book for Pixar and on one of the very first pages you see that Karl has been depicted as a square and Elly has been to being depicted as a circle and so this is just a fantastic example of you know a mainstream a huge company Pixar and Disney using shape language because it speaks to people of all ages and all cultures and you know everything about these characters the visual DNA of each respect of the respective characters has Dean applied to everything associated them so you know Carl's square glasses he has a square on his book a square chairs square lampshade le he has some much more dynamic pose a very circular head circular so teacup and lampshade so it's just you know it's a very strong expression of who these characters are on the insights expressed through shape language something that we all understand and then we have the Lord of the Rings and you know I don't need to tell you that the hobbits are the the goodies in this narrative so they have very rounded shoulders they live in round table holes Hobbiton itself the Shire has winding pathways and rolling hills the the the elves of course how would you describe those they are very sort of very straightforward very logical characters very balanced characters and so their visual DNA is a combination of the vertical straight line and maybe some leaf nature motifs embedded in there so you can see the figure on the left you know you can see that through the way that the hair hangs down it gives the sense of calmness and that we we feel about them but also the positioning of his arrows you know you as it from imagination from memory I'm sure you've seen plenty of arrows that stick out sideways but the designers in this case made sure that there was this verticality in the positioning of the arrows on his back then of course the in the middle we on the right we have the the Queen's sort of standing there in a very vertical pose in the way she's holding the vase you know is something that is designed to reference the visual DNA and of course they live in in a forest so what where else would she find in nature lots of vertical lines and then called on the other end of the shape spectrum in opposition to the circle we have the triangular shape concept and that's from the pointed tips of sirens glove to the triangle on his volcano you know everything is referencing this this aesthetic and that comes down to the color choices and materials and many other things but this visual DNA is very very important and so with the people of that sort hope that you sort of appreciate that you know shape language is a thing it sort of has very deep roots in our DNA and there are academic studies that prove that and it sort of gives us a conceptual understanding of why this mean that I found on online is is so funny it says that fonts matter now you'll always be mine or you'll always be mine and so why is it funny as her so why is this funny and the thing is that we in the context of shape language and the signature copying exercise that I asked you to do at the beginning we can understand what the physical tension of that character is the one on the left of course is more fanciful and more fluid and the one on the right has much more jagged movements yes oh yeah I mean it does help that you know these are the ones on the right are much more brushy-brush a sort of impulsive strokes and the line quality but it's still the the physical tension of each character still will hold three and so that and that's what I want to focus on for this that it's not so much about the the font itself is more about the physical tension that we perceive of each of the author's if they start with oh yes yeah - - yes yeah yeah hey hey we will never know same so in summary in a way for the fundamentals part of this presentation you know we have the primary shapes the circle square and triangle and the squares we saw associative balance strength restraint tranquility and rest and it really just depends on the context you can sort of apply this in very varied ways the skewed triangle of conveys force and stability aggression or impulse and things I doesn't circle grace flew positive positivity continuity and movement and these are these represents our ABC of shape language you know there are the routes that we always return to you know as I demonstrated by the Pixar example in particular and that's not to say that we can use secondary shapes which are our combinations of these primary shapes or cultural symbols as well to embed those in the composition but the the slight drawback of that is that the more we dilutes these primary shapes they're more specific our audience becomes and so it's important you know the more you stick to the square circle and triangle the easier it is for us to as viewers to understand the functional value and the aesthetic value of these shapes and so just to to how you know the the half circle of course is a reference to the beetle the triangle the balanced triangle of the curved edges is a reference to the Buddha pose that we saw and the skewed box we saw in the guardians of the galaxy example and some of you may have studied the work of Duchamp so Duchamp highlighted sort of totes revolutionized modern art and he did many positive things for art's and very and a lot of negative things for for us he studied classical techniques in that he he highlighted that he he he said without unashamedly that everything is subjective but because he was an artist who created ready-made combined ready-made objects into artworks he missed this opportunity to to experience physical tension and the value of all these lines and so there's someone who I respect more than to champu sort of champions my perspective is Pablo Picasso who on hearing that Duchamp had died having had a long feud with the champ simply said he was wrong so how does this apply to interactive media we have you know going back to the Raphael example cultural contents and crafts in a videogame context we have a character like Super Mario you know Japanese an icon a videogame icon of Japanese origin again it might not be familiar to everybody and that's why it's a cultural of cultural value and even pixels you know they're becoming as TV displays become more and more high-resolution the idea of the perception of pixels becomes less and less obvious to everyday person you know when computers first arrived and pixels were in a very centrality to the graphics whereas on the crafts site we're no longer dealing with a two-dimensional static canvas we're dealing with something that can be very dynamic from from moments and moments can change and this is one additional interesting point about shape language is that it's spaces and maths in the same way that video games and virtual reality experiences are based on mathematics as well and of course we're dealing with a three dimensional space so it's we're no longer experiencing passively or sort of semi passively an artwork which is which we're looking at in a sense we we're part of the artwork we're sitting standing inside it and creating it as we go in collaboration with in some sort of a synchronous collaboration with the designers of the experience and this image that I've put in here is very important because it's shows Glen Keane he was one of the old masters of the Disney ink golden periods using Google's tilt brush and so tilt brush is the equivalent of Photoshop where you can just create artwork within the virtual space and what why this is important is because tilt brush is an uncreated experience if Glen Keane decides that he wants to create a very jagged aggressive experience he can you know there's nothing telling him not to in us a blank canvas if he wants to create something very curving in fluid he can there's nothing in tilt brush telling him that to guide him in this day action and so when we come to storytelling we have to find ways to orchestrate and influence viewers sort of the the participants within the space to encourage them to do the to complete the shapes and perform the shapes that we have decided to - as part that our importance to the storytelling experience and so what I've done here I've included the a work in progress in ways a game design framework all applicable to virtual reality and augmented reality as well and it's a methodology for orchestrating this very experience that I described so how its constructed is that it's it highlights the main elements of an interactive experience and so you cycle through it and as you explore each one you try to you use shape language to try to manipulates the the player to perform a particular action and in general the structure of it is that it works from very broad concepts from you know very large-scale influences to very local my neat influences with the hope that the the audience will respond in kind to the kind of ideas that you are applying and these are a reference to how paintings and even comment books are designed where you start off with a layout this is the top row which you can see there are lines which are guiding the viewer from one page to another as such as the path on the top and on the right and these can for you know if it's rain on the other side and this is all before the details are put in before the graphics are put on top so in a very simple demonstration it's the idea that in a way we're starting with something that is equivalent to the construct in the matrix where there is nothing you know the player in until brush is also in a similar situation there's nothing telling them what to do what not to do they create the content themselves whereas if we start with global objectives then or even sort of things that are of desire to the player or things that are a threat to the player then we'll have a match a very simple flow of movements the play will go towards points of interest and away through things which are of threats or threatening or have a threatening aesthetic to them so how do we start to shape that experience and a very simple example is shaping the pathway among which they travel you know if we make it very curving or very angular or very straights the player will be encouraged to move with like gestures and this might be on a video game of course there might be a simple thing like the thumb but in other experiences we can explore other modes of interaction and this is combined with the functionality of the surface along which they're traveling so on the right we have a screenshot from horizon zero dawn we're walking through tall grass gives you a stealth bonus so you're encouraged to move more stealthily and slowly through that space so we have a combination of gameplay functionality and shape language shaping the pathway to influence how the player feels and interacts with the space if you're dealing with augmented reality games like Rupert sort of mentioned the Pokemon go then we don't have the same ability to you know redefine and dynamically change the environment in which the player is currently standing in but as a experiments you can even just decide you know where those specific action events take place you know do they take place in a park where we have a very sort of like very high likelihood that they'll be curving pathways in a parks beaches and so on have very curving path ways because they visually reduce the tension of the environments but they also encourage you to walk in a particular way or do we have action take place in very straight functional lines or very jagged ones which are very very rare to find it took me four years to find that outsider conference space in in Paris I was very happy to have found it finally we don't think of buildings has been tactile if we don't wind up we don't run our hands along buildings in the same way that a tree hugger would but they do have tactile value it we understand the tactile value of buildings in the shape in the context of shape language so again if you're creating augmented reality experience or even if you're creating a film or anything where shape language is a value then picking the setting and the interior that matches the aesthetics that support the narrative that you're trying to convey in Emilia shots or demonstrates in in an article on on 80 levels you know that even in uncharted you know we uncharted as a game way you parkouring so jump running around and climbing on objects is central to the game central component of gameplay and so she very clearly defines the block things that are actually of value for the park chorong parts of gameplay by making sure that's everything that wasn't related to that had a different shape language associated of it so making the landscape more curving so that and things which are of danger or to be avoided to be triangular so that the player can orientate themselves more easily and through shape languages inherent universe universality to of course communicate with the player in a very primal way and even when we're dealing with characters you know the characters good characters tend to be very circular characters which are very mature in in videogames or very tank-like very powerful aligned with the square-shaped concept but it can also be very subtle so something like in the the costumes of a sense of verticality it relates to my question of which car would you choose you know that we will naturally identify of a particular shape and then also applies to what kind of clothing we and decorations we choose for a house and the triangle shapes don't mean that the you know we tend to associate those with evil characters but as with tracer from blizzards overwatch the one of the kind of lightning bolts coming out of her back pain away the the tracer tracer line you know she's she's a positive character and just conveys a slightly edgier more in pulse of personality to say someone who's totally aligns the circular-shaped concept and of course shape language doesn't work in isolation she can also have a character like this could also have very graceful fluid lines which would be an interesting contrast to the shape language but aside from these these things which are just vaguely that are introduced you know thinking about the pathways global objectives what is most important is the figure in the middle so the adaptive gameplay statics framework I designed so that what you start with is identifying the sensory experience of the player so in a narrative context what you want them to feel physically when they're interacting with your artwork interactive artwork and that relates to the game interface which is the first step once you've identified that sensory experience and this is the interesting part that in a way the interactive media that we use are very analogous to drawing as I mentioned this the sketch Club that I manage where we draw and response to physical inputs and express something which is of a static value in relationship to what we see then it's important for us to understand what are in particular the continuous multi-directional inputs of the media that we're working with with a Playstation controller it's the analog stick which allows us to have drawing likes gestures with virtual reality you know it can be the the controllers in the hands but also like the pivot of the head and the fact that the whole body can can begin to move and this is what's exciting about the the framework in a way is that we we can use drawing to define the sensory experience so here's an example a study I did have inside one of my favorites games which are highly recommends where at the bottom I did an environment sketch second is a blind drawing where you just looking at what you're at the arts work without looking down at the page and then a summary of the shape language the lines and that I experienced so here's just an example of this this kind of movement these motion lines in particular that have the strongest effect on the player and so what I ask you to do is to just if you can if you're not I don't feel too self-conscious just to follow the the motion lines of these characters is if you are copying the signatures at the beginning and just be aware of what your body is doing so these are going to be slightly more delicates that in reference the designers used as our sea creatures this is the in science and then the vanquishment which is the triangular energy efficient from everything from the way the character moves to the responsiveness of the camera as being aligned to the shape and so by even just by studying these games this is these are more studies of insight you can see it's sort of the structure of the narrative or a slice of its where at the beginning you have more horizontal movements back and forth then you enter a submarine in the middle and the movements become much more jagged and then on the right is a this observational drawing study where the the character is actually swimming freely through the water and the movements are much more delicate and gentle and so at each change in this interactive narrative the physical experience is changing and so we you know when we come to virtual reality and augmented reality we're taking on this heritage of this all all of these experiments in painting and animation and comics you know and to to it's important to understand that again we're not dealing with a revolution in arts we're dealing with an evolution so a game like beat saber you know you can use the trace the trace of the trail left behind you can artistically alter that - in amplify certain gestures that you want to convey this is the dear Angelica that I mentioned earlier it's a beautiful experience where even at the beginning what is happening is that a line is being dynamically drawn it's sort of the title of the experience and you can imagine that the viewer of course is that the player is following these lines and responding to the aesthetics of what is happening on-screen and so all the time that body is is responding to the the shape language that you see in a much more physical full-bodied way than the console game could ever achieve in the game like superhot VR you can see that's where enemies are spawns and how bullets fly towards you you can even have micro adjustments on the position of your head so you're ducking down moving things around this is a very sort of objective driven experience you know you have to beat the baddies but it's what I want to highlight is that we can use this and much more artistic and meaningful ways to to micro adjust the player and the last one is just to think about the space itself so here's a game on scene diplomacy where you have to sort like an escape room virtual escape room where and the player has to crawl through the space and then once they're through it's they can stand up you know in contrast that with something like escape sort of edge of light where you have moments where you know you're in these canyons which have unlimited headspace you know and how the player might stand up straight when they can compared to that the previous experience and so you know this is just where I asked you you know what shape do you identify yourself with but as designers we have to ask ourselves what shapes do we want our players and our so our audience to adopt and this is what's most important and for this we have to in a way move away from thinking about virtual reality in video games as a simple objective driven experiences where you have to do something and this aligns with what well Disney said about animation but at first the cartoon medium was just a novelty but it never really began to hit until we had more than tricks you have to have pathos or empathy in the thing and you know having just focusing games on objectives and winning beating the end-of-level boss is the novelty you know this is what the the the the first initial state of the medium is and we have to start to think how we can use this existing these mechanics to motivate more artists experience so I just encourage you to be autism's first to understand your craft and secondly that will make you user experience experts and in whichever field field you decide to work with whether you're in virtual reality architects film directors this is the transmedia value of these principles and this is my favorite cartoon which relates to what I my son is called Charlie as well after this character but Charlie's explaining that when he if you want to enjoy feeling depressed the you have to stand like this head down back bent over and the worst thing you could do is to tilt your head back you know straighten up here yourself and look up because then you would accidentally start to feel better so don't do that if you want to feel depressed to stand like this and this is that the power of virtual reality and and sort of these interactive experiences to to alter our mood in a very artistic meaningful way that in and connect us with what is happening in the virtual space so thank you very much I'm sorry it's like III know I overrun by quite a bit so it's but I'm still happy of course to answer any questions that you may have and other I don't have the references here but there is oh it was just like is this is this response to shape language hard-coded in us in our DNA or is it sort of culturally learns and you know can we be sure that the artists actually embedded those shapes into the artwork and that I don't have the I wouldn't be able to remember the names of the academic papers that that references but there's very clear evidence that this is in our DNA so how we this passed down in our DNA that our minds have preferences for particular shapes and there's something which is reinforced during the early stages of developments when we are when babies are interacting with the environment you know the first time that they cut themselves on the sharp objects their survival instincts reinforce this in a very tactile way and often is actually when it comes to shape language being embedded in artwork and compositions I would say most of the time it's very intuitive and that that people just have a physical understanding or sort of like a natural understanding of what will make the thing they're doing creating more angular aggressive or friendlier but it's important of course to have a more sophisticated understanding of this so that you can have a better command of the artwork that you're you're sculpting and the experience that you're orchestrating in Cuba [Applause] [Music]
