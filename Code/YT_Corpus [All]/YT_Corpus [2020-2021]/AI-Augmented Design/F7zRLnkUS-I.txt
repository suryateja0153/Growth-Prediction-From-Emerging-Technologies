 We've all been here before. The blank page, the misery of not being able to find the right words to express your ideas. But what if you could write as fast as you can think? What if you could type a simple idea and, just by pressing a key, transform it into a full expression of your thoughts? This is Textio Flow. It's a powerful new technology that changes the way it feels to write. Here's how it works: I type a sentence, a phrase, or even just a single word, and then press Tab. Textio Flow writes along with me, completing my thoughts with rich and effective language. If something doesn't sound quite right, I can choose a different version, or just change what Textio wrote. I'm still the writer, but now finding my right language is effortless. The right words just flow from my fingertips. Because Textio knows how I write, how my company sounds, and what language actually works in the real world, it takes the struggle out of finding the perfect turn of phrase. Writing that used to take hours gets done in minutes. Welcome to Textio Flow, the new way to write.
