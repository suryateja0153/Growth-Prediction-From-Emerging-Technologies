 hello innovators welcome to the bridging the gap' podcast you're invited to join my mission to embrace and share the innovations transforming the AEC MEP and manufacturing industries my guest today is the senior product manager for aec generative design at Autodesk she's an architect with a passion for re-envisioning the way that buildings are designed after working for several years as an architect she joined Revit technology as a fledgling startup where she helped grow it to where it is today in almost every architects toolbox she has gone on to work on many Autodesk tools including formant dynamo project factual and project refinery where which has just graduated from beta welcome to the show Lily Smith thanks I'm very excited to talk to you all about a generative design great so let's start off kind of setting the terms how would you define generative design so that is a good question and causes a lot of a lot of people are asking that in the industry and I think the way that we are defining generative design generative workflows and I like to call it kind of generative design with a lowercase G and a lowercase D is really about a workflow and it's about a workflow that uses data and computers to help you generate a lot of options that you can then analyze and compare against each other so it's really about you know the generation part is the computer is helping you generate options it can be a little bit misleading to some people because it's not coming up with those options itself right the computer is not generating these designs out of the blue it's definitely based on the models that you describe and the inputs that you are giving it to and the geometry parameters that you're giving it to make these models catcha it's not a magic button designed to wipe the architect out it is not a magic it is something that architects really I think should learn about and partner with to enhance their design workflows gotcha how did you first get interested in all things generative design yeah so the problem of how can we design better buildings has really been a question that has guided my career so as you were saying intro you know I started out working on Revit when it was a start-up because I thought what they were trying to do with three B Building Information modeling was really a big improvement over what was available at the time with 2d computer-aided drafting um and after we were bought by Autodesk I kept working on Revit and it was really you know a thrill to see it doc did by so many architects mom and after a couple of years of that I was really psyched to work on some of the first energy analysis tools in Revit it was um like in 2007 I don't know if you remember like Al Gore's movie that came out the Inconvenient Truth which oh yeah really spurred a lot of people into action around what are we gonna do about climate change and so I was really psyched to be able to work on kind of next-generation tools looking at how can we automate the creation of energy analysis our models from Building Information models that were appropriate and good to use in our early energy simulations which would give you data about the you know at an early stage when you can really make changes about what your model is or what your energy use was going to be but the thing with that was that we have this great process to create automatically these energy models but it was really a one-off right like you were you design the mass the form of your building and test it but there was no way to automate like what if I turned it five degrees and tested it each you know each iteration of or if I had different parameters for its ratio of length and width and I wanted to test all of those things you know I could do that manually but what could you know computers are really good at doing kind of rote perhaps boring work like those men dude yeah how do you optimize it better how do you optimize that process better exactly and yeah how can you use optimization also to help you think through those various options um so around the same time Autodesk research was also doing some studies around generative design so we Autodesk research actually bought this architecture firm called the living mom and they were working out of New York City and they were really interested interested in applying some of these concepts of generative design because it wasn't you know this is not a new thing like generative design has been in art and architecture for you know decades but they were really interested in seeing you know okay how can we use the concept of these workflows and apply them to to real projects and so they did some really successful projects on redesigning one of our Autodesk offices in Toronto and also redesigning the entire show floor at AU 2018 well Mars sorry au 2017 and then those ideas our customers were like we really want to be able to do that too how do we do that yeah so that was how we really kind of got the energy in the company and the money in the company to invest in making some of these technologies available for more people to try them because that's you know what Autodesk is really like husband founded on is bringing these technologies to a lot of to a lot of people oh nice so you've been working on some next-gen solutions that are just for a while what's been one of the biggest changes that you've seen in that time the the biggest changes in how we make technology or sure yeah uh-huh just to the technology landscape what's ten years in technology that's like 100 years has there been some sort of kind of big moment that you would be like oh wow that's when things really changed in the last 10 years well a couple things I mean architecture and adoption of technology actually takes a long time I mean you know a lot of people are still using 2d CAD and you know a lot of people are using 3d Building Information modeling but you know it's been like 10 years moving towards just adopting that technology so it actually you know moves slower than technology and in a lot of places but things like um you know things like the cloud have had a huge effect you know we were in the current climate of you know this pandemic and working from home you know Autodesk really invested several years ago in sharing technologies using the cloud and investing and making that secure and making it work well so that people could work from you know we already had the problem before people working between different offices and it turns out that now when they're all working from home that technology is really helping them to stay you know productive in these projects that they're to do right yeah no that's great so why do you think genders did design hasn't been as embraced this quickly maybe back to your point of it takes a while for technology adoption to really go into place why do you do you think the degenerative design part of it has been yeah just not as widely embraced across the yeah well I think we we've been in beta projects we you know we started with project fractal 40 years ago and then we kind of took a little different tact because we wanted to make a tool that worked better with Revit which is on the desktop and also took advantage of a lot of the community work around the Dynamo package manager for people to share little bits of code so we we took a different tact with project refinery and made it work locally and you know that we have just graduated that now into Revit 2021 as a tool that was really widely available to people so it hasn't you know it's been available in a public beta for a couple of years but you know getting it out we joke that the best software tool that there is really is a is an installer right because if you give people like a huge list of instructions about how to install this beta it is it can be really a barrier to getting them dirty with it right like sure it's intimidating after step four but um now we have the opportunity that we actually have it installed with rabbit 2021 so you don't have to do anything now to start experimenting with these tools yeah that's awesome what have you seen as the response so far with the big announcement that it's in Revit 2021 it's been I mean I think a lot of people are it's the concept is actually you know while it's been in the industry for a long time the concept of actually being able to do this is new to a lot of people um so you know we've seen a huge spike in use though already which would be expected because it's just such a larger audience that we can about you know we have sure and people are interested in trying out these new tools so you know time will tell and see how how sticky they are and you know and we really we ship with some sample content that people that are rabbit users and not coders themselves can get started with okay nice but really to do to conduct generative workflows that are useful to what your projects are and how your firm designs buildings you need to invest in making or tweaking our scripts to do what you know your special design secrets are yeah to customize it more yeah got it so you mentioned this a little bit earlier what should the the partnership between the architect and generative design look like yeah so I think a lot of people are scared that they think that the computer automation is going to come in and take over their jobs but that is you know it's really there's a lot of work and really a change of mindset that designers need to do to take advantage of these technologies because you know just sitting down with a team and thinking about okay what are our goals for this design what are we going to study in terms of what's going to be like what our design variable is going to be you know are we going to look at is change in massing proportions is that make a difference and how are we going to measure how effective these different resulting forms are just sitting down and having that conversation with a diverse group of people who have input to this to the project um can be a really good exercise and you know there are things that it should not be done with a generative workflow like there are it's it's not worth it to do all workflows this way right there are some that that really are that by studying these you know slight changes or even big changes but that have you know a lot of bang for your buck that like changing things a little bit could mean a huge cost savings it can be really worth it to use the computer to help you study more generations yeah that's interesting are there certain kind of best use cases that you see for generative design where you get that bigger bang for your buck yeah I mean so we've worked with people what are the ones that comes to mind is some people in the Netherlands who are looking at laying out shipyards and it had a big effect for them where they located those shipyards or sorry I really like docks like dry docks like places to fix ships so they're making but they're looking at various places along a coastline and the implications of where they would have to kind of move more dirt or you know fill in some of that land to make their docks can have millions of dollars of implications you know making roadways and curving them certain ways contain a big difference architectural use case is like looking at reducing the number of different panels you have to create you know a irregular form can be a really worthwhile endeavor to study and it can also mean that you know if you invest in making a script like that it can be used over and over again so I would say like that is the other place where it can really make sense we see people all in one firm in Hong Kong was doing a ton of donut-shaped office layouts and so they invested in scripts that would help them to study those kinds of layouts because they were doing it over and over again on many different kinds of buildings in tourism so look for those repeatable place yeah yeah repeatable plays or plays with with you know big money implications big design implications involved interesting how much coding is needed to effectively run generator design well yeah so it really depends on what you wanted to do right like we are working to provide out-of-the-box scripts that can be used by any Revit user without having to necessarily invest in learning Dynamo and you know if you want to do what we have programs or you know are the goals and the sample set happen to match your goals and that will you know that can work for you our newer scripts let you automatically study layout patterns like grid patterns and you can use those for lights or sprinklers or smoke detectors and measure kind of how effective their placement is but you'll probably want to make modifications or add goals or change a little bit how they how they work and so you know the other part of this strategy to make this a very open-ended back-end is to use dynamo which is a visual scripting language and the intent of dynamo is to make it easier for architects and engineers to program geometry program measuring the effectiveness of that geometry in certain cases and you don't have to be a coder if you are willing to learn how to kind of put these little locks together with wires that will you know it's a little piece of functionality and hooks up to another piece of functionality and you can string things together in an easier way there's no compiling of code you just you just hook them together and then then run it interesting yeah and there's also a big dynamo community that is answers questions on the forum the dynamo forum is very active and it also they also share scripts what I was mentioning on the Dynamo package manager or people are sharing code and using that to you know make their solutions faster awesome so I'm curious with you being an architect is generative design turn the architect Union kind of known for being the creative does it turn an architect more into the rural based programmer well you know I think you can think creatively about how you are designing this generative study right like you have to there's a lot of thought that goes into designing the automated workflow right like it has to what are the bounds of that workflow like how much are you to allow your building to stretch in a certain dimension in or in length or you know what pattern are you going to start with to test these different automated layouts with and so I think a lot of the skills that designers have with you know conceptualizing you know doing a also starting with a party can be a very important thing so for the Toronto office layout they have they started with like six different ideas of parties of how they wanted to lay out this office and then within each of those parties they've studied how it can how it can flex how it can bury and then they were able to measure the parties kind of against each other and against you know make the optimum one in each party so I think there's still a lot of for sure you know skills that are applicable to new generative design mindset thinking but still a lot of skills that designers have that are still very important parts of design that the computer can just spend augment and let you study a lot more than you could yeah no I think that's really interesting because it's it's not taking the creativity away its kind of shifting it and kind of adding a whole new dimension an element to it to let your creativity kind of go to to new bounds which is I think pretty exciting yeah I think nice what are some lessons learned from project refinery so refinery I was mentioning so we started with project fractal and that was a tool that was running in the cloud we had basically dynamo instances that you could run scripts with that were running in the cloud and people really liked the sharing aspects of that so being able to send you a link and say hey look at the study that I did was a really great convenience mom but as I was mentioning people also wanted to work a lot more closely with Revit and they wanted to leverage this really strong dynamo community of shared scripts that they that they wanted to use so our team was working on fractal we took a little break and then we came back and we decided to take a different tact for a while and bring everything local in a way that we can return to the cloud certainly in the future because doing you know me right now we run on your desktop six instances of dynamo in the background and were to in in order to you know speed up the process of making these different designs Tom but you know that is a functionality that is very right to return to the cloud where you could offload that from your computer you know not have well your computer right now has a lot of power especially computers Explorer using for a rabbit um you know it might be nice to also be able to do that in the cloud and then also be able to to share those just share those strips so we you know what we are have these projects these beta projects because we want to get feedback from our users so we learned that we should try this other tactic and it was pretty successful and allowed us to to graduate project refinery into a tool that is now part of Revit 2021 awesome yeah and we're still learning you know I mean this is like our first go at having this out there and we're definitely still learning from our customers doing user testing on new features that we're building and gathering feedback from people so yeah we're definitely still learning and still working on improving things so yeah it's exciting that's awesome so there can be a lot of results that come back when you run generative design how do you not get overwhelmed by all the options right so it's very important to work on declaring your goals right and use that as a guiding factor and one of the you know one of the benefits of this kind of tool is in architecture and engineering workflows there are calling multi variable optimization right there's more than one factor that is changing and more than one factor that you are evaluating because there's a lot of different factors that you would that you would consider when you're making building and it's not that we're gonna have all of the factors are going to be able to factor into this but it's important what you choose and then how you measure it and we you know we try to make tools that can allow you to filter down the number of options that you're seeing to just certain ranges and you can do that after the fact so that if you maybe you don't know what exactly you have some idea of what your goals are because you had to set those up as outputs in the in the study but you maybe you don't know exactly what you're what you're looking for you can do a random search through the design space that you set up and then after the fact you can go and say okay I really want to look at the you know in the massing example I want to look at the what all the short buildings all the short forms and I want to see how they perform with this other parameter where I want to look at all the tall ones so just being able to rank them and filter them on different criteria that you're measuring can be a really helpful way to look through the results we also use optimization so we have a couple different methods in our generation how we generate designs right so there's things that can do this random search but there's also a method where you can set up what your goals are beforehand and say okay I want to maximize the height of this tower so only the ones that are the tallest ones are going to then they return to your study and so you can in that way you can get the computer to help you on generation after generation of studies that it's running return only the ones that satisfy the goals that you set before hand so that's another way that you can do this you know filtering down of all of the designs that are in your design space because depending on how many input variables you have and also what the ranges are and how many tests you're doing with each range you know the numbers can get very big very fast for how many designs you're looking at sure yeah so it sounds like it's well you can filter on the backend the more you can do kind of up front and get organized get your goals in line the better yes yes I would say that you know just having that conversation with your team about what's important and what you're gonna look at studying you know in some cases you kind of like stop right there but but using you know using the computer to then I made that conversation yeah I love it I think anything to get you closer and better at collaborating and communication with across teams is awesome but very much needed right right and we think that having this data and these sets of designs that you can then filter through we see people having much better conversations with our stakeholders because they have this data and they can say you know okay let's look at if these things are the best or you know you know Mike tall buildings let's look at all the short squat solutions next to the event let's look at the tall solutions and you can see the data that is resulting from each of those solutions it can be helpful or they could say no I don't like let's not measure this on just square footage like I also care about the how much surface area there are like it's gonna be really expensive besides materials so actually can you minimize how much surface area these designs are because that is really important so just having that conversation can get out what goals are important for your stakeholders - yeah interesting what's one misconception that people have around generative design that you'd love to knock down well so we talked about how people think it's going to take the place of the architect and I you know I definitely don't think that that is true you know I think architects and designers engineers need to learn how to use tools like this to augment their workflows another misconception is that a lot of people think that it's magic that the computer is going to somehow do this for you automatically I mean it's not your fairy godmother it's computers are really dumb like what they do exactly what you tell them so you you are you know like right now maybe you know in the future we'll start being able to use you know machine learning or some kind of AI to help us to make these scripts in an easier way but you know machine learning is also only learning from examples that it had in the past right right like it's so garbage in garbage out right and then I would just say that not all design problems lend themselves to generative workflow you really have to be able to identify what you want to vary and how you're going to measure success but also ask yourself you know is it worth it to invest in writing a script if I don't have one that works on this problem mm-hmm yeah interesting well my last question for you what are you most excited about the possibilities of generative design so given the challenges that we are facing right now with this crazy new world this pandemic I am extra glad that we decided to go with a very open approach to our generative design tools so for example we shipped with one of our examples that we shipped with is this office layout script and when we were making this script you know a couple months ago it was assumed that the goals for office layout would always be how could you efficiently you know pack as many desks in to a room right but how things change things change and who know you're gonna need something really different assumptions change and so it's really important to have tools that can change with the world right and it isn't the kind of thing that you can just build into input parameters knowing all those input parameters before the world changed in a crazy way but you know we're gonna have a lot of work to do in the next few years to next several years you know on a desk and well the world projects that in 2050 there's going to be 10 billion people on the earth and if we're gonna build enough buildings to accommodate all of those people not kill the earth and be able to keep everybody healthy we are going to absolutely have to use automation to help us do that work and you know be able to design and build safe and you know carbon neutral buildings for the way forward yeah no that's awesome that's great point two to end on there thank you so much for for coming really enjoyed unpacking all things generator design with you yeah thanks a lot for having me I
