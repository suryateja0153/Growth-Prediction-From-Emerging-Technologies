 so it's a pleasure to be here in Las Vegas to present to you now I get invited to do keynotes across the globe and while it's easy for me to be here in Las Vegas it isn't always easy for me to travel across the world and even when I do I can't always speak the local language well what if neither language nor distance mattered for me to deliver a fantastic keynote what if technology could help me be anywhere I needed to be and speak any language I wanted well it can we are bringing together the power of mixed reality and Azure AI services to create a truly game-changing experience what you're about to see is an exact hologram of me wearing the same outfit that we recently captured at a mixed reality studio and I don't speak Japanese but what if I wanted to deliver my keynote in Japanese using Azure AI technology I can translate my English into Japanese and train it to sound exactly like me the same voice tones those same inflections now we brought this together my hologram and as Rai to show you what's possible so first I'm gonna put on my hololens to hear and then we'll flip in the room to the special camera so you can see exactly what I'm seeing let's get started first let me introduce you to mini-me there she is my perfect holograph and thanks to the power of hololens - she just floats right with me I'm literally holding my hologram so natural now she's a little small to do a keynote so let's get her up so she can do full-sized Japanese keynote render keynote providing us what does that about sizing of Google gains its capture Gidget socio see what does in a hologram was accessed Amos did I know Jim boots ahora gramma to estimate a kotoba are commercially Masanga what a cigar design in nihongo Hannah stay tuned Agha a Pharisee notice what does your new home go Hannah seem a singer but the Sunoco a hologram you WA can pick in any home Hoda honest Amos Korea a neurotic estoy yo me agita Oh buddy resides in notes in casino digits you irony at ATT socio schemas Podesta to achieve una corner ago COC personality covetous additional codes in taking on session a success mass nihongo conference ago boruto gargle madonna Sema's EEMA Koenig is its wha what a static ah Hatake sob say katsu ho holy cast a sec I dunno cope Kyoya so he Kyoto in Osaka Tokido Kyoto so so steamy Takeda say Missoni see hygge games it's an inheritor goddess as you can see this is mind blowing technology and what you just saw was my life-size hologram my exact replica rendered here in real time speaking Japanese with my unique voice signature to do this we use mixed reality technology to create my hologram and render it here live then we use Azure speech-to-text capability in English transcription to get my speech then use Azure translate to get this in this Beach into Japanese and finally applied neural text-to-speech technology so it sounded exactly like me just speaking Japanese and the most amazing part all of these technologies exists today the future is here
