 hi I'm Tommy Thompson and welcome to the same dive here on AI in games in recent years a hot topic within the games industry as the adoption of microtransactions where players are encouraged to spend money on a variety of small add-ons that can change cosmetic appearance of characters or outright influence the overall experience in addition you've had loot boxes where you don't know what item you're getting until you take the gamble and open the box throw this current generation of gaming we've seen a significant increase in these monetization models being employed in large-scale commercial titles without appropriate consideration to a point that it's received significant backlash not just from players but it has now invoked the ire of governments around the world and regulation is hot on everyone's mind in this episode I want to dive into this issue why it's so problematic but more importantly from me the clear and present danger the AI presents to consumers as its adopted in these monetization systems now before we get into the meat of this video I want to make two points first let me stress that the points I'm making are not based on evidence I found of specific AI applications to microtransactions and loot boxes and commercial games but rather an argument based on my knowledge and understanding of this industry our game publishers aggressively pursue in game monetization and how these machine learning technologies can be employed in this space so while this is purely conjecture on my part it's an educated argument or at least you know I laid to think it is and I strongly imagine that some of what I am suggesting is either on the horizon if not already underway secondly as you'll notice throughout this video my focus is on the behavior of publishers not developers game developers often receive the bulk of criticism and then subsequently harassment for something they have little to no C n as a game is being Vell and that is frankly unacceptable my experienced developers are like players often having to work around the realities of having these microtransactions injected into the games are involved with as such if you have a bone apec with the topics of this video you take it to the publisher and more importantly you speak with your wallet you don't like what's happening here don't spend the money so let's go back to the beginning microtransactions are as the name implies an effort to have players of a game spend small amounts of money as part of the ongoing interaction enjoyment of the product these small purchases often are tied to elements that are cosmetic in nature such as costumes for characters or they can have some actual value in the context of the game itself this could mean extra lives in candy crush or new characters in a game such as Marvel contest of Champions the concept ro is predominantly from mobile gaming in late 2000s were instead of selling games at a specific price point they're completely free to download but your ability to progress in these games and the rate at which you do so is often heavily tied to the amount of real-world money players and jacks into it this is certainly a popular and lucrative format but it requires players to continue to invest their time and more importantly their cash into the game itself with thus leading to a variety of complex and convoluted economies emerging in these games to not only reinforce the need to spend money but obfuscate the true value of the money being spent and how valuable the items are that you're spending money on this has been compounded by the loot box an idea that existed in mobile gaming firm you know best part of 10 years before being popularized in the console PC gaming market by overwatch published by Activision Blizzard in each instance players open a box that has one or more items of potential value to players these boxes can typically be earned through in-game activity but a relatively slow pace however they can more easily be attained by spending money within the game's economy in each instance the probability of a valuable item is often incredibly low and only now are games being forced in some markets to display the probabilities of attaining the most lucrative items on offer all of these practices have continued to evolve and mutate as they thrive not just in mobile but also in console and PC gaming spaces however there has been some pushback as it moves further into the PC and console market given that these economies are being injected into paid products players have already spent safe for a quid or $60 on the game with publishers subsequently trying to squeeze more cash or other player much of the triple-a game industry most notably Activision take to interactive and Electronic Arts has embraced this well the argument is often made that these micro transactions utter reality brought on by the ever-increasing costs of game development many of these publishers have seen revenues and intern profits skyrocket largely due to end game monetization one need only look at Electronic Arts as FIFA and Madden franchises were the ultimate team component of these games where players purchase random digital cards based on real-world sport stars garnered 1.1 billion dollars of revenue in 2018 that's more than the box games themselves an account not just for 50% of all revenue from digital products by the publisher but is also 21% of EA's total revenue for that fiscal year publishers want micro transactions to stay because they're making them a lot of money and they'll go to great efforts to achieve it it's been a huge point of consternation for players given the impact it has on how games are designed and the psychological manipulation that becomes laced through a given title and an effort to encourage you to spend money in a previous design dive on Dark Souls I discussed her games bail reward loops and feedback systems to encourage continued play and provide a sense of progression while this temperately is laced and two-player performance and perseverance in the case of Dark Souls many economy driven games either stifle or limit that progression without a further injection of cash or outright inhibitor while many publishers and strangely the players who play their games often defend these practices given the additions found in micro transactions and loot boxes are cosmetic in nature it is a deliberate choice that inhibits a player's engagement or enjoyment cosmetic items are often heavily tied into the social element of play in these games you'll know that most loot box heavy games are ones with online multiplayer whereby you're not just defeating the enemy team but you're doing it while showing off your cosmetic bling this adds a social stigma to an existing pressure to engage in the monetization given it creates fashion trends within the ecosystem in the game this may seem trivial to some but in the case of games such as fortnight it can actually lead to bullying in schools towards kids who don't spend money given their default for the free original skins everywhere you go monetization leaden games are deliberately constructed to steer players towards end game purchases with lucrative offers made early in a game to get you on board as well as periodic deals that encourage you to maybe put down a few Bob here and there to get that item you wanted this combined with the obfuscation of the in-game economy can have a crippling effect on players and the Wallis Patil if the player in question suffers from say a gambling addiction or they're a child and don't understand what they're getting into in game monetization is not restricted in accordance with player age as such when games like fifa are rated by the Peggy and ESRB rating bodies as safe for children they don't factor the monetization systems involved Plus in some instances publishers such as Activision frequently add the monetization system as an update to the game after it is rated and released in an effort to avoid negative press and the build-up to launch all of this further adding to the confusion and sort of tisha Slee driving you towards spending money in addition to all this is the battle pass approach this is adopted in the likes of free-to-play games like dota 2 and is very popular in battle royale games like fortnight and apex legends but they are rather upfront about what they're doing given it's clear what you're paying for as well as what you can attain however they're actually still a bit nasty I think given their essentially a purchase that requires a time commitment given that the unlocks but then Abajo pass are often not available after the original gameplay season that that pass is associated with now in late 2019 we're seeing this begin to reach a critical juncture as publishers brazenly slap more and more microtransactions on premium $60 products aimed children without fear of reprisal however gambling Commission's and governments around the world are now looking to intervene while some countries of array banned loot box behaviour given the principle of spending money Albion directly for a random reward is tantamount to gambling others such as the United States and the United Kingdom are now investigating what new forms of legislation could and should be implemented to protect vulnerable individuals from what as an otherwise quite predatory behavior this is resulted in the lake's of EA in epic games being brought forward to speak at committee level of the UK government this is a pretty scary proposition as ei packed like a bunch of chancers by drawing parallels to the lakes of kinder eggs and collectible card games and an effort to normalize their behavior as surprise mechanics which is professionally speaking a load of old horse so why am I talking about all of this two words player analytics it's a process where you gather up data on mass about the behavior of players within your game in order to better understand what they're doing and how they're going about it over on the main AI in game series I've explored analytics a couple of times already with the lakes of the psyops project been able to establish our players adopt specific gameplay responsibilities in battlefield depending on their personality or more critically their age meanwhile the video exploring research into mater underworld highlighted one of the first real efforts by developers to understand what is happening in their game after it's released into the wild by reading data from players over the Xbox Live Network but perhaps more critically is the episode from back in 2017 where I explored academic research that examined the Team Fortress 2 hat economy as we explored in the episode there are distinct correlations that can be established from perceived social status in the games ecosystem to the quality of virtual items they possess and the distinct profiles of players that exist within that space ranging from those that are simply uninterested to those who crave attaining the most lucrative items perhaps most critically is the research itself warns of sociological issues that can emerge when social dynamics intersect with virtual economies with the very real threat of privilege and marginalization emerging in these communities exactly what's happening now in font light now all of these research projects are comparatively quite old now the Team Fortress and battlefield research date back to around 2012 2013 while the tomb raider underworld project dates back all the way to 2009 back when originally published the idea of recording player data to gather fairly accurate information about behavioral traits was very much in its infancy now in 2019 any publisher working on a live service game will have entire day assigns divisions dedicated to player analytics and other heavily data-driven field it's an entire facet of game development that has only really emerged in the last five to ten years these teams can be focused perhaps on individual titles or all titles under one publisher analytics of player data is equally applicable to your behavior around monetization as for any other in-game activity now this has been happening especially in mobile games for a few years now such as identifying the types of products people buy and whether particular levels of a game are where most players are getting stuck given it provides an ample point to sell a booster pack at a discounted rate but there are already machine learning driven metrics regularly used when assessing a player's engagement in a particular game and one of the most well-known examples is called churn prediction churn prediction is used in a variety of consumer services on the web and it's used to identify when you the customer become a earner meaning you're not going to continue to engage in a particular service and more critically you're not going to pay them for it hence Amazon goes out the way to send you emails if you haven't bought anything in a while or Netflix might encourage you to try out a new show if you haven't used your subscription and they're worried you're not going to renew all of this in an effort to put your money back into their ecosystem now churn prediction in games is identifying two key things related to players and microtransactions first of all I didn't find the ratio of churn within the game where by examining in-game behavior of all players you can understand what proportion of the audience will spend money on micro transactions within a period of time ever and secondly the churn rate at what point the players turn into churners churn prediction can be achieved using a variety of machine learning technologies that's kind of beyond the scope of this video but is readily possible once you combine this with player segmentation where you cluster and categorize players based on specific attributes ranging from in-game performance to your engagement with the monetization services then you're getting to the interesting but also scary point an abstract level the entire playerbase can be analyzed to see what's happening where are the problems in the game what bouncing issues need to be addressed but also what monetization packages are proving popular and how many players are not spending money I don't wait to be doom and gloom above AII in the show and I rarely ever am in fact a Iying Games was built to challenge the stigma and bad reporting that surrounds artificial intelligence but the problem as triple-a publishers are really embracing this stuff and they don't have a great track record with monetization as it is right now we're in a position what a top-level decisions can be made to rebalance and tweak parts of a game and in the context of monetization edits can be made to the economy of a game such that things become easier or harder meanwhile at present new promotional products can be released into the economy and targeted towards players who have never spent money or spend very little money this is a tactic that already exists within mobile gaming given it's a little easier to make these changes so quickly and that it's appealing to a broader base of consumers that are a little less incensed by at all no take this to the next logical step this is the big conjecture part by the way where your machine learning prediction systems become ongoing real-time services where a game can pull these analytic services to make judgments on what changes to make to the game you're playing to encourage you to spend money in real time say it game is tweaking its economy and progression systems and even coming up with unique and bespoke products for you this particular player based on your current gameplay experience and it's being driven by the analytic services that have been built this is sense Gaede yes is it far-fetched I don't think so otherwise I wouldn't be talking about it don't forget in 2017 Activision was granted a patent based on ideas of manipulating matchmaking to encourage use of microtransactions be that to give you an advantage in the game or just to force you to play against opponents with cooler outfits or costumes how do you think such a system would be able to identify what brackets you fall into for the matchmaking process this right here is what I'm worried about imagine games are being tailored to appeal to both casual and more hardcore players with the in-game monetization prioritizing specific aspects of player behavior within those sectors perhaps for the more hardcore it's offering better deals on cosmetics while the more casual audiences are getting better for dances for progression given they want to avoid a grain that's been artificially inflated in real time I can see this happening in mobile given as I said mobile audiences are typically as actively engaged in the media that surrounds a game plus many of these games are actually isolated individual titles without a larger multiplayer meta that players are commonly trying to establish plus there are products out there offering machine learning driven analytics for mobile developers again I recognize the value of it but all it takes is for one stupidly popular game to figure out how to take less than a dark road and pull it off naturally I'm worried about my hobby or whatever my relationship to games has become in recent years but this could be a real red flag that could impact more vulnerable individuals who are skirting around games that have been soaked in micro transaction models there needs to be a better understanding of what these systems can do and how they're being employed in particular games with legislation help perhaps the government's are often slow to understand how technology works and then make the most heavy-handed an ill-judged decisions this is why we're in this situation to begin with given nobody really notice the effect all this is having on games and their players until now plus if you consider my two biggest audiences on this channel the US and the UK I don't think either country can really advocate for how clued and their governments are when it comes to protecting the well-being of their citizens from technological upheaval oh I'm just getting depressed thinking about it is this all being blown out of proportion I'd like to think so but on the other hand this is an idea that I can imagine investors are salivating at the prospect of right now there's next to no consumer protection or appropriate guidance given when using these sorts of practices particularly loot boxes only know the time of rating this video did news break the platform holders will start to release the odds of loot boxes several years after they flooded the market it's a star but I don't think it's gonna be enough either way I think it's real food for thought and well this is a bit of a detour from regular episodes of design dive I think it's something I needed to talk about module swear I'll be back talking about video games in the more traditional sense in the next design dive episode be sure to subscribe as after two years I'm returning to Dark Souls next month as I talk about my time playing Dark Souls 2 scholar of the first sin as I continue my rather personal journey through that series that's it for this episode of design dive part of my ciarán AI in games that is sponsored by these wonderful folks you see on screen now join the AI in games patreon or become a
