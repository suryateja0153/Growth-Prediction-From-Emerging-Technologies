 [VOICE OVER]: With self-driving or autonomous vehicles on the rise, I can’t wait til I can just sit in the back seat of my car watching movies while it takes me where I need to go [RONALD SCHROETER]: Actually, you won’t be able to do that just yet. [SOUND EFFECT: Brakes screeching] Even in the next level of self-driving cars, drivers still need to maintain situational awareness to be ready to take over control when there’s a hazardous situation [INTERVIEWER]: Researchers like those at the Centre for Accident Research & Road Safety – Queensland at the Queensland University of Technology are experimenting with using augmented reality in these autonomous vehicles [RONALD SCHROETER]: We can show content on the windscreen such as your favourite movies or TV shows so that drivers actually look out the window rather than into their laps [INTERVIEWER]: Augmented reality is a technology combining the real and virtual worlds where computer generated images are superimposed on a user’s view of the real world [RONALD SCHROETER]: These augmented reality displays can already show you information like GPS on the windscreen. We are experimenting with more engaging content to draw your voluntary attention to the outside world [INTERVIEWER]: In order to test this content safely, the team at CARRS-Q have built a driving simulator where they can track eye movement, heart rate, skin conductivity, muscle activation, monitor vehicle data and even simulate certain driving experiences [RONALD SCHROETER]: Let’s go and check your situational awareness and the difference between you watching a movie on the mobile phone versus an augmented reality display [INTERVIEWER]: Cool, let’s do it [RONALD SCHROETER]: alright. [INTERVIEWER]: First up: the smartphone test. [RONALD SCHROETER]: So, did you see that car we nearly hit? [INTERVIEWER]: Aah, no, I didn’t see anything. I was just watching this video [RONALD SCHROETER]: That’s the problem. [INTERVIEWER]: That’s not good. [INTERVIEWER]: Now let’s test the augmented reality display. [RONALD SCHROETER]: So did you see the pedestrian nearly walking on the road this time? [INTERVIEWER]: Well, yeah, I was already looking. I was watching the video and it was where that definitely came out. So, yeah, I saw it. [RONALD SCHROETER]: That’s the idea. [INTERVIEWER]: We saved a life. [RONALD SCHROETER]: Potentially.
