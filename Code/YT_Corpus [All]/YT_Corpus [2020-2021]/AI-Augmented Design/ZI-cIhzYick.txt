 Today's aerospace and defense companies are changing how we operate across land, sea, air, and space, but face several obstacles bringing new products to market. With easy deployment and rapid ROI, industrial augmented reality is quickly driving end-to-end value across aerospace and defense enterprises. Augmented reality upskills workers to make classroom-style training and on-the-job training safer, more effective, and less expensive resulting in a more flexible, agile workforce. In manufacturing, AR boosts the productivity of frontline workers by overlaying hands-free, step-by-step work instructions onto their physical environment for added context when performing complex assembly tasks. For field service, AR ensures that technicians provide faster, more successful resolutions during service visits by equipping them with 3D work instructions and access to remote assistance. AR also accelerates sales cycles by giving customers and prospects a cost-effective way to visualize and experience customized products before they're built.
