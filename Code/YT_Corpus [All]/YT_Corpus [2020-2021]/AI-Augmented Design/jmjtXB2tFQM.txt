 In my future, I think we won’t simply consume fashion. We will interact with fashion together.  In design, technology is something that changes the framework of what you believe is possible. So I think that’s really exciting.  I think that tech allows for new opportunities in the fashion industry. There’s that reward of exploring something that’s completely novel.  It’s much more than just the garments. We aim to create a new fashion landscape.
