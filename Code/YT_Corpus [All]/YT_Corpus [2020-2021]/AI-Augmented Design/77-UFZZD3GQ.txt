 okay so first of all good morning and welcome everyone my name is Ronnie Koch from outer University and I'm presenting our work on may I today that this work represents a collaborative agent that works together with the designer to find inspirational material by using a recent interactive machine learning approach called cooperative contextual bandits which we evaluated with designers but before I present our work I would like to talk about the underlying process of ideation and design practice ideation is the process of generating and curating original and useful ideas so as to define and explore what is desirable in a design project especially visual material is considered to be most suitable to support the construction of new ideas and concepts that are especially hard to express and define verbally one common method within visual ideation is the collection of inspirational material in form of colors also called mood boards in this dynamic and iterative process that design a switch between searching and making and the final collage can help to reflect and communicate new concepts and ideas in the traditional way of constructing mood boards designers go through their own idea repositories or previous work they associate with the current work which reflects the ability to exploit material which is already known to the designer in addition designers commonly browse magazines or other sources of inspiration like art and nature which enables them to express new ideas and concepts outside the initial idea space through the collaboration with others and consideration of their ideas designers then construct a new understanding that might go beyond their own interpretation which is usually referred to as collaborative creativity now the shift from a physical to a more digital process enables designers to broaden their inspirational sources through large sets of inspirational images online however to retrieve these images designers have to use search engine which require them to express ideas in the making to actually find this material finding explorative and serendipitous material becomes challenging using this rigid search paradigm and collaboration becomes limited due to the separation of search per person so the that in mind we wondered how could an AI act as a collaborative agent to support exploitation and exploration of digital visual material to get a visit assignor to harness the machine's abilities to retrieve and analyze large amount of data by and by valuing the contextual knowledge of the designer in the process many HCI studies have looked so far at later stage design processes which are more goal-oriented and often have predefined goals or at least the clearer understanding of goal criteria approach is used here are for example predictive algorithms optimization to improve or enhance already existing design materials towards a desired goal but ideation is by definition the process of defining these goal variables and relevant criteria for a given problem or task because of that the objective of such a design tasks are constantly evolving and therefore require more process oriented approaches previous work on a I supported ideation has used adapter for interactive algorithms for example in the contexts of drawing dance or music improvisation so in order to create a collaborative agent for ideation we define that such a system should first understand the designers current strategy to suggest inspirational and situationally relevant material it should also facilitate collaboration by making its own decisions by exploiting the current visual idea or exploring new visual janitors by itself but adapting to the designer style of a time as done in a human to human collaboration and finally to facilitate grounding within this collaboration such an agent has to be able to provide explanations for its suggestions and also ask for reasoning of the designers choices so with that in mind we introduced May I abandoned by his collaborative AI agent that is able to exploit an explorer digital inspirational material together with a designer on the task of mood board design so here's a quick example of what it can do the may i troll collects aspirational images along with the designer as if it were a collaborator in the project the agent constantly suggests images based on its own judgment and on the current mood board and can also answer specific requests from the designer a life search engine on the Left allows the designer to find images as Anna normal digital design process while each suggestion of the may i agent considers this design of search searches in all images on the current booth world assistant itself consists of an image and explanation and a history where images are stored chronologically and can be retrieved on a later stage so now we have seen from a user's perspective how a designer can search for her own material using a traditional search engine and how the main agent can suggest images based on the current canvas now let's have a closer look at the AI suggestions and especially at how it retrieves the suggested images and how it justifies is suggestion through the designer so let's look at an abstract example of a very simple mood board the two green instruments on a white background in order to search for a suitable suggestion the eye has to consider the visual features and the content of the future image based on the current mood board first we look at how it analyzes and selects the visual features in order to do so we applied a collaborate a cooperative contextual bandit algorithm in the context of visual ideation a crucial requirement of this type of algorithm is to select a set of features that together express a point in the creative space based on professional mood boards we distinguish five visual features which in combination can describe any mood board which are color brightness saturation color fulness and the orientation of images given this five dimensional space we slice it uniformly into sub spaces based on human perception in our example the green mood board would be for example assigned to a bright green high contrast sub space given this assignment the algorithm has a probability function to exploit the same visual space possibly with minor deviations for example in our case this could be another bright green image or it can decide for a neighboring sub space representing a distinct shift for instance in color or contrast which represents an exploration in the visual space for example a black and white image these probability functions are trained over time allowing the system to consider the personal preferences of its color or ages as part of its decisions a common issue with online learning approaches and especially in contextual bandits is to so-called code start problem this means that in the beginning all options are equally probable and it takes a lot of training for it to develop a meaningful behavior in order to overcome these limitations be collected 1,024 mood boards online from a diverse set of topics and domains we segmented each of these mood boards to retrieve individual images and simulated their reconstruction which became them the AIS prior so now that we saw how the Bandit system selects whether to exploit or explore visual material let's discuss how the AI selects the content presented on the suggested image this is defined by the searchers of the designer and the application of a semantic Association engine based on the designers behavior this content space is updated and also previous content will be forgotten over time to continuously provide meaningful suggestion related to the current process and move board in our example this is dynamite have searched for something like instruments earlier which then is then observed by the Association engine and can result in words like piano music or entertainment this content is then combined with the visual features selected earlier and searched life in the background an image that fulfills both criteria is selected as the final suggestion of the AI in our example case this could be a green piano or black and white radio depending on the decision made by the earlier presented bandit system the selected image is then tested for its most meaningful characteristics given the current mood board for example how it nicely complements it or represents the current theme well the characteristic is provided as an explanation for the designer above the image the steering buttons underneath allow the designer to further communicate her current preferences in the form of more like the current mood board similar to the current suggestion but something different or it should be more surprising overall this button impact the probability considered by the i-44 selecting an exploitation or exploration behavior so to summarize may I as a collaborative AI tool that enables designers to exploit and explore while designing mood boards we tested the system the 16 professional designers with backgrounds in graphic design architecture fashion design and others all of them had a minimum of two years design practice and used mood boards before in their career the counterbalance the two conditions namely this and without the help of the AI suggestions and evaluated these conditions using questionnaires and interviews as tasks we provided two realistic design briefs containing a client and a task description regarding a new visual concept for a grocery store line focusing on vegetarian lifestyle and a youth program for Millennials for a new banking system each participant had 30 minutes per task and condition to build a mood board now in the end the vast majority of participants preferred working with the AI than without in their final mood boards about a quarter of the used images were suggested by the AI question has revealed that the participants found AI conditions more complex which was expected due to the added information functionality of the system however they also revealed an overall increase in the perceived ability of the system to let the user explore and express themselves in the an analysis of the interviews we focus on the three main abilities of the a I mentioned earlier first to provide inspirational material that goes beyond the direct search ability of the designer second the explained ability provided by the system that should enable better understanding of its decision and third the perception of the collaboration and agency in the context of interacting with the system regarding inspiration users reported these suggestions as novel without being too eccentric or useless they also told of being surprised by some of the suggestions even reported aha moments in insights that led them to change their approach to the task drastically looking at the explained ability of the AI some designers highlighted the usefulness of the explanation also for their own consideration in future image selection however three participants even felt as if they were criticized or judged by the system when it asked for justification of the image choices they made and finally the interaction of the main eye tool recommended on the attributions of agency and even personality such as an eccentric collaborator or is she by more than half of the participants strong ascribing of collaborative and helping behavior led to perceptions of mixed agency such as I feel like I don't work alone I feel like there's another person working with me on the smooth board to summarize inspirational activities are adaptive and evolve within the ideation process to assist designers with these early inspirational phases we have to move away from traditional goal-oriented AI approaches and to what system that can adapt and collaborate with the designer we introduce a cooperative contextual bandit approach in the context of mood poor design that is able to make its own decisions to either explore or exploit the creative space following or diverging from the design of current strategy in order to assist and inspire as an independent creative agent so that concludes my talk and thank you for your attention for the interested audience we will release the code of the for the cooperative contextual bandit the design briefs and the participant smooth words at the link up here I will now take questions while some of the outcomes of our studies will be shown behind me thank you [Applause] time for a few questions I was doing well hi Luis thank you Luis Romero you thank you for that really nice talk I just like to ask if you have intention to be looking at a convergence of the end result of your 16 designers for similarities and maybe contrast that if they won't actually be using your system instead and use their traditional methods that is a very good question so there is there is of course a difference between using such a system and using the traditional material yeah we purposely didn't compare the traditional way with the system because the traditional way usually has contains several different types of tools and also the ability to actually work with this tools so we actually trained the designer first but some of the functionalities of the tool so that we can actually compare them in the end the comparison between the mood boards itself in the end is actually quite challenging because what it actually represents in the end of the mood board is mainly up to the designer and also the designers viewpoint on the current task so well this actually cannot be compared in how the mood boards are actually end up we would need longer studies to actually see how this impacts the final product or the final design in this case to actually see the the real impact on a longer-term I boo Brackenbury University of Chicago would love to talk thank you so did you guys get the chance to explore the possibility of active learning to deal with the cold-start problem yes we thought about it but in the context of this work we actually wanted to have like as broad set as possible to to kind of like pre train the algorithm of the date were set of domains because as we have here also tested our system the fashion designers graphic designers architects active learning would have limited us a little bit more to specific domain so collecting this large set of mood boards from different domains with different purposes allowed us to have a more general sense of like the visual preferences of designers in this context you can see Clara University of Cusco yes and I was interested how you select the features to be used in in the process or whether the system can actually also adapt to the features that are preferred by the particular designer so the initial feature set was decided by me and my collaborators who are used for a long longer time or research for a longer time mood boards and try to find features that we can distinguish we see among different mood boards so the probability distributions are related to the connection of certain aspects in this visual space so basically if you would use the system over time the probability functions would update in a way that you actually that it would actually reflect your preferences for example in colors then actually for example in in the way it's the saturation is presented or so so this could be trained over time but it not actively can diminish certain factors of that there is in the initial work of cooperative contextual then that's a way to actually do instead of doing uniform slicing doing adaptive slicing which is also explained in the paper we purposely went away here to actually give like a larger set of possibilities and explorative possibilities in this process
