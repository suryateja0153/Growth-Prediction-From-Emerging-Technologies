 I really like to find problems and then find the solution I think this is something very uux related like all UX designers really like to solve problems and make the world a better place hi I'm Patti Serena's I'm a Adobe Creative resident this year and I'm a UX UI designer from Berlin I am going to focus on our future cities new technologies like augmented reality was control or artificial intelligence the topic of the future city is huge so I'm going to focus on mobility new work and living your ex is like the whole process everything you're doing in those like in the huge design process your eyes only like the little part of the user interface your aya means everything design related to X everything in the meantime or before I used to be a graphic designer so I studied graphic design so everything print related and then I switched to X and this which was really tough because I had the feeling that I had to start really from like from scratch from the beginning so I would like to share my knowledge and things I'm doing so other people going to have an easier start when they want to like switch to your X I think there's so much uncertainty in the future of UX UI so I hope that I am going to take a very small part in helping to understand where the future of uux is going i want to engage with my community and i want to humanize my design process and to share it with the world you you
