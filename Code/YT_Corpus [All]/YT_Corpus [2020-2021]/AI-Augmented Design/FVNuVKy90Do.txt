 [Music] great to see you all we took a little bit of a hiatus in May so it's it's fun to be back here after a month break I wanted to also welcome all of you who are joining 4sf design week I hope the activities and events that you've been to so far have been inspiring and enriching we are excited to be part of the SF Design Week events so thank you for joining us and for those of you who are our regular design is attendees you guys all know we started this series a couple almost two and a half years ago now to create a space for the design community to come together and explore the role of design and crafting the future specifically a future we all want to be a part of and implicit in that is the craft of design design encompasses more than just what we can see and touch to create really powerful and meaningful experiences we need to engage a multitude of senses and sound design has the potential and the power to do that sound design can enhance the sensory depth of product experiences it shapes emotion and it can even transport us into new realms it's often undervalued and overlooked which is why I'm so excited to be able to bring the topic to all of you today we have Connor O'Sullivan who is our head of design here at Google he leads a cross product effort which includes the most recent launch of our first sound spec which is really exciting and I'm very excited to have him here because he is an industry leader in sound design and sensory and Sonic branding so he knows a lot about this stuff I don't know very much so I'm really excited to learn he is has brought together a group of inspiring experts and I'm gonna let him introduce and be your host for this evening so please join me in welcoming Connor for design is audible thanks everyone for being here thanks Kai for allowing us to talk about sound design as part of SF Design Week which is really exciting it's also Pride Week so I'm very excited about that too and we're here today to talk about sound design so let me just jump in here before I actually introduce some of the talented designers who are going to share some of their work so get ready to do some listening I just wanted to take a step back and just talk about the value of sound as part of the product design experience so you know as humans we're constantly experiencing sound sound is all around us and our brains are very good at background listening and deciding when we need to pay attention and when we don't so as sound designers we have the opportunity to create sound scapes that take advantage of this and sometimes the sound can be in the background receding and other times in the for grabbing your attention and sound has been shown in studies particularly related to product experience to impact in the perception of things like quality emotion and even time and increasingly in product design we tend to rely on visual modalities to convey a lot of information to users but sound affords us the opportunity to offset some of the burdens that we place on the visuals on to this other sense so I recently wrote about some of this in an article that addresses some of these topics and also as Kyle mentioned announced the first ever material design guidelines for sound design so we're really excited about that if you're interested in learning a little bit more about that please do check it out so going to introduce our first speaker Elad marish and a lad I've had the pleasure of working with on some work that we did for pixel which I hope he's going to talk about and elad is senior producer and partner at swell music and sound which is a cutting-edge sound design studio and audio post shop here in San Francisco so his work spans from national broadcast commercials HBO and documentary film to UX and original music composition for bands and brands so elad please take it away hi everybody thanks for having me and I want to apologize for my pathetic slides I'm a sound designer I have no idea what to do with keynote or PowerPoint luckily I spelled things right what is effective sound design so ATS well music and sound we do a ton of video work and so I'll divide my talk up into a video or worked a picture as I call it and then UI experience so in video and the two are very different so let's start with video so when clients give us a video they tell us to bring the scenes of life how do we do that or sound wise that is in this particular example which won some awards they gave us a blank slate it was completely silent when they gave it to us let's watch [Music] [Music] so this was for the photo since the synthesis pack without whatever that means for Nike and then the jungle pack after that which we did one with butterflies but like I said before it was completely silent so we had to design everything from the jungle background to the laces to the kind of plants growing sounds of the jungle and then finally the the supers or the title cards at the end so you know what makes for a good sound design there somehow that came together to be a compelling enough piece to win the ICP awards and so forth so we will talk a little bit more after our presentations about you know what makes that compelling but for me it's it's it's the juxtaposition of the background sounds plus what we call the hard effects which were the shoelace is tying and the plant sounds and so forth and then the buttoning it up with the Nike sounds at the end another thing we think about when sound design into picture is that as you guys may know or not know every video is made up of frames typically 24 frames per second sometimes 30 or other weird frame rates but typically 2398 or 24 and in our digital audio workstations we have the capacity to sound design every single frame if we wanted to which would take all day but this particular client had the budget to sit with us almost on every frame of this thing and designed it that way so think about frames when you think about video and also enjoy Snoop Dogg once Ostra one boss one word thanks Pete no guts no glory one shot one story beat you right now no turn one would be like no more get the deluxe edition to play four days early rated T for teen Thank You Snoop so that's one of my favorite spots because there's so much going on there's so many scenes so many frames and we were able to in a frame accurate fashion sound design every single scene every single frame with the client and we sat there for probably 16 hours doing it in the same room with them on the couch you know the the the wrestler hitting the mat was us doing Foley with with our leather couch cushion and recording it in real time sometimes we draw from our massive sound library and drag sounds in and then design them and mix them so they're perfectly suited to the spot that that piece just had snoops vo and the music track and we were tasked with making the sound design amazing so that's that's every frame a little bit about UI what makes for effective sound design and UI that's what we'll be talking about for most of the nights and I like to think about designing for the brief so the first phase of that is exploration we get together with client and we talk about what do we want you know what's this going to sound like so I had the pleasure as Connor mentioned of working with him on at the pixel one and the ring tones for that and we had the idea of who's going to be using this phone is it going to be you know who are the users so we thought about different subsets of users like the techy user the kind of math nerd user the the sports head the emo music person who I identified with you know who are users and so we blocked it out and we gave letter code names to each user and we try to design sounds based on those folks so I was a pretty creative approach let's see what we came up with exploration phase I think we call that Borg techie soft round a little warm modern next phase is picking one of those things so we call that the initial direction the one we picked was that guy it's really hard to talk about sound so let's just keep in mind what that sound sounded like so then we went about revising that sound with our client cool we dug that it got our attention it's soft appealing attention-grabbing modern it it has a couple of tones embedded in it and we can get deep into the world of what you know sound and wave forms and sound waves but we won't do that right now but we decided it was a little repetitive what would happen if we added a musical element to it sweet everyone dug that and that ended up being the Zen ringtone on pixel so that is about all I have time for today thank you so much I hope you enjoyed and I'll see you in a little while thanks lad so next up we have Kevin do Sablan and I found out today that Kevin plays in an Irish music band which is a fun fact about Kevin but he's an award-winning audio experience designer working in San Francisco Kevin spent the last decade creating content for entertainment and technology with brands like Google HBO Nickelodeon and Ubisoft so please welcome Kevin great thanks Connor let me start by calling a lot out for stealing my joke which to be fair I stole from someone else but that is the apology for the slide deck because again we're sound designers so yeah so thanks all for having me and spending your evening here talking about sound specifically I would like to talk about designing audio for the intersection between entertainment and product and UX so over the course of my career probably like several designers out here I've had the opportunity to work across a large spectrum of products and mediums from film to games broadcast over to software hardware VR etc and the last several years of my career have sort of pulled me more and more into creating voice experiences so this is a content for Google home and Amazon elects on platforms like that and my main role nowadays is working at a company called Xandra and we specialize in immersive rich content for those particular mediums and work with companies like HBO and Google and Amazon and Nickelodeon sesame and others and what's really interesting is that it represents as I mentioned a true intersection between entertainment and you X and I say that because often we're tasked as a company to convey linear storytelling and gaming through sort of a more traditional UX environment using things like speech recognition and voice user interfaces and so I'd love to share a few examples of kind of how that plays out in real-time over voice experiences so I'll use a few kind of classic types of UX sound design elements that you might hear in a UX system as an example of to convey these particular sounds so one of those is an orientation sound so that could be an intro or an outro to a product really anything that indicates to the user where they are in time structurally or narrative lean so here's a quick example from one of our voice experiences Bob challenge [Music] the annual jellyfish migration is sweeping through town and those jellyfish hunters are sweeping through the krusty krab let's get behind the register and get to work so we you know we have a lot of fun we get to work on really cool IP but yeah so that's an example of an orientation sound on that like I said that's an intro to one of the voice experiences and a return intro and specifically so another category of UX sound design elements that we also borrow but use in more of an entertainment or gaming fashion would be a call to actions this is really anything that invites the user to interact with the product so an example from one of our experiences is the following kind of short example what kind of animal came in seventh and a half marathon in Alabama was it a cat a squirrel or a dog and full disclosure I don't know the answer and this is a great opportunity to ask the crowd what you think so maybe just you know after the speech the talks just coming let me know what you think but essentially you can hear a music cue there that we use throughout that experience to indicate that a prompt or a call to action was coming and then we have a clear question as well inviting the user to speak and that kind of leads us into feedback so feedback is in UX just a sound that the product will emit or potentially would have a visual to indicate that there has been interaction so here's a couple examples of some feedback so that's a clear affirmative if we answered that past question correctly and a clear negative so the last one I'll talk about is kind of another basic you know standard sound type and that is a branding sound so at Xandra when we're working on voice we tend to try to weave branding through our experiences as much as possible but we do get the chance to just play great branding cues so here's one that we whipped up for one of those actions that I just shared all right so as I mentioned working at this intersection provides me some pretty cool opportunities and the one that I want to talk about mostly tonight with you guys is being able to borrow best practices and principles from both entertainment and UX and kind of realize them in this center space where we work in voice experience and I think it's kind of worthwhile for the design community to think about this because in some cases if you're kind of too far over in entertainment or too far over and UX it's really easy to look over some very core principles so we spend time at Sandra and I spend time in my work working with my sound teams really focusing on a few of the following principles as we go through our practice so the first is story first so story of course is the words on the page the picture on the screen maybe the vision of the director but I think it's actually a little bit more than that as well for us it's the intent of the product and it's maybe the style or the emotion that's trying to be conveyed in a particular moment so we try to make sure that we really emphasize the intention and hold that Center as our first priority when we're designing I think this actually mirrors the core principles of UX design as well which are to provide relevant and contextual information at all times to the user and it has a further boon so if we're all focusing on story we have a kind of cross departmental northstar that we can focus on and have a shared vision to create for which is kind of crucial to designing a cohesive experience that might be rich in visuals animation sound and other elements so the next piece that I'd like to talk about is having a strong story or I'm sorry a strong style guide so this one is kind of a common-sense one in some circles and then in others it doesn't get much attention and that's why I wanted to mention it because it is another very important piece and really defines the brand the look in the feel of the product or the user experience that you're working on this is just another one just like story that provides a strong vision for the team to unite around as well and I'd like to kind of emphasize that this should get a beat as early in the production as you possibly can so that way you're creating material and content that has that shared vision from early on before you get too far down the road the next one this is kind of the most important one for me after a story so this one is thoughtful editorial I'm really kind of stealing from some of the best supervisors I've worked with in my past who really focus on editorial and in audio terms it's a great opportunity for pacing for dynamics branding and clear communication so it really shouldn't be overlooked and to me it means just going beyond stock sounds not just pulling things but really being thoughtful and curating great sounds and then beyond that I'd like to talk about kind of a few different types of editorials so there's sort of the macro editorial which is super important in the sense that it's similar to spotting a film scripts where you're looking at an entire product in thinking about how sound is use holistically in that product and essentially this might mean using silence or this might mean picking a per you know kind of a perfect sound for a particular emotion and the next is micro and that is sort of the Nitin gritty curating that exact sound getting that exact emotion and hitting that exact story beat so those are all super important to me things that we work on a lot the next is mix so this is usually just kind of a quick thought in the product cycle but I really think it's worth thinking about putting time in here and paying a lot of tension to mix so I'm sure everybody here has an idea of mix but essentially this is where we're leveling all the sound elements but beyond that this is sort of the last opportunity for the sound team to tailor the sounds to all of the other elements in the project because often final animation final visuals and final flow doesn't really land until the very end so this is kind of that last step to get things just right and of course this is where we get to optimize for platform there's a big difference between designing elements for a theatrical film or for a Google home and this is sort of our chance to think about that so kind of with all those things in mind with a little bit of luck you will be able to create a compelling sound moment or a compelling story experience and I'll just share one from our work that we thought came out pretty well won a few awards I'm pretty excited about [Applause] [Music] you're new not much of a ride on you not that one Clem they're here for something else you must be here to play the game well you came to the right place it's not easy but I can tell you on and on do you so actually before I go over there so so yeah so that was an experience we did for Westworld and for some folks that may have kind of recognized the soundscape there but it really kind of draws on many of the principles that we were talking about here and conveys them pretty well I hope so the last one I'd like to mention before I go is that dialogue is king so I may seem fairly bias having my primary my work be in voice and I'm holding the microphone now but there is a true precedent for this of course across entertainment and that's because in film broadcast and games usually dialogue gets kind of the number-one spotlight in the mix and that's because it's a very efficient and effective tool for storytelling conveying communication information and it can be actually the most cost effective in many cases and as Connor mentioned it does offset the visuals at times so the last thing I'll mention about dialogue is that it essentially is the most human centric design path as well so it can inspire empathy and convey emotion just about better than any other asset type so with that I'll say thank you so much for having me and I will encourage you if you kind of want to think a little bit more about this in particular if you come from a UX or a product background and maybe haven't been exposed to entertainment fields just as much do yourself a favor take a little homework assignment and go read Walter Murch all right thank you great thanks so much Kevin so when I first moved to San Francisco I found out that there was another sound designer by the name of Connor who had an Irish sounding surname but the difference is he has two ends in his first name so I'm talking about Connor Moore who for the last 10 years has been the award-winning audio creative director and lead sound designer of Siemer sound where he's been designing bespoke sound experiences for brands across the globe so he's had the pleasure to work with the likes of Google uber Amazon and Tesla and has been featured as an interviewee for a California Sunday magazine NPR's marketplace and Communication Arts so please welcome Connor Moore hello everybody thanks so much for being here it's quite the crowd and a good evening so today I want to talk to you guys about curating our soundscapes and in particular looking at this through the lens of audio user experiences I'm gonna start with a little test so you guys know about brand audio and audio UX [Music] now by showing hands how many of you guys recognize what brand or product or app those sounds come from you guys know your stuff alright so sound as a medium has this amazing ability to be very effective in short snippets of time that file I just played for you guys was 10 seconds in its entirety and each sound was only two seconds in length so as technology is really starting to utilize audio at these multiple touchpoints for our user voice user interfaces heads-up displays connected home you know we have a real opportunity here to be very intentional with these designs and very thoughtful with how we're crafting them because we don't want to add to the noise right we actually have an opportunity here to make the world potentially quieter so I'm actually gonna start with a bit of a unique storytelling that'll teach you a bit more about me and I'm gonna use my family and our house as kind of a metaphor for how I think of audio user experience design because I think we can learn a lot from how people communicate within these ecosystems and potentially bring those learnings into how we craft our audio user experiences so come on a little journey with me I live in a home in Oakland I have a wife of four years I have a two-year-old son also known as mr. messy as you can tell and a four year old lab so this is the audio user experience within my home so I'm gonna play some sound recordings of these individuals in the house here so you need a little sample what they sound like so that's my wife calling my name from across the room this is my son calling my name in the house whoa what and my vicious dog miles I think he's calling my name unsure he got two syllables so that's good so in isolation in moderation you know these sounds aren't really gonna drive any forms of stress or they're not overly intrusive but what about right when they're all firing at once it's gonna kind of drive this more stressful environment if they happen over and over again for long periods of time it could actually trigger our fight-or-flight mode so we as humans we don't want to these moments all the time right but unfortunately you know our soundscapes around acerbic chaotic and unpredictable and we don't have the ability to always just press a new button on these moments but we do have this opportunity to be very thoughtful and intentional with designing our user experience designs so this is what I call considerate audio user experiences right so you might ask what does consider design sound like so I'll show two case studies for you guys today the first being sense some of you guys might be familiar with this product um it is a sleep tracker and smart alarm that sits on your night side table and it's able to essentially tell you what is waking you up in a given night so you can better curate your sleeping environment and become a more productive person sleep better and yeah just overall be a happier person so what really struck me with this product is that when I was researching with alarms that's the first thing you experience in your day right just think about that for a second that has the potential to make a massive impact on your overall mood right so I didn't want to create that it's a very intense sound right and what's crazy is you can still buy that alarm go to Target and buy it right now and ten years ago that was kind of the only option we had so I wanted to create something obviously unlike that something that was really bespoke to this product something that matched the ID the look and feel what the brand was trying to communicate so if you guys would close your eyes I'd like to simulate this sleeping environment here and place on these examples for you so you'll notice these of all alarms of all very gradually they start very quiet to wake up soft sleepers and then they grow over time and get louder to wake up heavier sleepers so it covers a range of users he's also use a lot of silence and space in the compositions I learned through research that the brain is attracted to new sounds coming into the fold so it's a way to kind of subliminally wake you up [Music] you also notice these all use softer tamarind instrumentation and airier textures so it really supports this lighter waking up experience thanks guys you can open your eyes now so what makes this experience consider it well as I mentioned it covers this range of sleepers I was very intentional about what is it that wakes up light sleepers versus heavier sleepers and how can we you know essentially design a system that is not one-size-fits-all it really speaks to all these different users number two it uses space and silence in the compositions I wanted to actually utilize space so people could sit there and actually listen to them and maybe stretch right a little bit instead of just jumping out of bed and they're a holistic cohesive soundscape this is really important with product design or any type of branding you want something that ties the entire experiences together right so I didn't showcase the UI alerts or notifications either but these all harmonize with one another so if an alarm comes in and then alert rides in on top of it it doesn't bring dissonance into the experience and lastly these are very intentionally branded they build an emotional bond with the user it's an opportunity for the brand to create something memorable because after all these people are investing their time and money into this product so you might as well give them something memorable so the second case study unfortunately I'm unable to speak about the brand but I did get clearance to play some of the talons and obviously it is a car so I created the end car alerts in UI and notifications and for any type of app or product experience when you're creating these alerts and notifications essentially you're trying to express and communicate a level of priority or a hierarchy of priority but this is especially true with your car because some of these moments are life or death if you think about a Ford collision alert if you didn't if you're not able to hear that and respond really quickly you could very well end up in the back of a car right so it's really important that you're able to communicate these things it's so simple I wanted to create alerts and notifications that are communicative and expressive so for low priority alerts I use lower pitch these are more mellow tone I use softer attack and longer decay so these tend to be much more elegant so this is a ring tone [Music] for medium priority alerts these step up slightly in pitch they become a little bit more percussive but they really lean on this idea of using repetition because as seatbelt warnings go off you guys know that if they don't turn off and tell you buckle in so you will hear it eventually and for high-priority alerts these really shift up in pitch so these fall in the range of two kilohertz to 5 kilohertz which is the most sensitive area of human hearing these become much more percussive and they use a rapid-fire three note repetition so this is a forward collision alert this is something you're gonna hear that's really gonna grab your attention and you're gonna be able to react so what makes this experience consider it well it is communicative and expressive we were very intentional about working with the team at this company and defining what does it mean to be high-priority and how can we work with a pitch range the tambour of instrumentation the composition styles to really communicate this priority again using space and silence is always important across these experiences especially in the driver's seat a driver could be driving and talking to someone and listening to music so you don't want to clutter that environment lastly there simple indirect they're very communicative and the compositions are very simple to digest again you don't want to throw too much information at the driver you want them to be able to focus on the task at hand so in closing I think there's many things that can make up consider it sound design and obviously we just looked at what this means to me through these two case studies and I think a lot of those design supposed to hold a lot of water and can scale across many brand experiences but ultimately it's gonna come down to what project you're working on it's gonna come down to what's the product you're working on what's the app who's the brand and ultimately what are you trying to communicate to those people as many people have mentioned standing up here tonight we have a real opportunity to shape what the future of our sound experience is sound like and we have to start from this zoomed out vision right the zoomed out vision of what it means to be considerate are we spending the time upfront to be intentional and thoughtful in crafting these experiences and ultimately I think it's so important that we do this so we can set this foundation for a considerate audio user experiences so thank you guys very much appreciate it so really interesting sounds and principles approaches some really outstanding work there that you're showing and we're just going to step through a couple of questions here and then we'd love to hear some questions from the audience too so seeing as how we're here is part of San Francisco Design Week and there's a lot of disciplines represented from from various people from things like marketing engineering UX design of course so I wanted to talk about the process for how we engage with people in these various disciplines how you might approach a sound design project with designers or branding people or engineering so what would make a good design brief and what would that contain as you begin working on a new sound design challenge so I spoke to this a little bit earlier when talking about pixel but it's it's great to talk to the team early on about what we're trying to achieve obviously and to create a language that but both client and obviously the designers can understand around the parameters of sound and it comes down to adjectives kind of like it's kind of like a music brief in a way when we get a music brief is it warm is it fuzzy is it round is it modern is it vintage antique new-school old school hi-low these things that were outlined throughout the talks and achieving this common language around sound which is a nonverbal medium is I think paramount to the process and can get us going on our job and once we understand we can grab the ball and be the Labrador yeah I'm happy to speak to that as well yeah the biggest thing is you know what is the project and what are the project goals similar to a lot said a lot of times what we like to talk about when we talk with our product teams is you know what do you anticipate will be the biggest challenge and essentially how can we help in many cases when we're producing sound I think this is true for probably many content creators it's sort of a service industry and we really want to help the product makers make the best product they can so getting ahead of where the challenges are in the project and sort of anticipating and thinking of those is the big set pieces over the course of the production where do we really want to dig in whereas where are the things that we may have more familiarity and kind of can get through a little easier and use existing expertise so yeah so that's kind of a I think a lot had a lot of great things to say but I couldn't add that little nugget how about you Connor yeah so you think it's dependent also on kind of what project you're working on if it's UX driven obviously UX drives kind of what that brief would look like if we're talking about it from a lot of the bigger brand build-out work I do includes all those facets and when that happens you know just getting a comprehensive brief on engineering giving you the spec you know what what can we actually design for what does the speaker capable of and what's the environment so understanding that from engineering side super important brand and marketing's typically more the story side so really understanding what the communication points are is super important and then the UX side obviously is how to how do these things work in actual application you know what is the visual system look like and how can we kind of best map sound to that so but ultimately it comes down to getting a comprehensive brief that is you know explicit kind of on all fronts okay you just wanted to add how hard that is because again sound is something we can't talk about like I had to CEO of a company tell us that he didn't want it to sound like a dishwasher or a washing machine what does that mean so they know what they want it not to sound like but can you come up with any common language of what you do want it to sound like I wanted to sound elegant I want it to sound premium what does that mean so the closer we can get to a common language you know and I don't know if I don't mean to Darrell it that because you know going back to the brief idea you know often what I do with companies when they have a brief that well generally speaking first stages what the project is all about discovering what that is right and working with the client about you know potentially doing workshops like okay you have these adjectives we're trying to design to but or or just brand attributes you know from a visual language but what are those means sonically and kind of creating playlists maybe of sound or music that can really translate those things into sound because you you know those initial phases are so important because you're really setting this foundation right of what these communications actually mean so that's a big part of what I do you know and those initial phases is kind of workshop based yeah great and just from my own experience a lot once a sound gets tagged as the dishwasher sound I think that's forever going to be the dish the dishwasher sound but I I'd like you to think about and share some things that have helped you to get to where you are as in influential designers in the field so one of the questions I often get asked is how do I get started in product sound design or in sound design in general so what are some things that have helped you get to where you are and what advice would you give someone who wants to start down that path sure I can I can go first um sorry so yeah when I got started in my career I I feel like I got very lucky because I was able to meet some pretty big design people at some agencies in San Francisco but this is this was 10 years ago so it was different like now I feel like you can get out of school and there's you know agencies or you know bigger companies that are that are had these kind of organizations you can get work at but I I linked in with some very influential visual designers that kind of pulled me into some experiences which quite frankly the time I didn't really know how to do the work to be honest because it wasn't really happening at a high level yet but it was kind of the first part of seeing product and brand sound come to the forefront and I said yes you know I just kind of jumped into the fire and took the opportunity and ran with it and that really just opened a lot of doors so I always recommend to people getting started you know I'm not a big fan of the fake it till you make it thing but sometimes you just got to jump in and and you know take taking initiative and just just take off and let let it guide you and you'll figure it out in the process you know I'll kind of piggyback on that for certain for sure I think the the biggest piece for me was finding people that inspired me in various communities entertainment technology and just hanging around them while I was learning and you know while I was hanging around them my network was growing and opportunities would pop up here and there and like Connor said I'm always saying yes I'm always showing up and I'm kind of building trust with these people so some of the earliest studios that I started to build a reputation for myself at I'm pretty sure it was like 50% super-annoying that kevin was always there but also super comforting that kevin was always there I would I would be there and and that reliability in our profession is it puts you a cut above the rest right off the bat so just you know be consistent and always be learning in building things so don't wait for other folks don't wait for opportunities to come your way if you're really fired up about product or games or film you know and you can't find a team that wants to hire you to do sound for it commission that team find a way to do it you know do it with equity tell them that you can't pay them now but the next project will definitely have funding and it probably will and in the process of kind of generating the steam they're you know you're gonna be again growing your network growing your skillset and growing your reputation so yeah I think just you know being proactive working hard yeah I completely agree you know a prominent Hollywood composer once told me when someone asked him how to get into the into the gig he said is there anything else you'd rather do anything at all and there's a little bit of that with audio I didn't land like I thought it would but but there's something to it because you need to be incredibly passionate and you need to have skin in the game and you need to hustle really really hard and you know someone emails me once I won't pay attention but if someone you mails me two or three times I might pay attention and if they're really good and they're really persistent and really talented and I will pay attention good some great advice there so you're all part of a group of specialists and boutique agencies that are vital and that often partner with big companies tech companies and non tech on various design projects so I'm interested to know what are some things that companies who want to work with you should maybe do differently or what are some things that they should know if they're interested in in partnering with you on a project yeah let's take this one to start we very much like you said we work with sort of the biggest companies out there which is a which is a great opportunity and companies like ours are boutique companies we're always stoked to join the fold and jump on great IP and get on the cutting edge of tech but there's a few things and I think the big companies can you better and the number one thing for me is I want those companies and this is a tough it's tough to request here because you know oftentimes you're working with great people at these companies and they just don't only have so much control and so much power to make change but what I would love to see is sort of a capacity to grow and learn from the boutiques and the specializations and develop some institutional memory for experiences with us so you know it's it's such a bummer for little companies like us for us to put time into long product cycles with say a team at a big company and then work with a slightly different team at that same big company and they don't remember anything and they don't know anything about us so part of it is the ability to learn and part of it is the ability maybe to communicate maybe horizontally and I think Connor you're probably doing great work at Google that's evidence of that but that's sort of that that horizontal communication pipeline that's on a disciplinary level so having audio communication through a company and having visual communication through a company I'm seeing great steps being made in that regard but I would love to just see it kind of pile in yeah and I would say you know these these companies got to where they are by taking risks on an engineering side or on a development side or something to rise above the noise I no pun intended and I would like to see these companies take similar risks when engaging with us I find that often times at the end of the day and there is either someone at the top that says here's how it should be or or you know that this sounds end up feeling safe or expected so I would love to see a little bit more risk-taking on on the on the audio side yeah I think I mean kind of piggybacking on what Kevin was saying about having this horizontal communication it's super important and it kind of goes back to Connors earlier question about the briefs you know of having that open line of communication between you know engineering design branding marketing it's just super important you know for projects and this work to be long-lasting whether it be for any of those mediums or all of them there really needs to be that open line of communication and ultimately you know the UX should be telling a story which is helping the branding and the branding can think about how the UX can play into their marketing materials which is gonna build equity you know and the engineering is worried about how are they going to sound and this product that is gonna influence what you can do in design so it's all this you know it all circles back upon each other so just that line of communication is so important and similarly it is getting better it's gonna getting a lot better so that's a great thing but I think you can always you know continue to get better interesting so it sounds like some institutional learning communication and risk-taking some some good lessons there to take away I think I'm also interested to hear if you could give an example a notable example of a product sound design experience that you admire but you didn't design it yourself so if you could pick one what would it be I can I can start again so yeah you guys familiar with Jambox I'm sure you are but I'm ruined that product came out you know and obviously I didn't work on it but I imagine the brief was something like it's a small portable speaker it's pretty affordable but it's really powerful and it sounds great you know because most speakers of that size are gonna sound tinny and not good on a low frequency spectrum like bass you know the low end but the boot-up sound of that product has a very distinct you know kind of run from really low pitch up to a low a high pitched tone and it really kind of showcases the power of the speaker and that's the first moment the user does they boot it up obviously uh so when I first received it and I turned it on I was shocked it has this really nice low frequency content I was like wow like this is a very strong point of communication to the buyer who just bought this sets like oh wow this thing does it is a really powerful speaker and it is portable and it is affordable so I think that's a really great example of good product sound cool yeah that's a good example I know what the sound is and I totally agree and I'm not sure if it's the same speaker or not but there's another Bluetooth speaker or a Bluetooth speaker that when it bluetooth pairing I think Mike has the speaker it has kind of like a little conga like a dude and it's super nice and also full frequency and it kind of it's like a constant reminder that this thing is not a piece of junk and it's great and I just feel like you for brand that's super valuable and though like here I am not knowing what the brand is so maybe not so great but maybe the maybe the brand so the visual site maybe just the brand should be a little bit bigger one that actually I picked up very recently it's a very new product is the oculus quest so I'm one of those super VR hopefuls I'm like waiting for it to catch I want it to be great and I've you know played on a lot of headsets but I have to say that the quest as soon as you put it on all of the sounds make sense they're balanced there's sort of a sound when you're in setup mode that lets you know persistently it's like a pad it's always on and it lets you know and you're in sedima and you kind of have more to do there's just a lot of thoughtful intentional sound and then from the deployment hardware standpoint it's fantastic as well so when you put it on you you hear stereo effectively but you're not wearing headphones and it doesn't have a lot of flow low frequency response initially but you know it is kind of a small device but it it has a great stereo field and it's very clean and and in fact when you do kind of multi-user you know use with the with the device dialogue like other folks voice comes better it comes through better on this device and I've heard it on any pair of headphones today which to me it blows my mind so yeah oculus quests fantastic cool allowed I'm I suspect you might be a bit more of a skeptic with this question a bit of a skeptic but so I'm an iPhone user because as an audio professional I have a million Apple products I'm in computers and so forth and I've always used the same ringtone old phone on iphone which totally dates you and sounds terrible because it's one of the only ringtones I could hear on this phone but in the most recent iteration of the device the Rings I was happy to discover after searching through the whole bin I found one that is tied into the haptics in the phone so it actually matches the ringtone is matched up with the vibration when it vibrates on the table and I'm really into that design the fact that they married sound and haptics together seems like a really obvious idea but it they didn't really nail it until this interation iteration so that's my example nice some multi-sensory design there so we're gonna open it up to everyone and if you have a question I believe that Nichole is running around with the microphone and please raise your hand if you'd like to ask a question hello panel thank you so much for this awesome talk it was really cool hearing a little bit about how important his story is as well as like discernible dialog and the idea of having sounds for States as a UX designer I'm super interested in hearing a little bit more about what frameworks were using to better communicate this vision with design so are there any frameworks that we're using for a sound playback for example that provide any transformations or DSP on the sound as its played back in the app or service that's super interesting to me at sub hub you know I'm always interested in figuring out how the sound design could get somebody to convert better in for example selling or buying a ticket but in games it's like a totally different world where I had things like stereoscopy I have things like delay you tell me more about that yeah so I have a fair amount of interactive experience and so you know game audio middleware such as W wise and F mod that plug into game engines like unity unreal those and wise I'll pick on in particular is a fantastic product that does do real-time DSP and effects on content it runs relatively lightweight and it has just two decades of create engineering Sony just bought wise so I'm kind of no I think we're all waiting to see how that product evolves as a result but it sounds like it's gonna survive us a pretty strong player in the space and I'd recommend folks to play with it and you know package it with your binaries if you can you know they have pretty affordable packages and stuff like that but I would say that one thing if there are engineers in the audience that I'm always kind of yearning for as a designer is you know the infrastructure that powers a lot of the experiences that we are trying to bring to market whether on phone or whether on a smart speaker the underlying infrastructure on the code side often just doesn't support DSP runtime game engines and or even you know bespoke ones that you might be able to pull on an engineer and work with so you know as much as I would encourage people to go out and use wise and tools like it personally I do really want to see engineering work done on the platform and infrastructure sides on on the tech side to just support a wider range of tools in the space thinking about also you know just it's not you know that the actual abilities to do that with that certain devices now is very challenging but I think moving forward I think that's going to be there's gonna be many capabilities around that and I think there's a ton of power and this idea of adaptive audio I mean just from a simple idea you know imagine you have an app on your cell phone and it can immediately sense when it goes in your pocket so it gets louder or the EQ changes to where it cuts through kind of environmental sound or through your pocket so when it's out it can actually be quieter you can you know so these adaptive elements that will hopefully be more at play very soon will will be super powerful moving forward my name is Raphael and you talked a lot about like organizations that have like a big sound design infrastructure or pretty big professional sound design teams I was wondering if you had any advice on introducing like sound design into an organization that is not really like a sound design culture like that is very open to it but just doesn't have like the infrastructure yeah that's why we exist as vendors because I'm not certain that most companies you know know what it takes or know how to how to bring those folks into their matrix and into their design structure where else we also are used to running really quickly as vendors and really lean so I don't know if I answered your question but but I think it's I think it's a challenge and yeah I think it's a challenge and I think it's very very dependent on each company's culture and what they're willing to assume or not assume into their culture yeah just a quick quick one on that I've got just a couple of anecdotes one I create lots of Docs and send them to lots of people all the time so I sort of saturate my channels at the bigger companies with audio information all the time I send white papers I create white papers I'm just sort of busy on that front in hopes that I will spark and get a signal because you know I think Allods right like we exist and we will continue to exist for a reason but if a company is open to knowing more and handling sound better we want to foster that as much as possible so that we just have more resources to do our job whether on the technical side to the last question or on the taking risk side Allods earlier point you know we really want to sort of acclimate those companies and let them know what's possible and kind of you know spark their imagination thank you so much you shared a lot about some principles and frameworks around sound design and something I'm kind of curious about is what are some considerations that you make in your work around accessibility well can we elaborate a little bit more for that crowd on what accessibility means to you um I guess in terms of accessibility like people of all abilities well I think project-specific and also a playback system specific for people like that might have hearing loss or something like that you're definitely taking often taking into consideration those things right for people that might have a hearing loss oh that's kind of what frequencies work better for them you know there tends to be a roll-off in the high frequency end and the low frequency end so yeah we're thinking about kind of how we shape these tones and in these types of environments and and also adapting to generally like what's gonna cut their environmental noise for for everyone another thing about accessibility is a recent project I worked on it touches a massive amount of people it's a KQED who's NPR affiliate for Northern California and the listener group and base is a massive listener base so with that work you know we wanted to make it accessible to generally anybody and wanted to make that work something that anyone could appreciate you know and not super strong point of view on it so yeah we're I can definitely say certainly you know thinking about accessibility issues and stuff like that in these spaces for sure there's also again the opportunity for a multi-sensorial engagement like haptics and sound or you see you know when you see the strobe go off with the width or with the phone ring you know for grandmas and so forth yeah yeah so kind of related to it I will say that one of the points that I actually cut from my slide deck just cuz I didn't kind of have enough time to you know keep talking your ear off one of the big points that's important to me as a designer is program management and this kind of again speaks to some of the material design work that connor's been doing and it's about maintaining an ecosystem all of the experiences in a particular platform and having a set of standards and you know it's it's like I said it's kind of related but you know if experiences aren't kind of regulated to some extent there is no adherence to spec you know things playback too quietly and people not might not even realize they're sound because it's too low people might be wearing headphones like kids might be wearing headphones and you might have a mobile app that didn't adhere to a standard and it comes flying in hot and then you have the potential for hearing damage and a child might not know that it's too loud for them so program management especially in in the technology and software and hardware world where it's not quite as established as in film and broadcast is crucially important because it's still kind of the wild wild west and only a few folks like Connor are sort of really digging in and trying to get that message out there so that's a big note that I again I would love to see the design design community run with and to build on this I had a similar question about accessibility but thinking about of a continuum of ability and we're getting more sophisticated tools on the visual side so we know things like we have tools to gauge whether something is high enough contrast to be visible to a wide range of visual users and we know we have rules that we've learned now around making sure that we don't communicate something by color only reinforcing it with a visual change like an icon or something that can be seen that doesn't rely entirely on color so I was curious whether you are starting to see projects especially for consumer devices or things that you can touch that where you think about this continuum of ability for sound where it I'm really glad you brought up haptics because actually while I was waiting here I got a call and I responded to it and there was no sound so I think and in the same way that visual and guidelines have been provided for designers around contrast and around color we just have these rules and it's extremely helpful I'm curious whether honest design side especially for consumer products are you starting to hear that as a consideration I think so a lot of the the last part of products that I our projects I work don't work on with different companies I often provide kind of audio guidelines that are similar to brand guidelines but they also talk about you know they talk about the thinking process of what are we trying to communicate who are you trying to communicate to what are these kind of brand personas or attributes we're trying to express but also it gets into that more engineering side of you know kind of in my presentation talking about low priority versus high priority priority alerts and how we compose those based on how people listen in environment so yeah as I mentioned a lot of the the last part of projects with me is essentially creating documents for companies that they can have and that they can continue to use and that can inform you know the remainder of products they might have coming out you know shortly after as well and if I want to be maverick about it you know I feel like with sound a lot of times we don't know until we hear it and it's trial and error and exploration because ultimately we're trying to give a personality to the sound and so how do you define that personality you know it's going back to the adjectives you're shaping shaping and sculpting and yeah we can look at in oscilloscope and we can look at frequency response and we can look at the science but it's ultimately we're creating a personality and almost a persona to these sounds when you think of these modern notifications from whatsapp to slack to Skype to to all these products and that's so it's it's really sometimes it starts on the dartboard yeah I'll just add that you know we use our ears professionally right so it's largely about intelligibility is sort of our number one mission like whether it's dialogue or whether it's sound effects or music we want to really use the full frequency spectrum and we want to really make things pop and punch so part of it is you know mixing just mixing thoughtfully and really using our ears and using our experience another piece though is you know having a product that supports what we imagine so that has to do with having a sound team on early enough so that they can influence the speaker that's chosen because realizing that soundscape does have a lot of dependencies in the consumer product world on both on the software and the hardware side so it's kind of cool yeah I just said there are objective and subjective measurements that can be made and if if you're referring to a specific project I would definitely recommend engaging with a cyclic ooh sticks expert I am soca thanks a lot for all the informations I'm a huge Android ring phone fan so what I usually do in an online environment is like I go through all the ringtones and cannot decide for one I chose the one you play today but I also have a slight hearing impairment it's like not I never got went to a doctor but I know that for my friends and that's also annoying for them for me it was will be just like a super little step it's super helpful because I'm not educated and what people hear better or not so I don't know actually that higher frequencies is something I hear better so it will help if you just put it in the name like you know hearing impaired caught on that's not a good name but you know get the point that would be super great just a little thing that's a great suggestion there is a there is a field of so this is something that hopefully will become more prolific but so in VR and AR mixed reality there's this notion of HRT F sore head related transfer function has to do with the actual physical distance between our ears and the shape of our ears and how the reflections in a given environment are interpreted and there has been talk about essentially creating custom profiles for people that are HRT F custom profiles so essentially you would go in and you would have your HRT F profile map and there would be something you'd be able to load on to some kana you know a pair of headphones or an operating system so I think I'm kind of hoping that you know that there's a little bit more signal folks like yourself are kind of you know pushing that forward but there is definitely a field of science there and it can create just a better experience even for a traditional listener because it again it translates what's true it's a sound designer was trying to convey kind of universally over all here listeners hey my name is su Yash I have two questions one is regarding why aren't why don't we see more sound used in the apps because I you know in any game you play every tap every click everything has a sound effect but in apps there is no sound except for like you know Facebook or apps like they put like notification sound which is annoying and you know they everybody want to know you with notification but they don't use sound like in other places I noticed what's where do you think sounds could be used in apps and second question is I really am fascinated by sonification any books or any resources to learn about sonification so I think you know it's it's dependent for the app you know app question about why they don't add as much sound on apps isn't his games you know I think it's dependent on the app and like what the brand is trying to communicate ultimately right and Facebook you said for example has kind of more you know touch sound things like that more just feedback generally speaking and I think part of that is you know the demographic they're reaching is a bit younger so they want to probably gamify the experience a bit more whereas some other apps you know might be a bit more just pulled back from a design sense and more like clean right so it's I guess every app is gonna be different right and on how much or how little sound it will use I think it's very specific to that particular company or that particular brand as far as books Sonic branding is a great entry book into the field of audio branding it was written about ten years ago but that's a that's kind of a classic classic book to read these companies are incredibly intentional you know so getting any sound into that app is a huge ladder of approvals and yeah so it's a miracle when a sound gets picked yeah just one book is a universal sense is a fantastic book it's pretty deep pretty heady but all kinds of great stuff and very applicable I wonder if you could identify some dangerous or unhealthy behaviors around sound that humans have and what you think the risk is yeah music is too loud man I mean I have kids I'm old but I mean music is generally do genuinely too loud so there is a topic that maybe some people have heard of its called the loudness war it's genuine it's a real thing it's a it's a field of study now and it has to do with generally how records were made in the 90s primarily and just continuous driving up of sound systems play it back to loud and and music also loses dynamics and audio loses dynamics the loud it the louder the music is presented on the whole the less dynamic range it has and more it's getting squashed the top and therefore the less information and the the less drama you can sort of author into sound so there's a creative risk right off the bat and of course yeah hearing is precious and after being in this field for many years playing in bands for many years I can say that I you know I I would definitely support a PSA for the kids you know preserve yours here you can turn it down but one of the cool things about you know things like electric cars and a lot of the things that Connor was talking about in his speech about you know kind of turning the world down a little bit is you know you X sound design and the proliferation of sort of audio in our environment and devices you know becoming more auditorially you know responsive is that we do now finally kind of have a chance to curate and maybe you know gates are gonna go away because gas is expensive and electric cars will come in and so I'd like to think the world is getting quieter but yeah there are some risks currently ya know I'll piggyback on that real quick and say that our urban ambient environment is too loud our bart trains are too loud being a pedestrian next to an air brakes on a truck and squealing brakes on a truck goes above the safe level you know I'm that guy who holds his ears shut when I'm on my bicycle and a truck goes by because I know it's gonna affect my work if I don't so you know these are important considerations especially when you have kids and they're exposed to these ambient sounds I think another space that has a lot of room for improvement and is hospital spaces you go into a hospital room and there's multiple devices that are constantly beeping at these people which does drive stress and it drives these moments of you know depending on what level of stress you know it could be it could you be an annoyance but you know these people that are in hospitals are people that need to be in a relaxing environment a place that they feel comfortable in so I think there's a ton of improvement that can happen in our hospitals of kind of curating those spaces but these guys mentioned I think just like the ambient you know soundscapes that we see every day are generally very very loud so yeah there's many health risks I think ultimately have you designed physical object that moves so simplest one could be the sound or the life switch and a complex one could be the motor or draw or sound with the robot arms and if you have it'd be great if you could share the experience because I think I find it's a super typical it it's completely different for digital but it is a part of the experience physical objects sound yeah so you know as a synthesizer is capable of designing any sound in our physical world so a competent sound designer should be able to sit with a synthesizer and design any sound from a trumpet through a piano to a light switch yeah that did that I mean a lot kind of nailed it I mean you can really recreate kind of any sound that is in the natural world pretty you know pretty well through synthesis and you know within you acts too like there's opportunities to do skeuomorphic types of design which is incorporating potentially Foley into that as well although there's been a bit move a movement away from some of that scheme or freak design but yeah yeah I would just say that you know this is the most fun thing we have to design movement there's a there's an exponential way amount of ways to express it ski morphic is a great example and for me again you kind of hit on the head here skeuomorphic is like not cool and then very cool and then not cool I mean it's swings it's a that is like seriously just throw it in the mix because it might be cool that day and you might find the product seems really like it so I would say just get crazy with things that move I mean listen to um you know film is just killer at this look at look at some of the best sound designers look at those sound designers at Skywalker and listen to listen to moving objects in Star Wars and it's wild like you know what a TIE fighter sounds like it's a you know sounds like an animal so you can you can kind of pull anything as I would just say just have a blast with it and just to add heed a there's a whole range of art as a discipline of sound design sound sense is called physical modeling which might be interesting to you which specifically tries to take in the physics of an object and how that would sound what I was gonna ask is you touched a little bit on like designing for AR VR and that's like spatialized audio right but like have you ever designed for something where it's like not necessarily like where it's like just sources in the physical world like you have a bunch of devices surround you know in your home that make noises and how do you approach that design problem like designing a sound environment that you don't necessarily control yeah that's really tricky I think again I'm gonna pick on Connors talk here a little bit or you you got into this a little about not being able to control that soundscape and I'd like to think that we're sort of on the precipice so now that we have microphones as well as speakers on so many things and we have intelligent OS is running on everything and cloud support for assets there's absolutely no reason why we can't essentially be measuring the environment so our headphones currently do this and our phones do this pretty well they do echo cancellation they're always measuring the ambient environment and they're always EQ in so that as you're speaking if you're you know if you're on BART and it's loud as heck you know your voice is still coming through on that call in many cases so there's a lot of work being done in that way but in terms of yeah all sort of the cacophony are trying to control the cacophony in a space yeah I think that that's a tricky one I don't know that we'll ever quite solve that because we can never you know make everybody buy all Google products or or Apple products and we don't know that we'll have control over that but maybe again it's back to your work with material and project and program management you know maybe we will start to develop a standard for especially like in-home sound ecosystems and I think that'd be a great thing so I think there's a lot of work to be done in that space yeah kind of piggybacking on what Kevin was talking about about you know we we might not have that much control over this yet but from a pure brand standpoint you know the brand's themselves should be really considering what these these multiple devices are sounding like and how can they potentially harmonize together I know it kind of beats around your question a little bit but this is actually pretty new I think that companies are really thinking holistically because they're developing products faster the technologies constantly advancing so quick and I think companies are really seeing this opportunity to say okay wow this is cool we have an ecosystem of devices let's have them kind of speak us the same language you know harmonized with one another have similar instrumentation and have an overall kind of cohesive DNA that carries you through an experience and might even tell a story but similar to what Kevin said you might have Amazon Google products and and how will that work out in the future who knows but I do think that idea of kind of a you know an actual like format of how that would play out and an in-home system would be really fascinating how do you feel about UX design kind of prioritizing user control and giving the user the option to kind of mute or turnoff sound how do you navigate that sort of situation I think it's great I think you should give personalization sound is something that's really subjective you know we are from our you know our birth we are around sound constantly you know with music you form opinions about sound I think in ways that other mediums you don't write everyone kind of has an opinion on what types of music they like and that shifts over time so sound is just the same and in the context of product you know I'm just very very sensitive about generally speaking less is more because people have very strong opinions and we have to be careful about how much we're bombarding them so I think personalization and that in that context is a great thing I mean at the end of the day the user has to decide you know what they're gonna play when they're gonna play it and if they have that power that's that's fantastic yeah I will just quickly say a little devil's advocate on that I agree and and I think that there's a an accessibility perspective on that that's like non-negotiable and I think that there is curation is great subjectivity as a thing but it really is medium specific so I think in some cases this is this is kind of it this this in itself is subject kind of to opinion but you know like if you're someone that likes to go to a restaurant and get what the chef makes or if you like to pick from many many pages from a diner I tend to be more of like I want to taste what the chef makes is just that's just my feeling so you know I do want to I think that there should be experiences out there even in UX experiences that you get how you get what's made you get it's bill you hear it how it's made so again just playing devil's advocate I think there's room for both but yeah okay great that's all the time we have so how did you want ascending terrific yeah thank you all thank you so much it was really wonderful to have you I learned so many new terms tonight that I'm gonna go look up and learn more about so I just wanted to thank you all for joining us and thank you all for joining us join us for next month for design is curious so have a wonderful evening thank you very much [Music]
