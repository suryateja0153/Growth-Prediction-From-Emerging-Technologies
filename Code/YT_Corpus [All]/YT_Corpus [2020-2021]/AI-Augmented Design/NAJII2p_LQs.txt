 hey guys and welcome back so today we will be trying to recreate the scene from Iron Man one where Tony Stark first tries on his Iron Man suit and scans his surroundings in this scanning sequence is scans in the objects in his workshop as well as some of his awesome sports cars so we will try and replicate sports car scene by scanning model cars without the use of a marker or image target But Ritz how do establish our Augmented Reality functionality without a marker? Well, we use a markerless AR feature using Vuforia’s upgraded Model Targets for detection and tracking We spoke about model targets in an early lecture on Vuforia 8 updates So essentially if we spoke about how the old version of Model Targets where you had to laboriously and manually scan each and every object using an object scanning app This involved placing your object on a marker template which would assist with tracking the pose of the object whilst you scanned it I wont lie, it was quite a pain in the b*tt and depending on your lighting conditions, it may not work in some cases Now with the new version of model targets I must say the process has been greatly streamlined Instead of manually scanning the object you just need to upload its CAD or 3D model to the Model Target Generator and through the power of Deep learning you have target that can be uploaded into Vuforia for detection Simple Right? So lets get into it. Before I get started with this Vuforia Tutorial if you are interested in learning more about Augmented Reality then I have 3 courses that you can check out One, Is the complete course on AR with Vuforia and the other is the second course on integrating Augmented Reality with the Internet of Things and the third course is my ARCore Master Class If you are want to be an AR expert then check the links down below Okay first we going to continue from the video where we have Vuforia in Unity already set up If you are still not sure what to do, then please refer back to the previous videos Best Practice for Model Targets So before you set up model targets, I recommend you check out this site which explains the Best Practices for developing AR app with this technology The link to this page is I’l have the link in the description down below. So, couple of things to keep in mind with model target is that you can move your view around the object but you cant move the object itself This because the of the way they’ve structured the tracking algorithm The next one says that the objects, that are in a single uniform color are difficult track even though they can be reliably detected It comes down to how well the tech can distinguish between various features Moving on they mention that the object that you are detecting must be complex with sufficient geometric detail This is so the track can be able to distinguish between its various sides So coke cans and soccer balls are out of the question But cars, engines, machinery will meet this requirement The object you are detecting must be non-flexible and rigid So, this means that there should preferably be no moving parts as this would reduce the chances of detection The algorithm is not advanced or optimized for moving parts on the model And lastly, they recommend that your model match your CAD model as much as possible Practically speaking, it makes sense as so to optimize detection They mention that the model targets technology can tolerate up to 20% deviation between the real and virtual object Target Generator To get started, head over to https://developer.vuforia.com/downloads/tool This is where we will download the Model Target Generator This is the tool that will help create the target for detection and tracking As mentioned before that it uses Deep Learning to train the model for detection Click this link to download. Make sure to sign in, if you haven’t already and agree to the license The installation process is pretty straight forward so once you are done you can open it up I already have some models that I have trained before To create a new model target, we will just click this button over here Now CAD model is the directory to our CAD or 3D file, we will get this is just a bit The rest of the fields just fill in automatically Getting the CAD File So for this exercise you can use any 3D CAD model as long as you have the actual model I will just be using a normal tea cup because hey everyone has tea cup at home right? If you are able to, you can design your own CAD model and 3D print this model you know for all those advance students To get the model, Google "tea cup and saucer free 3d Model" you can browse these two sites free3d.com and turbosquid I prefer using turbosquid because they have higher quality models But what is nice is that they have free CAD models that you can use as well You can filter for the FREE models right here You can select any model here that represents an object that you already have or can 3D print I will choose this coffee cup over here This model looks good and should work for our demonstration Its not the ideal model for detection, because it’s not too complex geometrically but it will do the job Click download, Login if you haven’t already And then we can select format of the model that we want Both FBX and Obj will work in Unity I will download and test with .obj Once downloaded. Unzip your CAD model and you will see your materials and object file Back in Model Generator Now remember these empty fields, click select and navigate the .obj file that we just downloaded Click Model Target and it will load our CAD model In the editor to get the right orientation, we can select Model Attributes and change this so that our object has been orientated correctly For this one Up Vector Z, does the job For the scale you can test these various settings I will choose the centimetre scale. You don’t need to worry about the missing colour information for now Looking at Guide Views Reorientate your model as how you’d want to detect it in real life Guide view will create an outline guide for you to align your detections when we run or deploy our app This looks good, You can have multiple guides but you can only select one when you run or deploy your app Good, then once you are done, we can go ahead and Generate Model Target We’ll check if everything is correct as well as our directory, and then click continue Just beware that you have a limited amount of models that you can generate This output file over here is the target database that we can drag and drop back into Unity Vuforia Model Targets Setup With Vuforia already setup, go to game object Vuforia Model Targets and then import the Target Database Okay so open up the folder where we generated our model target Just drag and drop the UnityPackage anywhere into Unity Now instead of the default VuforiaMars_ModelTarget lets change it to Coffee Cup database So this target base is analogous to having your image target marker but in this case we have a 3d marker Lets add in a new 3D game object like a cube to test if our detection is working Before we run it, select Model Target, Under GuideView Mode Select GuideView 2D and this is so that we have guides for our detections Under Guide view, you can select any one of the guide views that we created earlier from the Model Target Generator And then check Show bounding box and Preserve Child size Save it and run it and see what happens Now we just need to align our guide view with own object for detection to happen And if detection is successful then we have cube that is augmented onto our tea cup Now instead of viewing a cube, lets augmented the actual tea cup on the cup target To do this copy the coffee cup .Fbx or .obj into unity and then drag it into our hierarchy. Next drag it as a child of the Model Target and lets resize Once its aligned perfectly. We can once again save and play So, as you can see that we have had a pretty quick detection close up and tracking works very well Deploying to Android If you are happy with the result you can deploy to Android in Build settings and then Build and run. So detection was quite seamless. Tracking is decent but not perfect This is because we are dealing with geometrically non-complex object If we change the object to be a car, we will achieved better tracking accuracy You can find a variety of car models on Turbo squid They are high quality models, so you can expect them to cost a bit. However you may find free models on the site Okay so hope this lecture worked for you, if you have any questions leave them down below Thank you for watching and we’ll see you in the next Lecture if you are interested in learning more about Augmented Reality then I have 3 courses that you can check out One is the complete course on AR with Vuforia and the other is the second course on integrating Augmented Reality with the Internet of Things and the third course is my ARCore Master Class If you are want to be an AR expert then check the links down below
