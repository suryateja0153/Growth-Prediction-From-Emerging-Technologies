 Defining my style is easy! You take a little bit of Arcimboldo, a little bit of Sponge Bob, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, you shake it up really hard and see what happens! Broadly speaking it's a mix of classicism and pop culture references. Digital art has a leading place in my work. I prepare all my projects and sketches on the computer, even for street art I'm interested in new technology like augmented reality because it seems to be indispensable to move forward in my work, to open new doors. Personally I can't be satisfied with producing images in the same way all my life. I need innovations. These new avenues are really interesting. These are unexplored paths, I'm convinced that there are amazing things that can be done with them. Also, you can create interactions with people which is super interesting. Creating a piece of street art and letting people interact with it thanks to augmented reality is something I really like personally. I really think it's something every street artist should do.
