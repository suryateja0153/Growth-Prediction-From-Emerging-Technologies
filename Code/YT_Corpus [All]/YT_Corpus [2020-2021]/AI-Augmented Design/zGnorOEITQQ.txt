Be careful not to follow them When You have the cable in your mouth We also watch connectivity On the right side We have the USB type c plug The plus button and the volume down button, and in the center of the button, we have the power button We have a grid for the speaker, and on the left we have a second grid because It&#39;s also stereo on the left side and we have an 3.5-inch audio jack A Slot For microSD card Now Let&#39;s untie The tablet greets Laptops or mini laptop I want you to say pretty hard to break You got a magnet On both sides Therefore If you will On such a product, take care of how you unfold it The country Is a laptop Hidden Keyboard Or better Tablet with a keyboard hidden from Lenovo in Mask Holo keyboard practical Has the layout of a normal keyboard I am with the touchscreen and when I light up Tablet Turn on the keyboard Until it opens This device I forgot to mention that You can turn it into a tablet multifunctional Or you can use a module You can sit in the kitchen or put on the table on the train You look at a movie You look at what you want I started the tablet I set it Sigma did As usual with any other device I installed AnTuTu and geekbench Before I go to this I&#39;d like to talk a little about the keyboard What I mean is when you put it in body mode The keypad turns off automatically Mars no function Practically How did you get through a certain no The keyboard is activated So you can use it A laptop module Regarding Leute These keyboards For me It&#39;s exactly the one on a laptop with one difference Instead of the Windows button Here is the home button that if in Ploiesti Application At Fish he does exactly what he does And the circle usually We also have the page up page down function Print screen dilit Backspace And all the buttons Functional from F1 to F12 With different functionalities such as F2 and f3 You can adjust Volume F5 and S6 You can adjust the brightness in combination with With the function key you can adjust brightness Keyboards Namely Less or higher depending on how you want View this paste I really like it is not really Exciting for a long time They are accustomed to touch keyboard It really is a totally different feeling this time Traditional blanket As for a portable device I love the fact that I have a keyboard just like the one on my computer I also like the fact that this device kept the shortcuts on Windows Or with clock In operation like another tab To Select different I close more I can give another YouTube Song Maker Chrome Manager or anything else open Also when I write in the text You can select to give control for children controlling for Catholic pasta for Cot and so on If you open an app and tap another F4 It&#39;s closing You can get it from here From the menu You pull it up And that&#39;s it In terms of multitasking There&#39;s also a window mode But I noticed that it does not work All applications And what did not like At this Type of window management That I can not Change it so I can not change the size I do not like this but it moves fast enough so I can use it in the fullscreen to give And And so on However, if you want to use this feature it is easy to access with a double top On Status bar Or Notification bar tablets If we get a swipe from the top down we have Notifications and of course Quick settings Power of the screenshot dolby Of course the setter menu Let&#39;s look Settings Lenovo did not intervene here And he left it This layout In practical peace It&#39;s actually the Android 6 settings menu so much Board Android 6.0.1 and the latest security episode on April 1, 2007 What I&#39;m saying here is that unfortunately Lenovo will probably not launch a software update anymore But given the purpose of this tablet myself, I do not even bother with any older version Android You mean you can watch Android 5 Just as good as you can on Android 10 On Facebook movies and so on Now As for tablet functionality when you want to write Get it through Doxi slide and other tools from Google Regarding software editing When you are free to give them up often and And those From the Play Store A minor look I&#39;ve noticed on this tablet and it&#39;s good She did not like it It&#39;s because I do not have a preinstalled application in the gallery What am I required to use Google photos? Personally, I do not really like this app but on a simple search on the Play Store I found a simple gel South Application Simplistic what my images display from Device It does not occupy a lot of resources and you should keep in mind that this device has only 2 GB of RAM So it recommends using applications that use quite a few resources In terms of multimedia consumption It&#39;s good here much more enjoyable That he has two Stereo speakers and it sounds extraordinarily well for a device in this price range We&#39;re joining YouTube Hermannstadt It does not have an extraordinarily high quality, that is, it does not compare it to a laptop Which has Harman kardon or akg soundbar and so on But the Dolj function on this laptop Me when the multimedia content that supports this technology is heard pretty well I also like that The voice is clearly heard and all the elements From the movie or the video you are watching It sounds pretty good So when you buy this device And you use your vacation on the road or just sit in the kitchen and Looking for something on the Internet you want to listen to some music in the background It&#39;s good I like to hear better than a radio sounds better than a phone is heard almost like Portable entry level speaker Therefore For portability and chapter Functionality I really enjoy this yoga ya12 One more thing I have to mention and almost was to forget The fact that I have a touchpad but I assume in the usual touchpad is simply a square Where I can have my finger and make contests on screen I do not have Right Click and I do not even Click Left To access a function I only could hiatus Yes A short text does not necessarily mean traffic Download and on screen But you will have to press A little longer Example So You have to get used to, but I like it so much The fact that I have a keyboard limp A very slim device on which you just marooned in your satchel and one with me Always Indeed, the screen does not have the best resolution For a portable device I find it pretty good Therefore Let&#39;s try I&#39;m writing a document Google docs Okay I have a text editor where I can write absolutely Cel.ro Or It was not like this Textures but in the end everything I wanted was just to To write text Finally, we have arrived at the Synthetic Tests Let&#39;s see how they do it up AnTuTu I did not understand AnTuTu Does not work in landscape mode But I got a score of 57,000 881 points Yes it is a score Very weak But from my point of view I do not think it reflects Really these performance tablets Why do they say that? Minimum Chrome in the background with a lot of memory I am AnTuTu with Google docs on YouTube And yet They do not do well 100 years Then you go However Let&#39;s look at the geekbench 1,224 single coy points 2019 Multi points I forgot to mention the processor of this is a parkour An Intel X5 z8350 atom What runs at a frequency of 1.40 and And 4GB That being said Lenovo Yoga a12 is one Entry level device for those in need Where&#39;s the mini laptop or a tablet when you&#39;re on the road Also This looks good just bothers Okay Pink you can put a sticker you can put in exchange And so on It&#39;s very easy to get into any pussy bag or any little one Let&#39;s look at the iPad as well I chose Two devices one with Android and of course one with iOS Somehow I&#39;m more excited about this iPad than this Lenovo why this iPad is good 9.7 7 out of 2018 is the first iPad out of the Pro series What works with the pen from Yes Of course given that we are talking about Apple We do not have pens included in the package Something We have to buy separately Tears As for the unboxing of an Apple device Apple is very simplistic And Very short, that is, we have the device between a plastic film Power cable A box or one click Of course miscellaneous Cards And the charger That&#39;s what we find in this huge box We both have it Charger and cable But the charger bright 10 cows He has an out 5.1 volts 2.1 amp Of course it&#39;s a fingerprint magnet You like But this tablet Must usually It also has an oleophobic layer It is resistant to scratches As for diagonal display, it&#39;s not 9.7 inches. And where does the name come from? it And unlike the model Previously, he does not have that switch for silence At the top We have a 3,5 audio jack A power button microphone And on the right side we have the two volume buttons I really like that they kept it Deck of 3.5 Making it a little more Flexible to iPad Pro that does not have Jack anymore At the bottom We have two grids The two speakers So we have a stereo sound And the charger Lightning How this was to look behind we have a room It&#39;s a room simple Which we&#39;re going to talk about some more about In terms of construction it&#39;s good considering it&#39;s a device of Hundreds of RON It does not seem to be a device of That is, it&#39;s very well wrapped up Very well balanced So everywhere I like this iPad It is small is useful The only thing I do not like and did not really like was the livepad It&#39;s the display layout of what the moment you want to type even if you have a little longer fingers you have to get yourself You stretch a little To get the letters in the middle I know there is a solution to divide the keyboard with iPad Applications But Not about that Also on the front we still have A room for Selfie or on For video calls And what seemed to me very interesting Keeps the home button What has the touch ID So you can use your fingerprint to block it This iPad Let&#39;s open the septum and see how it moves As soon as we open Tablet We have a display Colorful a very beautiful display and what I mean here is fine It has no density Very big That&#39;s 264 pixels per inch The resolution is 1536 per 2048 pixels Also The tablet processor is an Apple A10 What is a 2.34 GB COR code? What is coupled with 2 GB of RAM Come say It is quite a bit, but we have to consider the fact that we are talking about a water device This means that at least the software is optimized Run as fluffy as possible Tablet As for the interface, it&#39;s good if you have a button Device from Apple I do not have There are many things to say Spotlight search In a sort of Upper Down Swipe from bottom to top You have recent apps What I want to meet with the latest software update I forgot my Quick Settings here At the top I honestly bothers me for why. Because it makes me stretch to the side His screen To get started with iPhone or bluetooth I want to adjust the brightness WhatsApp It is an impediment Extremely high On the left side we have door widgets Hickory And here we have a game with applications that are You can move around here She did absolutely what you wanted The movie As for the room it&#39;s good We could say it exists The main camera is 8 Megapixel f2.4 and the selfie camera is 1 1.2 Megapixels f 2.3 But to be serious, I do not think you&#39;ll take pictures With a tablet It&#39;s good to have a room to help you Surprised at the moment or remember something As for the performance of this tablet It&#39;s good How you capture 2GB of RAM and a processor Quad core We have 201 760 points in AnTuTu So in terms of performance this iPad is much better than Lenovo And gaming will surely move better But What I really like about this iPad is that I can buy a pouch With keyboard And again you have a mini laptop or a device Super portable or ultraportable that you can take after you You can write text You can edit some pictures Sing He does not have the power to process a laptop But it will surely take you out of it mess I like how she feels in her hand It is not a Premium product but feels like a Premium product and in terms of quality of construction Apple does not have no I&#39;m at certain standards To lower the price In conclusion, any choice you choose That is, you do Lenovo with Android 6 0 or iPad The last version of the divest is incomprehensible Okay, we just stay a little taste I was thinking of the version Yeah you can buy 1600 RON a laptop And I do not deny this thing But here I am talking about Where a device that has Ultra portability Not a laptop that is probably between 1600 RON You can find an i3 or an older i5 and so on As for this iPad It is You just put it on the top map And so You do not feel the same thing in your schoolbag with this Lenovo I really like this Novo and it seems to me An advantage over the iPad This is my keyboard and the fact that you can do it In body mode Mass mother Thermostat Why is it good for one IPad You will need an extra pouch or something you can Make a star at an angle Also What I do not like about iPad is that you have to buy that pen that&#39;s pretty expensive But Again as mentioned at the beginning of the video, I like it to be a pretty cheap iPad and also has support for the penis From Apple So I will not judge the performance of these devices in terms of Gaming capabilities or processing capabilities Information cherry only from the point of view of media content So on both devices I have audio quality Sanda good Both devices have audio jack 3.5 and, of course, bluetooth So you can listen to music and you will not mind Absolutely anyone in what Look at this One reason I chose these two Amin devices is the autonomy of any of these two Choose It&#39;s good you&#39;ll be at least four or five hours away from the outlet So you chew in the kitchen and celery to go take the charger or you&#39;re on the train or plane Take a long road to do, you will not have any problems Look at the battery So it is up to you to choose iOS Or Android according to your preferences However, you should keep in mind that neither of these devices is made for performance I repeat not You can play more than candy or Candy Crush Saga This Novo Stay on you can play and piubigi but no longer extraordinary pleasure why Why The device is pretty big and pretty uncomfortable to hold Try looking at gaming
