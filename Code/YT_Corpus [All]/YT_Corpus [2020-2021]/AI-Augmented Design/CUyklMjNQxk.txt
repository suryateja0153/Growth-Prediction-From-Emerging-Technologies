 here tonight thank you no he does thanks man said give designs as well for Stephanie Plum boniva who would be a moderator tonight is he has been helping us a lot into putting this together tonight so massive thanks to you and thanks as well for to a partner so the IDSA in west by design super ventures and hardware massive enter the food enjoy the drink enjoy the discussion if you want to have a near demo as well we have no way and Edward who can do that for you will be very pleased to demos Yap to you and with that great on you well first of all again thank you when I first approached the mental review team and Charles with this idea I was like let's we have to do something really to help establish the value of augmented reality for designers and so it makes a lot of sense and when we you know when we kick this off it's it's great to have the support so thank you very much and we'll we'll kick this off officially and for those of you hopefully also that are joining us online or live Facebook you can and for those that want to tweet about it you can find them on I want to reviews Facebook page so there's a lot of social media use the hashtag augmented designer for anything you might want to post and as a just as a reminder there's also an option for us to to ask questions through the the app online Medicom and we'll be able to there's a special code that will she'll be sharing through that so I got it there we go yeah there you go it's all good so yeah for those that want to download the app and then use that special code you'll be able to log in and we'll be able to capture those questions and seamlessly to my phone so with that let's kick it off so some introductions I'm going to pass it to our fine panelists but again what we wanted to bring together is folks that could really bring us give you the latest and greatest of the snapshot of the industry as well as some real hard use cases for industry specific examples given that we are during NYC by design so New York Design Week and we have some great designers here so with that I'm gonna pass it on to Ari to introduce himself worried Thank You Stephanie hi everybody my name is Orion vara I've been helping build the AR ecosystem for over 12 years now as an intrapreneur event organizer and recently as an investor I started the company back in 2009 we developed a art games and not so different than Pokemon ago it was kind of early as you can imagine but actually we also developed some hardcore tech that eventually was acquired by Apple and became the foundation for air kid so it was nice to see kind of the whole loop closing with that acquisition but at the same time you know back then we felt so lonely developing in AR that we felt like we need to get together and there was no event for AR at the time so we started something that is now called awwe as a small event quirky event with just a couple hundred people with some great vision and ideas and concepts and over the years it became one of the most influential event in this space actually the next event is happening next week in Santa Clara so if you can still book some flights be happy to kind of have you use this come code which will give you the best discount we have today but it's really it really became this way for everyone in the a our ecosystem to get together to partner to develop ideas to educate and energy to everybody that goes there so that's why you know we did it for ourselves and now it's kind of serving the whole industry so let's move to the next slide just a few words about super ventures the fund that we put together a couple years ago with the focus of investing in early AR startups so if you want to talk about that happy to talk about it now or today or any time and I'm really kind of excited about this evening because ever since I started my journey in AR it was all about how do you find the most relevant experiences to develop in AR and design is still something that I think we all in the industry need to figure out what it really means because it's a whole new type of experience a whole new language that we all need to create so I'm really excited to have you guys here with us today excellent thank you so our so take it away why don't you introduce yourself to our audience okay hi Marcel I worked in its beta a profit development firm in the Navy Yard inside new lab for those who have been there Kennex Peter started you know this progress that you know most of my work was always in beta firstly there was never being finished and with like ten projects at a time so it was kind of like they just make you poking fun of myself but right now today we have to venture funds been made typically about six Paulito vestments a year we developed about 20 products a year for the last five six years we do robotics medtech consumer tech connected devices but you could think of aircraft mobility you name it so we were industry agnostic we use our expertise in digital manufacturing additive or subtractive digital face of global collaboration and all our past experience of pain of how to collaborate remotely to do some great work across flight officers right now we have every Center for work is out of the new lab here in New York but we have teams in San Francisco Amsterdam may be coalescing around Berlin Cape Town in Johannesburg next week will be in the South African office sharing some of our work around manufactured stories for the ad industry with the South African groups and the following we come back in New York in robotics and the first responder tiger great thank you very much next we're gonna go to me don't need us leaders please introduce yourself yes hello everyone my name is Lonnie the Strom cookies I'm a greek architect living in New York for the past 13 years so together with my partner Lenny we are founders of lot it's an architectural office based here in New York in Athens in Greece and object of common interests our design studio we are not interested design background we are focused more in more sculptural design for we work with galleries institutions museums we present installations have to do with space and objects at the same time merging our two backgrounds as architects and designers what you see is a temporary theater with design for a design Miami two years ago down in Miami we work a lot with temporary projects because they give us opportunity to play and as temporary then they are dissolved in many different pieces that are actually collaborations with galleries or they just disappear and so this sense of temporariness is something that we always like to work with we recently started experimenting and playing around with AR in our work not just in the design part but also for presentation in I would like to speak later in this panel about our experience with us excellent thank you very much and last but not least I'm going to introduce Ross who already kind of kick things off already but tell us about yourself Charles yeah sure so transmen co-founder a tormented with you again were using augmented reality to streamline the product design process I've been in the future prototyping industry for the last eight years have been working with automotive manufacturers aircraft manufacturers we were installing huge virtual reality system the size of this room may be minimum investments several I mean six digits minimum and then two years ago came to market they are kids in a year cause those two framework introduced by Apple and Google that basically make any smart phone they are compatible and this was a kind of trigger event for me I suddenly understood that we could bring those virtual prototypes to anyone any designer any design team so what you see here is augmented with you see applications that we created one year ago this is pretty much what you can see in the in the experience today we like to say that we are at the crossroads of 3d augmented reality and instant messaging so if you're a designer you're working with 3d model you take your 3d model you just drag and drop them to the platform you can use them in ER and then you can collaborate around so those little dots that you see our collaboration items that triggers a conversation it's precisely located and you can say I mean changes shape make this texture evolve and so on and so forth okay good excellent so with sort of introductions I'm gonna let myself last so I've been sort of in the space of what we call digital twin for Cinda sort of the mid to late 90s and as as we saw the evolution of this space we really came to it was obvious that we really needed to show the importance of how designers can really take advantage of this new medium so that's the whole purpose of getting this panel to discussion together today so I come from a background of sort of a hybrid a world where engineering and design design and business again working for powerhouses such as IBM and and the the PLM provider called des Eaux systems is the developer of CAD tools such as SolidWorks and CATIA and I've been working in these project four projects for clients at least the last five years with a lot of AR and realizing what the process that we will need to have to be able to support the sort of this method this new medium will call augmented reality so with that in mind we're gonna kick things off with a little bit of a kind of where we are sort of a snapshot of things off in terms of setting the scene with a couple of themes that I wanted to covers for for our our discussion as we kick things off so in setting the scene I wanted to sort of show this sort of this chart of of the current industry landscape so you can instead of see where things are going it's been obvious the last couple of years and already I'm gonna ask you to kind of give us your perspective of this as well but you see this this extreme a huge evolution of players in almost every possible place whether it's hardware developers software mobile apps and the sort of the baseline technology to support all those as its evolving extremely quickly it's changing dramatically drastically every quarter if we look at another one example and I had a couple more but I'm not gonna bore you to death but the point the point I wanted to make with this is that the numbers are staggering the amount of users per are estimated to go over if you put them all together it's over billions its billions of users and you probably probably the latest numbers as we move forward but the reality here is we wanted to sort of see that the space as a whole here and that's just a are I can put up the VR developer site as well but the other thing that I wanted to highlight is that we are going through this transformation it is a point there's an inflection point where we have the maturity the technology going to a point where we can evolve and we were just talking about this earlier where you see this happened in the 60s where you went from you know doing things that hawk would in in two rooms in GM for example which is that picture on the far left which you have a bunch of craftsmen working on stuff on paper then you went into the 80s and 9 is where you had the personal computer evolving where you start to see the evolution of of a collaborative product development start to mature a little bit and now you're going into this new phase where everybody can work remotely either at VRA or collaboratively what is that gonna mean for us so in order to kind of put that together I wanted to highlight a couple of interesting things that I thought the way I look at it here is I break it down into three sort of sort of the the thing that we see in the mass media or the apps that are mainly main made for consumers is sort of you know living your life in this augmented reality space right and the other one that we're seeing a lot more of the last five six years is taking this technology that it's is adding a little design and mixing it up and letting it bake and see what comes out the other side okay and then finally at the thing that's really interesting for me is this new medium as once we have the technology ripe enough to be able to to support the use cases being able to design directly and went to reality and that's where I'm really interested to hear your perspectives on today so these are some examples I'm gonna go through them very quickly just so to get your your your thinking I want you on the audience to start thinking about the kinds of things that we could be doing so the traditional made for consumer kind of use cases you have information on the go you have actionable insights you know hopefully taking like I said here taking giving the power back to the consumer or the the shopper going back in the shopping on in a store in a traditional store and other examples such as mixing you know makes it a reality for for enjoyment where we can talk about some of the new games that might be coming out your way some other it the second example that I wanted to share with you is this idea of where we have creative folks like the teams the guys here on my right who are sort of taking this medium and mixing in some creativity and some design and what comes out on the other side or you have some really powerful use cases that you can start to leverage meant that you know communication of business plans so how can you make better decisions faster how can you conceptually support those case studies with powerful visuals and then you know at the end of the day how do you create that visceral response to an experience right and and that can be very powerful and help people along the way I used the game of thrones for those that are Game of Thrones fans in in the audience no spoiler alerts in case you want to catch up but just highlighting with the examples of some of those visual experiences that were created for some of those other marketing experiential marketing events and last but not least some again something to think about and as we move forward in this medium is sort of how can we move in how can we make somebody an Augmented designer and that's the examples here where you have sort of what I think about as an industrial designer or designers in general is they're very powerful they have a very strong empathy and they have a very strong ability of being able to design and context and for non designers I think this is a tremendous opportunity to use these kinds of tools to help enable that kind of capability that made these other non designers may not have so and then finally last but not least for those that that have been playing in these sort of fair in this area and the tools to being able to directly does in 3d like gravity sketch and some of the other tools that we're seeing not only does not only design reviews but actually creating directly in that medium so I'm really excited a couple other things to think about here for the introduction is balance and I'll point directly to this is it's not only about the technology but we need to make sure that it's just like spinning a plate you can't have it you can't have it all going one way otherwise it's going to fall down so you have to be able to mix this have this right mix of Technology usage a business case and you know brand identity and staying true to your brand and last again it's technology maturity which we're gonna get to in some of these questions it's while it's not about the tech the tech has to work so that's why we have some startup companies here and some folks that are in the industry that can really help us give us some some pointers along that way so to kick things off with question number one question number one going Tory Ori give us sort of a state of the industry today please sure so you know since I got into AR 12 years ago we're trying to predict when is it gonna really take off and we always thought you know it's like just a couple of years away because it's such an amazing top technology and you know when the the iPhone was introduced and then Android phones all of a sudden has incredible device with all the ingredients you need for AR but it took much longer than we all fought but I think today 2019 it really feels that we're heading for exponential growth and there are some really key market indicators that point to that one is the tech giant's are investing billions of dollars in these technologies we're talking about Google Apple Facebook Amazon Lenovo many other Chinese companies as well and that's producing not just more you know technology and in content but also that are enabling people out there like I said before that can actually develop AR and VR applications in much simpler way than when we started the second point is that enterprises are now completely into it you some of the surveys that we've seen recently point to over 70% of enterprises that have either started implementing AR and VR or plan to implement it by next year and there's a lot of FOMO going on here because they see some of their competitors using it they know that they have to use it whether they understand how or why or not the third part is the install base especially when it comes to AR with mobile they are like I said there's now over a billion mobile devices that are they are enabled in that that's an amazing install base so today there's 1 billion devices in according to Facebook and some other metrics there has been about 1 billion people that have experienced AR so it's really in most cases maybe it's Pokemon go and Google sorry ah snap lenses and so on so not the the high-end type of failure but still a yarn it's educating people about this and the reporter we're seeing from these people is that those who tried it really liked it whether it's for you know try before you buy or for for other kind of things and that points the fact that now that the trick is to create experiences for the rest of us right for everybody else so that when you get in you have something that can really be valuable for your life or your business the fourth indicator is that investors have poured a record number of dollars into AR AR and VR startups nearly seven billion dollars last year and that's again that's an indicator that there's interest from investors and there's plenty of startups out there that are developing interesting things that could really take this industry forward so that's kind of not surprise for me that most analysts predict that this could become a two hundred billion dollar industry sometime in the next decade and that's you know it's not where we were ten years ago where there were just some really cool ideas in concepts now it's real products real people using it and all the big companies are behind it awesome thank you thank you for that very interesting I'm gonna go on to Marcel for question over to you and this is a you know kind of general design but I'm gonna say you know what is your design process what is your holistic design process and we're all engaged with the experience you know if you call if you use joke lines quote or any age of IOT so how does that impact potentially your design process or so you know for me my design process has evolved over the last 20 years from you know being at the forefront of the design challenge be that person that generates the designs dating to the being the purser person today that has to facilitate the design experience and design tools for 20 other people which is a very different role than you know I have strong designed desires and expressions and opinions and it's very hard to to you know pose these on my on my team because you know we have an extremely talented group of people that I work with and my goal my sole goal today is to both in design business that's interesting at all levels from venture to philanthropy and how do we participate in our local and ecosystem how do we collaborate across offices how do we optimize work flow all the boring stuff that you don't think when you know off when you're 20 but the stuff that really you know when I started 2D visualization and animation was all the rage in the 90s name 3d printing in the early 2000s and now it's like you don't have to 3d print every model and really you don't you should get over 3d printing it's awesome and we use it every day but it's not the right tool for rapid exploration across boundaries so we are super interested in how VR and AR workflow will change our design practise over the next 10 years you know Gravity Sketch and the ideas there the tools want to be better all the time and all the money that's been poured in right now you can see the rapid effect it's having on the way you the way that we can use them without investing in ourselves there's also if anybody went to CES you know we've seen all the investment in television and lens technologies for the VR and AR headsets trickle its way into high resolution headsets that the military and the design office alike use so we're super excited about resolution militarization light weighting things that will allow me to use this so that it feels like an extension of myself so they're big places or not replaces but becomes an alternative to the pencil and paper awesome no need I would like you to weigh in on this as well as a from an architectural perspective I think as well yeah I think I agree that we are commonly different type of studio like smaller scale more it would have to be more involved in putting projects and efficiency is even more important for us we don't have usually the capacity that you have or the capacitance as large a few to have so also I think the current state in design is that also remote work in cross-disciplinary correspond but there is work work is even more and more evident so for such young firms to be able to be they don't have the resources to be able to be efficient as you said traditional ways of working that with like with 3d model with 2d even 3d printing that is super great but we I think more and more I see trying to explore AR and VR because of that necessity and nowadays more is more accessible we used to hear it we used to listen but it's it's now even even that if I listen to it for like for the past many years it's not we have a capacity of film like ours to have the capacity to start like exploring it and we're trying to evolve through it and see and what they can do for us so the lower barriers of entry has allowed you to sort of adopt these just cases that would be prohibitive in the past exactly okay and also it's motivating because you say okay it's accessible it's not only the large and the figures of how about their shows you can do it let's try to see where can they take us and how we can make it things work for us excellent okay thank you so let's put on a question over three so this question is for my friend here or Charles so take it away so however it is the technology I guess we're there if you look at the design process today each stage is basically you have application which are ready to help the designer today so for instance had sketching phase when you start think about an idea and designing it I mean gravity sketch as earnings as an example is very good very powerful then you want to go I don't know for design reviews you work with rhinos really for instance you can use design reviews tools such as mine desk vo you can do in-depth review provided us the hardware as a setup someone to do you want to do something instantly really collaborate streamline and share the design intent as Leonid as mentioned with basically everyone even people who are not a oh and we are already this is a sweet but sweet spot for augmented with you further down the road in the poly design process you can think about feasibility and assembly studies checking whether this part fits together with this other part you have great tool name verify i FY which enables you to do it in VR it even enables you to record it and to send it to your manufacturers which that you don't have to share hundreds of slides with them and so on and so forth so I guess the real question is Reza for the designer and the engineers towards themself okay which tool do I need for each step because we often hear a demented with yogi can you do renderings as well can you do assembly feasibility as well no we can do something very specific very job to be done very vertical we do it well and this is the same for the other apps so the main questions that you have to ask yourself is ok which pain I am I trying to solve with this a yarn or the artwork excellent all right I like to repeat your awwe add-on for a second here and give us some insights that you clean from your many years at bringing all the best that there is for a RvR X star in one place in Santa Clara design well in terms of these these use cases that that shawls started off with a little bit so some of the examples that you might be able to also share I know when it comes to use cases we've seen tremendous growth in the enterprise first you know starting in 2012 2013 2014 and there it was mostly around improving logistics processes about remote expert assistance about improving safety and security and things like that but you know when you think more about kind of in terms the design context and and consumers the mainstream I think you know beyond entertainment which I think most of us have tried you know the face filters and so on there's the biggest use case right now is probably in e-commerce try before you buy so you want to buy so far you can see how it looks in your living room or you want to buy glasses you can see how it looks on your face or even earrings and now just this year are some amazing applications came out of love to see how a new color will look on your head before you actually put it on that's super valuable for users I tried it myself and I have to say even on without any hair it works great so these things I really have improved from a technology perspective and are becoming very useful another thing is what I like to call with it fit so we have something and you want to kind of measure it you don't have a measuring tape or you know I'm not sure about the measurements you can use a are too so see how it will work so for example you want to make sure that your suitcase can be acceptable as a carry-on just point a kayak up app or stanza app to it it immediately tells you if it kind of fits in in that size and then you can imagine how you can start measuring things in your life in a very quick way just point your smartphone to it and it gives you the answer immediately and finally I think maybe the the number one use case that we soon we're all gonna use is navigation Google Maps is already introduced a are based navigation to on Absalon their pixel phone which some people are using again and soon it's going to be available to everyone on on smartphones and I think that will be a game-changer because then everyone will use augmented reality on a daily basis and it will probably come the number one use case great question maybe for Marcella nowadays when have you already put your design to customers where's video and I know you did but maybe can you tell us a bit about this experience yes we have in a couple of cases already and in the in terms of luck in in a context of a review or of a very preliminary design not as a final presentation which I I really this is what we're looking forward because I think it's really good tool to to convince the way we used to convince many years ago with like the super high high resolution realistic renderings but this time it is something that cannot you don't you don't fool the other the other party because it's there it's real and you can see it and almost touch it and I think that has been appreciated from the other side and then things don't need to be perfect perfectly refined like a flashy renderings and lighting and amazing details because it's everything's acceptable acceptable when you see a physical thing and that helped us a lot to convince not to comment like communicate our design without doing that much work because we used to have put so much effort to do a presentation but now we don't maybe wouldn't need it yes in the early 2000s I used to pay rent from Photoshop in 3d renderings and you know that level of perfection that we were striving for them it's not something that we're looking for now oh of course keyShot and other helpouts are giving you real-time high-resolution VR environment renderings if you want it but our clients are in or if they just see a working concept model that they can cut there's a sense of ownership I can touch it doesn't need to be a 3d front it doesn't need to be a final object that in process flow and the ability now just started looking at portable VR systems and orbit our systems that they can play with and they as simple as on your phone we have you know when I first forever reviewed and it was basically or so this is great because I can send a file file you know I was most interested about what flow and mock-up but also the client interactions like they are excited about crying the need to will be first to them it's the first time they engage with this hardware very few of them are on top of that level of technology integration when it comes to the design process it's their first time they super inspired and no matter how simple it is that will change it becomes the normal just like 3d printing in the normal but I'm you know right now what we're doing is we're changing our entire office infrastructure to allow us to experiment with different technologies different Design Review technologies and design work for technologies for the next five years because we don't know what is going to be needed to drive these systems so everything from you know handset to the full nurse server rack we have accommodated for the entire array of hardware investment so but by effectively turning the office into this non swappable server rack great so that's actually perfect lead-in to the next question I'm gonna sort of set this up by saying having the opportunity to to see a lot of design houses both architectural and is industrial design product development and they're a are sort of sort of workshops let's say I've seen a lot of that technology that's everybody uses a little bit differently have their own use cases but you know for those that are wanting to jump into things you know what are some of the key takeaways for companies that you know that designers are wanting to dive into this how big how can they get involved in it for us it's very much still in the early stage of experimentation I feel even this with technologies changing so quickly you always going to be the early stage of whatever the next version is so for us I don't want to get too far ahead where you buy all the latest tech and then you're stuck with this old technology within a few months but we reinvest a certain amount of budget every month or a recorder in exploring these new technologies whether they 3d printing or robotics or sensing or IR VR equipment so I think committing to reinvesting in your in your education and experimentation in this space is what's gonna drive success in this space and figure out what Dec fits with your workflow because it's not a one-size-fits-all solution there are too many players and too many interesting things happening simultaneously sure sure so no neither you know I kind of want to jump on a little bit early about you know there used to be a time when we did a lot of that render high in renderings and now we have this opportunity in this new medium it's almost like less is more do you find that within the architectural clients sometimes I think it's really important act except clients have bit harder to to work with because they tend to be a bit towards a more conservative mentality then I think the design world is moving faster and design clients the clients I have to do with these eyes are easily trained or easily easier no more be more exposed to this kind of new technologies so I mean so I think in terms of architecture is if it's it happens in a much more in the very high end of the project and we're still a small firm so I think there are much bigger players that take and reapply that was that I was 10 years ago was very pressed I heard a lecture from Bangkok Burkle from a human studio Netherlands they were doing a project for a in Stuttgart and mummy 15 years ago they were using this kind of technology to me that were I heard experimenting still and but the lecture was all about not about the architecture was about training the owner the clients to to be to believe him so that's the hardest thing no matter even with Fortius technologies or for coincident design in architecture the most hard thing is to to train some of those to that be a bit more forward-thinking from 2003 I was designing a church the Catholic Church and I was supposed to show sunbath animation so that at a certain date the Sun hid the baptismal font in this church was my last church but I I showed this successfully after borrow Monique's world and then they made me burn whereas very young at this stage they made me spend more than a week to build a physical paper model to verify that I wasn't lying about the coordinates of the Sun this was like basic 3d IMAX stuff in 2003 but it was I couldn't even try my own boss to believe me to use the tool properly so it's hard yeah thanks guys number 5 so kind of putting now your your your wizard hat for what's coming next what do you think is kind of just over the horizon when it comes to ATR so you know there's a lot that we can still do an improvement a technology side but I would actually argue that this is the time for creators for designers for people that build content to shine the tech is good enough we have the tools we have devices out there now let's create experiences that will delight users and will be essential for their lives so so for me that's kind of the the big focus but the question is what is good design you know how do you design what's the new language of interaction in a world where there's no keyboard and mouse and these questions are only partially answered at this point so I think that the big things that we'll see in the next couple of years is kind of this language evolving new techniques I mean new methods not not technology but new methods of how to design and how to to pay interactions that really take advantage of this new medium okay Charles definitely with some kind of to invent a new keyboard to help people basically designing a our VR and grab this shape make it bigger make it evolve so this is still I'm saying so it's a it's a whole new language so we should develop it yes it's up to us I mean that's really and just as this song yeah I mean just as a sidebar one of the conversations that I can share with from my from my discussions and projects with with hardware developers like meta vision is there is a need for a whole new user experience we can't go back to as I said in my early kick-off it's not about you know it's about creating getting rid of the metaphor we can't use another keyboard or a mouse to interpret things on XYZ and something that's directly 3d in your mind you can you should be able to go and use your hands naturally to develop the the design directly in 3d as it should be without eliminating all those those interpretations and interpolations that take place today because I'm sure you're doing and why were you doing things with our colleagues always you know you still do the gestures this is out there it just they don't do anything well you're a Greek so it's so guys as I sort of the question 5 book to you as well but a little bit of a twist so keeping that in mind I have a because you're more on that creative side I would say you know architecture design I was presenting with one of the designers is here designers from unity speaking before me where he you know he kind of stood wouldn't say he said you know where they are I think there won't be a need for designers in the future because it's gonna be designed automatically so for the creatives which you know I part of that as well I want your input on this particular spot so Marcel I think with every wave of new technology from you know from then where the first Ford Motor car that stableness be made there's only need for designers because we've optimized this part of industry so much that no one has to rethink and Ford obviously because the press the precursor to a massive car industry today and it's being disrupted again by newcomers I think that it's kind of a naive statement but it's also the perfect statement to make to aggravate designers because sometimes they need to be aggravated to Reese tip up to the plate and design new interfaces you know we are designers aren't very easy to say this is too hard indoors understand all the technology in all the of context or context realization of what makes that this design to work I think once you get out of that comfort zone were refusing the tool effectively and you something you're the software and the hardware of the sensing then you can start looking at wonder what kind of interface is going to drive the future of interaction for VR AR and future tools and I'm sitting here there's some great things that we can talk about or maybe you know all prototypes around just to make a our experience is better and and that's what that's what I hope to do for the next five years is create that platform for experimentation where we can just make this part of our normal output and just get under the hood of what makes it tech to adapt to new circumstances in you know new areas of play and I think that has been there historically and we have this expression agree whatever your rock your left you'll find the design around so I really think that's behind every great project there is a great designer and so designers evolve and the way technology evolves designs will find a way to to use that technology to something new and and I think there are open-minded enough to maybe some of the studies and interior design architecture what I ended up doing start about doing whatever else and that's I think Design Thinking doesn't go away and nothing that's why they're useful in all these explorations of new applications in companies that acquire companies and as you said designers are it's the time of the journeys to to try to play around and see what they can come up with many times they don't get all the credit many times they get all the credit but they keep doing it great great well thank you for that I'm gonna kind of open it up to the audience over the next couple minutes so one of the things that I have to do before I before you as you get started if you have any questions you can use you can use the website or like I mentioned and I'll get them directly to my phone in addition I want to ask you guys a couple questions how many people in the audience feel like they have a pretty good grasp on an augmented reality real show of hands just a couple okay sort of okay so about half the audience and let me ask you do have you ever played Pokemon though show of hands so the rest of the folks that didn't put their hands up to you you did now so it looks like actually you're better are you more familiar than you actually knew about it so I wanted to sort of get that start of I also underway there is a there's some some news that the new Harry Potter augmented reality app is just about to be released I heard I don't know maybe you can confirm that or deny it so any questions from the audience I wanted to sort of ask if if we have any you want to use the app or not we could just to go directly to the old old-fashioned thing in the back there sir I'm just curious to know in what ways do you think the smartphone is an ideal platform but also not an ideal platform for a our experiences or interactions I'm happy to take that I think it's a it's a step stepping-stone really towards where we all want to go I think it's pretty clear that we want to when AR becomes really powerful when it's hands-free when you can just see the information overlaid on the world somehow whether choosing glasses projection mapping you know magical mirror whatever it is but we don't have that technology perfected yet in a way that can you know reach the mainstream and that's what we need this smartphone is sort of a window into that world and it's good enough again I think based on the technology that is out there based on the experiences that we've already seen it's delivering quite a bit on the promise of where AR could go so you still look into the world through with a screen so it's not exactly interacting directly with the world but it's pretty close to that so I think for now or you know for next probably a couple of years it's the ideal platform that we have on hand that is available to a billion people out or 225 billion people out there but where we all really want to go into some form of smart glasses where AR is everywhere you look without the need to hold anything in your hand yeah anybody else wanna weigh in on that yeah I was South by Southwest I came across that Bose AR and phone Sony put the sunglasses with their speakers sounded and I was kind of disappointed ly first than like over the software is not ready yet but here's the hardware you can see it's a cool bike your front headset but the quality was so good to just start imagining what it could be if there was like a bass interaction with the sound interaction for this immersive hands-free experience on top of your layered wall because there's nothing that annoys me more than having fun in front of your face right but it is the right first step and I think you know Google glass went far to like the you know prove that they did a lot of things right you like shows what the future could be they may have just been like came twenty years too early yeah I think that's a good point to add to that you I think you hit it right on the head there's a there's a new study that just came out that said you're there there are about fifty percent more time they'll spend more time on an app on a our VR app if there is sound involved in the experience so the engagement is so much more there if you have that additional level and one other point of information and interest for those that are that want to there's two pop-up stores that were in the city that are still down in Soho that you should check out there's opposed and there's I think Bang & Olufsen so if you haven't been downtown to Soho there's two of them entered reality but on the sound side that you guys can explore we had a question in the front I kind of want to return to a question five and says general question for the panel but you mentions the fun if I can quote you this eliminate the metaphor but if we look at all the other kind of technology that's kind of advanced since talk about the keyboard and mouse there's a reason that that technology there's hints of it in the smartphone for example you have a keyboard do you really feel that it'll be so simple to just kind of do away with all of these best practices of design and interaction that we've had for the past however many years and just shift to this 3d interface no I think you're gonna still use all the traditional tools most of us you know depending on your age right so I I draw on a drawing board like that those transition moments so 25 years ago I draw the drawing board and before that on an easel you know after that in Canada in 3d and all the way to where we are today and I see I would say that the interfaces and the experiences of glue that we designed will layer on top of what it's obsessed and functional it takes you up to two weeks to learn a new interface you're not gonna suddenly jump and forget everything that you were trying to do my four year old kid can navigate her mom's I found and remembers all the security keys for the phones and devices she's four years old like I don't know if I was able to do that in four years but that's her world so she's I mean I think it depends where you come in and depends much of what your history is maybe if you never learn how to type on a keyboard and everything sports recreational X is your friend then it's a different world I like to add to that to answer your question I don't I don't think it's gonna be easy but it's gonna be more natural because if you think about it you know computing as we know it personal computing is only around for 40 years maybe and before that for a million years humans interacted in a different way with the world with each other communicated in a more natural way kind of like spatial computing is promising so I think it's gonna be at some point in the future we'll look back at those loud the last 40 years and we'll think it's gonna be was really an awkward phase in humanity where we use those keyboards and in two-dimensional squeeze and we kind of interacted in a way that is not really the way our brains are wired right I mean with the way we interact this is by moving in a space and but and when you know you move your head things move accordingly and that's not happening on on a 2d screen that we've experienced in the past 30 or 40 years so the transition back to a more natural phase is gonna be hard but I think it's inevitable and eventually it will be there the more the most natural way that we interact with computing guys before I weigh in too many comments without I think it's actually easy to change because we've been having like form of our hands for the past about ten years maximum and then what is ten years nothing yeah yeah I'm gonna use an example for thought my one of my idols in the space is Don Norman for those that design of everyday things or the invisible computer so if you haven't read any of those books I suggest you look them up because the he's a he's a he really has that ability to come to to showcase so the reason why what you're saying is so important so I mean one of my talks about AR I used the 500 years of DaVinci just celebrated about a month ago to come to to make this point you know he's considered probably I use a micro him as one of the first hybrid designers because he did everything right and he used left brain and right brain he was a surgeon you know did anatomy and was also did beautiful art so he and sculpture and everything so he used his hands he didn't have these tools that we created the last 40 50 years so our brain like you said earlier is hardwired to do this sort of thing and it comes natural how does how does our seven month old or a one-year-old use a cell phone mobile phone like an apple without having to learn anything they can't read right it just comes naturally and that that is very difficult to be able to do properly but if you can do it I think that's where it's gonna have tremendous payoffs and it's gonna be able to really become a ubiquitous new language that and medium in which we can creatively make the stuff much in a much better way in a much more natural way for a lot more people than than just the the experts that are in this field spend 20 years learn mastering a particular tool or a device to input data any other questions in going back to something that's more natural I think that's super fundamental because what is life if you're holding someone hand all the time right it was never meant to be like that so I think going natural it will be the hard thing to happen from this stage it will be very hard but I think we have to happen great any other questions from the panel from the audience one more switch your back we'll come back to you last how do you see the role of the professional designer changing as tools such as this especially in tandem with 3d printing moves more it's like the household I think it's the same as you know software you know the question that you're asking points to you know the companies that launch software we can design your own house in your own household right so from the design perspective in the complexity of creativity at scale I've seen people serve assume that they can just do it themselves because you know design is easy are cliches easy product design is easy but it's not because it takes a lifetime of training to just almost get it right and I think these tools will make its way into the household but they will be applied in different ways the design offers versus the household in terms of education or any access training and the professional services I think the same tools will be used in different ways but I always print what I see if I can another company launching this can help you design your two-and-a-half bedroom house efficiently for the suburbs I'm like why I think that they are we are and this kind of more natural visual technology will be easier to get into the homes because it's some tangible and it's more accessible as we said it's already there nobody was been really than a thirty pin things at home and I think it's whatever happened because most of consumers and welcome get it from somewhere and but I think it's the opposite thing will happen what they are yeah I think I mean the the promise that we have from Back to the Future was that you couldn't order a recipe for something offline and then it will just constitute itself in your household but miniaturization me time free look at the physics of making something out of nothing and household with you know core chemistry that's I want to say hundreds of years out it's like maybe it was done out it's not an era near future but everything became much much more accessible for example you can go online almost on you can order anything you like and arrived the same day or you can go me you can 3d penny whatever you like and have it in the same day so all these application companies came up and so you don't really need to have anything at home because you can have it super fast and super easy it's a it's a business plan it's a business problem it's a cost-benefit analysis driving in a town versus having it near your home yeah and there are some you know they're really powerful use case so if you've had a chance of to use that NBA VR but you know you get to see courtside what the action is like I mean how many people can actually afford five and a half thousand dollar tickets and Madison Square Gardens are down and to watch you know your favorite basketball team well now thousands upon thousands of people can can see that experience it may not be the real thing but for not being able to ever experience something like that ever it is the next best thing the security part is that maybe that will become better and he it would replace actual experience and it has happened already I see people instagramming right it's has a replaced actual experiences with different kind of experience everything happens for something else yeah the downside of potential unintended unintended consequences of of these technologies I mean I think we're the the human race and all the technologies that we've developed over our lifetimes a constant tension with you know our social interactions with each other and with the world so the tension is not gonna go away well it's spoken like a true designer I think we're gonna wrap things up I have one last question for you just putting your other hat on now so super ventures sort of think about that as an investment perspective for for you know what are the lessons learned for those that are stunned of scouting those new technologies that you might be looking for you know in a company to support to to invest in you know like we talked about 3d printing is sort of you know it's maybe past its heyday now we're looking at ARS and VR is really taking off what other you know is it the hardware manufacturers what should we you know how would you respond as a as a sort of from a V investment perspective you're asking this is from an into the noir perspective like what you do they about so I think you know for me it's really important to understand that this technology was actually born 50 years ago and if you want to build something for the next 5 10 20 years I think it's important to understand this history because people have made all the mistakes possible whether it's on the tech on the user experience on the use cases on the business models so before you start something you know of course focus on something that you're passionate about problem that is really important to be solved using these technologies but also look at what others have been doing in this space and and make sure that you're really ready to kind of compare yourself to those and explain or or show how you're different and better than any of these things because you know especially when you meet someone like myself you know people have been in this space for a long time we've seen everything we've seen you know several thousand companies pitching in this space and many have haven't done this Homer of really looking at what's happening in the competition so it comes up very quickly in the discussion so that's kind of my tip great well I'm gonna let ask the last question to the audience what can you imagine as the new generation of augmented designers put the question back out to you you've had a chance to sort of hear from some of the experts in the field where do you think design can augmented designers can actually go to what could they be doing using this new medium thank you very much
