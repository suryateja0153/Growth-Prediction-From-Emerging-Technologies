all i would like to thank to dr sarah and dr inji and also everyone who organized and contributed uh to this valuable panel uh it's a great honor for me to be here uh on the other hand my name is dr adalchen i'm from istanbul and i'm an associate professor doctor at istanbul roommate university uh first of all i would like to firstly talk about the micro and micro effects and the uh situation about the postcode 19 also the retail part and also the management and the long-term issues that we have to mention we have to think about so thank you very much it's glad it's very nice to be here i'm glad to be here thank you very much so before we um open the panel discussion i'm just going to just contextualize um where where we are and where retail is um so we have a um a blog post um that we put out with this um session which can be found on the birmingham um business school uh blog and um we know that uh retail spending has been very volatile this year so spending spending's kind of like up and kind of spending sort of like that down again um we know that um in the uk when we were in our first major lockdown um our sales um peaked very much online but then they have retracted a little bit um in virtually every country in the world there's now new kind of uh retailing rules um so um you know things like social distancing and having to wear face masks um and particularly in stores that were um quite highly experiential so where there was a lot of person to person contact um so you know things like beauty counters personal shopping and things like that um we've seen the closure of those in-store services and they've moved online and we've even seen that as far as some of our our in-store um expectations so things like cafes and things we've even seen some of those clothes and they haven't opened up yet now so we've seen this strange sort of rise in on online shopping and but also in the uk we had the eat out to help out scheme um and a number of countries have had different ways of trying to stimulate some kind of consumer spending um but particularly in the uk eat out to household was has been pretty popular and has shown that people do want to go out so we'll say we're seeing this rising online but also simultaneously people do want to go outside and i think we would argue that part of that is because retail is not just about product acquisition but prior to the pandemic retail had become very much around socialization and a way in which people would meet get together and spend time together and enjoy the retail outlets um we've seen new technologies become increasingly important so when i wanted a new desk for this office i went on to amazon perhaps as many people do today and amazon had a function um where i could see the desk in this room so i was able to try a few and work out which one looked better and which one might not fit so we're increasingly seeing technology is um in our reto retail world um you know whether that is something more exciting like robotics or something which is more functional by like using our qr codes and of course many people have gravitated to some form of online payment even in store so using things like apple pay etc now very much before um we went into lockdown we've seen this big development um into what we call sort of fidget off um and fidget is the physical and the digital coming together and i think one of the propositions we would have is that fidget all really is uh one of the the ways forward um i'm just i just wanted to sort of contextualize again and just sort of give you some sort of like headlines and for anyone who's in the u calling in from the uk um you'll probably know that the john lewis advert um has been launched this morning um and in the uk the christmas adverts for the retailers are a pretty big event they're highly anticipated and because they drive that interest and of course they drive that um online traffic and we have been just having a debate before the panel started as to whether we were keen on the um john lewis advert or not so we had a little bit of debate about that um we've seen retail sales rising um we stay and sort of retracting as we've been through the through the pandemic um we have seen um some retailers on making predictions um for those nations that do celebrate christmas that uh stockpiling is going and christmas shopping early is starting to boost um sales uh and i say you know the the certain sense in the market is that things are going to be uh on online um very much this year and we'd be really interested to hear your thoughts as to how you're preparing for the various upcoming festivals and new year and what you're uh how you're uh starting uh to shop um i will show this slide at the end um uh which is uh where you will be able to give uh some feedback which we would very very much welcome but say i will pop that slide up at the end so nobody needs to take those details now um so um we're going to move to our q and a now um i've been given some instructions uh to to read out um so if you'd like to ask questions if you can type that in the q and a and then if your question is selected and that will be read out by my co-chair dr inchi or we are a reasonably small um group so if you would like to um raise your hand um and then again we can invite you um to speak but i've been asked that you don't use the chats um for questions so that those are those are our instructions so as i say you know we we have very much designed um this panel um to invite questions from our audience so please ask as many questions as you have um and we will be very much uh delighted to um to answer those um so what i'm going to do is i'm going to invite um my panel now um and what we're going to do um is we're just going to start off with what we think our thoughts are on the way in which um retail is going to go uh forward and what we think our post pandemic world is going to look like um now the way in which i'm going to do this is i'm going to go um via my screen so i apologize if anybody is seeing the presenters in a slightly different order um but i'm going to call on the um presenters in the order on my screen and the question to my panel members is what do you think retail will be like in a post-pandemic world so i'm going to go to dr erdell first yes uh sarah can you see me uh i can't see you but i can certainly hear you okay because my video is not opened yet but i will start talking yes i'm starting it right now yes first of all i would like to start with the micro perspective that's the one that i'm always writing in my articles for the starting of the covet 19 i think the individual and the organizations and also the systems are going to be defined again retail is the one of the thing that we have to think about the production part and the consumption part of all the system so first of all if we are thinking about uh defining redefining the individual we have to think about the needs and wants and the changes of the individual before code 19 and after code 19. but in the on the other hand if we are going to talk about the effects and the possible important part of the postcode 19 for the retail we must think about new formats we must think about omnichannel we must think about flexible supply chains we must think about digital marketing and campaigns related with it we must think about the demand changes and transformations that are uh really critical for all the companies and all the of course consumers we must think about using data and using the information and the knowledge management for all the things that we touch and we manage the perception of the consumers in general there will be mergers and acquisitions because we have to think about the small and medium-sized businesses for the uh retailing industry retailing activities and also the regulations and the tax policy are the latest one that we have to think about and also we have to know and understand the first of all the individual perspective secondly the organizational perspective and thirdly the system all the things are going to change according to the kovid 19 but it's not a health issue it's an issue that's related with the digital revolution that is uh going on all over the world for example we were thinking about i'm from istanbul and i'm a turkish academician we were thinking about that we are all different all the cultures are very important we are all different but at the end of the day with the koi 19 we saw that all the consumption that we made are very similar all the fears that we feel in ourselves are same or similar all the emotions are very important and same and similar for all over the world that are living the code 19 pandemic so emotions are gonna be much more important for the retail sarah sarah is smiling so i have to i have to stop right now that's right yes so i'm going to invite professor hainer next yes thank you very much well i think the the covet and the current situation we are in was literally only speeding up a process that was already in progress and that is the process of digital disruption or digital revolution similar to what adele said so that process has been or has had been in place for quite some time even before covet and that particular crisis in this case it was a health crisis in my opinion has just increased the speed of change so i'll give you a couple of small examples for instance when you look at people who were online shopping for the first time the average age tends to be well over 50. so that's an interesting you know observation that means you have a whole new cohort of people that have never had the experience of online shopping so i think that means online shopping will increase in market share i think that is one of the main development however we shouldn't forget that online particularly when you talk about grocery retailing still makes up only about 10 percent is online so 90 still happens in physical stores and in that respect i think a development that i would anticipate in the next year is that you know people will change their shopping behavior again you know we were just going to a phase where people were going into more sort of the smaller stores the more local stores they were shopping more often smaller baskets but more often now i think that may perhaps change it looks like the big winners of this pandemic so far grocery retailing in particular are those that actually offer the classical one-stop shopping you can see that in germany and i believe it's relatively similar to what you see in the uk so i think they are there they're bigger trends in society you know working from home staying home seeing shopping less as something you have fun doing but that's something you have to do and you want to minimize that effort so i think these are the kind of trends in the on the backdrop and they have been increased or the speed of change has increased on the back of that thank you thank you very much so i'll go to fiona next um yeah i've actually my comments were very much following on from what hines said so uh very slick from that perspective i totally agree i mean it's no new news that digital is the way forward but i think as a result of that and this is something i've personally been talking about for a really long time what are brands and retailers doing to encourage people to go to stores so experiential is even more important than ever before and i think for me it's quite exciting for those brands and retailers to be thinking creatively to give consumers a reason to stray away and to actually visit physical stores um i agree that shopping local has been a really big trend and i think we're starting to see people talking about boycotting people like amazon and things like that um so i think that's very interesting um and then the third point i just wanted to make was that from a consumer perspective what covert has done to people is so so varied so you've got people that have saved money from not going on holidays you've got people that are out of work um or that have been impacted financially and it's almost a bit like covid's a journey anyway that you have good days and you have bad days and i think that brands and retailers needs to take notice of that and they need to um target consumers on any of those days that they're on and target each of those consumers those that feel like they've got more money and those that are really conscious of it um and i think some retailers are doing that well but i think that's an opportunity that um those that succeed will really perfect thank you very much roman next um all right so um i am going to uh disagree a little bit with uh with ayna and the french always disagree with everything so i have to keep to keep the tradition so a couple of statistics yes it's true that uh 42 percent of french uh have started to buy online for for the first time above what was the the normal average uh but there's a little bit of of a change for example 150 increase being drive and collect so it's not necessarily that they're going to go back to the supermarket 23 decided uh to change or to revise a little bit where they are actually buying and a little bit of resistance the traditional french resistance of what's happened to our small uh shops you know can can we help them is there is there some bypass in some way you know because otherwise the and they have seen that very clearly especially with the second confinement that is not going to be the supermarket that are going to be the winner but it's going to be amazon and we don't like amazon because amazon is just the american giant um 14 of the french decided to test new shops also so they they have revised and it's a little bit in the idea of degrowth also because uh the the kovid or post retail uh kovit for me it's all about a social divide also some people have access to technologies some people have access or not to alternative shops some people still have to go to uh the hard discounter all the little or have to go to the big supermarket but here a choice and a crucial choice need to be made about what we want from our local territories and you know that in french we are always uh labilizing things everywhere the wine from bordeaux and the cheese from here and the the whatever other product from there so we're quite quite proud of our of our territories and uh lastly uh 24 of french said they are not going to go back to the supermarket because they see the supermarket as the uh uh the cause in the sense of kovid because they associate supermarkets with globalization and they associate globalization with uh the uh attack on the environment and eventually the uh the the root cause of of the virus in that in that particular case so this is a a rethinking if we could do things better partly due to the social divide and partly due to the fact that maybe there's a kind of a degrowth uh within the way that that we were consuming and that the french system hopefully is shifting a little bit from mass consumerism towards maybe a better consumerism last thing i wanted to say we have seen that in in the middle between the two confinement in fact when the french people actually rediscover france uh the same as in as in many countries we have realized that in fact very close from where we live there's a lot of really interesting activities to do and we don't need to go necessarily on the other side of the world so for me the the important key takeaway is the the social divide that it has created and how the retailers are going to change to compensate for that social divide thank you very much sir come to um patrick last but not least thank you sarah and thank you fellow panelists i think what's interesting just listening to all the points of view and it's uh i think it's reinforcing the work we're doing with a number of the kind of household retailers his retail is quite a broad church so i think i think we need to kind of look at it very much from a segmental perspective and understand both in the kind of segments within retail and then globally how that works and how that's impacted i think having said that there are a number of kind of key themes that come through and we're seeing with our clients so as i think a couple of the panelists have said before this this acceleration to digital was there before the pandemic has given that a push actually what we're seeing if you look at the most recent ons data is the kind of online penetration is actually dropping back down slightly probably won't go back to where it was and none of our clients think it will go back to where it was before the pandemic but it probably won't stay at the high that it's hit so if you take the uk market 400 billion pound retail market depending on the numbers you you believe you know there's still a sort of a good nearly 300 billion of that is go through physical retail channels stores for one for better term and for retailers that's their most profitable channel by far now the economics are changing slightly with retailers so with more of us working from home becomes less expensive the fulfillment costs of online of home delivery directly uh becomes slightly less expensive so that's that's changed the shift um i think the other kind of key thing we're seeing is um scale and access to capital and cap masters so to fund this digital transformation costs a lot of money what we're seeing are the bigger businesses look and invest in automation now so we've got the number of automation providers and they have a three and four year backlog order list so you wouldn't be able to get automation bought and fitted into a warehouse or store for probably three or four years if you ordered it today which gives you a sense of kind of where the focus is we have before this and still have an aging labor workforce in the retail sector predominantly in the uk particularly in the supply chain area so that push on efficiency will continue i think the other thing is you know i think all retailers before this were clear their store formats were not right this has just proven that and they are accelerating towards that and the increase in the use of in the uk in particular cvas has indicated there's a real push to rationalize store estate and then the final thing is all of them are looking at value so value has become the key focus driver across the across all of all of our clients i think probably predicting not just the pandemic but the knock-on effect of the pandemic and what that means to consumer confidence thank you very much uh patrick so um dr h is chairing our questions um and i'm delighted to see that there are already um some questions um from from our um great audience today so dr inchi would you like to present the first question yeah sure uh the first question is uh about retail attainment uh do you think that uh if the retail attainment will continue or uh actually postcode um how the elements of this will change um i don't know who would like to answer this question um anyone volunteering i can i'll start i'll start with that one and i can start with that one because i was having a look at the um chat and i could see that somebody mentioned um fidget all right as well so i thought i could probably um i'll i'll i'll start uh and then invite one of my fellow panelist members in and no i don't think it's the end of the retail payment industry um so uh retail attainment is about how many um of the large retailers particularly sort of the way department stores um have have gone um in that they use their store base to create exciting things which entertain the customer and these are things like you know that were now very useful useful so the fact that you can like go into the apple store and you can play with all the technologies um to the fact that you know if you go to somewhere like um bloomingdale's then you know they have a magnolia bakery and things like that in store um so it's it's very much around um sort of giving consumers other reasons to come to a store other than just the the the product base and so so no um i won't um i don't think it's the end of retail payment and also i think as people and i think this is what eat out to help out and i know there are some discussions just the consequences all of that but i think what it showed is you know as people and as a society we need to come together that we need to be with other people that's that's how we are is that we need to be with others and we want to be with others um and and retail is a proxy for that socialization you know if you just think about the types of shopping that you do you go with friends and you start shopping and then you might go and have some drinks let's run in the evening and then you know if you have a shopping mall you might go to it to the cinema as well um so no i i don't think it will end and then um as megan says um just about fidgeting being the way forward yeah so um and it really touches on what um heinen was saying as well um and roman was mentioning around technologies um in that what we're seeing is digitalization and physical coming together um and in the same place and thinking about how the retailer operates in that holistic way so i can see mehmet's popped into the chat talking about you know by buy online and pick up in store um so that's quite a simplistic example of um being digital um but what i can also see um you know is things getting more exciting you know having robots to kind of uh service kind of interaction so there's some great stores um particularly in sort of um in in singapore and where you can go in store it's completely self-service and you can access everything um that you need by using various um digital um operations um so i think uh so yeah i think in summary i i would say um that it it's not gonna die george also wants to uh answer this question would you like to come in george okay i was gonna i was just going to ask just thinking of what um heinen was saying did you want to um expand on that question about retail timing yes i'd love to that's that's quite dear to me to look at how retailers can become more inspirational places to be i think you're absolutely right in saying that it's i mean it's perhaps the most important element of retailing yes we have to get some stuff but there are multiple ways of doing that but we are inherently we are social beings we want to do things just because we want to do those things not necessarily because we have to and maybe adding a slightly different angle to what you have said is i think it will be very interesting to see how pure online will also try to sort of emulate that experience that inspirational shopping experience in a purely online context and again technology can be a conduit of that if you think about immersive virtual reality worlds i mean i can see that as a if you wish a covet safe way to somehow interact with people in a different manner it may sound a little bit remote and a little bit alien to most of us but you know we we learn quickly and we get used to things rather quickly and i was as i said before i was amazed how quickly an older generation adapted to this new world and that is something i would have never thought i would never thought that my old mother would actually try to do their first online shopping she's never done that and he said in this life maybe in my next life i will but not in this life that was her mantra for the past 20 years so in that sense i think there will be new experiences there will be these interactive social interactions which could also happen without the physical social interactions and that the newer generation being much more used to those kind of interaction i think that will will actually grow but certainly i don't there's no way i see the end of the physical retail i don't think we're gonna experience that because the entertainment and the inspiration aspect will be so dominant thank you very much um just uh dr ritchie just before we take the next question um um uh our esrc colleagues have popped uh an instruction in in our chat uh we're allowed to have our cameras back on yes so unless you're allowed to have your cameras back back on we're just doing this for toes um do we have time adol wants to pop into uh for this question but yes a few more yeah so our dog would you like to elaborate on this please yes it would be great for me first of all as patrick mentioned value is the most important part of it and also as heiner said the speed of change has been increased very much and rate and speed of change in my opinion the time range is very important are we talking about for five years for 10 years for 20 years because when you think about the time and when you think about us our generation when we born there was not internet there was not mobile communication there was not the zoom there was not anything we only had one tv channel we were watching the call boys we were watching american culture everything as ronan said the the big brother was watching us and they are still watching us but on the other hand we are going to die we are going to die in 20 years 30 years or 40 years and the people us knowing the world without internet will die and also for the long run individual will change organizations will change systems will change means that the things the paradigm shift will make all the things will change transformed and value after transformation will there be a value or not so according to our paradigm according to our philosophy and perspective retailing is very important shopping is a part of socialization etc etc etc i believe i agree with them but on the other hand there's a new world there's a big revolution done it is going on and after 10 years we are not going to live in a world that we cannot believe it right now because we were not we wouldn't believe that if 10 years ago they told us that nine academicians will meet on the computer and talk about the issues online and all the world would have chance to watch them it was uh not possible so i have a theory it's called sinisim sen means you in english uh my surname is sen but it's also a dot under s so it means happy i think that the individual and will be defined and will change all the things and the individual must be defined according to me i and the you and me sending me so it's another uh part of you but i would like to share especially that points thank you very much thank you very much so uh doctor if we go to our next question uh we have a question regarding uh the rural locations uh i would like to uh make some comments about it before i uh ask the panel but uh when ronald heiner uh expressed their views um my experience is also uh closer to ronan's and although the big supermarkets are winning because uh they are providing us with food on the other hand we are working on a project at the moment uh in rural england uh basically this project uh is looking into farming and beautiful landscapes that's what it's called uh and we are seeing at the moment non-retailers becoming retailers and ditching the uh value chain and shortcutting the value chain uh to because the value chain has collapsed in a way during the first lockdown so they need to reach to us the consumers in one way or the other and that's how they are doing this they are non-retail wholesalers i have seen and also these rural farms uh are trying to reach to the consumers using different uh manners so in another question which forms or retailers will remain we will perhaps see different types of retailers forming a alongside not in place so but alongside the current retailers so that's my answer and i would like to ask anyone else who wants to go for this heiner ronan because you uh you're talking about this previously okay is your finger okay i i can i can go on that i think answering the the first question also the about the uh the the inspiration that the small shop are providing i think it's very important for retailers to keep in contact with their customer you can have a lot of big data you can have a lot of web analytics but that will never replace the information that you get in in the contact of of your customer that's why i think to the physical shop we still have a very important role to play uh in in inspiring people uh definitely agree with uh with inj uh there will be probably a fragmentation uh that that's going to happen of the of the retail environment uh we have seen over the last 20 or 30 years of global fragmentation so the gap uh coming to france mcdonald coming to france they should have forgotten that one but we are going also to have a reshaping of probably from the bottom of people that have decided that there must be a better ways of getting things or people that want a greater traceability i want to know where the apollo eat come from i want to know more about about seasonality and that will create opportunities for new entrants within within the market that are going to to disrupt the ddd incumbent and even shops like the hard discounter that disrupted the uh the traditional retailers we're going to say in groceries you know we are going to have to have new entrants that are going to enter the the market we have forgotten a lot the the rural environment we say that the rural people don't have access to technology the rural people are backward um i mean i mean in britain you know when we talk of people from paris you know they look at us and this is great for holiday but for for nothing else this is this is going to certain there's a lot of talents there's a lot of skills and there is easy access to technology now to to build the website so for for the small shops in france we have seen a lot of websites that are grouping in in association or in clubs to actually sell together so it's a new way of uh of selling also i'm selling only a wool or i'm selling only clothes i'm sitting on issues but we group together when we are online offering a completely different experience from what you get from those generalist retailers that are selling a little bit of everything but without having the passion for any of the uh particular items that they are selling thank you very much think patrick's just going to come into that one and then we'll go to our next question yeah i was just reflecting on the question around um farmers becoming kind of moving out the value chain into retailers i mean our experience of this is they're very different businesses and i think um one of the benefits of of diversifying the two and keeping them separate is you keep the risk in the right place if you think about fresh produce it's incredibly complex and risky business backing yourselves to produce something that requires particularly has such a had such a kind of dependency on the weather and i think what we're seeing actually is is more retailers go the other way which is to say this is a real specialism and risk we want to transfer this and keep this with the areas of production i.e the farmers we need to make sure that we've got it covered because we've got things like global warming happening which are changing the kind of dynamic around the weather and the quality of growing in the land but actually this isn't our core business but at scale you know we need to source from multiple places just to physically deal with the demand and the scale needed to do it so i think i think there will be you know will there be more farmers looking to go direct to consumer yes you've got businesses already doing that so oddbox in the uk do that um farm drop or another firm that do something similar they take produce direct from the pharmaceutical consumer they've all chat their challenges have been scaling because it's this is you know particularly in food it's a scale industry continuing on that uh fiona or patrick would you like to comment on the uh what kind of retail formats will be staying or forming in the future and the winners and the losers yeah what's gonna happen i think it's probably not new news that the department stores um need to be thinking about what they're doing they're space-hungry um and yeah we've seen that reflected in um their results and things as they go um i think i would probably agree with what patrick was saying earlier that things need to be even more segmented and retailers need to understand what works in each of the segments um and be they need to be tighter over what they're doing with the space that they have as well so i think it will be more smaller ones in large but i think it'll be ones that are more educated on what their consumers are looking for and where yeah i'd agree on that one i think for me it's not it's always been about knowing your customer and tracking with your customer and if and and understanding what goes on what's front of their mind and where they want to play i mean typically when you see kind of areas of financial challenge which which we're anticipating happening after this crisis you see a greater polarization and segmentation actually typically um both at the top and the bottom ironically um so i'd imagine we would be seeing that i think like i said before a lot of it a lot of these businesses that have struggled at the moment it's a cash issue so it's access to cash access to capital so it's the funding behind them and it's how cash generative they are as a business and how much debt they've got to pay down or not as the case may be so um you know and again to the points that the panelists have all made previously this was happening before it would just be accelerated there's a question regarding the fraud prevention what impact has covet 19 on e-fraud prevention anyone who would like to chip in there's there's no not a huge rush to answer that one a tricky a tr a tricky area and perhaps for consideration another day i mean i can give a couple of minutes on it that's interesting if people are interested i i think most of this is around so we're seeing a greater adoption of things like um robotic process automation and technology that look to weed these things out and look for patterns in fraud prevention so that's something that we've seen a lot of retailers moving to the deployment of artificial intelligence and those type of technologies um i think you know we would expect to continue to see that as a significant cost on the profit and loss accounts for most um retailers is shrinkage and fraud and those type of things um i guess retail generally is slightly less regulated than a lot of other industries so it's a bigger issue for the financial service industry insurance industry and those type of areas but you know it's something i think will i don't know necessarily whether it will accelerate um but it's something that i think any anything where you are losing cost and need to manage cash is something that's an area of focus thank you thank you very much um another question is about printed promotional materials so what coit had uh in practices you cannot use your printed uh promotional material uh and is this going to be a a habit uh electronic or more uh virtual ways or promotions or are we going to go back to printed materials do you think fiona would you be able to take that one um i think it'll be a bit of both i think there's no doubt that digital will have pay um a huge part in communication within retail going forward i think at the same time we're seeing that costs of customer acquisition are going up hugely um as advertisers are wisening to it and brands that previously really benefited off that are struggling slightly more now to reach the same benefit and i think the other thing that's interesting is all trends come around as well and at the moment print is still part of marketing communication albeit decreasing and smaller and i think it will get to a point where that is actually a way for brands or retailers to stand out as well and particularly if they can do it in a targeted way in a creative way um so i think digital will play a huge part but i wouldn't rule out print as long as it's done in a creative way i think we answered this small shop so i'm uh skipping that question if they're benefiting we answered that question uh and i'm following the other one um yeah mental health basically technology is becoming a huge part of our lives at the moment and what can we do to ensure our fixation on technology doesn't limit our social interaction uh what are the impacts of mental health uh overusing technology uh what are the impacts on our mental health uh adult please first of all when we think about the mental health uh we have to think about the digital technologies that are in our lives right now and can be in the future how they will transform in the future for example augmented reality or for example all the uh virtual things that we cannot you know uh predict what's gonna be about the technological parts so for the uh for the needs and wants and the satisfaction of the all consumers and individuals all around the world about the stakeholder management parts because we must think about the stakeholder management and we must think about the individuals and their mental health issues according to that because the world has to be much more greener the world must be much more equal much more smarter with the technologies and with all the digital revolution this is not a dream but on the other hand it will transform the individual as i said before so when we think about the individual the the all the companies all the brands are dealing with the rational part of the human until these years but we are defining that there is an emotional part and we must deal with the emotions and the emotional emotional things are emotional variables are very critical for us for our brand management for the perception management for the for all the communication and the customer relationship management strategies crm strategies and all the things related with big data so i'm afraid that the most one of the most important things that are going to be a problem for the humanity is the mental health related with all of these issues because we are thinking about the production part we are thinking about the consumption part we are thinking about the marketing we are thinking about managing the people managing the organizations managing the systems so all the things directly related with all the applications of industry 4-0 are big chances for humanity but also risks for the mental health of all of us thank you thank you before you there is another question for you uh the question is how do you relate your sinism theory uh to the topic senism is the one that defines the individual we are always talking about ourselves and we like for example seeing us individually in the social media for example but sinism defines the me with the sen in me and it means that we are going to define ourselves or the system are going to define the cells according to individual perspective so the perception of me and perception of all the world around me must be defined again for example if you think about sigmund freud if you think about karl marx if you think about adam smith or nietzsche if they were living in these days how would they change their theories how would they think about for example ego super ego it's directly related with cynicism or laken or how how how what's the value created added value patrick for example what's the added value that marx wrote and what's the added value that are that's gonna be for the robotics that's gonna be for the uh smart factories for example where where can we think about the capital who is the capitalist who is the labor who is the individual as a customer and consumer also so cyanism defines all of them i'm just sorry i'm just going to stop you there um just because i want to capture just some thoughts on technology and mental health because i think that that's quite quite an important one um so i'm just going to ask um heiner and and ronan so heine first and then roman if you can just quickly um answer add your thoughts on technology and mental health yes i'm you know unreasonably uh optimistic i would say the technology as such it's neither good nor bad as we have seen you know we have we have you know automation or help with care for instance we have at least in this country and i think in most developed countries we have too few carers so helping those in those situations and being helped by technology i think can be quite useful and can be actually a good thing that would reduce mental health issues on the other hand of course we have to learn and i'm with adl in that one we have to learn to live with these new you know these new realities there are new things around us which we have to learn how to deal with we don't have to get you know all dependent on it we still you know we're human beings you know what defines us as human beings we have to still be mindful of that and you know the technology i think i'm reasonably optimistic that over time we will learn how to make the best of those technology i'm not really a pessimist in that sense it will perhaps give a little bit you know a couple of hiccups on the way i'm sure until we have learned it but in the long term i think it will be more beneficial than harmful thank you and ask ronan if i could just have your thoughts quickly and then i'll ask well then we'll need to finish because we've only got a couple of minutes left okay so i agree with with aina that we have to learn with technology but i think the reverse is also true technology are to live with us in a sense and uh they are our technologies at our service so uh for example if we have a qr code in in supermarket or if we have intelligent aisle in supermarket uh people that have allergies can figure out just by flashing their mobile phone which product is applicable or not we can envision ourselves with closing and all those kind of things so i think we have to see that the technology is more at our service because we are the one programming the technology and we are the ones saying we want that type of technology and not that other type of of technology and this is a little bit the big debate we have on the on the gaffer at the moment uh are they too powerful uh who decide uh uh you know net neutrality uh is on the uh on the horizon uh we have seen all the the tweet uh by uh donald and uh you know twitter saying we are not very sure of what he says is ever true uh uh you know uh please don't listen so we are just at the beginning of that debate we have the debate on the 5g in france uh also now you know is it beneficial is it something that we want we know that cryptocurrency about 35 million users are using the entire electricity of denmark in any given year so you know choices are going to happen but it's a bit what uh erdell was saying we are now the uh digital migrant but the digital native are going to make all those decisions the same as we have been making decision on copyright and and upstairs and patents over the last previous year and accident is going to accelerate uh dramatically but we should remain we should remain very positive that we have been so far able to create technologies that are helpful of course they destroy job at in some part but they also create opportunity in others and this is what we have to do uh we have to insist on technology redistributing ones i'm just going to stop you there because we're just about to finish and we'll just be out of out of time um just as a very final summary um so you've basically got about six words each i know everyone's academics and we're industry experts and we like talking and we're basically six words um so what in you know let's say 2030 you know 2030 what will our post pandemic world be like i'm going to reverse the order so go to patrick first consolidated automated and value driven oh excellent you can come back again i'm gonna go to fiona next you're muted all right targeted personalized and digital come to roman next uh wealth redistribution and going over the digital divide higher i think it will be a merge of the two worlds online and offline inchi i think we will be seeing interesting social engagements and last but not least erdog digitalized individual oriented and senior citing lately thank you very much um i'd like to say to all of the attendees thank you very much for joining us and asking us such great questions i'd also like to say i'm really sorry if we weren't able to get to your question um but all the questions were really amazing and i wish that we had more time um i'd also like to thank all my panel members today um for being able to join us and sparing their time i think we've all decided that uh retail is really still really important to us all um but technologies are going to become increasingly important but we need to be cautious with how we proceed with that and my final action is i have to make sure that i um share the screen um that show that um people can give um feedback um so that's just our little feedback slide so you can apparently use use the qr code talking of new technologies or you can uh use that link to give us um our feedback um so i will just leave that there for a moment but as i say i'm very thankful that we had lots of attendees um we really enjoyed sharing um our thoughts um with you um and i think you can probably find just relatively easy because a lot easily because all our details um are on the invitation but if anybody would like to uh or contact me as the chair of the event then i'm happy to talk to anybody afterwards or answer any questions that perhaps um were outstanding so hopefully everybody um has that slide and has seen the feedback and um
