 in today's video I got o to Tara and I grabbed couple of them and in this video I'm just gonna open it up talk to you guys about it and let you guys know what this mask is actually about and is it really worth spending your heart and money on it or not welcome back with another video on thank you for stopping by on my channel now in this video I am NOT an expert so if you're looking for an expert advice I am sorry I'm not going to be able to provide it to you guys as whatever opinion that I have is based on my experience and a little knowledge that I have about mask protection and what I have read online so putting that aside without further ado going inside the packaging I ordered these I first of all got their message and their ads online quite a bit actually I could say for about a week after I the whole pandemic started I started looking for masks and ways that I can obtain masks without purchasing any medical ones because I know that that they are short-handed on these especially the hospital so I didn't want to go jump inside that buy the surgical mask online so I was looking for something that its first of all reusable it's gonna last me a long time and actually a lifetime and for better sake and it's not gonna cost quite to refill its filter because the filter has to be changed and I wasn't quite fond of the one that are washable because I'm not expert like I said but to my to my eyes that just doesn't seem healthy and it might be a little problematic at times so I say couple of searches that I done inside of the internet the cookies took over on my internet and my IP address and from then on I received tons of advertisement from different companies making their own mask and trying to sell it to people for crazy amount of money but when I went one of those ads was from Oh to Canada now this company is mainly there their mask is towards athletes and those who are athlete in the professional and they want to control their breath not sure about that and they're mainly other reason that their use is to control pollution so they're not medical graded based on what I have read online so that's first thing first but they're much more protective based on what I read then covering your face with one of those homemade masks and they're not being used by the medical staff so there's no problem on buying it the only thing is that they cost a lot of money they cost around $70 and to me that was crazy couple of week passed and I was like I'm not gonna spend money on it and then I had no choice to get myself a pack of these surgical masks and as you can see this is not Neil because I don't use them unto him away first of all I don't want to create extra pollution and extra garbage second of all I think since I'm not using this all the time and I'm using a couple of times a couple of hours a day I can continue reusing these for at least couple of days that I use one for every week or every two weeks until they're pretty worn doubt the color is faded and that that's when I know that I have to throw it away now the way that I use it after I place it on top of my face I open it up just like you guys know I clamp this together and when I want to put it aside I open them up like this without touching the front and I have a container that I put this upside down and wrap it around it the way that I do it imagine this is the container by continuum in one of those ziplock container plastic container I put this right on top of it bring it to the bottom just like that and if I know that I have been to a hospital or I have been to a drugstore that I know that there is a lot of possibility of pathogens beyond there I would just dazzle it a little I sprayed a little bit of alcohol to just get everything on it off of it then at least do something yeah that's that's the best thing that I could come up with but this idea it's not my idea I learned it from washing and Instagram video of how to keep your mask clean without touching it so this is what I do but then I came across this company I was like this is great 70 bucks after I saw how the price for this kind of jumped and I hated when companies when they see people are hurting and they're suffering they take advantage of this and they're just they just bring their price up that's just that's just so horrible that's horrible don't do it this is not a good money to provide for your family you should not this is I don't even want to talk about it that's a horrible deal and that's what I cut off go to Canada when I saw the prices like these guys are crazy asking for this amount of money but then I looked at previous reviews and their pricing and I come to find out that their pricing has been the same as since they started a long time ago and they didn't gouge their prices because of the pandemic but the only thing was that when you go inside their website right on the top they have a little bar that says that when you order it's gonna take a while for you to get it as a matter of fact it took me about a month and a half to get my mass and once and then they're not gonna give you a specific time because there's a lot of orders coming in and another thing that they have they don't have any return policy because of the current pandemic you don't have time to deal with turns and deal with customers who are not who have problems they say it is what it is basically when you buy it you don't know when you're gonna get it though we'll do our best to get it for you that doesn't mean they don't have a good customer support they have a phone line they have an email and they're usually responsive your email but their phone number every time you call them it's just gonna go straight to the voicemail but when you purchase your mask you have options to change the color of the front of this part yeah you could changes they have three colors black blue and red it comes in with white and it comes with this filter pad this one when you buy one it already comes with I believe four or five pads the pads are not expensive they're $10 for 10 pads and each pad glass you're about a month now it all depends on how often you use it for me because I use a couple of hours a week just go grocery shopping or something it lasts me about 2 3 4 weeks about it's almost sometimes a month and they have replacement pads that is cost $10 and you could get 10 filters with it and these 10 filter can last you depending on again what you do for that amount of time now first of all the packaging is quite astonishing and I'm gonna go inside the packaging with you guys which is I already have one open but I want to show you guys that I try to put it back together the way that it originally was once I got it but I couldn't figure out how to put it back together so I decided to bring the other one and open it now I get them by 2 to just stack up for myself one is for me one is for my wife and I myself I work I actually I'm in the school for mental health counseling so I work inside of a hospital because I have to do practicum and I have to see patients so it's important for me to protect myself and my patients also my wife works in a research laboratory she stays organic chemistry so she uses masca so that's the reason that it was really important for us to have the best thing that we could get without hurting frontline employees such as nurses and doctors so we got this one first of all the packaging is beautiful but I had no problem with the packaging we have the actual front of the packaging which is the side of the mask and then the back of it we have a couple of information about it and what it does basically it's a fine particulate PM 2.5 filter by application helps with household dust pet hair and dinner a house with dust and water cold and flu and other viruses and bacterias hey does the mold fungal and pollution exhausts dust and wildfires so it does it does quite a bit of protection I just am not sure how much is it comparing to an n95 again I'm not an expert but I know it does much more protection than this one I'm gonna go over that with you guys soon so this is a version 1.2 so this has been updated from their original versions and once you open it you are greeted with the mask itself now it's it's a good looking mask and I'm gonna go over that with you guys so we have the mask itself put it that aside and we have the little catalog of teaching you how to use it proper ways to handle it it's all with pictures and this should be relatively easy to follow process so we have our mask I'll let me learn this table for you guys to be as distracted to be distracted so without any distraction sorry I can't speak for some reason today now inside of the package we have the mask itself and I'm gonna lift this open and try to get it out for you guys and there you go this is the mask itself very nice quite compact I'll do a little bulgy but quite compact we have a carrying case for it so this is really handy and like I mentioned it comes with a couple of filters and one cleaning light which I'm gonna go to that for you guys as well now the cleaning wipes you don't have to buy it you could just do it yourself and I'm gonna explain it to you guys but and I'm not gonna open it but this is basically just I want to say a little bit of a cloth with some alcohol in it just to wipe the top surface of it so it doesn't get so but viruses and bacterias you could just chill it and then put it inside on your back but for me I don't know if I'm gonna buy these I'm just gonna do them myself have a ziploc bag put a little bit of paper towel in there and then spray it with alcohol have it in there moist and so every time that I come out I could just wipe it down now the mask is really nice again like I said it's a little bulgy it comes like this and it has a little clip right here that you could clip it together and this part is basically goes around your neck and then you can clip it very nice and then have it right here and whenever you're in a situation simply bring it up and put it to your face now one complaint that my wife had because this is from different angle and I'm gonna try to speak while I have this on and they complained that my wife had was that she works in a laboratory and she mentioned that it's quite difficult to talk about you have this one off and she got a point it's really difficult to speak while you have this on and this is inside of it and this is inside of the actual cover like I mentioned it we get this so it's quite difficult especially when you place the filter on top of it now the way that you place the filter on top of it you have this filter right here very nice and you're gonna get your cover get the filter place it in here they have alignment place inside of this so just like that Tugg and nice you just place it in there and this one goes on top let me take you yeah I couldn't do it without looking at it and it has clipper clips so it just locks in place and you put it on and that's it now I have it on I haven't changed anything to my microphone setting first of all it's a little takes time to get used to the mask itself second of all once you talk to it it's really difficult to breathe I'm trying to guess my air as I speak I don't have no problem but when I stop speaking and I have to take a little deep breath to catch my breath I have problems and again it's a little difficult to breathe inside of it because this is very covered and another problem is speaking to people my wife complained that if I put that on because I opened mine up and she tried it and she said that if I put it on how am I gonna come communicate with people in the laboratory with me so that's a little problem this is my voice without it I'm not changing my tone but then I put this on it just kind of muffles my sound and I mean that's understandable that's nothing out of the blue I'm not complaining about it but it's just a little problematic now the air comes out from here when you exhale and when you inhale the air comes in from inside of here so it's a it's quite a nice revolutionary device I really like it but again it has these problems so if you're in a place that you know you're gonna be talking constantly with people and you want people to hear you especially in a busy area if you're working in a small place that is covered and the sound doesn't get out as much and there is not a lot of extra noises I understand that this might be a great option for you but if you know you work in a busy place such as a restaurant or if you work in hospitality and you want clients or customers to clearly hear you and be able to communicate with you that's a little problematic another thing that my wife didn't like actually was how awkward it looks on the face now I know it's not time to complain about the way that it looks but she said that I look like a sci-fi addition especially if you have your glasses on and from the side I think the pants are a little cheap and little problematic but to be honest I really liked it because every time that I had the surgical mask on and I had him on my face it was easy to communicate I had no problem talking to people but the air wasn't coming in from here unless I have it completely against my face and then brittle which is dangerous but if I don't have it like that from the side here the air goes inside and I wear glasses so whenever I have my glasses on and I start talking to this this is what happens this is the problem with surgical masks but with this one when I have it if you wondering how it may work with people who are wearing glasses and they need their nose it's not problematic at all and as you exhale if you tighten this there is no way that the Air Canada coming to my glasses so no problem there so it takes a little time getting used to it I like the actual fact that I can have it right here easy whenever I'm not dealing with a patient and whenever I am about to see a patient or go outside on foot just put this on go in there and talk to them it's a good product this is version 1.2 I think there is a version 2.0 out I purchased this one when the 1.0 was in I believe but I'm gonna put the information down here highly recommended it's a great product again if you are working in front-line or if you are working dealing with patients or if you are a police officer if you are a fire fighter or if you have important job that requires dealing with people constantly there is and a special box for you to check mark and write down the place that you work so they can get it to you faster which i think is absolutely wonderful they haven't the hat the fact that they haven't gouged their prices I give them ten out of ten and I think it's a it's a valuable item to have I hope you guys like that this was a review of their ode to Canada highly recommend them it's a little expensive bite but guess what these cost forty fifty dollars four pack of twenty thirty of them you'd buy this seventy dollars with the mask that comes with it it will definitely last you longer than and hacker knees which come in a set of 50 or set of hundred depending on where you buy it but let me know what you guys think as always I am NOT an expert I am giving you my opinion based on the fact that I use it and based on what I read online and I hope you guys liked it and if you have any question any common concerns little down below and if you are working in the first line defense I highly thought you and I thank you for your service and I wish you guys safety health prosperous and Happiness to come as always thank you for watching and I'll see you guys on the next [Music] [Applause] [Music]
