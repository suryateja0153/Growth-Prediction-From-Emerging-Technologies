 IS A -- IT IS A HUGE LIFE ADJUSTMENT CHANGE. EMILY: A HUGE CHANGE AFTER A HEAD INJURY YEARS AGO. BEATRICE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH SEVERE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AND REQUIRES 24/7 CARE.  WE ARE SO USED TO HAVING FAMILY AND FRIENDS VISIT. I WOULD TAKE HER OUT TO WALK AROUND THE STORE OR EVEN DRIVE TO HER APPOINTMENTS. THOSE ARE ALL BEING CANCELED. EMILY: ONE CONSTANT, HER TEAM AT SENIOR LINK. THE COMPANY PROVIDES CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES THROUGH A PROGRAM.  A LIFELINE FOR A LOT OF FAMILIES. EMILY: SHE IS THE CLINICAL TEAM LEAD WITH SENIOR LINK. SHE SAYS IN BETWEEN HOME VISITS, THEY HAVE BEEN USING AN APP FOR SEVERAL YEARS TO CONNECT WITH CAREGIVERS AND THEIR LOVED ONES MORE OFTEN. BUT IT HAS BECOME EVEN MORE VALUABLE NOW.  THEY LOST THE STRICTURE ROUTINE, BUT IF I SEE SOMETHING IN A NOTE, I RESPOND TO WHAT I’M READING. EMILY: THE COMPANY STARTED INVESTING IN THIS TECHNOLOGY ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO TO QUICKLY MESSAGE THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND PROVIDE RESOURCES LIKE THIS COVID-19 COURSE. COMPANY CEO TOM RILEY SAYS SUPPORT IS WHAT THEY DO AND IS VITAL FOR ANYONE CARING FOR A LOVED ONE AT HOME RIGHT NOW.  REACH OUT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE ISOLATED. PROVIDE THEM SUPPORT. GET ON ZOOM. TALK TO THEM. HELP THEM WITH THEIR STRESS BECAUSE THEY ARE DOING REALLY IMPORTANT WORK OUT IN THE COMMUNITY. EMILY: WORKED AT CHANDLER JONES SAYS SHE FEELS BLESSED TO DO AND GRATEFUL FOR THE SUPPORT AROUND HER NOW MORE THAN EVER.  FAMILY MEANS EVERYTHING TO I WOULD NOT HAVE IT ANY OTHER WAY. SOME FINAL ADVICE FOR CAREGIVERS, KARIN SAYS DO THE BEST YOU CAN, ONE DAY AT A TIME. TRY TO MAINTAIN A SENSE OF ROUTINE. AGAIN REACH OUT TO OTH
