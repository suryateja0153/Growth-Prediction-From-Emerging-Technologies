 Have you ever felt the inconvenient nightmare of overcrowded commuter line during rush hours? If you are one of the millions who commute daily in Jakarta’s commuter line you probably have experienced it SmartStep is an array of smart tiles  that are able to harvest micro-energy and help daily commuters in Jakarta like you to experience more convenient commuting during rush hours SmartStep tiles are able to count the number of people in each passenger car and send information to the commuter operator when a  passenger car has exceeded its capacity limit This could help reduce the overloaded crowds by adding more commuter line units into the necessary track SmartStep consists of a few components such as The switch and coil spring A powerbank to store the generated micro energy Microcontroller and Real Time Clock SmartStep tiles will be installed in front of the passenger car door As the passengers stepped on the tiles Microcontroller and the switch will count and determine whether passengers leave or enter the passenger car based on patterns of steps sequences For example If tile number five and one are stepped on in sequence then the system assumes that the passenger is likely to enter the passenger car and the counter will increase If the sequence is reversed then the system assumes that the passenger is leaving the passenger car and the counter will decrease The data collected will be sent to our real time database which is connected to an app that we use to visualize the collected information In this App  we can determine the number of maximum capacity limits in each passenger car When the number has exceeded a certain limit the user will be informed through colored highlights This feature enables the total number of passengers  to be visualized using color code SmartStep tiles could also be useful during the current  coronavirus pandemic By helping to effectively implement social distancing  measures in the commuter line By assuring the numbers of passengers in each passenger car is still in a safe limit SmartStep can help commuter planners in providing more effective and convenient commuting for everyone In the long run by increasing the number of people choosing public transportation over personal vehicle we hope this could also reduce the amount of pollution  generated by personal vehicles and improve the city’s air quality in general
