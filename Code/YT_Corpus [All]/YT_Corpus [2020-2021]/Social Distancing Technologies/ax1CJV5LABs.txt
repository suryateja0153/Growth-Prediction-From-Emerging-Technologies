 so we are standing in what was so this is actually this is a tour of the past of the past because the Geffrye Museum is under construction at the moment it's now called Museum of the Home it's been under construction for two years so what we're seeing now is the history of the Geffrye museum as well as the history of the the theme of the museum so so we've got double history going on here today which i think is actually quite kind of cool it's just come to me um so this this is no longer this is no longer so anyway so we stood in the entrance I don't know whether you have ever have you guys ever been to the Geffrye or obviously me and Jess worked there but have you ever been before? no I had the opportunity to go a couple of years ago but I wasn't able to make it so this is this is quite a nice opportunity to finally see it. I was literally was looking at this museum I thought it bookmarked for when lockdown closes for a visit because I didn't know about it so I'm really excited yeah. So it's a tiny it just give you a quick before we walk through it old almshouses they were built by Sir Robert Geffrye in seventeen now if I get my dates wrong today its because I haven't done this for a couple of years so forgive me Sir Robert Geffrye he was Once Upon a Time Lord Mayor of London in fact he was twice Lord Mayor of London and when he died he left a legacy it was like the thing at the time for gentlemen of that stature to leave legacies of charity so he had almshouses built on his name so he had the elderly poor living in these almshouses and they're really beautiful and there's a recreation of them at the Geffrye or I think it's still going but I did all the tours like the tours for them a couple years ago went to over the tour guides so so the museum closed down as an almshouses in the nineteen hundreds of beginning of the 1900s because it got too dangerous in the area of Shoreditch so the but the reason that them use the building was safe because there are other arms houses along the Kingsland Road where this is you can kind of I think you might go to see at the bottom of the bottom left of your screen you've got Hoxton can you see Hoxton station if you look at the map and so there's that yellow road going through that that is the road like if you go south going straight into London and out and this area when Sir Robert Geffrye built these almshouses was actually countryside all countryside there's only really a mile away from the centre the centre of the city so so but in the 1900s the ladies that then were the elderly poor they were all like ladies governesses they were moved out because the area around Hoxton shortage was just so incredibly like criminal activity really dodgy and the ladies were taking their lives and hands literally walking out the gates so then it was like well what's going to happen because there were almshouses along the Kingsland road there were three in total two of them got knocked down the what to either side of the Geffrye but the Geffrye got kept because was kept because the gardens it was like the greenest space in the whole of the area at the time as beautiful gardens outside the so so anyway so they say they've got saved it was saved William de Morgan um the guy amazing luster where tile designer he was one of the people that helped save it it was like the Arts and Crafts movement and then it was made into a museum so in 1904 if I'm if I'm right it was like 200 years later, thanks Jess so inside is the story of the home. Oh no it might be 19 I want to say because it would have been a hundred years when we have the centenary celebration so it would have been 1914. 14 that's it it was that's it if thanks Jess yeah in 1914 that's right so in fact it was 1714 they were built there we go so 1714 1914 like I said forgive me on the dates so um now the museum as we go through or then two years ago let me was about a chronological order of the history of home from 1600s through to when I say modern day it was like 1990s as the final room it's set in the pitch of the middle classes so they it was decided to do to do that because you can work historically either up you know upper classes aristocracy you know working-class from the middle class and standpoint and and the majority of you've got to think of people like doctors merchants lawyers that kind of level level of living so um and you know very beautiful pieces of furniture recreated recreating the living rooms so anyway we're stood in the entrance or what was the entrance so okay shall we should we go? are we interested okay so let's do it it's exciting actually so this is a chair gallery the original the original museum was about furniture because the local area was based around furniture making so anyway the first so you went through this tiny tiny corridor it was very hard when you had to bring the arts and crafts trolley to the learning rooms and it somebody had to push chair you had to go all the way back This is why the museum has been done now they've got new ways of look they've gone down to the basements they've gone upstairs but but like Jess said you know you have to get everything down those corridors you have school groups sitting in front of you know in this space here in front so you constantly squeezing passed you constantly go sorry you know but just intimacy you know the intimacy of it was always great fun so this is the first room and how do I turn this baby round oh there we go look at that look at that so this is the first room or was the first room recreation in the in the museum it's um what can you see come on throws come on what's that on the mantelpiece those metal things? what are they? so they're there pewter plates so for eating but also one of the things that they used to do was use it to help light to bring light into a room so the pewter was nice and shiny that they really particularly fine examples we had some in our handling cupboard that were a bit duller but when the pewter was really shiny it helped bring the reflection reflection in the room. Well that makes sense with where their position would they have been positioned there as well so the light yes hitting and reflecting yeah from the fireplace cool which is yes nice. Axel anything take your interest? I can't guarantee I can answer everything strangely one of the things that struck me is the grating on the windows bit of an odd thing to pick up on today yeah. yeah no no no if we would if I was doing tour guide training with you we would focus on that and you would do loads of research about it and then we're talk about it because everything like whatever is interesting to people it's bound to be interesting to other to somebody else it just that's the way I works it's about subjective like working and it's then you up see you kind of  do the hard facts like work on the hard facts as well as well as intermingling your interest but they um yeah they I I can't think the name Jess like a casement windows are they but they're basically the windows a tiny panes of glass I think the separate to even have windows at this this time would have been uber expensive ridiculously expensive and this room is actually before the fire of London so if you can see all the wood in the room and the small windows if you've either been to Shakespeare I'm sorry stratford-upon-avon or seen Shakespeare cottage this is this is Shakespeare time this is like you know where when this is the way I think about it like Shakespeare time and um and you know I can just kind of imagine him sat at the desk scribbling away so yes so this is a room which is called a living hall living hall and at this time the master of the house would be in the big chair but that would be saved before the big chair all the guests the special guests that came around and then you'd have the stores around the table very nice piece of like heavy I'm thinking oak it's got to be oak furniture and you'd find that this this is where you know the servants would sleep in this this this place as well you know everything would go on in this room there's not really much privacy not at for the family the family in the servants like all working and living together under one roof and I think if this is done in a way that downstairs is the shop if I remember though there would be a shop downstairs like a merchant's house and then upstairs you would have this big living hall and as you can see you've got a huge great chimney huge great fireplace. Sorry but they have eaten in this room is that a dining table as well? yeah yeah just imagine absolutely everything going on and... It's quite similar to kind of a contemporary open-plan because that's a very similar arrangement to the one that we've got actually with the kitchen knocked through we're sort of all living and you know working with are different laptops and computers. Well on washing day as well the washing would be hung up in this room if it was wintertime typical British British kind of all together all together scenario so so yes if that's any anything else on that a rush matting on the floor which is amazing obviously know what I used to love saying there's no hoovers at this time and you can't really see it here but they used to have this um this spray is called a pot called a sprinkler and it's made made of like clay quite large and with a little kind of holes in the top and the maids would add rosemary to it and water and the rosemary would they would sprinkle the rush matting and that would help with any sort of fleas or any sort of vermin it would kind of put them off it was like the early day disinfectant so so that that's um so no hoover's anything else? is that a pot on the table it's a ornament? that's a bellarmine jug it's it's a beer jug I think it's a joke on Roberto Bellarmino the priest we used again have one in the collection I can't remember exact facts of the bellarmine jug and that's very very um trendy trendy for this this time it's a sign of the times cool okay so let's go back so let's carry on along the corridor oh hang on it's been passing the wrong things and they'll be like what's going on so here we go squeezing past everybody without trolley hmm so this this room here I'm not going to talk about but it's it's after the fire London I'm just quickly after the fire London very very different type of architectures its William and Mary since I I work at the historic royal palaces as well so now quite a lot about William and Mary um as in king and queen who jointly ruled together um I'm not I'm not gonna talk about this I'm gonna go into the next one because this the next one is is really cool they're all really cool or they were all really cool it's really weird talking in the past I'm such a present and future person. So are we okay can we all see this yes so previously similar type of architecture so Stewart Stewart architecture and well you have this you can see now there's even actually bigger windows compared to your lovely ones that you liked earlier on and and like again it this is like a town house so you would have your merchants shop downstairs or whatever job to practice or whatever it was and then this would you be living upstairs and mainly because it would be quite stinky in the streets so you lived up in the the first floor to kind of get away from the smell and sorry to be graphic but that's kind of quite interesting I think I find and so so you've got this beautiful windows the room before room two was green with green you had the green fabrics but here we've got like a new dye the red dye which is um become very fashionable what I really love about this room is that it's it's there's loads of trade and things about trade in this room. Oh what's that thing in the corner? is it corner cupboard higher up. Now this this is always a fascination for people it's called a japanned cabinet so so this whole room is about trade from all all over the world and a japanned cabinet it's not from Japan the lack of work originally is actually a technique that was created by I believe English craftsman could be wrong so it's a long time to create the same lacquered effect and inside is the tea set that you see on the table so the tea set on the table and oh gosh here we go the Cà Mau tea set do you know anything about that guys we heard that before no terminology hmm so this is there's a really famous story of this merchant ship that sunk off the coast of Vietnam and played near a place called Cà Mau and it's sunk with all of its wares and 250 years ago ish and it was found by modern-day divers and at the bottom for the haulage to help keep the ship stable they used to pack in all of the the crockery and then the tea was above it the tea was above it in boxes the tea had all got all dispersed obviously so the the fish would have a nice cup of steam and that went down and and all there are other surrounding animals and creatures but they found these tea sets and they had barnacles tiny little barnacle and we had/have a collection in the handling so they are tiny little tea bowls originally the to show the fact that you've even got these in this middle-class living room means that these people are very wealthy because they're buying tea and let's imagine that this place is actually a tea merchant that's how they manage to get hold of it so so yeah so tiny little tea bowls no handles green tea in the in the green tea would have been the original thing that they would have drunk very small amounts and also I think if I'm right you can see the tea caddy here can you see there's a tea caddy with a lock and key which would have been kept by the the mistress of the house or the the housekeeper but that also would have been locked away in the japanned cabinet because it was super super ridiculously expensive and just to let give you an idea it would take roughly a year from the minute you went to the merchant they walked into the merchants shop downstairs to give get the tea for it to come from China to back back here again so you'd really have to not just do you know you're Asda delivery you see you've really got to forward plan. Wow and would they would they have drunk the green tea just neat as it is because it's quite bitter isn't it can be quite as quite an acquired taste was that? yes it would have been would they have put sugar in it or not? no not not as not as far as I know no I think that that comes it's again sugar was very very expensive being imported at this time I'm not 100% sure not 100% sure but the dregs of it probably would have been drunk again and then drunk again and then if any would have gone to the servants so so yes so that's a beautiful tea set and some little like petit four on the table as well that been in like probably sugary petit four but I think the highest of the highest sophistication would have been having it like completely pure and know no additions what else. The chair you know I've said that I've got all these wonderful things going on in these rooms on thinking what else well that the tea is the most the most beautiful the chairs are imported as well I think they're mahogany so they're so they're imported too in fact that the and the likes of the jappaned cabinet but I'm actually going to bring in a little bit of a nod nod to slavery here because because they like all these things are coming from places where there were the colonies and in fact Geffrye Sir Robert Geffrye not ever that I really research this but probably made some of his money in regards to slavery too so so never really had a tour around that with the Geffrye but this this room would be a kind of a good representation a good representation of it at the time shall we move on shall we move on. I was just going to say also notice candles. Yeah good good yes um so yes super super super expensive you knew if you were in a wealthy house as to what kind of candle that you would have had so these are beeswax candles and but if you were in if you couldn't afford the beeswax candles then you would have made tallow tallow candles which was from sheeps lambs fat or the fat of an animal yeah and I would say that even though they have these gorgeous ones here would be for visitors they would still be using the tallow ones you know kind of in evening times because because of it being super expensive at the time. They used to use those candles in in the almshouse as well. That's right that's right so we we we used to do usually when I'm doing this tour I have a whole of objects that remind me of everything as well like we have got a tea caddy that you can have a look through so it's got usually two containers and a little mixer in the middle and just thank you for Axel because then we have two candles the honey candle and then the tallow and then always get your people to guess what they're made from so yes so these people were definitely definitely privileged and you would you would burn it as you can see this quite low on some evenings if they have like members evenings if they had members evenings at Geffrye they would burn the candles for visitors to see what it's actually really like and now you can see me how also like there's mirrors those mirrors coming into play we are starting to get the idea of identity and enlightenment enlightenment. Can I ask you about the mirror that's across the fireplace because that almost fits like it's been made is that was that what would have originally been there it looks like it's been almost made for that space. I don't I don't know but they do a lot of the objects are originals okay they are originals and they they just it's it's quite unusual isn't it it's it's absolutely stunning  again for reflection like you said earlier with a pewter place but it's um but also it's it is for a looking it actually like a looking glass I'm just thinking yeah 1745 so this written living room is 1745 so this we're talking just when the British Museum is being built which is another place that I work in so this is the late age of the Enlightenment very much so people who merchants going out buying stuff things being ported in kind of I've got to I've got oranges going on in my head now sugar everything has been exported and that's it yeah the mahogany of the chairs it's coming from the the kind of colonies also been imported with sugars and there's all sorts of things coming in from different different places so it would have been a good thing to do to do some sort of talk around slavery with this room actually thinking about it but been a bit more you know controversial and topical. Right shall I move on shall I move on and that's right. So funny not walking even like walking and talking and not walking I find really weird because I use my body all the time this is one of my toughest lockdown moments moments so there's a little chapel here so this is again an original feature when they were almshouses and the residents who lived in the Geffrye museum would have to come to Chapel every single Sunday and there was a whole list of rules there was a chaplain that lived in the in the almshouses when it was and a matron as well that would look after the residents there's a lot like a nursing home but with religious connections and so they would have to come and there was even set of rules of you had to keep your place that you had like can put so clean like religiously clean and there was no swearing if you got if you swore you there was fine you got fined you really had to live although you were living in a really beautiful space very lucky to be in this space there was lots of rules and regulations around around being being in it but still the way it's painted it's absolutely stunning isn't it yeah. Gorgeous and the floor is beautiful. I know I know it's just so it's so gorgeous so so gorgeous right so we're going to go that was the space where we had lots of books and art books and libraries and people would sit there and just hang out and we sometimes did storytelling in that room and all sorts of things going on so it's more specific so let's let's keep going let's keep going so now we're getting to the Georgian era do I show you that yeah let's do it yeah. Honestly I could talk I haven't done this for so long. I just want to walk along on the corridors I used to look on the corridors I would be so grateful that I worked there I can't tell you I just used to love it the feeling of being there so um so this is early the early Georgian period and you've got lots of pairs of everything it's about symmetry so this is 1790 and so lots of some kind symmetrical things can anybody see anything that they like and I try and talk about it. Are they playing cards on the table or they just? yes yes so so yes the family it's set up to play play cards and do a little bit of what I can see gambling gambling in this and and they're having a little little tipple as well as well you can see the  here you've got the pair you've got the pair they're all about symmetry and that's it the grand tour this is like a reflection of when the gentleman went on the Grand Tour so they took you know when across Switzerland France all the way to Italy and had the most raucous fabulous times and then came back with all inspiring ideas about what to do so so I'm thinking Palladian architecture which is the front of the British Museum you have the portico then the pillars so that that kind of Palladian style so the height of fashion is the the Neo neoclassicism that's it at this time everything everything's about that the very rigid society rigid rules rigid society and and you know you kind of play played by it or you or you're out it's very it's not it's not one of my favourites I can take you to my favourite and anything else? well just the wallpaper and the carpet is very striking we've got so much more pattern suddenly haven't we that's that's right yeah it's more we're getting into more decoration and design of the home more luxurious more luxury and handcrafted handcrafted things I just love the curtains you know just they're stunning aren't they and and at bottom you can see like some sort of some sort of fringing it's very it's very very beautiful and also very feminine this this room it's a very very feminine room um very it's very nice so let's carry on I'm not sure we're gonna get through the whole we might get the up until the 20th century it's it's quite interesting to see how much change has occurred since the first room where everything everything's very hefty all that furniture is huge it feels quite stuffy and and slowly things get a bit more ornate and delicate and a lot more open I think you're absolutely right as you go as you go through time it feels like things are less harder to do yeah yeah no you're absolutely right and even in the home you know having the servants like living in with you or um you know at this point you start to get more separation of rooms it's actually that the next the next room because with like bedrooms aren't particularly a thing let's just go this is this is nice. Also I want evidence of leisure that you didn't you didn't get any evidence of any leisure time really did you in the in the first room not not I think unless you're super super duper wealthy yeah yeah you're you're getting you've got your you know you have your gentle gentle woman you know because they're kind earn so much money from their merchant businesses that they're not working they're working they're gentlemen they're just you know work know. This amazing. Whole bygone era well this is it this is the this is the room as I walk down the corridor for my interview at the Geffrye Museum this and I've never been there before I did a bit of research I've never been there before and I walked past this room and I'm just like BAM. Oh look you can see the window from this angle because the windows gorgeous yeah we wanted to see that. There we go there we go so so we are talking. Is that a chess set? yes yes this is that's why I didn't talk so much about last room because I love it but it's just too it's too stuffy for me it's like I want to be in that space but the picture the woman in the wall in the last room she's got a mantua you were on the big huge dresses you know you can't move it's just and everything is completely rigid but this just it's much more relaxed I think is 1820s you know you can actually breathe in this room so yes a silk beautiful silk curtains this is about interior design this is about interior fashion the hand-painted printed wallpaper the colour blue at this time this was the fashion the Regency blue and the chess set also turns into a sewing table so you've got this furniture that maneuvers itself around and you can tell how excited I am about this can't you but the furniture crate you know but you got chess set that then turns into a sewing box underneath so there's like multiple uses of everything going on and there we go that's better as about a better look you've got the fire dogs in the fireplace again like stunningly decorated the mirror is like convex and the gain with the lights but it's just I want it it's stunning a love all this design and then on the sofa... Oh a litte footstool. Footstool. You've got to sit still you've got can you see mr. Darcy on the sofa right now? because for me he's there I'm taking a turn around the room and just adjusting the curtains it's a bit like the The Sex in the City series were wearing mr. big is almost his sofa and Jessica and there's you know what's the name Carrie like walking around adjusting things that's how I imagine it modern day always bring up some modern day so beautiful oh yes and also absolute stunning not going to touch anymore is but up here you've got silhouettes so this silhouettes just love love love love love love silhouettes and I actually did a workshop based on silhouettes once where I had a projector and a light and then children like projecting their image onto the wall drawing it cutting out and then I also did another one where silhouette cutters where you just literally have a friends that opposite you and you and you cut the profile of their face really quickly and as only I think when I did the research this is a while ago now there's only like five actual professional silhouette cutters in the country that go to weddings and will sit there and do do this so we challenged ourselves to get it to get it right I always ended up with a really like doing big nose or some people I can't help it it's just absolutely right for me this era probably because of Jane Austen it's just so alive so alive for me. I love it. It's gorgeous isn't it yeah absolutely I think it's beautiful so and then we have the Victorian room so early early Victorian so we've got Elizabeth oh sorry Elizabeth Victoria there in all her her beauty and her glory um but now we're talking very different what - how do we feel about this room? sort of clashing colours isn't it's all coming at me I mean it's only only the walls that save it really isn't it the theory behind oh look at that you can even see the dates at the bottom I didn't needed to worry and think about the dates I shouldn't have had a disclaimer 1817 there we go so actually yeah it's fairly early Victorian um mid-victorian the reason one of the reasons behind the clash and the colours and the like the beauty of the the room before and then now we've got like everything in your face is apparently according to Industrial Revolution so in lots of these little middle class living rooms are all based in London so the idea of them dealing with this progression happening at such a rate that the Victorians wanted to add every single thing that I could think of from nature into their homes so it's almost like a case of suddenly like dealing like psychologically dealing and coping with this living in this in London at this time where everything is expanding so just behind the museum there was the we had the railway so that was coming in was really nice if we were stood there I could explain so you've got the Kingsland road like I said if you can see at the bottom we've got literally the railway behind the museum and then just if you carry north up the Kingsland Road walk about ten minutes you've got the canal so you're actually surrounded when we stand in the museum that's what I love that kind of experiential feeling we stood there surrounded by the Industrial Revolution and lots of factories in the area of Hackney too so yes I can I can kind of see why there's you know the carpets flowery the the chairs of Flowery you know everything like everything is just kind of Flowery curtains it's just this is that need to grip onto the feeling of being natural I suppose what this one one of the reasons one of the reasons. I was just gonna say that's why that's one of the things I found most interesting about looking at things like this is the changing idea of what nature is and do you compare it to the first room there's a real sense that they're kind of shuttering themselves away from something awful outside really whereas you know when when we reach the Industrial Revolution and things start to take off in in the urban setting nature becomes something ideal it's something that you want to get back to yeah that's nice I like that in the first room at Christmas they they have a Yule Log they put a Yule Log in there which you would have burnt for all of the days of Christmas and all of their beautiful outdoor like ivy and mistletoe is brought in yeah by this point they you would have the Christmas tree and it would have been on the table and it's the first time it was introduced so it's much more yeah kind of organised organisation of nature yeah in comparison to like you said the first the first the first room yeah. It's also got less formal feelings I want to say cosy its kind of cosier than than the previous rooms but it's kind of it's a for me it's just like completely overdone you know. Yeah it's just it's kind of little bit hoarder yeah but you know that's kind of we think that's a negative term but  it is really it is actually and that's Victoria there was Victoria um and these are amazing these nature domes I've did many many arts and crafts sessions and about nature domes so again you're encapsulating nature into a glass case and there's two reasons for that one because of dust and you would have there at least knew the gas alia so the gas lamps are coming in at this point rather than and candles too so that would call the whole cause the whole out of like black and soot on the ceilings this was this room would have been a heck to clean and and then so your dust but then also just thing capsulation of of nature and quantification I'm thinking that Charles Charles Darwin so these are actually little birds from South America tiny tiny little birds in this one here and then there we've got like different dried dried flowers it's very much about capturing it all sticky into something and then claiming it as yours that's is the empirical thinking maybe. Is it the first time we've had a musical instrument in the room, is that a piano? no not not first time not first time there was they they have I think there was something in a violin in the room two but yeah playing the piano being accomplished the ladies you know sewing you know it's all about accomplishments um so so yeah so very very nice very nice and then anything else on this room so so much I always just want to go out if I thought if I ever had to go on lockdown in this room I think I would. You would go crazy wouldn't you. If I had been in the one before. In fact lets ask a question so far which room would you have gone on if you could be in lockdown in one of the rooms we've seen so far which one would you be in? definitely the one before I would go in the one before the one before with the white curtains. Jess? I know my favourite is the next room right. Can I just say one thing is that the fireplace is tiny in comparison? yeah it shrunk hasn't? coal oh I'd say coal because you can get at like a fiercer a fiercer flame from coal whereas with wood with wood you you you need a lot more you need more bigger space this is literally just popping into my head as I'm talking so whether that's if there's any fireplace scientists out there who's gonna watch this they can they can comment and then we can learn I'm no I'm no expert on fireplaces but I find it all fascinating. Right okay so this is the last room of the 20th century I dunno what I'm there we go there we go but Jess go on why don't we talk about it if this is your fave. I just like it because I like the Arts and Crafts movement and it's very Arts and Craft go and tell us a bit more. That's all I really know. I like the William Morris design and the tiles around the fireplace. But I don't really know anything about any of the objects in this in this room. What about you guys Sonia Axel what you think of this one it's still Victorian but late Victorian really late Victorian. Well I like the I don't know how to have to describe it almost the border that's underneath the skirting on the on the ceiling that's very nice yeah and it seems a bit more uniform as well it works with the curtains for instance rather than clashing room. Yeah if it's like moved it's like the the Regency style and grace the room before then the Victorians of everything together and then suddenly like the next stage it's been refined yeah you've still got a lot going on but it it just feels like it's got more I don't know it's hard to say without offending because like obviously that room before has a lot of thoughtfulness gone into it but but this just appeals to personally my sense of style and taste and it and William Morris the never have anything that's not beautiful or practical that's not the exact quote I know but but that's what this is about you choose the right things to be in your home and everything is beautiful and but also and or practical at the same time and I love I love the idea of that and like you know Jess said you know the colours and just all matches it matches it feels comfortable there's a lot of oriental Orientalism in here too so lots of nod nods to the Orient I'm just trying to see if there's anything and also this is a beautiful Arabic like chair can a Moorish chair I've not chair table there as well so in that if you can imagine in the houses and the with this room for me the gentleman has a long smoking jacket on and he's got one of the little the little kind of hats there the the Moorish style hats I'm not talking a fez although some did and they would be smoking a really really big pipe. Are we thinking Sherlock Holmes? I'm always thinking I'm always thinking Sherlock So yeah I think I think so it just has that extra extra beautiful edge and and uplifting like the carpets and yeah it's just stunning it's absolutely stunning this was the restaurant keep going through this was like the new wing No don't want to go that way I'm gonna go that way New wing. Okay right this is Edwardian Edwardian room and yeah okay this is over here the living hall no it's the hallway so when you when you come in it's huge it's like a room of itself um this this building this Queen Anne style so again like Jess said art the Arts and Crafts style and see you walking you've got a whole hallway there's even you can't see it but it's even a fireplace in there as well in the hallway so you're getting yourself you're coming out from the outside and oh that's right just quickly we're going to say back to the aesthetic is that it's like Nature has come back into play again but in a in a beautiful way in a in a respectful way like William Morris that's how he worked he was all about you know having nature in side the home as well but not in such a way that they're Victorians you know who done previously and this is the same it's like a real nod and a real respect for nature so so you're walking in you've got this gorgeous great space you kind of shaking your coat off if it's cold and rainy and and you're getting yourself like ready to go and greeting people in the hallway whereas Victorian houses you traditionally were really tiny that all corridors going through at the beginning when you when you walk in and then you've got the you know the idea of the big chair the big chair again you've got the Arabic stuff fireplace which is like this gold stunning lots of nods to the Arabic aesthetic in this room which I love and you've got your windows again acts all that kind of casement style that's really going to go on about your windows could be your expertise you never know yeah let's let's you know lead whatever it's called. lead tracing? I don't know I was going to say piping but that's Cluedo so yes beautiful it's lovely plate on the fireplace which is really nice the colour of the green of the gold you've got this and if you I don't know if you've ever seen the film room of the view which or what share the night so the awarding air is very much the Belle époque like a lot of money before the war and the First World War I mean real luxury beyond luxury Downton Abbey you know just servants masters and this always makes me think of the dresses the actual the lampshade is the same as the outfits so imagine wearing that it's just so fabulous and the fringing coming off it and and again we've got nature but but nature done in this is Art Nouveau Art Nouveau style so you've got tulip lights but it's just tasteful it's just very very tasteful lots of green like the plants and this rug actually I remember because I did used to storytelling this room a lot Albert the mouse story it's really cute I still loved storytelling in this room I just have to be really careful and because I just stipulate a lot and and then the rug this is actually an original Irish rug so I'd have to put like and these cloths down before I start storytelling just to protect it but yeah very very very beautiful very beautiful so some so this is the idea of a Pierre de terre 1930s so after the first world war before the Second World War and absolutely gorgeous art deco art deco design so you've got other different the kind of graphic design on the like on the carpet the graphic shapes technologies coming in more there's central heating in this room it's sort of them that all the latest mod cons tiny little kitchen here they haven't got the cocktail bit set up with cocktails starting to get cocktails at this time with a Hollywood magazine on the table beautiful Hollywood style this is German actually but um like figure a face on the wall the polar bear people used to talk a lot about polar bear it's really cute and you've got the wireless you've got the gramophone even telephone even telephone there too so it's really very much this is your London residence and you've got it all you've got it all there at your fingertips and you know you don't need much home you definitely host much at home you're out of the town at the jazz clubs and having having a gorgeous time. It's kind of my era too. My favourite favourite room so far I think it's gorgeous just it's done it was done so well that you could just literally walk up and live in the room that's how clever this is. Oh well I revised my view this is now my favourite I love it, oh do you see that round table with the chairs. Yes. I'm sitting on one of those chairs now. No way. That I got for ten pounds in the local charity shop I'm not kidding I'm sitting on it right now It's so handy as I can bring it up and down the stairs to do my video calls upstairs it's stunning isn't it and there's the way that they fit in around that table there's six chairs and that's not a big table it's it's real scandinavian design we're talking early IKEA all though the designers at this point would be know it's all been made modern and everyone's you know everyone's able to have it but but yeah just just atomic design so we've got space race going on here we've got the UFO lampshade that one of our lovely volunteers sunny used to talk about who it was that was his special topic great tour used to talk a good half an hour about that lampshade with all sorts of things included and we've got the beautiful can you see the phone there which is very iconic phone style that I had growing up the the tapering of the chairs like a rocket coming down like really really small what else the wood the cleanliness like the this possibility there's no cleaner or no daily coming in anymore where's the previous one you would have had that the daily come in to help have a little clean even though it's not that big a place where as this very much you know you'll start to get rid of the idea or the need for servants so so this is about cleanliness and light and bright it's got like double height ceiling idea yeah what what do you think what do you think? when can I move in I just love it it's totally totally the kind of you know style I would if I could have afford oh look at that telly oh my goodness. Oh wow. I thought you might be into that Axel so that was one of the first designs so the first TV broadcasters 1953 for the Queen's coronation so that this is a later model something star I can't remember exact my head and we we had so we used to talk about that and we had all the radio times and magazines and things to do with the coronation which was really really cool yes oh good it's a good time it's a good time it's good era and and a lot of a lot of the generation that's like the older generation it's to come to Geffrye if we were doing um different tours they would really relate to this room because because a lot of the furniture a lot the style is the style that they lived in and this here this is a lack of the ladder rack ladder rack system and this is so expensive but it's so beautiful I was like look at it online I really want the ladder rack and then you can get ones whether there's a desk and it folds out it's just cool it's just really really cool so it still speaks now like I think it will always speak it's that kind of that kind of era that kind of furniture and it's really interesting because it's so light and airy and it's a bit like you know that the whole nature the relationship to the domestic in nature that we've been talking about this is like sort of bit just like the ultimate paring down of that and they're still they're still nods to it in terms of the materials and the colours yeah but it's very very minimalist now isn't it just gorgeous. And we've got the plants going on again and urns on the curtains interesting so we've got another nod to classicism It's all that all that kind of the different natural woods that are on display it's not it's not just all the uniform is it it's lots of different examples. That's right amazing and then finally you have the very cool kind of urban urban loft space got a Rothko very New York but you can look how cool is this you've got your kitchen under you know it I'm sure the bed would get hot but so so cool like 1990s style even now I love looking at Architectural Digest which is a YouTube have YouTube videos we can look and when I see the New York loft spaces and it's just so so cool and that is very much Hackney so this is based on Hackney but you've got if we see the TV you know and you've got the VHS you can look at it and think on modern but then you start to really look at it and go now hang on a minute. I think any any like early 2000s cooking program seems to be based in this exact kind of kitchen area. What would you class as an early 2000s what programme? So if you go online like a I can't remember what it's called now but it used to be called UK TV food it's called something else now and you see like Nigel Slater and one of these kind of usually making some kind of fusion cuisine type thing and yeah those chairs in particular seem really evocative of it Do know what I actually don't like this room at all I find it very um a bit clunky I feel like it's kind of the good we've lost the element we've got the minimalism but we've lost the elegance to me it's not like just a bit I don't know cold and clunky and not very attractive even though there's loads of space and light. I also think it's quite strange sometimes how stuff that's more recent you can seem much more dated. Yes. Because it's only slightly out whereas like the the one from the interwar years with the kind of Bauhaus you know modernist stuff that looked a lot more futuristic. I totally agree yeah. That's fascinating isn't it I love that I love the chair the this chair here is a Balzac chair I think it's like a couple of thousand pounds it's really and it's so comfortable. I think that's it that's on its own that's when its own would be fine I think it's the it's the rest of it the sofa and the shelving. It's friends Axel I absolutely love Nigel's Slaters he is one of my absolute heroes and the fact that you bought it up It's one of those programmes where they come on and with Nigella Lawson there to and a couple of other chef I now follow that back in the day and just really cool just so so amazing I'm just so you're so right. I didn't think I'd be bringing that up. I love the fact you did it's brilliant So relevant um yeah this is also a very famous piece of art I'm just thinking I think it's called flipper I think just that's really recalling my memory but this table like it's got like flipper or fins it's a very very very cool piece of furniture this up here it's um Japan style Japanese style where it folds out into either a chair or table so it's that kind of you know furniture that morphs metamorphosizes and again like you can see you've got the kitchen and there's the dual lit toaster um you know all of that all of that kind of stuff that we still we still no one love now oh and the wireless phone that's a wireless phone mm-hmm if you bought children into this room when we did school sessions and you start showing them all the old technology you know they've never seen a CD is there and you show them the big mobile phones we had those in the handling cupboard it's really good fun really good fun to get those things talking yeah like yuppie like wall wall street wallpaper yeah all sorts of things so yeah okay that's it. So I hope you enjoyed so shall we go for a cup of coffee now sure this is nice should we take it over seat or do we want to sit over by the window
