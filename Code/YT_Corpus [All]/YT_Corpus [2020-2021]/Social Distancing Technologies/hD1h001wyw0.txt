 we can't break our country over this we have to get going what we reopen will be better than what we had before as the debate over when to reopen and restart the country rages more questions what will our lives look like can fans gather at sporting events theaters what about busy workplaces some including New York City's mayor say part of the new normal should involve health screenings the important thing to recognize with the temperature checks they absolutely have a role to play this device may play a role in getting the country going again it's called the symptom sense medical evaluation gateway the manufacturer says it can screen up to 600 people an hour for signs of illness company CEO Derek Peterson showed me how the technology works at their lab on Long Island New York okay Vicki come on through as I walk in Peterson says this sensor uses ultrasound to measure my height so the machine can adjust now we're gonna calculate your body temperature and we're all sound like it your heart rate resting heart rate and oxygen level by this sensor right directly in your chest area in less than 10 seconds this screen tells the operator my external temperature respiration rate blood oxygen level and heart rate so you're looking at these vital signs what cannot actually tell you about someone's health through our combination looking at these four vitals we could tell some ways well or not well Peterson says because this is not a medical device it doesn't require FDA approval the machine doesn't collect data and he says the technology to measure these vital signs is non-invasive we're using a technology called millimeter wave technology to be able to scan the body for respiration rate and heart rate also using our own proprietary technology for determining temperature we validated against known equipment in the industry that can verify what we're doing let's be clear this cannot tell me if I have coronavirus absolutely not I can't tell you give the coronavirus but what I can tell you is that you're maybe sick it might detect vital sign differences that are consistent with coronavirus but up to 50% of people with coronavirus are going to have normal vital signs and those symptoms whatsoever NBC News medical correspondent dr. John Torres says this device is not a magic solution to detecting coronavirus how important are these vital signs to determining a baseline if someone may or may not be ill vital signs are one tool we use to look to see if somebody is sick but it's not the only tool people with normal vital signs if they have other complaints they still might have a disease what do you say to critics who say this might give people a false sense of security about whether or not they're healthy it's just another tool trying to help people understand in a quick way if they're healthy or not this is not the end-all be-all but who decides what to do with this data tech ethicist David Pogue R says it will be up to the organizations that use this technology to figure out how they respond do you think tools like this are helpful and do you think they will become commonplace yes I do think that they can be helpful we are in an extraordinary situation where I think a lot of people are looking at how do we balance our individual freedoms with more of a collective need for for society he compares the new technology to Airport screenings after 911 I think a lot of us are talking about tools like this and other forms of technology that might have seemed unusual a year ago might be part of our future well as for the symptoms sense the company says it's received interest from thousands of companies and governments including major league sports the Greek government just ordered several of these devices but it's unclear how to where they're gonna use them yeah and you did just talk about asymptomatic people being up to fifty percent so that'll be tough but the question is it may help a little so what does it cost and when could it get on the market they are not cheap there are about thirty five thousand dollars a piece the company is also working to incorporate a metal detector based on feedback early from sports leagues so this can be more of an all-in-one screening tool and they do expect to start shipping these devices in about one month okay all right Vicki thank you for the update you
