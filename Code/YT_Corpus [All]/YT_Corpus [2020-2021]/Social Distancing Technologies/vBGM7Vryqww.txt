 hi good afternoon everybody welcome to Kovan 19 implications for science technology and international affairs I am Joanna Lewis and I'm the director of the Steve program and a professor here in the School of Foreign Service as we wrap up this very untraditional semester here at Georgetown the Steve faculty staff and I thought it would be really nice to hold an end-of-the-year event to bring together the Steve community and beyond to really reflect on the historic period that we are living through and the broader implications that we are seeing for issues across science technology and international affairs from Earth and space science to energy innovation we also will hear from two of our world-class global health experts here instea and learn about how covin 19 is affecting vulnerable populations around the world where many of us work and we'll hear about how new data science techniques are helping in the humanitarian response today's event will be a panel discussion and we have five excellent panelists I'd like to briefly introduce to you all and you can see them here first we will hear from Rebecca Katz who is a professor in the science technology International Affairs program and she's the director of the Center for global health science and security at the Georgetown Medical School and she'll start us off talking about the global response to Kovan 19 we will then hear from Professor Sarah Johnson Sarah is an assistant professor of planetary science in the science technology and international affairs program and the biology department here at Georgetown and she's gonna speak about kovin 19 from the perspective of Earth and space science we will then hear from Rajesh Bureau Geffen vera Gaffin Ansari rush assistant professor of science technology and international affairs on using socio spatial data to promote a more equitable response to cope in 19 particularly focusing on some of the work he's currently running now in India and then we'll prefer will turn to Professor Emily Mendenhall Emily is the Provost distinguished associate professor of global health here in the Steve program who's going to speak about the complexities of koban 19 inequalities from to society and finally we're very happy to have Addison Stark joining us Addison is this adjunct professor here in the Steve program and he's also the associate director for energy innovation at the Bipartisan Policy Center who's going to speak about the impact of Kovan 19 on the u.s. innovation ecosystem and after we hear from all of the panelists I will moderate a question question-and-answer session from the audience and so look forward to hearing your questions then and so with that I'd like to go ahead and turn it over to Professor Cass he's gonna kick us off this afternoon all right everybody so Mustafa and this is this has been a surreal time for everybody but including myself and and this is I spent the last 20 years just plus thinking about how we prevent detect and respond to public health emergencies including pandemics I should say you know global health security experts have long been worried about the emergence of a novel respiratory virus and and we've we've all kind of watched in horror as this disease has become a pandemic overwhelming capable and the resource nations alike the pandemic highlights the importance as well as the limitations of global governance of infectious diseases it showcases the importance of ground truthing the functionality of domestic preparedness levels and it also demonstrates the critical need for early capable and strong national and global leadership to coordinate effective response and contain to contain the outbreak and to save lives for those of you who have me in a class you've probably heard me say this but basically every every plan we've had in place every international agreement we paint pick and painstakingly fought over every system that we have all worked on for for multiple decades basically collapsed or become ineffective in some ways that are predictable and we kind of knew that might happen in a pandemic and in some ways that we're not and really I think eat at many of us and try try us every day and all the work that had gone into creating really what we thought were really robust pandemic plans in some ways have been completely ignored so I I think the establishing strong leadership and coordination to beat kovat 19 globally and re-establishing national level capacity for pandemic response and global security in theory will ensure that the world is better prepared to fight future outbreaks and pandemics as well as the one today doing so though requires a wholesale change in the way the US and the world fights infectious diseases and and there are significant prospects for smart investments that will not only save lives in a pandemic but also improve public health global development at national international security today I think it's important to note that global health security has been underfunded significantly certainly in comparison to other national security threats and this pandemic is shining light on the consequences of that under investment and the lack of prioritization it's also showing that even though we've we've had a dialogue around this for a long time health security has never truly become an integral part of national security and foreign policy but I think clearly it needs to I think first domestic and global security need a major infusion of sustained resources we need a renewed commitment to leadership in global health security we need to truly elevate health security as a national security issue which is that are going to require that countries fundamentally change the way they approach health security challenges and finally we no longer have to capture the imagination of anyone right now I mean I've spent decades screaming from rooftops to try to convince IDing all sorts of insane scenarios to try to convince people that that this was this was something people should care about and and we get very far because in the conversations the very best thing that you could say what happened is nothing and and that that's that been a it's been a challenge we've been a challenge with help with health with finance ministers it's been a challenge in prioritization it's been a challenge in the national security environment but clearly Kogut has changed that conversation so we're not speaking in hypotheticals anymore but people are dying and economies are suffering so we really need to do a couple things we need to change a couple of things and I've been told not a couple things a lot of things and first I've been told by many folks you know oh you don't worry about funding anymore all this stuff that you've been yelling about for years it's all good your your you'll be fun to the rest of your life you're gonna create systems it'll be great but the challenge that we have is that we in this field least we do suffer from we call the cycle of panic to neglect and I think the I I think there'll be no doubt we'll be in the panic phase for a long time but I really do wonder how long it will last until we slide back into neglect and because of that I think there there is a chance we can to try to create the systems that are required right now and to build functionality before we slide back and put into that neglect cycle so I think creating a list of things I think we could possibly do should do that list seems to grow every single day but I thought what I would do right now is just list a couple of them and and then pass it over to Maya my esteemed colleagues to get into some details and in different parts of how this outbreak is affecting different aspects of the steo community but first again if I was gonna pick a few things I think we this is an opportunity to really re-examine global governance of disease we need to be thinking about global health diplomacy there's a diplomatic window where we need to build upon the existing partnerships what this is g7 the we I the Australia group the global health security initiative to really seize the initiative and both the tone and the pace of diplomatic discourse to coordinate the next stage of the response we need to we need to take a look at the international legal regimes that we do have in place I would prefer we don't scrape them but scrap them together but instead really think about how we revise the international health regulations how do we make it more fit for purpose it's the same way I feel about the waho there's a lot of proposals for doing things like let's get rid of the WTO or create a different wh own the same thing for CDC I think we're much better served by thinking about how do we actually strengthen the institutions we have and are in a real in a real and resourced way how do we ensure stronger systems are in place for information sharing including pathogen sharing and genetic sequence data how do we think about what our national manufacturing and supply chain should look like with the assumption that countries will nationalize during times of crises and how do we plan accordingly how do we support sub-national entities since that's where decision-making often happens and whether that is to build upon networks of of mayors that we've been working on prior to this event or what kind of guidance looks like to actually support where we're the decision making where it actually happens and where vulnerable populations are protected and then we really need to figure out how to codify the relationship between the public and private sector in in health security and there's some really interesting in fascinating innovation that's happening but we don't have a way to actually capture that long term so how do we think about that at the same time we also think about resources for PPE and coordination for contact tracing and the when we when we get to the point of actually having a vaccine and shelah that there's a system in place that's coordinated for prioritization and if manufacturing prioritization and distribution none of which is actually in place at the moment so I really think we need to be rethinking our global health system and thinking about how we not only build these capacities but also build long-term sustainable capacity in our partner countries so we can get any to get away from this parachuting in mentality and instead really think about what partnerships look like and all of this will require resources and it's going to require partner resources partner countries themselves to prioritize health security and put a bit of skin in the game we have empirical data to support the anecdotal evidence what we've been collecting for years about how investments in public health infrastructure actually mean very little if they don't and they don't lead to long term capacity unless the partner countries themselves buy into that process and ship them financially so again a lot of things that I'm just throwing on the table but I think there's some we've got a lot of problems we need to solve really quickly and there's a lot of things we have to be thinking about in terms of response right now as well as the same time that we start to think about the the systems and the processes and the resources that are going to be required to not just respond and recover from this pandemic but to fight the next one so with that let me let me stop and then turn over to folks we'll get much more specific thank you so much and and really Rebecca thank you for all the work you're doing to try to get good information into the hands of policymakers on this difficult topic you know I had the pleasure of co-teaching our gateway course with Professor Katz right before spring break where she led a unit on biosecurity and was teaching everyone about the institutional limitations to a global outbreak response and it was amazing to hear about this in the classroom and then actually live it in the following weeks so it was just extremely timely and and your comments were very very prescient unfortunately with that I'd like to go ahead and turn it over to our second speaker who's gonna shift gears a little bit professor Sarah Johnson all right let's see can you hear me okay this looks like it's it's gonna work so thank you so much um thank you so much I really just - Rebecca I mean we are so fortunately here and SIA to have Rebecca not only at the helm of a lot of decisions that are happening at the university level protecting our community and figuring out how we're gonna adapt but also just being part of these national conversations and Emily Mendenhall as well it just never felt so proud of my colleagues it's been really really incredible um anyways Jenna said I'm a planetary scientist and so I thought I'd just share a couple things that you know that Earth and space science communities have been thinking about and response to Kovac um I'll just start yes Syria um so so one thing that you know like a lot of workers at federal agencies most NASA employees are working from home where we're doing mission-critical operations are continuing in so I'm I'm on the science team for the Curiosity rover and so we're doing all of those operations remotely there's a great article that NASA just put out about how the scientists and the engineers are coming together in their and their apartments and in their houses you know change edit coordinate to keep Mission Operations going we've got you know astronauts still launching into the International Space Station we've got some really exciting things coming up in terms of the first time that human spaceflight is gonna be going from the US soil for almost a decade since 2011 that'll be next month on a lunch with SpaceX you know some of these things are still going on but it's mainly the mission-critical operations and there are a lot of folks at different NASA agencies that have been able to take some of their time and energy and devote it to the covert response and so I just thought I'd highlight a couple of those things on the left here is this tremendous team of engineers from JPL that you know capitalizing on the success that they've had and rapid testing and rapid prototyping and really excellent engineering have come up with this ventilator design in just 37 days and it's really you primarily set for field hospitals which you know we're hoping that we're gonna stay below that hospital resource level but it's really exciting to see that you know if we do end up with large-scale field hospitals at some point as we continue to fight this pandemic you know we've got these wonderful brilliant engineers that are coming up with great responses NASA also has some tremendous supercomputing power and there are lots of questions that were coming up with that you know would take weeks or months to do and more traditional computing and serving servers but NASA has these great supercomputers so when we think about these epidemiological models or these five informatics or the molecular modeling that we need to do to really fight this virus to come up with a vaccine we've got NASA putting in there but I think what I really wanted to focus the rest of this little talk on is what we can do just from seeing Earth from space and how we can track what's going on and how we can start thinking about our response and we just have these tremendous satellite resources earth observations in some ways actually have never been so important we've got dozens of satellites you know both you know from the US and from other countries and other construction and private sector folks that are doing earth observation everything from high-resolution imagery to you know looking out in other parts of the spectrum beyond visible light to make these calls about what's going on with land use what's going on with populations and shifts and I just thought I'd show a few images and so this is from a private company it would be a does high-resolution imagery but this is Mecca the Great Mosque and you can just see on the left is after the pandemic broke out and on the right is before and you see these real changes in human movement you know we're seeing these across the globe and these high-resolution satellite images we can also see lots of things about the global response so here's one of the field hospitals in Wuhan they got constructed in a matter of days and you can see on the left before you know just empty fields and then that on the right this massive new construction effort we can also do a lot with energy use and so this is um this is an instrument a visual imaging radiometer that's on a satellite that NASA is looking here down at whoo honey this is looking at light emission and reflectance and you can just see that as the quarantine goes into place dimming of lights throughout the city and it's really interesting to think about how energy use is changing because it's having really tremendous impacts on environmental quality and so you know lots of pollutants to think about one of these is shown here this is nitrogen dioxide which is a common pollutant it comes from car engines it comes from industrial processes and so just in the span of a couple of weeks here in China you can see these very large emissions of nitrogen dioxide just dropping just so next to nothing and it's not just nitrogen dioxide and we're also having carbon dioxide emissions dropping really dramatically in China we already think it's a 25% reduction a temporary reduction you know to start but we we don't know sort of how long the virus will go on and projections are looking like we will have the largest drop in carbon dioxide emission since World War two as the result of this pandemic and it's like we're inadvertently running the largest scale experiment we could possibly run trying to figure out you know what would happen if we did in fact successfully succeed into transitioning to a low-carbon economy and of course this is not the way we want to do it with millions of people out of work but I think there's a lot of hope among the environmental community that if some of these stimulus packages can be kind of green stimulus plans we might be able to lock in some of those reductions and you know we may see other changes say if meat becomes more difficult to access maybe there'll be more of a shift at different types of you know relationships with food and more vegetarian diets it's really interesting to sort of think about why what might happen sort of in this sphere but one thing I think is is also really important is using these kinds of earth observations to think about the supply chain I'm like what's going on with them transportation for instance here's a train station and you can see no more trains after the pandemic starts down but monitoring what's happening you know upstream and our Factory is closing at a large scale are people starting to move around or are they not and these are really interesting changes as long as just tracking the domestic cos and the international food supply and I think there's a lot of concern now that there may be widespread famine or hunger and as a result of you know just being able to get products to market and so you know you got these Landsat satellites which do an excellent job of monitoring land use and they help policymakers they help us understand how resources can be utilized and what's going on here so I'm really hopeful that we'll be able to coalesce some of this information from this extraordinary constellation of satellites that we have in orbit to help us understand you know these very large-scale movements that are happening in response to the pandemic but I think I will leave it there and if you happy to answer questions at the end if folks have questions great thank you so much Sara that was it's so interesting to see just the amazing global scale of the changes that are happening and just how quickly we've been able to to witness this all right I'd like to go ahead and turn it over to Professor o2 Raj sorry Raj is going to talk about a really interesting project he's working on in India where they're in real-time have been able to convert their actual data to actually help the humanitarian response Raj go ahead thanks Jonah for the option you talk and for those of you who've taken the time to attend um you know like the co-ed tragedy affects us all but I want to make the case that I probably don't need to make the case but it's very obvious that what are you finding globally is that it affects the poor and marginalized citizens the most so I'm going to talk about one of my research projects that it started before covert three four years ago and how we had to react to covert and and in some sense it's an opportunity for us to be it be in a position to do something about it and particularly for the for the poor and the marginalized and and in in talking about what Sarah talked about in terms of using some of the satellite imagery if you were to render visible the poor which often are left out of imaginations of even state governments and so I'll talk a little bit about how what we are doing there this is before code and how you're adjusting to what code the crisis of code so there's something called slums are in unplanned settlements that you know many of you probably have seen a movie at least in India because Slumdog Millionaire where you have most of the poor live in extremely bleak conditions and I I do with no fear you know I did I do part of it now I can also do quantitative work and I have spent a lot of time living in rural areas and never felt you know any kind of misgiving about how some of the very very poor rural situations live but when I started doing this work the last couple of years in cities you know we're in slums and and in what is officially kind of call as unplanned settlements it's mind-blowing and and I and I look at all guidelines that go after Cohen gives us right in terms of six feet separation washing soap with clean water and a wide contacts and it's just anybody who's kind of visited a slum or an informal settlement an unplanned settlement you can merely realize that how impossible that any of these guidelines applied just do not apply to people who live in these horrible horrible conditions so of what what I want to do is to show that this is going to be a kind of a description of a project that we are doing and in in Delhi where more than two-thirds of New Delhi's population live in these settlements right we in fact we don't even know I said you don't have a sense of how many people live in these settlements even governments as I said do not have reliable data as many of these services are provided by different local governments and Delhi is not unique many of the cities the global South and practically more and more places in the US are are running running into this issue where with massive urbanization of many parts of the world where rural citizens are moving to the cities for work government have been struggling to cope with even providing very very basic things and in in few if you look at the statistical record most of most of these things are not even documented so what we know from pirate prior work is the cities there are cities within Delhi so there is no one's place called a city of Delhi the cities of Delhi with people hacking access to public services like water sanitation schools ration shops and transport and the Society which shows there are nine different types nine different cities within Delhi there has been existing so it's not these settlers are not transitory but are firmly part of the urban condition so the past three years what we've been doing in some sense what Sarah talked about where we've been trying to kind of first understand can we use satellite imagery to even locate these elements these slums and what we've been collecting is we've done three things a rocket blast three critical challenges of data collection one was using the satellite imagery to kind of try and map the boundaries of settlements but two to actually geo code very basic things like ration shops where where where hospitals are there where the access to transport is there and we have this urban spatial Observatory a web site which where we acquired a bunch of this data and what happened was I'm slightly troubled by this when the crisis happened in 24th March in the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the country while locked down to control the kernel virus epidemic and this you know I it was an opportunity first in some sense because we realized that we're only people who have actually have data of their very basic things like ration shops and gamma did not have it so we had geo coded where where all these places were and so we put it up immediately on a on a Twitter feed and opened up this data set and it trail and we were extremely thankful that our data was used by the government to locate these schools and ration places to provide a hunger relief centers and night shelters for people and we had mapped initially four and twenty seven of them and within a few days we found that don't three hundred thousand views of our map this led to either the government realizing that this is a type of data that we need to collect and now we are I won't go into the details of where we are but just to show that now we are getting requests from other parts of India we're getting requests from Mumbai and Chennai from civil society from state governments to basically kind of recognize that the importance of actually having very very basic things about a city about the right to live for the poor and and now things like subtle imagery things like geospatial data things like allowing these maps you know not just to be a nice academic project residing in you know in a paper embedded in a paper somewhere but actually trying to make it actionable for people and governments to take action on so if you want to be part of this project I know bunch of students on this call check out urban spatial Observatory dot org if you're interested in working with us on this project please write to write me it you know you can find my email id on the website and if you want to work take this work to a different city and you have access and you you're passionate about a particular city please write to me as well we really we really think that we're trying to use this opportunity that this crisis has given us to see whether we could render legible the poor who live you know who live in the cities who were often you know you use I mean I wanted to show some of the images but I just just couldn't get myself to do it because you see all these people migrate you know walking miles back from these urban areas back to the villages and if you want to be part of an effort to can I do something about it please write to me thank you thank you so much and if you want to read more about Rogers really interesting project we have a story up on the main page of the steel website so you can check that out it's dia Georgetown dot edu I'd like to go ahead and turn it over to professor Mendenhall go ahead okay trying to share my screen but this isn't no good just is it not happening it is shut down okay here we are everyone it's such an a wonderful opportunity to have this time to talk to you a little bit about the complexities that we're facing as you all know I'm an anthropologist so I'd like to talk about some of the squishier social things and my colleagues so I'm going to talk about those today I published a short piece thinking about how we conceptualize Cove in nineteen coronavirus as ass endemic very early on because actually the stars 2003 outbreak demonstrated that people with heart disease or cardiometabolic conditions were more likely to die in Hong Kong and elsewhere due to due to this respiratory infection and so there was always already some evidence that there were some cinema qualities biologically because we know social political economic factors really shape how we think about who gets sick and who doesn't so from the get-go I was already thinking because of what we'd read from previous epidemics about why this was endemic and some real challenges have come to the forefront and that are politically driven socially driven and economically shaped that we need to talk about when we think about what Cova 19 really means and the lives of families and communities so overall you know when we think about current coronavirus we have to think about it from this social as well as this viral perspective I mean you could not know that any any more than anyone else as you are living this and these social ramifications are realized in such deep ways in your everyday lives and but we all know what this what this is but what does it really mean so um as they go through in this article I talked a little bit about what living in dense context really matters so in the US and elsewhere we have these complicated challenges of overcrowding in prisons and the risks that poses to especially elderly prisoners and also our detainment centers and what our immigration policy has done to driven drive risk and to affect those who are more likely and more vulnerable for infection and really thinking about what that means in the lives of some people and not others in the United States especially thinking about racial economic lines this is a real tragedy and inequity that we have to understand and also we have to think about the densities in which people live what neighborhoods live how you know how dense neighbourhoods are organized what that kind of risk with social debt social distancing can mean for some who have big backyards or maybe live in rural areas compared to others who may be living closer context um and then really we need to think a lot more about what it means what risk means the concept of risk is not just fun infection but as we're kind of tracking the epidemic and as people are in quarantine longer and longer we're seeing that domestic violence is a huge challenge and those people who feel unsafe potentially every day have greater risks due to confinement and the lack of resources available to support people children mothers families other family members who may be really dealing with feeling unsafe and now have pretty extraordinary risk due to this social confinement so when we think about security we have to think about pandemic preparedness we have to think about what health security means but this security is so deep it's it's financial it's emotional security in the United States we have this extraordinary situation where people can go bankrupt here due to medical expenses whenever I talk about that around the world people are so astonished that our health system is broken and we do not care for those who need health care um and I think it's I often say this to my students but it's something we need to remember again and again that that you know that health should be put you know people should be put over profits and health is a social good but in the United States it's a commodity and this plays a very very powerful role in how people are responding to koban and if I can circulate some of these really interesting responses through go fund me some campaigns which go find me is a is a you know a way in which a lot of people pay for medical expenses and we've seen an uptick in these cases to care for family members who have outstanding medical bills Dudek ovid and this is a really big challenge in in how we structure our health care and how we care for those is such a most vulnerable and this is bringing these challenges to the forefront so also you know when we think about security we think about loss of jobs so many in our society are now unemployed and employed facing mortgages facing rent I'm facing food insecurity and what also loss of loved ones emotional feeling emotionally secure to kind of move on also loss of childcare or elderly care in home care and this this breakdown of the social fabric creates really new challenges and we are forever changed and I think there will be incredible innovation and incredible new social challenges and also transformations from this epidemic which are yet to be seen in our lives in our community members lives in our in our nation's lives but also globally and it's really important to think about you know our failure in the United States to this response is a political one it's the US response reveals this political failure but not a scientific one necessarily as professor Katz said earlier we've had the science and policies in place that they were not implemented appropriately for instance we still do not have comprehensive testing contact tracing isolation of cases these failures will significantly delay and weaken our ability to safely reopen anytime soon and although of course some states are attempting to do so this creates risk for so many people and we will see state-by-state what these political failures or political successes different responses will do it's a natural laboratory for thinking about politics and healthcare and we know politics and health are so tightly wound together um political leadership matters so much so I wanted to talk about president Romo closes response because it's controversial but it also is very different and provides a different type of leadership so I worked in South Africa for nearly a decade and I um health and politics there pretty closely and I also understand RNN study how poverty makes you sick and what that means in the context of the United States in the context of South Africa I've also worked in Kenya and India and Zambia and this all informs how we think about this but it's been really interesting to watch the South African response which is so different from the United States and you know so quickly quarantine was enforced and implemented it was expansive they don't even require allow people to actually walk outside it's strictly enforced the police is out in full force and so the actual what quarantine means is a national strategy it's a lockdown I'm compared to what we've seen nationally which is really no strategy I'm leaving all autonomy to the states which has been really interesting someone said it's kind of like being in a swimming pool where you may you know clear off one part of a pool but everything's kind of connected in South Africa that's not what's happening they've actually closed it down pretty quickly and um but enforce enforcement has not been safe for everyone so people residing in townships like where I work I'm have very different challenges than compared to those in wealthier ones and these are racial and economic factors that are real and historically deep and have created really different realities I have a working with a cohort that I've developed an interview that's at almost a thousand people in Soweto in the townships in Johannesburg and we found that many people are struggling in a very deep way um they describe stress when one actually man we interviewed last week said he was really stressed out because his neighbor his neighbor shack was destroyed by the police because he didn't have land rights to the land and his family was displaced in the middle of a national lockdown now this isn't uncommon to to approach families and in homes in this way but in the middle of a national lockdown where are they supposed to go and these cases have been reported again and again and again and so people are starting to talk about these human rights abuses amidst the lockdown and this brings up - you know brings forward these really big challenges okay what does a national lockdown mean how do you enforce it without abusing human rights without putting families and children at risk for displacement so there's a risk of the virus but there's also risk of a fear of a lack of food food insecurity of feeling unsafe I'm happy to wear to sleep know where to care for your children know where to feed them these are extraordinary challenges that we're talking about every day here in the United States because these are real here but they're also real else elsewhere and there are trade-offs countries are making about keeping people safe as well as saving or you know keep you keep keeping people safe broadly from the virus as well as in people's homes and their personal lives so it's important to think about this and I've written about this generally but in the US and South Africa and we shared this deeply situated racial economic and health inequities these are coming in sharp focus with covin 19 as epidemics or acute viruses often do where heightened risk of moderate to severe koban 18 is heightened among risk factors and conditions that are disproportionally afflicted by low and middle income families and especially in the lowest income neighborhoods I write in my new book rethinking diabetes that when we think about the transition when we think about emerging economies when we think about how diabetes and stroke and heart disease transition within wealthy nations emerging economies low-income nations now initially they affected wealthier groups and they slowly transitioned to affect low-income groups and what I study actually in South Africa this big study on how infectious and non-communicable diseases cluster among certain people and what this means and how stress and violence and different types of financial and security promote the or an increased risk of some conditions including diabetes which is what I look at very closely and I fear this is something we're going to see so currently there are no cases in sweat oh and if they achieved the lock down this will be fantastic but what we've seen in the United States and what's pretty well documented and they have extraordinary data on this is especially its original African American communities are disproportionately affected by the virus and this is this kind of racial inequalities in the United States on who is affected and infect and affected by moderate to severe COBIT it's a problem of racism of institutionalized inequalities that are then embodied in these Kearney metabolic problems which also are manifested further when people delay care seeking or maybe not provided testing because of racism of the health in the health care setting so there's a lot of complexities that come to the forefront and within within these extraordinary situations like the one we're in so the last thing I wanted to just talk a little bit about is you know how South Africans do we know a pretty good job naturally of staving off the coronavirus all these these although these are early days and of course there's a lot of social and political complexities that also are enabling them to have a special left down so already the effects the virus on mental health though in people's lives are real from our interviews we're calling people on the phone my team is and they're finding people are really feeling feeling a lot of fear anxiety distress domestic violence and so on and these are challenges that we're feeling in our homes in the United States as well in very different ways um so in my research so we have a cohort of a thousand people but we've only interviewed of about 300 so far and that of that cohort but we found that people understand very clearly what coronavirus is and what the risks are for infection although you know some people have some kind of like different ideas about what the virus where it came from what it is most people generally understand but what's most difficult in this first in this first kind of month of lockdown is not necessarily a viral but these social consequences so we're looking at mental health indicators from before the pandemic and now in lockdown and that people are facing and we are finding that mental strain from these so the social impact of the condition could not be clearer people are much more distressed in and really demonstrating distress from from this quarantine so you know often in pandemics the rest of common health conditions are also set aside so people are stressed not only about the quarantine about security in their homes or in the communities but also about the ability to actually health an access to health system we see this with Ebola we see this with all types of emerging infectious diseases which professor Katz talks about so extensively and well and what we see is that healthcare for all other conditions or basically routine care is really put to the side and this is an extraordinary challenge for people who also have more risk to DeMott for moderate and severe COBIT who have chronic illness diabetes depression heart disease hypertension one in three people in sweat to wear work have hypertension so actually manage these getting access to medication and caring for their existing conditions create you know some type of fear and and concern for what's gonna happen if they get cocaine so this is all the realities that people are facing and are thinking about pandemics is not only about this viral spread and this medical response which is really fundamental and you know we're reading tons of articles every single day but politics economic security and social relations are critical for promoting good mental health we cannot overlook this for people around the world in quarantine as well as within our own homes and I just want to leave you with a reminder to find some peace wherever you can and we at stea are all thinking about you and wish you need some calm and love during these difficult days we care about you a lot thank you so much Emily it's really a really nice sentiment during this really difficult time and obviously of course very nice to hear the anthropological perspective which is always I think really insightful ok I'm going to now ask our final panelist dr. Addison stark to go ahead and wrap us up right and I do plan on sharing some slides Oh perfect cool it was just waiting for Emily to take hers down you get mine you know quickly okay I think we're good to go so hi everyone Addison Stark and as Joanna head pointed out my day job is not on campus with everyone I work at a place called the bipartisan policy center think tank downtown here in DC where we have been focusing broadly on economic and energy and health issues all across kind of the the spectrum of what we would classify as topics where we can get bipartisan traction up until will be into February my focus had been predominantly on finding a bipartisan pathway forward on addressing climate change but a big part of that was always focused on innovation energy innovation is a place where we could identify a path to move forward on an issue which now obviously we're an entirely different policy environment one thing that we recognize that the B PC is in than this new Kovan reality that the entire policy debate has been turned over and so we've really started to think strategically about how we how we address what is truly a crisis of national and global importance so I'm gonna walk through a little bit about my identification of some of the issues that have been occurring and the impact kovat has had on the innovation ecosystem in the US which is broader than just the energy innovation ecosystem but has a lot of real challenges for how we're going to be addressing economic response so many of you would recall seeing what was you know actually the first week of this when it was the first 3.2 million dollar I mean 3.2 million jobless claims that was published in The New York Times where it was an incredible piece of infographic where the graph was plotted below the below the fold on the front page and then the the single week numbers went all the way up on top of the fold which you know really shows the scale of impact and when you compare how jobs and economic impact is occurring during this crisis compared to the 2008 recession we see that we're in a very different reality and a lot of that stems from the fact that were actually the vast majority of it stems from the fact that we are rightly socially distancing and meaning that there are vast parts of the economy that are not taking place as normal and this is not just what we've all seen a lot of that's impacting our daily lives of service economy and and everything else that you know where we see that there's a lot of restaurants are shut down but this has been broad-based across the economy impacting clean energy deployment so we've heard that there's been a major downturn in how actually building projects and also it's directly impacting you know as what we're all used to in the in the university and educational sphere is that all the students have gone home so this is also directly impacting innovation so let's start from the beginning though however some many people have probably heard the story that during the London flag of 1665 this has been circulating during this crisis that that Isaac Newton was actually able to get a lot done so the rich at that time the well-to-do were able to socially distance and as a young student who had left Cambridge at the time to return to his family estate he was of course um not truly in history but you know the history he created later was he was inspired by a falling Apple to develop his laws of gravity of laws of motion which led of course to the development of differential calculus and also he did foundational experiments on optics so this was a really productive time for one you know historical genius but today science does not is not done by individual geniuses but instead is done through collaboration as of course anyone can tell who opens up clipart of science you know there's lots of people who are collaborating together both in clipart but also in reality when you look at most of the work that's being done with major pushing in health care in big science in in fundamental physics you have international collaborations that are happening at labs around the world but also in classrooms and and also through other places where there's a lot of intellectual and social contact like conferences and other things like that so today we can't see that model anymore of social distancing leading through break through innovation we may see a bump in the number of published papers that occur because people have all taken their data and have gone home and started to write up results and submitted them however we're not seeing the continuation of laboratory work outside of critical research around the pandemic response and as we all have alluded to before and we are all living now is universities have recognized their particular role in the spread of of infective infectious disease where many students come from all over to centralized locations and this was one of the very first responses at many universities we immediately follow suit and it's been impacting for quite some time so what we see now is the full innovation ecosystem in the US but also globally is on hiatus so if you look at universities they're shut down National Labs like Lawrence Berkeley National Lab have limited their access to visitors and non badged people for activities that are not related to kovin response and that's also the case across all the National Labs Industrial Research is also incredibly down now GE Global Research is one example I'm not citing from them but I spoke to an industrial researcher from a large multinational corporation who said their research team is currently doing shifts we're only one third of the total team can go in and even them are divided across every other day and they estimate that their activities around 10 percent of what it would usually be and so industrial research has been really ground to a halt and also another place of major innovation in the u.s. system startup incubators and this is a picture of green town labs and energy incubator in the Boston area have also had to shut down access outside of core core facility usage for many of their participant companies so there's an issue here obviously that as many of us know from from economics that you know we're gonna move this is going to be impacting our short and long term economic growth so the major impacts that were recognizing that are occurring is they're slowly slow we're slowing innovation and that's going to lead to slower economic growth and this is something that's not just going to be immediate but could play out over a long time so I'm going back to traditional economic growth models more than 50% of economic growth is directly attributable to innovation so when we're not innovating we run into the very real risk that this respect this this economic essentially as we leave the crisis we're gonna have a very slow recovery and one thing that I've seen a preprint on also is this is not impacting researchers equally so it's also going to have a challenge on innovation within the innovation ecosystem where those who fall into the role of primary caregiver at home are also not the ones that are actually quickly writing up these new papers and submitting them and there's been some data out there showing that men are actually submitting more papers during this than women are and so that could be a major issue that we see within the career development of many people within the innovation ecosystem also it's impacting early career researchers quite a bit more as one can imagine with the downturn in the market you can see delayed retirements and also the potential where there could be less risk-taking on behalf of funding of funding from outside and industrial partnership and they might want to go with partners they've had for longer and it could be a major challenge for young pas so recommendations that we're thinking about right now but obviously makes sense and what I've written up in a recent piece in Scientific American on this is we need to invest do a broad-based innovation stimulus on the back end of this and one thing that I think we all need to be careful about is recognizing what stage we're in and there's been a lot of confusion in the media about this the recent bills that have passed the cares Act you know we look at those as rest few bills that were not even yet to the economic stimulus that we are addressing both the near-term public health crisis and economic crisis of individuals in the US by offering economic support but this is not stimulating growth yet this is just maintaining so we don't fall further into a hole the next stage should be looking at stimulus followed by long-term investment in economic recoveries so it's really going to be a three phase thing so but when we get to the past the public health crisis investing in innovation R&D across NIH the NSF the Department of Energy is going to be really critical as a component of how we think about we how do we strategically grow the US economy also we need to think about how we invest in the burgeoning sectors into the into the sectors of the future and one you know I was on a panel last week which gave me some experience doing a zoom conference like this was the fact that clean energy up until the Cova crisis between the downturn of 2008 until two months ago was growing at twice the rate of the u.s. GDP so thinking about the places where we invest strategically where we can both grow faster than how we're growing before but also address things like our our environmental challenges and climate change is a smart move about how we think about investing in the economy and an innovation moving forward also we need to think about if we want to have a stimulative effect is investing later-stage innovation so beyond just broad-based early investment through NSF NIH and goe but also something about technology demonstrations and the small business innovation and research programs which directly support startups and the building of demonstration projects which directly lead towards technology deployment and ultimately deployment is the procurement of steel and cement which leads directly to construction jobs and growth in a way that is really directed and important in stimulatory effect so with that you know I'm gonna turn it back to the whole panel and bring it back to Joanna and I'm happy to take any more questions around these issues during the panel great thank you so much Addison and so now I'm really excited to have a discussion with all of our panelists and to really open it up to all of you who've been patiently listening in particularly I know we have a lot of students here and others from the steai community so please go ahead and this is a little different from the zoom you might have been using in your classes if you look down at the bottom of your screen you'll see a QA prompt and that's where we're going to ask you to please go ahead and type in your questions and then I'll do my best to get to as many as possible and direct them to the appropriate panelists or panelists so I'd like to start off with a question that we received from Abdullah Omer anta from the Steve program and he has a question first for professor Vera Raghavan and he wants to know you pointed out that communities such as some of the slums in slums in Delhi are more susceptible to covin 19 are there any specific socio-economic policies that further strain and stifle government capability at the local and national level to respond in combat kovat within India thank you for that question the first response would be the states should first see it's I mean in seeing in the sense that of acknowledging their existence right today the the reality is they are almost 60 70 % of the people who are there are just they're just working and supporting jobs and so the and through various different political mechanisms they've gotten access to toilets somewhere a ration shop here a health clinic you know a childcare center and there are variations across the different settlement types in fact the project that we are doing is to kind of try and document that right if show how unequal you know the setting is so so and so in some sense the first ask is in order to kind of deal with these crises you're right those fundamental socio economic policies need to be fixed which basically means that the needs to be actual recognition that these people are full citizens of the country so the they are not this is not the u.s. problem where we have you know people might you know trying to kind of migrate from different parts of the world here this is citizens full citizens who are from rural rural parts of migrated to work for work and living in in the cities and they don't have you know they don't have access to any fundamental basic so so I would say start there and you know of course it's a big start because that's it's obviously you know a lot of it's a lot of population exist and so and existing I would just say that policy is to kind of the new jerk reaction which is to kind of demolish slums that's nothing that doesn't help because of the the you know the standard middle-class response to you know these these slums are eyesores and and and and and so they the the default tendency is to kind of get rid of them and that's sixty sixty seventy percent of the population can be gotten rid of and so they have to be acknowledged and provided so you build schools you need to kind of make sure that you know these you know the roads you can have energy with emergency vehicles and if you have and this is not just a Kapolei this is the one thing that I'm hopeful is there any in this bleak angry situation that you know you could see my motion is flowing is that there is more recognition because it the real a reality is that this doesn't affect only the people who live in these settlements it affects us all if I see you know in a pandemic you it is more apparent that that it actually affects the middle class and the rich who live very very close by and if you just count the number of articles that has come out and and and when we started looking at this urban settlement project it wasn't very academic project now if it's all attention the requests and you know people you know wanting to work I just realized that this is actually well you know selfishness is useful you know people are realizing that oh it actually is gonna affect me and and we need to figure this out so that's that's that I'll end there great thank you I mean following on that there's a second part to the question which asks about the role of clean water a lot of you mentioned the the issue particularly in the developing world but not just in the developing world also in poor communities within the United States Native American communities for example don't have access to clean water and as was mentioned something as simple as washing your hands becomes extremely challenging and you know if this is sort of the number one way we can be commenting the spread of the virus is there any do any of you have specific recommendations about things we can be doing particularly to adjust the water issue at this time I mean I tell you what we are doing and then it doesn't actually answer the you know question directly but you know because you're on a place of power so what we are trying to do your academics is what are we trying to do is to first collect data who has water what is the schedule how does it differ across the city and then first put it out there and that's not there you don't have data and we are trying to kind of pour it spatially so we can actually get a clear sense that's the urban space clear sense of who's got water so then we can actually fight about or deliberate about and discuss about very useful things about inequality right now it's all like anecdotes nobody knows and so the work that I'm doing we are doing is to kind of first locate that on a map so we can actually collect data about access to water and who's got you know tanker water who's got who doesn't have that and and all different combinations of that that's that's all that's so that's what I'm doing this one it's gonna make a comment on when we think about water and we think about all of these structural issues it's really important to also think about distribution and these kind of softer aspects of what having safe water means and there's a lot of shame and shaming involved in access to water using safe water identifying some populations as dirty or vectors or you know certain types of really really often racist and and not helpful things so it's really important to think about how we how we talk about some of these really major access issues and are really thoughtful and supportive of the complexities that people face because it's not just structural it's very much social and intimately emotional and to think about that great thank you I want to kind of continue on this theme and shift from water to food there's a question from Nathan Bergen particularly asking of Professor Johnson and professor Viera Gavin who both mentioned the use of remote sensing technology for a variety of issues but in particular for tracking the global supply chain for food are there ways you think we could maybe use this technology to you know prevent farmers from destroying crops that are high demand in urban areas too you know essentially readjust the way that we're distributing food around the world Johnson Oh Nathan that's such a good question and I think that one of the things I am most worried for the world right now is about food I think the UN used the word biblical proportions when they were talking about the kinds of famines that we might potentially see like more people may in the end die from not having food from the virus itself and I think that is something heart-stopping and something that we all need to be thinking about and I mean part of the disruption is right we've had these supply chains that are all you know funneling into these wholesale distributors so we are thinking about schools and workplaces in these industrial ways that we feed our population but without kids going to school I think they're dumping young millions of gallons of milk every day you know we've got these big pallets of food the kinds of ways that food is packaged that you could not get these massive bags full of milk you know to serve yourself and I mean I think there there's a lot that can be done and like some of it is on us and our consumer preferences you know and realizing maybe we don't get the food and exactly the perfectly packaged little way that we're used to and being more flexible there um I think we need to think hard about donations and and exports you know a lot of trade is on hold right now and so if there are ways that we can open up you know ways to transport food but I think that again the real question I guess is about moat sensing and I think that there's a lot to be done because we are restructuring fundamentally what we're where we are sending food and how we are sending it there and I think understanding where the foods are and like where the fields are following where things are lining up and where ports have waiting times that are excessive and which ports don't you know being able to use your most insane for data like that and the thing that's hard about is is we do hope and expect it to be a transient change you know it's it's the reason that when we manufactured toilet paper Roget have trouble getting toilet paper right because it's all you know was in it for schools and businesses and on these big pallets and it doesn't make sense that changed that fundamentally for these countries when we're only talking about a year or two at most in terms of redoing all of their factories but um but I think that some real creative thinking needs to come in here and I think this is exactly what SIA graduates are so good at and trying to figure out how we can you know take the data at hand and help buying these short-term changes so these supply networks I think is gonna be really important one of the things that I would add there as a follow-on to Sarah is there's not a built-in flexibility in the logistical chains that we thought there could have been and we've seen innovation across logistics and companies like Amazon and you know their ability to adapt but no one can turn on a dime and in a month and we're learning kind of them the edge case of how how efficient and how resilient are our logistics chains can be sensing I think should also be thought about innovation and RFID and tracking of where food goes as well and thinking about how also in food innovation broadly is spoilage is the fact that you know things are very much in a very produced on time kind of scenario and so improving long-term storage capabilities of critical foods is also going to be very important beyond just refrigeration I would add one more piece I am I don't know how short-term this is so when we talk about this idea of like what do we do in the short term before we can turn back to normal I don't have a really good prediction at this point of what what that timeline looks like and and what may be more permanent damage to our supply chains might exist you know it's it's it's it's not necessarily the kind of thinking we want to do but I think it's some of the thinking we have to do yeah great thank you one of student skate tool has a question actually for you professor Katz she asked the question I think many of us are wondering which is you know what were the major causes of the failure to implement national pandemic plans where there are weaknesses in their applicability to kovat in particular or was there just a lack of awareness about plans or communication within governments you know why weren't we better prepared for this right do we not have plans in place no we had a lot of plans in place and I think I mean so there's there's how do you break down that question and there's a question of what do we what is our preparedness and response look like domestically what does it look like globally I think you know we are seeing different countries respond very differently with different impacts sometimes you you can't control the virus right and we always know the virus that the microbes are smarter than we are they always have been they always will be and I think that we could have thought about I mean we always knew also that many of the plans that we had in place yeah any plan you ever make ever is destined to be thrown out right that's the nature of plants but but it's it's the process of having gone through planning and developing preparedness plans that actually make you in a better place now I think so we have seen these plans work better in some parts of the world we also we also knew where the fault lines were so we hadn't had an event at at doors challenge in January January or February um where we talked about the you know if you read the those of us who read the fine print in a lot of these contracts and negotiated agreements around global health knew that there was a force majeure clause in say the agreements that for pandemic influenza preparedness so all all these agreements were actually built on kind of shaky foundations that in the event of a true global emergency we knew that we would see nationalization we knew we would see sovereign expressions of sovereignty over international law so so we always kind of knew those things would happen we didn't like to talk about it very much because you didn't want to believe that all of your systems will fall apart but we knew that the the pandemic a true pandemic would actually stress all of those now what's happening domestically is a completely different situation and I will say 20 years of pandemic preparedness planning and organization and thinking and structure have literally all been thrown out so I think we've seen a an abdication of responsibility from the federal government and a push to state and locals for for things that normally would never have been pushed to state and locals we've seen a sidelining of the CDC like that so the organization that's designed to actually respond for us has been taken out of basically taken out of commission as a response and we've seen the organizations that we had in place at the White House through multiple administration's were were gotten rid of so it's what's happening domestically is I think I think different leadership and different prioritization within leadership would have led to very different results but I I'm also trying really hard not to focus on what do we what did what didn't we do yesterday I figure many of you could be writing dissertations and I'll be reading for the next ten years everything that happened in the last three months but at this point trying to figure out how to how do we solve how do we fix and in some cases how do we recreate the systems that should have existed from the federal level so right now it's like for for purchasing power for PPE you're seeing governor's band together and almost it's like recreating federalism so we're seeing we're seeing solutions put forward that are very ad hoc but in some ways trying to recreate the what the would have normally been expected from the federal government great thank you I want to segue to a follow-on question that Daisy Dunlop has particularly for professor Mendenhall asking about you know whether we might see a change in the treatment of sindh em'ly conditions following the outbreak what changes in the American healthcare system in particular do you think would need to occur in order for people previously infected with covin 19 to not face the often damning barrier being listed as having a pre-existing condition for example while applying for good health care well that's a great question um so that could go a lot of ways we could take the political route on the one hand when we think about how to care for people as like full humans we need to actually take away the financial questions so everyone you know a lot of you followed universal health coverage so how does everyone have access to care and what does that mean and what does it cost so one option is a single-payer another is still closing the gap further on on cost on access issues you know there's two big issues there's the finance how much you have to pay for it and how care medical care is provided so it's what the institutional paper and and the payment so how do we close that gap for everyone in the United States and what does that look like so there's a lot of big political systems issues that need to be cared for and in determined and also how do we train more doctors and nurses and how do we pay people address wage across the system and you know how do we strengthen our system and have a natural system I mean both UK and US really delayed their response but one thing that was pretty incredible to watch as soon as as as things we're changing politically in the UK a lot of our friends and colleagues um my husband and I spent the time at lettuce cool hygiene chocolate medicine and as soon as things change in UK everyone left and started working in the National Health Service and I saw a lot of people around the United States trying to say how do I volunteer how do I go how do I actually go support the response and there's really because our system is so fragmented we don't have that capability and we need to have a more organized health system that can actually deploy people across this we have you know five different you know public systems and a number I mean so many different privatized health insurance payments right that are very disorganized and fragmented which makes it really difficult on the other hand when we care for people as full people so I've done research all around the world and one of the biggest challenges and biomedicine is caring for people and not diseases and this is a very simple way to put it but you know many people don't actually get cared for all of their conditions because they have to take a day off of work to go to the clinic to get cared for on one day their diabetes on one day there may be another hypertension but one day their tuberculosis or one day their asthma or your arthritis you have to see different clinicians for all of these conditions so if you've been acute infection for example you may be going in for coded symptoms but you also are out of your medication for a chronic illness and you can't get those refilled potentially they will not be caring for your full health so when we think about you know talked about how we can think things politically and systems wise but actually people have written it pretty extensively but thinking about patient centered health care patient centered medical homes I like to talk a lot about what is actually comprehensive primary health care look like well it looks like going in with asthma symptoms and realizing that the symptom or the the prescription should having have someone call your a lawyer to get someone to clean the mold out of your apartment rather than medicalizing your health condition which it's almost it's it's it's not exclusively obviously medical or biologically driven so many things are socially economically and environmentally driven so really taking that seriously and caring for people as whole people is is what's going to be transformative so is that possible in the United States I would like to be optimistic I think we can reimagine anything but we need to have the political response appropriate to make it happen great Thank You Emily I'd now like to ask Eric's question for professor Starck he asks that many of the recommendations you propose involve significant increases of course in government stimulus spending are you concerned about the cumulative effect that this might have on the u.s. national deficit and when and how is it appropriate to recoup these investments if we don't spend during a crisis when do we spend I think that in this case you know there's been very little concern about the deficit in the past three bills and I can anticipate as we've seen politically already for other political reasons like the fact these up for re-election Senate majority leader has been calling that there will be no more stimulus bills I don't think that this that probably won't hold and I think that certainly when you see the president currently pushing the question about if and how we recoup is more interesting obviously there are a lot of long-term challenges that we're facing as a country and a society that will need to be paid for down the road and certainly for many of the students on here it just looks like another trillion another there like is going to be paid for throughout your lifetimes and that's a big challenge and I think it's something that no one's stop to start to reflect on one of the possibilities of course was during some of the big bailouts the major corporations the chant the possibility of taking warrants or equity stakes in many of the large corporates that were bailed out like the airline industry could have been a viable approach there's a lot of political challenge around that obviously but it is something that I think that is worth reconsidering and it's something we have done before as a country and it shouldn't feel like it's out of bounds for the u.s. to take ownership stakes and companies and that could be one viable pathway but when we're thinking about stimulants that's directly going to the taxpayer I think it's more difficult when we're talking about innovation which can have such large impacts on economic growth it's really an investment in recovery which will pay for itself but not directly however some of the more corporate bailouts it's probably worth the political conversation around it yeah I think it's a really interesting question and you know if you all remember back just about a decade ago after the financial crisis and we saw some of the largest investments ever in the clean energy sector in the u.s. in China and this completely changed you know the the global competitiveness of these technologies and and these countries for the better right so I think this is in many ways could be thought of as an opportunity if we do it correctly I want to turn to a question from Anya Wow who talks about the trade-off between all the data that were now have access to and privacy issues this is a great stiva question she says there's been a lot of talk the government access to data can help alleviate or control this crisis in the future presumably data can be used to help treat patients track social distancing and provide access to resources like water how do you think the more democratic societies like the US will use technology to alleviate the coronavirus crisis while simultaneously balancing democratic values and presumably privacy issues would anyone like to tack that maybe professor fearo Raghavan's yeah I mean I you know this classic conflict between surveillance and privacy and an openness and I think you know it's yeah I mean I see II for example I mean the part in your Center is the first sentence right which which I think needs to be if there's been a lot of talk of a common access to data so yeah yeah if the state has total access to data you can see you know it's a problem but if you we're talking about access to data that is not just to the state but also to citizens themselves to kind of question to understand what's going on I mean I also echo what Professor Johnson talked about this warrior famine and and you know I think it's real and and in law at least in India there's a lot of people who come out amethyst and John grass and many other economists have come out very strongly in saying that this is really a concern and goes back to this question of we have a lot of you know we have very little data about the cow it has a lot of data about how much grains are stored in you know in but that data is it's not you come back to this question yes account has access data but it's not available to us to find out who you know why I assume it's oniy grain stored there so we tie we are talking not just about data in its you know in its you know kind of neutral sense of like it's it's going to be sucked in by the by the government then used against you know citizens but we are talking about how do you democratize access to the data so more people actually can talk about in concrete terms because more you know and to change policy so I I think that that said that there is gonna be risk in terms of you're talking about you know the Google Facebook a recent I mean I have yeah I mean I I a big reservations about about any such technology I mean I work at Microsoft before so I I know they're kind of you know the the you know you know good I not to kind of completely paint people working is corporation just as not interested not many of these people so my friends are they're working and they really really well-meaning and I think they are trying to kind of figure out like neh while each of us trying to figure out what can we do and so so you should look at some of these efforts as as people trying to do things but as as a whole I share your skepticism about having so much power to some of these companies to track us and and I think the the simple answer is we should have we should this should not be a black box and we should have we should you know we should have we should have us look into the algorithms and so we know who's and how that works can't just trust and and store all that in in in in you know in company databases and I think that would be a place to start one thing that I jump in here quickly and it goes back to a lot of the framing that I've been thinking about this crisis response is the fact that and it goes to the heart of the thinking about long-term debt is many of the policy preferences that people have have gone out the door as we go for immediate to see of response for the near term and I think that even here as you know you talk about looking at an Apple and Google and trying to put together social distance tracking is it sounds very good as a headline about being able to keep people away from each other for the next few months to a couple of years but the question about you know long-term respect individual privacy exactly right it could be a long-term challenge that many of the things we're doing right now in response it's not reflecting many people's policy preferences from before thank you we just have a few minutes left so I think I'm going to go ahead and take a great question asked by Theodore Chia who I think this will be maybe a good question to end on and he asks it of dr. Katz but I want to open it up to everyone he says his large exporters like India block exports of general pharmaceuticals and other countries rush to get their needed medical supplies in this crisis how could countries be coaxed to move towards cooperation when their survival is at stake and I think this really gets at the crux of sort of the response we're seeing globally you know is this is this really going to become an opportunity for global cooperation or is this going to be a you know everyone for themselves you know fight for scarce resources clearly there's just so many opportunities for better cooperation here but as dr. Katz and others have noted there's just real failures that we're seeing in the system would anyone like to try to jump in on this to wrap us up you know I can start I mean the question gets at the core it like you who does multilateralism work or not and I don't know I think any any of us who spent any time looking at international law and and international organizations always knew that sovereignty comes first right and then and and we're having lots of discussions that feel very hot see in these days but the that I don't I don't know how you get around the the core of you know what what what countries will do in their populations best interest when when when push comes to shove I think we can I mean the flip on that is that what we also need each other I mean we desperately need each other and this is this is a clearly a global threat it doesn't terribly care about political boundaries and is impacting people all over the world which means solutions are gonna have to come from all over the world as well and so what what w-h-o for example is trying to do is put forward a you know this notion of solidarity that that we fight together that we come up with solutions together and that we and then we can only get there through through deep and sustained collaboration and cooperation now you know right now there is a wh o has an initiative to bring countries of the world together to collaborate and cooperate on on the development of medical countermeasures of the vaccine and the eventual prioritization manufacturing and distribution of said vaccine and right now neither the US or our China or party to that most every other country is so you know I I don't know the answer I don't know where that gets us but I think there there are clear benefits to collaboration and cooperation and working together against a single threat we've known that always but we also know that at the end of the day countries are going to do what they want to do and that's that's yeah if somebody can answer you know do we have a future or multilateral some that would be great yeah it's gonna be really interesting to see how this all plays out because I do think that's a big question with implications not just for the response to this pandemic but for solving issues from climate change to you know many other things and I'm afraid we're gonna have to stop there but thanks everyone for the great questions thank you so much to our panelists for taking time out of their very busy days to really to shed some light on what's happening and talk about how your work is is being affected and is also trying to help I'd like to thank all of the staff faculty who have been extremely flexible and very creative and bringing all of their courses online and continuing to mentor our students at this during this very challenging time I'd like to thank all of the DIA students and community for your continued engagement and passion during this very difficult time and particularly our seniors we are so sorry that we're not able to celebrate you in person but we you know really hope you will stay in touch and that we'll get a chance to do that down the road and we really wish you all the best Thank You Tube deullyeo and Patty and the other staff that helped make this event possible and finally at this particular time in history I think it's it's just more clear now that ever the knowledge of science and technology are really important to informing important policy decisions and global responses and I hope that we can all figure out a way to do our part so thank you all so much for joining this afternoon this will be posted later online for your friends and colleagues who missed it take care everyone and and please keep in touch bye bye thank you thanks Joanna
