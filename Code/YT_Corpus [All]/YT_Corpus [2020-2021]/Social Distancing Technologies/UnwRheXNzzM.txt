 So good morning today is the last of the daily series on COVID-19 the daily YouTube lives we will be covering them the bottom line is this is the last in our series on the daily series for COVID-19 today we're covering surveillance and privacy in the time of COVID-19 there's gonna be more surveillance there's gonna be more challenges to privacy and again this whole thing of surveillance privacy lockdown has become a major major political battle I'm trying to not report on that stuff but mostly report on this science the public health issues associated with these things for the next week we'll have we'll have two we'll have one on Wednesday and one on Friday the one on Wednesday is not so much on COVID-19 it's gonna be on with Doug Thompson remember the dentist that started and runs the Wellness Dentistry Network Doug has come on a couple of times and done some popular shows with us he has he's been marketed by a few guys that are that are um wanting him to help market nitric oxide supplements nitric oxide is a big big deal there have been some Nobel Prizes awarded for discoveries of nitric oxide in fact three people received it at the same time won't go into that the real question though is on a practical basis what makes sense in terms of this supplementation makes sense does use of mouthwash decrease decrease the nitric oxide in fact there's a a YouTube Live with the attractive blonde female doctor talking about that's going to impact male function it's again it gets into a lot we're not going to go into that that piece but we are going to talk about nitric oxide supplementation and why it's important and whether supplementation makes sense there's no question that that some things that you ingest like beets beet roots and stuff like that do actually have a significant impact on artery health but do the supplements again we'll talk about it on the next Friday we will have a YouTube Live then the following week Monday Wednesday and Friday then we'll get back to Wednesday in terms of the schedule I'm not going to cover the upcoming topics other than the one I just covered the nitric oxide and we're not going to rehash the previous topics take a look if you're interested covered more than we ever thought we'd want to cover about one infectious disease COVID-19 I think a lot of people are getting worn out on this issue myself included the other thing is I'm spending more and more time on a personal basis helping people get helping America get back to work in Canada and Europe and several other locations we're doing more and more work with employers on how to engineer this safely in terms of maximum ability to return to the work work environment to get work done to reconfigure the economy and to do all that safely so here's the schedule for the next two weeks Wednesday Friday then Monday Wednesday Friday and then Wednesday's after that not going to go over the in detail on the updates remdesivir no new news on that the VitalPatch no news on that at-home test kit looking good so far no new news on the Roche or Abott tests nothing new on the the webinars other than to just again let you know we've got several webinars that are coming up number one do you have prediabetes diabetes oh we used to the CDC used to think it was 30 percent of adults 60 and older and new information coming out over the past couple of years and with indicate it's not 30 percent it's more like 50 percent and it's not 60 and older it's 30 and older why is prediabetes important because that's what that's the root cause for writing our arteries burning the lining of our arteries and causing plaque which is the root cause for heart attack stroke kidney disease blindness you name it so the majority of things that are chronic illnesses "normal" aging the things that kill us and disable us other webinars that we have if you've had an CIMT you may not have the you've got a CMT but you don't know how to interpret it we've got we've got a webinar where we can help you with that a lot of people have asked us a lot about supplements no supplements are you can't supplement your way out of a healthy lifestyle lifestyle problem the supplements can often help quite a bit so I've had a lot of requests and discussions about what's one of the best supplements to take when do you take them what are the doses how do they work if you're curious about that again just check in with our folks about how to get into the supplements I know that several people Chuck for example got very interested in the monthly subscription plan we've got a couple of monthly subscription plans we've been working on these for over a year we ended up saying yeah but why don't we tweak it this way tweak it that way make it a little bit more bottom line as we decided we just needed to put the subscription plans out there the membership plans there it's a great way to get ongoing updated information and information specific to you and your care for example what have you been interested in getting a complete workup a complete follow up but our prices are just too high there's a way to get started into that program and start taking a chunk at a time rather than all at once and that's through the membership plans so for those of you are interested in getting a little bit deeper in terms of taking charge of your own health adding a couple of decades of healthy life this is a great cost effective way to do it so we'll get to the topic of is there a Big Brother you know George or it was the George Orwell Big Brother involved in a COVID-19 surveillance and contact tracing we'll deal with that in just a minute right after a Lori gives us the water ball so COVID-19 surveillance technology and I think it's George Orwell's big brother the demand for surveillance technology has surged because of COVID-19 thermal camera maker FLIR Systems saw its stock rise 60% in April because of increased demand and I will tell you with the work that we're doing with employers there are a lot of new high-tech imaging systems I covered those gosh two months ago where you you you go back and you look at the the YouTube videos of schools in Korea and China where they've got the hand monitor and they're putting it close to the child's forehead the technology doesn't is totally different that's available the groups like the NFL have already purchased these kind of systems where it's a thermal camera you can get sixty or a hundred or even 200 people per minute through that camera it takes a thermal picture it gives you some ID information on the individual as well as their temperature so don't be surprised if you start finding yourself when you go into a big building as you see on this picture right here that looks like maybe a basketball arena going through security requiring that you get a thermal scan companies are using software to monitor employees working from home students are being watched remotely through exam monitoring software while a Bluetooth has been used to track crowd sizes in malls it's now being used to enable contact tracing apps so as you can see this one is leaning a little bit more towards the technology side of things and again it comes from an article from CNET as we've covered before third seen that a few times in the technology approach as companies beefed up beefed up surveillance with technologies like thermal cameras facial recognition drones contact tracing apps and mobile location tracking these have raised concerns about privacy software company Vantiq has been repurposing its tools to focus on technology tied to tracing COVID-19 before COVID-19 it was supplying companies with monitoring tools to detect environmental or safety issues in buildings the COVID-19 pandemic  caused a spike in demand for Vantiq's tools since March its tools have been used in social distancing programs like in an app to reserve a slot at a food market in China the company helped build a real-time a "real-time coronavirus tracking system" called GiConnect the app relies on thermal cameras and facial recognition and has been sold to a mining company and retail stores in China such tools represent the double-sided nature of the effort to contain the spread of coronavirus while technology promises to help experts warn it also comes at the cost of privacy there is no question I mean again I've done public health for over 30 close to 40 years now and there's there's always going to be challenges in terms of personal freedoms and individual freedoms and the ability to screen and protect the public's health now back to the script while technology promises to help experts warns it comes with the cost of privacy more worrisome is the notice that the pandemic driven use of surveillance would become the new normal and I think most of us expect a lot of that to happen in China because they come from a centuries millennia long history of the government having no problem at all with surveillance and issues related to to personal freedom we all we always risk that if you create a new set of norms and about what to expect on privacy those norms last that's a quote from Mark Surman executive director of Firefox maker Mozilla you remember Mozilla was that opened software for a web browser we could be left with a legacy the choice to make now is what legacy we want currently there are no federal laws on how data privacy is to be handled in April lawmakers proposed the COVID-19 Consumer Data Protection Act Vantiq CEO Marty Sprinzen believes there is no going back after COVID-19 but surveillance technologies could become would become widely accepted because of the pandemic and the public health security issues it's like what happened after 9/11 the security systems are gonna stick around Sprinzen said the genies out of the bottle the toothpaste is out of the tube that kind of sensing is not going to go away now that's Sprinzen's perspective on it and he's got some points but Mozilla's Surman doesn't believe that the world has crossed the point of no return yet on surveillance norms any decisions made in the next few years for COVID-19 will all have a privacy implication attached Surman said and it takes it'll take constant vigilance to ensure that the privacy norms are actually protecting people this picture that you see in the bottom right we covered this a couple of times the first time again I think was a couple of months ago when China started linking QR codes facial recognition and the ability to by public transportation tickets that's what's going on there this individual has to use user QR code and I believe facial recognition in order to be able to purchase a subway ticket so Lori are you able to get the video up so we've seen for example of coronavirus an extraordinary response from the Singaporean government that has probably done a better job of containing coronavirus in the early days in any other country out there in part extraordinary surveillance yeah through being able to track any given individual who has tested positive and you can know where they were and who they are which on the one hand provides market stabilization and confidence among people that live there and travel there and on the other hand is really scary in terms of the lack of privacy of anybody that lives in that society what that can mean obviously again this is just gonna get stronger and stronger these capabilities yes how do you how do you think about that so there's always a trade-off you could say if you want to have maximum security there's often you know minimum freedom I mean in China where the coronavirus originated I think there is a real case to be to be looked at whether the censorship and the systematic lack of freedom of expression and concern that people have to speak their minds may not have actually led to the spreading of the virus because surveys yeah the concerned doctors were not heard people did not feel free to speak out information about the virus was being censored also online until this day discussions about the virus and how the authorities handled it are continuing to be censored and tracked so I don't think the last word has been said about the benefits of a surveillance state when it comes to a virus and a pandemic but in general I think the question should really be what kind of society do we want to live in so the contrast is that in China their governance model has been leading and the technology is the instruments in democracies there's been a reluctance to apply democratic governance over technology and in some ways that technology is leading governance right it has really shown us that we need to apply governance and the rule of law proactively if we want to have a chance visit these Chinese top-down controlled models we have to show how it works in a democratic way and be sure that our societies are resilient whether it's in the online domains where people live or or offline go as you may have guessed we're back into the question and answer Douglas poll lost chip I tell you what my worst nightmare my worst fears were recognized I was trying to manage the screen and I totally lucked out my my web browser and so that's what took me down but amazingly we were able to get back up very quickly so thank you Doug and yes we're excited to be here we appreciate your interest Jim day hey Doc and Rob 99 percent 51 beats per minute one of this one of the group asked me earlier on is pulse ox very important for seasonal flu it can help but not nearly so much normal seasonal flu doesn't have as much of this phenomenon of the quote Kathy hypoxic end quote but again I don't think it can hurt to just keep an eye on that Laurie thank you so much for putting information out there folks that have questions Laurie's our nurse she's also managing the the co-hosting today there sometimes some challenges in some areas of the Philippines in terms of the ability to get up and enrolling on the Internet Carl had a challenge this morning so any questions from Laurie eight five nine seven five seven to three to four that's a 5 1975 7 2 3 2 4 babe murky hello Laurie thanks for your help and Joe Riley 97% and 66 beats per minute good for you Joe James canner had a head test yesterday I'm assuming that's a one of those thermometer guns and my doctor's 97.7 Fahrenheit as part of the check in Dave Murphy thank you so much for the for the super chat thanks for all you're doing looking forward to getting my consults set up have a great holiday yep I did some reviews for your case via just a couple of days ago Dave I think you're aware of that I'm looking forward to meeting and going over your case see what see what's going on in terms of your actual metabolism that's hardly ever it's almost always some significant information and quite often some big surprises Jim D should integrate the surveillance tech topic with nitric nitrous oxide protection by monitoring man's zipper lines as they pass through scanners in public areas male predators mobile okay Jose fun tell time to buy a boat and go live on the ocean Caribbean islands are great thank you so much Jose and I'd love to see that I'm jealous Joe Reilly we don't have to worry about privacy Facebook has already distributed and sold our information multiple times thank you Joe Jose z50 Joe Google Anna Apple Google AMA Apple - with the in-form from information from our phones no question the a lot of information coming in through telephones as they find out where can I get a good see IMT in Orange County California Jose if you will call Lori at that number that she gave you eight five nine seven five seven two three two four that's eight five nine seven five seven two three two four Lori can help you get set up there's really two high quality providers that I know and trust in the US you can get them a bunch of other places there's one for example a third one in the Atlanta area but which we've used a few times but the two that I know and trust are a neurologist who is located in Nashville the only national group that I have worked with that I rely on is Todd Eldredge e LD or EDG II and it's cardio risk laboratories and again Lori can help you with getting that information we don't have a whole lot of questions today let me know we've got a couple more than n times coach Darren end times all this for a virus that less than 3% of people die from it's more than it's more than to this than a virus as a veteran that fought for freedom it's truly sad there's a lot of sad reactions to it coach I would agree and one of the things that's frustrating is to me there's significant over politicization won't go any further than that gene Kelleher do MIT do mesda slowed down heart beats reduce oxygen in the pulse oximeter no not significantly they they can have some impact but that's not that that - in most cases that's not a significant issue thanks it's a great question though gene sax girl honk horn boy regarding the recent question regarding wind instruments there's research ongoing in cooperation with the bamberg symphony in germany for those of you who this is just hitting totally cold we've had conversations on several of the videos about you know this is transmitted by coughing sneezing you get aerosol droplets in the in the air droplets and aerosol and you start thinking about well what about people that play wind instruments what's going on with that they've demonstrated using modeling that if somebody sneezes in the grocery aisle next to you that plume of aerosol to an infectious level can travel over into your aisle in the next level so again what if we're talking about a brass quartet what does that do and if if you're in the New York subway and you're walking by one of those groups in the subway that's playing there you know a brass quartet what should you be thinking that's what sax girl horn boys talking about Dave Murphy my local heart hospital used to do CMT but no longer do them no reason given why they stopped I can tell you a couple of things see IMT is like an orphan there are gosh for example in Nashville there were probably about 300 places where you could get a routine carotid this is the carotid artery ultrasound and that's looking for plaque but only two of those places actually gave you a see IMT what's the difference between an ultrasound and a plaque the regular ultrasound it's called Doppler or echo is basically looking for an asthma attack where the mint where it impacts your flow of blood to impact your flow of blood that makes it what we call in our space a flow study well flow studies really flows not really impacted either in the carotid artery or in any of the arteries until you get to like 50 the 60% occlusion or more now we used to think that was what's significant but here's what we found out in terms of research we meaning the general scientific medical community two-thirds of people having a heart attack had less than 50% occlusion flow with plaque so you that's not a great test unfortunately a lot of that's the vast majority of when you get if you go to get a quote carotid ultrasound and they basically just use that for for consideration of whether or not to have a carotid endarterectomy surgery on your carotid artery that surgery is less and it has been shown by science to be less and less effective compared to what we used to do I trained with them with a surgeon way back is almost what 40 years ago 1981 a doctor named Max written Barry he was in Charleston and he basically did nothing but carotid endarterectomy going into the carotid artery removing plaque that they found there and sewing the artery Beca you know see that that much anymore because the science the evidence doesn't support it it doesn't help now so you fast forward to today then those tests have become much less popular although they're still done now when we talk about it though we're talking about something else we're talking about a well it's what's called a B mode it's say looking at any level of play it's not looking at plaque that just plaque if it obstructs the the flow of the blood because any level of plaque indicates that you can get into an inflammatory State and therefore create risk for heart attack and stroke that requires some significant software it requires a fastidious approach with to the location because the the amount of plaque that's seen in these arteries is not consistent throughout the arterial tree it varies so you have to know exactly which location and which direction you're approaching that artery from in order to get anything that's comparable we do know that if you have plaque you have significant increase in risk there was there was a study gosh over a decade ago called the café's de cave study and base what it showed this people that didn't have enough plaque to to cause disruption and flow but still had measurable plaque had very significant as in up to forty even sixty percent risk for heart attack over the next ten years so that was a landmark study it created a whole new focus on how to get a little bit more information regarding do you have plaque not do you have plaque that's already disrupting the the flow of blood pardon me but if that I think maybe I went down a three or four-minute rabbit hole but not sure that I answered your question not sure there is a question there bottom line is because of some of the challenges in looking at CI Mt it's only been very very recently that standards committees medical standards committees have started to use those I'm gonna now that I'm started I'm gonna have to continue down that rabbit hole if you start the book that were the Todd and I are working on hopefully come out within another three months maybe another six I'm not sure but basically it talks about what's the best way to measure plaque well number one the most common is framing him it's not a measurement it's a guess and it's a bad guess number two a stress test hey Doc my brother had a heart attack and I'm gonna love the same genes and can we see if I'm at risk for a heart attack okay well let's do a stress test hope you're feeling lucky because a negative stress test well let's talk about foster a positive stress test 15% or more false positives and with those folks you go into the cath lab you get get a needle stuck into the artery and you're growing that's not a fun or non-invasive type process usually if you've got that going on you're gonna find reasons to to put a stent in you're going to find plaque and if you've got an assumption that plaque needs to be stented then you put a stent in unfortunately that results in the patient having a false sense of security I had a problem the doc fixed it I'm good now no not at all the other place where you get a false sense of security is if you get a false negative stress test again 15 to 30 percent of negative results under stress tests are false negatives just look it up google it you'll find it on the Google snippet location zero on the on the search page so what should you be doing then there are three different technologies that are much much better each of them like everything else has its pros and it's cons CI&T is one of them coronary artery calcium score is another and a new and upcoming CT angiogram so if you got more interest in that and how to protect your own health how to predict whether or not you're gonna have a heart attack or stroke keep your eyes out for that book thanks for raising the subject Dave it looks like I may have to go to Kansas City to get one when they start up sometimes you have to travel a little bit time to get your back bagpipes out back out doc great lung workout - not sure if you're talking about me talking so much or something else josè find a life I if I want to know gt2 tests with insulin survey what can I tell my doc so he prescribes it I fear he might look at me funny and won't even know what that is Jose you're not alone and in fact that happens all the time what you may want to do is just do that with us through the through the webinar it's very easy very simple and here's the problem yes if you go ahead and get it done with your doc and he doesn't use them how is he going to know how to interpret it so you don't have to switch Doc's you don't have to depend on me as a as your doc for everything but you may want to go in get the correct in from the correct guidance on og TT and here's the other thing about two patients per month these days that I'm seeing have a have an relatively normal oh gee TT but it's taking twice the insulin to keep those blood sugar levels okay so that's a that's something is some things to think about how's that one other thing I would say a couple of people have asked me about that there's a new test for insulin sensitivity or insulin resistance it's called the insulin resistance score from cardio risk now on by in a part of the old Cleveland health labs which is now owned by Quest's I forgot who I forgot which viewer asked me about that but they said what do you think doc well here's here's what they're doing with that they're just doing a regular fasting glucose a1c and they're adding AC c-peptide c-peptide is basically just the our peptide our you know protein is made up of peptides amino acid stream of amino acids and that's what the peptide is insulin is a peptide that gets cleaved in the small section is taken out of it the other two parts of that amino acid string bond together and that is in they form what the insulin molecule so if you go back and you look at the sea peptide you get a little bit more information regarding what's actually going on with you it's really important for folks that are taking insulin however at the end of the day they say that's a better test and it may be a little bit better test than anyone seeing fasting glucose you don't have to get I mean that's a low bar a 1c and fasting glucose you really need to challenge your your metabolism in order to get an accurate understanding of what your metabolism does when it is challenged other people for example have asked me about homa IR and the vast majority majority of Homa IR ratios are one-time ratios again same problem if you want to know how your metabolism responds to a glucose challenge you need to measure it before during and after the challenge and as I said before to Hosea you really need to be looking at insulin in addition to glucose Amma zine my wife are are about an hour I'm guessing you mean my wife and I are about an hour from Atlanta thanks for the from the both of us I guess you're saying what place do you recommend that we go to for a/c IMT there again if you'll call Lori she can she and I can give you a couple of pieces of information regarding folks in that area Thank You Amazon Dave Murphy I refuse to do a stress test I would - Dave you know the problem is I mean you can say well is it harmless that's assuming that a false negative is harmless and a false positive is harmless and they're not I've heard Cummins boss David Bobbitt had a negative stress test that actually had a 100% blockage in one artery thank you for sharing that Dave Joe Riley already won the lottery on calcium score 7,000 that's more than a lot of rich oh you and your metabolism had to work pretty hard to get there actually Joe has shared his his story with our viewers Joe Riley and if you look it up it's Joe and I did an interview and he's got some very interesting risk factors and he's doing some great work and some very interesting work in terms of managing so google my youtube channel and jo-jo e reilly r LLY thanks Joe for the contribution and for sharing that's helping your stories your stories help each other dramatically Jose Z 50 time to cut out all the carbs man Wow seven thousand it's a big number ts bleached flour root cause in Joe's case Joe had some other significant genetic issues going on very significant genetic issues so again you may want to take a look at the rest of the facts before you before you offer an opinion regarding rit costs i will say this though TS there's no question for the vast majority of us and for the vast majority of us bleached flowers grains big big issues as we age you know we may be okay eating some of those in our teens and 20s but it's when we are surviving on a diet of way too many grains in our 40s 50 60 70 s we start getting into problems Dave Murphy thanks to you and the team I've noticed you catalogued the YouTube videos yes we're doing some work in that area Laurie's done some work chris has done some work Jerry Jerry quantico's Kurth came on originally - over a year ago and as a volunteer and helped us do a good bit of work in terms of changing the catalogs developing new new playlists so thank you guys I appreciate the interest and we're gonna go ahead and be wrapping it up bambi greige baby is this any int is this the same as Bambi Abel if not we've got two bamboos how is hard to disease diagnosed in conventional medicine well I just told you you know you you go in you do the questionnaire which is not a measurement if Black gets say guests and it's a bad guess and we go into the details in the book on why Framingham is a bad gifts it's I mean it's better than nothing and it's better than you said well why don't we go there problems with the recent data on Framingham and you say well why don't we go back to the previous Framingham Survey assumptions well those were worse so nothing's simple I'm not gonna go further you know beyond Framingham and some of the discussions we talked about earlier the other thing about heart disease diagnosis and conventional medicine as all of us know anybody watching this channel is going to know that your typical doc here in at 20/20 for the past couple of decades has been looking at LDL quote bad cholesterol in quote even though most docs understand fully that half the people having a heart attack have normal quote normal LDL values so they understand that that's a logic problem but they don't know a better way to look there are better ways it has to do with some of the things we've talked about so if you'd like to get that evaluated for yourself Bambi give us a call we can help yes we knew this in 1903 yep you know the human species can be smart but we can also be slow learners okay not the same Bambi thank you it's just an unusual name as you know see now Sam is a truss chlorosis a best sentence at a young age no that's what most people think that it is a death sentence they think you know what in your 60s or 70s or some people in their 50s you can't predict it it's just going to happen you're going to have a heart attack or stroke and you're going to die that's not reality it is not reality and again this channel is made up of thousands of people tens of thousands of people who understand that message Amazon what's the latest day we can get the book oh gosh I'd have to pin tied down to his on the date for his last edit and if you would like to and that's sort of like you know I come up with some analogies like a greased pig contest things like that it's finding a needle in a haystack it is difficult to pin tied down to a schedule so I can't sorry I can't give you that I would I'm hoping within the next six months BG 92 right this sec blood glucose 92 thank you Joe I appreciate it and again I appreciate the interest that you guys have shown as Joe saying heart attacks are optional and we look forward to seeing you next week have a good holiday weekend and again we'll look forward to seeing you next week
