 here at Microsoft research we developed health portation it's a system that captured a 3d model of a person in real-time and then transmits it to if you are wearing a holo lens or a VR headset our traditional system uses many depth cameras to capture the user from every angle and it requires a lot of processing power and equipment now we need your help to make holo portation available to everyone at home we want to build an application that lets you connect any commercial depth camera and livestream that video to anyone on a cell phone tablet or PC so here's what we need first we need people who have access to depth cameras so maybe you've got an old Kinect for Windows or an intel realsense or maybe you even have one of the new azure connects or one of the latest iPhones all of these cameras can capture 3d video and next we need developers if you have experience getting cameras to work on computers we need you to help us create interfaces between the depth cameras and a user's desktop or laptop we want to make any depth camera work with our system so that anyone can use it our current plan is to make a unity app that pulls in the depth camera information does some 3d work on it and then transmits it up to a live streaming service like Microsoft mixer or twitch so if you have experience with unity app development computer vision or computer graphics we could use your help there and finally we want to ask you how would you use this new technology to help people if you have an idea for how to use Halle partition at home join the team or contribute your idea it's going to be an amazing new technology and I'm excited to work on it with you you
