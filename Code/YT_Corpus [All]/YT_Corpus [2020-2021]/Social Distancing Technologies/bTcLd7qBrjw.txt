 well lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death along both men and women yeah early detection treatment are key Kathy Walsh joins us now tonight with a new way to catch and treat lung cancer faster that's right it uses high-tech mapping of the lungs and a robot the surgeons consider it safer and less invasive for patients it can be a lifesaver Judi Arpaio knows healthcare she was an RN for 40 years still she was worried when doctors wanted to remove a nodule on her lung it was very scary very anxious about it so she had a small lung cancer that was too small to biopsy and it had been too small to remove by normal means but dr. Lanny Dunham a Kaiser Permanente thoracic surgeon offered Judy a new technique in collaboration with Sky Ridge Medical Center he has been combining technologies with a CT scan Dunham's first uses a sort of chest navigation system similar to GPS the screen tells me where to go I put my needle in and I can precisely locate the nodule he marks the area with blue dye then dunham removes the growth through small incisions using a four-armed robot it's a bit like The Wizard of Oz I'm the man behind the curtain who controlling the the robot be able to go in and pluck out tiny nodules a year or two before we be able to diagnose them before has changed everything Kaiser and Sky Ridge were among the first in the country to begin using the technique Donham now does about a hundred of these surgeries a year I do have cat skins every three months and so far so good Judy is thankful for the procedure that's saving lungs and saving lives now Judy was in the hospital for three days she said she was in great shape for her son's wedding just a month later the earlier the better that's such great news absolutely especially with lung cancer it's had a tough one to detect thanks Kathy
