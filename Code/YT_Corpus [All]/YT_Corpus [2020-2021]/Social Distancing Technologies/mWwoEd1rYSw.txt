 what we're seeing is that a lot of organizations not only have to adapt new technologies to what's going on but also the processes and in there's a lot of cultural elements to this where the people that have worked a certain way for many many years now all of a sudden are having to change the way that they're they're going about things right and so that cultural change is is probably as important if not more important than some of the underlying technologies you know like I say using things like cameras and doing remote teleconferences and and those kinds of things have been around for a very long time for for many of us but for a lot of people out there that had a different type of engagement with students with patience with with clients that they may be consulted or banks that worked with with members and and customers you name it retail everybody's having to change the way they're engaging so that's what we're seeing in general is that everybody's had to adopt new behaviors and new ways of working health care is a good example of that just because so many people in health care were focused on engagement with patients and hospitals and clinics and teachers education is another one right there again focused on working with kids in the classroom and not necessarily working with them in a remote capacity like this there's corporate users that we've been doing this for a long time and that's not that big of a deal but when you're taking people that have traditionally use this sporadically use these technologies sporadically and now this has become their way of life that has expanded the demand for support and so a lot of organizations are seeing this huge spike in the number of support calls there that they're getting [Music] as I mentioned you know those large increases in percentages for support calls for an organization that maybe has two or three people in it to handle their typical support demand now has double tripled quadrupled that can vary that team right it also creates a lot of frustration and angst for the end user that's asking for assistance so one way that we've been able to help is to quickly onboard those those organizations or expand our capacity to help to meet the demand that they're experiencing that still means that they're maybe longer than normal say whole times for for an inbound helpdesk call but it's a lot better for them and for the the client to at least know that they've got the support that they need there it's 24 by 7 and that we can help to reduce that burden on the organization so that they can stay focused on the things that are really core to their businesses they're essentially reinventing themselves and or adjusting their business model for the current landscape you [Music]
