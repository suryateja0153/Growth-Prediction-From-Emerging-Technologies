specialized professional support at Illinois State University and with me today is jennifer phillips and she is our strategic initiative coordinator at IC SPS at illinois state as well what we're going to cover today is best practices that you can put to work immediately so you're going to be able to leave this webinar and start implementing some of the things that we're going to talk about today we're going to do a quick overview of technology that enables remote pians management so what can you use to keep that conversation and dialogue going with your remote team and then three we are going to have time for questions so again post those questions in the question pane and we'll get to as many as we can today if little heads up if you haven't seen this I rate this is your first time with us there is a website that we put together for you and it is writing in the virtual workplace and you can find all the resources from yes last week in addition to that you'll have the resources from today and then being able to register for our third part of this series which is bringing your best self virtual workplace on April 8th let's get started challenges with our new normal we've all found ourselves in this virtual world and I like to say that our world has flipped upside down and if I have any stranger things and out there you kind of get my reference there we are we are in upside-down world everything that once was is now being challenged and I do want to talk about how you know the lack of face-to-face supervision we have a lack of access to information lack of right technical equipment sometimes we have people who literally pick up their laptops and we're told on Friday to not come back on Monday so how do we address those lacks of technical equipment body Wi-Fi not everyone is equipped or is in a residential or even an urban area that has great Wi-Fi I'm actually guilty of that I live in the middle of central Illinois on 13 acres so there is not excellent Wi-Fi but very good Wi-Fi most of the time but I'm also competing with my my partner's my children and everybody else for Wi-Fi work plans aren't as relevant without face-to-face or interaction and then we're going to talk about social isolation and anxiety and what does that mean as in distractions at home the reality is that we are all now working from home it's not as it was with just a fun and very engaging and very productive I get to work from home on like Tuesdays and Thursdays and I got so much done on Tuesdays and Thursdays because there weren't any other distractions this is the X the opposite desk is the upside doubt of that if there is tons of distractions your children are home with you your spouse is home with you there are some people who have decided to shelter in place with their friends and colleagues and so there are individuals who are not maybe usually in your home that are in your home now because you know you're going to be in there for another month and you have young children at home that needs your supervision as well one of the things that I want to really talk about as we go into this webinar go into the challenges is our governor came out yesterday and Governor Chris Berg did a fantastic job as much as he was bringing that exciting news he was telling us that we had a shelter in place for another 30 days but he had a message of to lead with empathy and I really want us to embrace that as we move forward the message was the message was fantastic when we are engaging with people everyone is going through something during this very challenging time and we don't know what our teammates are going through we don't know what our employees are going to through we don't know with somebody who is on the other end of that conference call is going through so we need to lead with empathy we need to lead with allowing ourselves to take a breath allowing ourselves to ask how we're doing and checking in on each other we'll get to that a little bit but I really loved the governor's message yesterday of leading with empathy so there is no real big secret to leading a virtual team if you were a great leader of a team before we all went upside down you're still a great leader of a team I will say it does lead to some challenges that we didn't really think about when we were all together and engaged on a face-to-face basis but I like this little cartoon that we put together here experts say that the best leaders have a good sense of humor I'm an awesome leader and therefore I must be hilarious I can't tell if I should laugh at that and that's because you're not a leader humor does help and humor helps in a lot of situations but I think there's no big secret to being a great leader we do want to lead with empathy and we do want to be aware of that idea that we're now all virtual so that does also take a little bit more time in the management role of checking in and touching base so I got a little ahead of myself but being a great leader is being a great manager great management can happen anywhere and the essence of growth management doesn't change when you're working remotely you want to be setting the tone you want to be giving clear expectations you want to be communicating effectively and often and we're going to talk about what that means particulars is set out parameters for when they have communication with their teams or their virtual teams I know with my university or our university they set out parameters of how many times you would have touch points and we'll talk about that a little bit later coaching staff through challenges and asking for and given speed getting feedback other things that you're adding on to that essential of being a good manager which you were already doing or should be already doing the digital adds that idea of the transformative vision so a work plan that we had in place in February could change significantly for example at ICS PS our main initiative for April was really to roll out this fantastic wheel a summit 400 people coming together in East Peoria none of that is going to happen and so now we're looking at ways to deliver that content in a different manner and how do we keep that ball moving down the court but the world is now upside down forward-looking perspective really embracing digital literacy and an allowing time for your team or encouraging your team to build their digital literacy if they don't have that so if there are certain things that you want to start using so for example at ISU again we use teams kind of on and off since June now we use teams every day we've had to embrace it we've had to make that learning curve go really quickly so we can all be up and up to speed on what we're doing and then adaptability be flexible as a leader but also encourage your team to be adaptable as team members I'm gonna hand this over to Jennifer and she's gonna get us started thanks Amy and good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today so we did a big sweep of the literature over the last couple weeks and compiled nine important best practices for leading teams virtually these tips are geared more for managers and supervisors and if you missed last week's webinar we did a best practices on remote work that's geared a little bit more at the individual level and as Amy mentioned in the beginning the video the slides and the handouts are all on the ICS PS website so this week's webinar is going to be fun it's right and just a quick commercial for next week's webinar is really focused on staying productive and taking care of yourself in this new work environment and world situation that we're in so just very quickly I'm gonna run through these nine best practices um use your emotional intelligence Amy was just talking about empathy and we're gonna get into that in just a minute strategically communicate with your team agree on guidelines for remote work create a virtual work plan that works for your team structure assess your team's strengths weaknesses and redeploy as needed make work visible and create clear measures of productivity for your team address the tech the technology issues as best you can for your team have everyone brush up on their technology skills during this time and most and very importantly maintain a sense of culture and comadre throughout this so we're gonna go a bit into each more of these nine best practices we're gonna try and go as fast as we can so we have time for questions like we did last week all of these slides contain hyperlinks so when you get the PDF you'll be able to link to all of the resources that we've compiled here in in some cases the content is taken literally directly from soar and our apologies for some of the slide density but we really wanted to share as much as possible so first off Amy led with the comments about how important empathy is right now and we really felt that the first best practice to start with was that of emotional intelligence you know it's probably never a good time to be a toxic leader but especially right now it's not a great time and this is a real you know this is an opportunity to really reach deep as a manager and as a leader to cultivate your own emotional intelligence right now we've got some resources here from the founder of EQ Daniel Goleman and there was for EQ super powers boiled down to having good self awareness self managing having empathy and social awareness and that includes having good cultural and equity awareness and relationship management um one of the the resources that is is listed from Harvard Business Review has a great quote that I just want to read that was literally in this morning's Harvard Business Review tip of the day and that's that supervisors suddenly have found themselves managing a fully remote team and may be wondering how to measure employee productivity and quality of work from a distance but the key ingredient is trust you may not be able to see what people are doing but you can still equip them with the information that they need assign them tasks and check on them like you always have that gets to the point of good management can happen anywhere since you can't monitor the process in the same way your review will have to be based on outcomes of course there's no reason to believe that in this new environment people won't do the work that they've been assigned remote work has been around for a very long time and today we have the technology not only to do our own work but to also successfully collaborate remotely so as a manager your main job is to heed ernest hemingway's advice quote the best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them the second best practice revolves around strategically communicating with your team this is we actually have several slides in this best practice to share and they primarily relate to setting the tone and figuring out what the appropriate remote work protocols are for your team we shared some information last week this hyperlink about how to communicate effectively if your team is remote is an article that we would recommend anybody take a look at most of these articles are three or four minute reads so they're not super heavy loads but they really do if you want to dive deeper into any of them the resources are there for you to look at you know let me go back just a second I just want to add a little bit to this so when you're setting your tone and create creating your remote work communication protocols be intentional about those but also allow your team to have ownership in those so when you're talking about the tone is set by you so if you are in a frantic state your team's going to be in a frantic state if you were there was a interview last night than the interviewer was just crying the whole time that's going to set a bad tone for everybody as well but at the same time you set the tone this is where leader we're going to get through this this is not the end of the world yes our world is going to change that how do we move forward in a positive light and then creating work communication protocols you need to be honest with ourselves and honest in our leadership and saying there's a good chance that our team members are not all going to be on every day from 8:00 to 4:30 and take that hour lunch like they traditionally work some of them will but you might want to consider allowing that flexibility of hey Jim's going to start at 7:00 and he's going to get done at 4:00 and he's going to still take a lunch at this time and let him sent his parameters there the other thing that is you is a very verbal about and asking all of us as people who are leading teams at Illinois is to take your time if you want to take a vacation thing take a vacation day you might need a mental health day you might need a sick day be sure you take that time and support your team in that environment of it's okay we're all going to be okay and it is okay but if you want to take again I have Jennifer's on my team that Jennifer wants to take a vacation day and spend today is beautiful and sunny outside with her kids set that up and take that that doesn't mean the work doesn't get done that doesn't mean that we don't have deadlines we have to meet that doesn't mean that the expectations are changed but allowed that flexibility in the time that you would if they were in the office because you'd still be allowed to take that time sorry go ahead now Jennifer perfect thanks Damian it's a great set up for the next couple of slides so you know as as Amy just did as a great leader and manager and as she referenced Governor Pritzker doing yesterday being a great manager means you're also you also need to be a great communicator so this slide is just a little storytelling reminder of how great communication is at the heart of leading people and bringing them along with you in a joint effort so this is a picture of Joshua Chamberlain he was a Union Civil War colonel he was marching through Virginia his troops you know weak and devastated and when he got the good news that he was going to get more men but it turns out that those men were Confederate Army mutineers and his choices boiled down to two he could shoot them or he could persuade them so um the photo on the right is probably a little hard to read but it's a breakdown of his message and it's a reminder of the structuring your message to bring people along with you and some of those things that are probably hard to read or I felt like just as Amy mentioned I hold the stick I hold the ultimate stick but I need you and our case is just and we are joined together the challenge is critical and I value your shifts your support these are messages where you as a leader can really set the tone and if that example feels a little out to date here this snapshot of a speech that Lou Gerstner who is the former IBM CEO gave when IBM acquired Lotus so this was the speech he gave to those Lotus employees and the the critical message here is that if you're appealing for support of your group sharing your message and sharing the objectives of your your mission is is really critical and that kind of gets to like what's your message you know what's the the message that you're sharing with your team so we're since we're already in our third week of working remotely you may have already done many of these things but if you haven't this is just a quick reminder to put setting the tone at the forefront of your mind these are just some great examples from get your virtual team off to a fast start and it's an article and Harvard Business Review and it's you know this is this script which I'm not going to read basically follows the Joshua Chamberlain script it follows the Gerstner script it's you know we're in a different world we don't know how long it's gonna last you know we need to I need to find out what you need how are we gonna change our work plans how are we going to communicate those kind of things but those those are choices that you get to make as a leader going forward and the unusual upside down time that we're in right now so the next couple are still in that best practice of strategically communicating with your team this is a quick slide that basically is suggesting that you may want to create kind of a team charter or a sort of a rules of engagement for how you want to communicate what kind of tools you want to use to communicate and how you're going to be able to do this without being able to just literally walk into your colleagues office or your staff members office and be able to have that kind of face-to-face time taking a pause think about how to clearly convey communication norms can really make a difference in sort of how smoothly your team is working in this remote space this is also a great place to use humor because there are a lot of opportunities that seem common sense to to us as leaders to us as managers and to those individuals who are driven in the field and then there are also some things that we just want to kind of point out if you start a Netflix series and you think oh I'm just going to watch this on my lunch hour and you watch more than one show or you you know you get sucked in you need to take that time or acknowledge that time you are at work it's the same thing if you were sitting at your desk what is appropriate what is inappropriate and you need to outline those things with your team if you get called away and you need to help your son with homework and you're going to make those hours up later you're going to get that directed done because the the crux of it all is yes the world is upside-down and yes we are all in this together and yes there is a lot to do but there is still things that we have to get done we have a lot of clients that still need service and that is actually booming right now we have a lot of individuals who are just as scared and challenged and struggling with technology as we are so how do we help them get through this and so when communicating with your team again be empathetic but also lay those ground rules down you don't use email to discuss sensitive interpersonal issues don't be complaining about co-workers over email things of that nature even though you are not sitting you know what you would wheel your chair out into your cube farm to do don't be doing over email or maybe do over a different platform that's not your your work email because that's not really effective use of that time but being sure that you are again enough that's important as the leadership setting those goals what are we going to get done how are we going to get it done and then I'm going to be flexible but I'm still going to hold you accountable it is a balance and it's something that you had to work at when you when you got to see them every day but you also have to work at now how many touch points I have with each of your people things of that nature sorry I get spent a lot of research on this so go ahead Zephir Amy that's exactly right and this is this is where so you as a manager instead of waiting to get inundated by emails from your staff and be upset by it this is your opportunity to be proactive to give your staff a sense of how how the team how you expect the team to be communicating and I'm just gonna I'm circling you know this fourth one right here about us expected tonight respond to requests you know this is a pretty simple tip but when you know say those of us who have children underfoot who are trying to do remote learning and especially anybody that has pre-k or elementary where they actually need they may need our time as parents well this is where you can let your staff know like hey I know you need flexibility during the day but you may be working this evening let me know when you can respond these are the things that instead of waiting for things to go haywire just a little bit of upfront proactive thinking can really make a difference and I'm gonna um just in the interest of time just kind of go through these next ones very rapidly what this is is basically a typology of the remote work communication tools that are at our disposal right so these are the types of things it's email chat programs we're gonna get into this in a minute the video chat and video meeting tools voice over Internet is one way to use Wi-Fi if people don't want to use their cell plans to be on calls like this which I know is an issue the project management tools we went through those last week and we'll show the tip sheet in just a minute and then for those of you that are figuring out how to deliver services right now there are so many amazing easy platforms to make short videos if you need to make a short video of how to reach the case managers and you local workforce area there are ways to do these short videos remotely and have them posted to your websites so this is just a type of knowledge I just want to add one other thing we are going to do from the survey from last week there's a lot of requests for information on how to contact clients and customers and students and we're going to have a webinar on those resources how to use how to use the remind app to assist you in contacting your clients customers and students and in addition to that as you were saying I think we should add tick-tock and YouTube into that because that if you want those shorts nice snippets of video those would be some nice ways to use tick-tock for good and educational purposes which it can be achieved they're both tick-tock in YouTube just for those of you that don't know remind is a text nudging tool and maybe we when we get to that webinar we'll make sure that those tools have this kind of typology slide and this slide is not necessarily the typology but it's really about understanding what's the tool when to use it and how to use it and some sort of some you know this is what it's best for some considerations for how to use I'm not gonna an interest of time I'm not gonna go through this one but just know that this is a resource for you that's embedded in the document again this is something where the content is literally cut and pasted from five ways to improve your communication and virtual teams it's from MIT Sloan manager review this I'm not gonna even read this since it's so dense but this is a resource for you to take a look at about how you want to structure and be proactive as a manager in creating that remote work communications protocol so the third best practice that we want to share is about creating some agreements on guidelines for remote work you're probably gonna notice that some of these best practices sort of overlap and blend into one another but they're important to pull out because of some of the distinguishing pieces so um just like you might want to have some rules of engagement for communication with your team you may want to think about a remote mission statement that your team wants to create or you want to create that reiterates the common vision things like the goals transparency and trust most likely your organization's already have HR policy handbooks in place you may want to either with your HR department or within your own team think about a remote code of conducts conduct so everyone is on the same page Amy eluded that to that just a minute ago but some of the things that could be in that lines for remote work for your team are articulating your values in the mission figuring out what the touch point meetings look like and how to have those established structured check-ins and also what the Freak what frequency makes sense for you as a manager and for your team how to deal with sorry how to set the tone for expected behaviors that's goes right to Amy's comment about you know you get sucked into Netflix well you need to let your manager know like I took two hours out of my day and I'm gonna make it up a different time but some of these things if you if you don't articulate them in a proactive way they could come back and sort of cause problems later same thing for unexpected behaviors how staff can report problems to you right now some type of statement about how you're gonna take care of each other during this time it's it's really it's already happening in terms of people that we know personally that are being affected by Coe bid and people that are passing away so thinking about you know how you're going to take care of the team and what kind of things you want to say up front so the fourth best practice is around creating a virtual work plan that works with your team structure as Amy alluded to earlier many of the things that we had on deck to work on are no longer as relevant or applicable and you know are being canceled or restructured in different ways so this is an opportunity to really sit down and work with your team to figure out you know do you do you have a team that's that's in multiple places multiple states do you have a small team a large team you know the type of team will also require different strategies for how to revise that work plan we really just like we did last week we encourage everybody to focus on what you and your team can do what can be reprioritized during this time there may be things that have been in a parking lot that may be more conducive to remote work or something that's a tech upgrade that you and your team could work on and then just really creating scenarios and contingencies for immediate term and longer term goals activities and outcomes I do want to say a little bit extra here all of you are in different places and looking at your team structure that is very different and I'm going to speak a little bit to mine because that's the one I know the best so on my team I have people who are in more of a leader a co leadership role or they have directives and they have work that they will be able to sustain whether they are in the office or at home I had a conversation earlier today with an individual and he even said the end of the structure of my work hasn't really changed it's just the location of the work because I can still do everything I needed to do I just AM now doing it from my home that is the case for many of us but there's a lot of places and a lot of individuals who their primary job was something that had to do with contact with our customers clients or students their primary job was possibly answering phones or completing registrations so how do you a identify the strengths of those team members and making sure that we're utilizing their strengths and then also work with them individually to say what are some upscaling that we can do for you and when this world does look right side up again that you'll have those extra skills you don't want anyone sitting twiddling their thumbs to use my grandmother's term and just not having ample stuff to do and you also don't want them watching Netflix you can watch Taylor on whatever but watching something of that nature streaming a video during during work hours so how do we focus on up I got ahead of myself again assessing the strengths and weaknesses and then also looking at how we can better assist our teams and doing that you're also going to have a challenge of managing up so a lot of us are in triage right now I know a lot of us have either had our programs paused they're going to be starting up all at virtua or we're looking at how do we serve our clients or we have an influx of employees coming into our system wanting assistance wanting things like that so some of us are just in triage we have to live in the moment now and that's part of your job as a leader to the print depend and decide who is in triage and has way too much to do and how can I help that person by kind of delegating out into the members of my team who possibly didn't have that responsibility before but maybe need that responsibility now I understand that unions are an issue in Illinois I'm not going to get into that but I do think when you look at your team structure independently what are those upskilling areas that you have and what are those areas that you know how do you help people manage through this time absolutely and this is where no no you're right on track and this is exactly where you know revising I'm gonna go back for one second you know revising a work plan has everything to do with assessing your staffs strengths and weaknesses and the reason why we use the the football-like playbook icon here is that a play the success of a play is only as good as the players and like each player knowing what they're supposed to do to move that ball down the field and so this is where marrying like thinking about how to revise a work plan has to be paired with that question that's in the center of the slide what can I do to make sure that this sudden and quick transition is working for you this is also a time where we need as leaders to be encouraging our colleagues and staffs and even our bosses to be problem analyzers but also be solution creators right so figuring out how you are going to empower your team to come up with the answers to the questions that they have or you have and really engaging them and asking them how they think you could do the work differently so Amy alluded to the fact that the center was hosting the we owe a summit at end of April and the entire thing is not about oh it's not gonna happen it's how can we make this happen in a different environment and how can we make sure that the content and the learning is as good as we can make it but in a different in a different space so the the the sixth best practice here is about making the work visible and creating some clear measures of productivity just as I was mentioning a couple slides ago you don't want to get into a situation where you as a manager have let six weeks go by and and then you're you're barking and employees to say what have you done what have you done this is a time where you can press pause as a leader spend a little bit of time and think about like how can I measure my staffs work in a reasonable basic clear and simple way so touchpoints are an excellent example like using those and figuring out the frequency and the cadence making sure that your team knows how their performance will be measured and what your expectations are during this time thinking about the key indicators of success in those job descriptions or responsibilities and thinking about what the right metrics are this could be like sharing work plans or mini weekly reports or group meetings the touch point meetings one of my favorite tricks that I shared last we in last week's webinar as someone who's done consulting for 10 years is that I use my calendar to time block and that time blocking and using your calendar to signal to your colleagues and your your employees whether you're managing up or managing down is another way to kind of have a metric for the work that you're doing so for instance normally we just use our calendars when we have an out-of-office meeting or we have a phone call using your calendars remotely in this in this time of virtual collaboration you can signal when you're going to answer emails when you're going to try and do some phone calls when you need to write something and you can use your calendar as a way to do that and ask your staff to do that so that you have their calendars as a dashboard to you about what what they're working on and just the final point here is that the time worked or time logged is not necessarily a very useful measure of work accomplished in this remote environment and there's some great resources I highly recommend the three links Fast Company links at the bottom if you want to learn more this meeting I'm not gonna I'm sorry this slide I'm not gonna go into in detail but these are types this is another typology of the types of meetings and check-ins that you could do during this time I'm just gonna emphasize the last bullet point here about making sure you know when your team is working but allowing for that flexibility it is essential for parents who have small kids at home right now that they may be working from you know 6:00 in the morning to 8:00 and taking a break to get breakfast and get kids going and then coming back and working from 10:00 to 12:00 and then a lunch break and then you know 12:00 - you know who knows what it is but it's really important to allow that flexibility in thinking about how you're checking in with people I just want sorry can I say one more thing about the left side depending on to your team a depending on your team structure depending on your environment depends on how often you need those touch points State Farm for example has Huddle's and I have members of my team who had previously worked as they are and they had morning huddle so everybody comes together and they have a huddle and their team moves forward each day that's great for them within my structure we have weekly meetings with our whole staff and and I have weekly individual touch points with each of the members of my team it really depends on what fits your needs so we're not saying that there's a right or a wrong we are saying that as needed at some time you do need to be touching base with not every member of your kid with everybody where you can whether that be through a staff meeting what do you zoom GoToMeeting or WebEx - really gay for them but we encourage you to touch point with everybody but it doesn't you don't have to do it every day maybe every week also a lot of your institutions are going to be providing guidance on this same thing with HR I'm looking at what what your touch points need to look like how do you need to document those touch points to look at that and see some guidance from HR on that and also I'm going to move into addressing technology issues because keep in mind that we are all working from home we were all issued I'm guessing laptops I don't think image of their desktop home with them but I'm aware of but that is still state equipment and so all of those rules and regulations that pertain to you and you sat in the office still pertain to you in remote at work so be aware as not only the leader but also make your team aware and again that's another place to use humor that they're not to be shopping and doing all these other things one of the things that we found there's a big move I know do-it has been overwhelmed with the amount of tech support that they've needed to provide ISU has worked on encrypting all of our computers it's a crypt encrypting from afar so when we're doing our updates they're getting encrypted but again that's adding some additional technology aspects to it that we didn't have before I was actually fortunate because I worked from home one day a week and so my computer we've had a few little issues with encrypting but nothing nothing huge but keep that in mind that the individuals who you're managing are still at work when they're using that equipment I'm just going to take the rest of the fee mindful of first-time remote workers it is a challenge for many employees especially those who are working from home for the first time to stay close to communication with your remote workers and make sure they have the tools they need a lot of us left in a hurry from the office and now we're more on a lockdown status so did they bring home their earbuds did they bring home their big-screen things of that nature and if they need those things do you have mechanisms in place to allow them to know how they can get back at the office to get that information or get those forms of Technology again how did make sure they have access to what they need to work security protocols from your organization's the encryption for me I got to talk with our IT guy every day for the last two weeks in the morning because they had done a bit Locker on my computer and the only person who received the access key for that was Sam at college event now Sam's a great guy and we had a standing 7:15 call every morning which was lovely but a lot of people don't necessarily want to be doing that and so looking at your technology and how your technology is being rolled out and that encryption or that BitLocker codes or how whatever we're doing to secure because now the whole world is upside-down the whole world is now virtual looking at downloading software some of the things that we've talked about you might have restrictions in your area from using and if you do I encourage you not to violate overrides and be sure that you know who the administrator on your machines are and then asking your staff what do they need in order to do the work that we're expecting them to do do they have what they need and again always and I know we've talked a lot about kids but there's also often times other individuals in the home as well there's many reports of people who back in March said hey mom and dad you kind of stay with us so we can keep an eye on you so we know where you are so we know that you're not lonely in your own home and those things are happening so you there is just a change in the whole way in which all of us are doing and moving through the world thanks Amy um in the interest of time I'm gonna start moving a little faster through some of these slides again they're embedded with lots of links that you can go back to and look at later but the the seventh I'm sorry the eighth best practice is about having everybody brush up on their technical skills this is a really good time to to think about how to become more proficient in some of the things that we went over a week ago and I'm gonna run through a few of them in more detail in a second this is also a time where you could think about different people on your team that could be the the person who's delegated to learn the new skill be the resident expert and then help teach others that each one teach one and again I mentioned before like be a proactive solution finder not just a problem identifier and encourage your staff to do the same especially related to brushing up on their technology skills just a few things to share that we shared a week ago we went into more detail on these five essentials for technologies for facilitating remote work essentially they're the office essentials file sharing platforms virtual meeting platforms instant chat instant messaging and chat platforms and broader project management platforms this tip sheet this two-page tip sheet is on the ICS PS website it has hyperlinks that you see in blue those hyperlinks take you directly to those platforms tutorial programs many of them are video based some are both in English and Spanish or they're downloadable PDFs so that you can train yourself how to use them just another reminder from something that we shared last week these five major corporations are have free or low-cost platinum access right now log me in is what we're using right now it's the parent company of GoToWebinar zooom Google suite Microsoft 365 which is the host for Microsoft teams and Cisco WebEx similarly this is a great link high-speed internet calm has some information you can put in based on your area where there may be free or low-cost internet so this is just another resource that we shared last week that we wanted to mention again similarly this is these are the four major virtual meeting platforms we wanted to go into a little bit more before the end of this webinar on some best practices for virtual meetings these are the links that you see at the bottom about virtual off sites that work and what it takes to run a great virtual meeting are two terrific resources at Harvard Business Review essentially the best practices for virtual meetings are not that dissimilar from any kind of meeting that you would have make sure that attendees have the tools that they need have purpose statements participant lists agendas making sure that everyone knows how to use the technology thinking carefully about the flow and perhaps doing a quick dry run doing practices especially with technology is a good idea assigning clear roles for people that will be speaking setting the ground rules right up front really trying for interactivity this is another place where we can all be improving our skill set and using the technology tools like polling and chat you can even do breakouts on virtual calls so as more conferences that have been planned for the spring and summer of 2020 go virtual there will be ways that people will have probably a panel and have breakouts that are all going to be virtual embrace the bumps and the weirdness it's gonna happen and remember not to go too long you're gonna probably find that virtual meetings can be shorter than the in-person ones to other kind of tips and tricks for virtual meetings this is literally cut and paste right out of slacks ultimate guide to remote meetings set an agenda and agree on the guidelines right so this just goes into a little bit more detail on that first bullet point that I shared from the previous slide and this is also from the ultimate guide from slack and it's the etiquette it's the must do's for online meetings introduce people when you can give everyone a chance to contribute especially if you're on video don't be doing something else try not to interrupt people when they're speaking to the best that you can make sure you're testing the technology have people come prepared that's that's something that should happen four four good meanings anyway but just because we're meeting virtually doesn't mean that you know you can slack off and sort of not come ready for a meeting but these are just some attic it must do is for virtual meetings again this is content straight out of the New York Times I think it was just a couple days ago some other do's and don'ts and I am NOT going to read this in the interest of time but the hyperlink is here and these are the basic messages from that article same thing for this one this was a New York Times article about the tech headaches of working from home and how to remedy them there's some really good pointers here I highly encourage people to take a look at this link but most of our common work from home tech issues are the ones that slow down our productivity it's those internet connections the low quality of the video calls the software and those can lead to you know not feeling as productive as as you wish you were if you're having any of those problems take a look at this article it has some really interesting ways to kind of work through them Amy and I are not gonna be able to answer detailed in the weeds tech questions but hopefully you've got some IT people in your organization or you can do some DIY solution finding through articles like this the other piece that we wanted to drill down a little deeper than we did last week is on instant messaging my message last week was don't jump too fast to trying lots of different things or pushing lots of different things out to your staffs before you kind of figured out what works the best yourself as a leader you know the middle bullet point here rather than starting from scratch with an instant messaging system you may want to think about what you already have within your organization for instance you know just as Amy mentioned before none of us were really were proficient or using Microsoft teams it was kind of like oh it's this new thing that's in office 365 but no one was using it but we had it so we are choosing to use Microsoft teams instead of a different platform like slack or jabber which is the cisco program definitely go back to those ground rules about the communication protocols as we were talking about earlier and be careful with instant messaging I'm pretty sure instant messaging is FOIA double so you and same thing for open you know Open Meetings Act and Freedom of Information especially if you're a state employee or any type of public employee any of those messages could be FOIA material and so make sure that you're not too informal and be careful about messages that people might take the wrong way so that's the only downside but instant messaging can really help stem the flow of emails into your Inbox again but I need to say I do feel I need to say I encourage you to use humor but do understand that sarcasm sarcasm does not translate often in email or in messaging so be very cautious of using sarcasm using humor is one thing using sarcasm just bring a whole different level with it and you want to be sure that you're not being taken as being inconsiderate or not empathetic or a jerk because you're using dark so just just a little note there use humor but be be wary of sarcasm sorry thought that was needed Amy do you want to keep going with the next three that are about maintaining the sense of culture and comadre this is our best practice yeah our last best practice again maintaining that sense of culture and commader ii you may need to over communicate during this time you may need to have more calls with individuals more touch points than what you would in a standard office in the virtual office and that would be needed one of the things I caution you to of not doing is we're always going to be held accountable for the work for completing during this time don't over don't create busy work for your team especially if you have a team like mine that's very diverse some of us are in triage mode some of us are working on things that we've been working on and we were you know Jennifer's in a virtual employee for a whole time with me and other people are you know maybe seeking out things to do and going to be working on their strengths and doing more editing for documents things of that nature but don't just create busy work create something that's really going to be meaningful to your organization meaningful to your team to move those things forward also encourage them of emotional support we do not know what everyone is going through but I promise you if 240 thousand Americans die from coded xix every single one of us will be impacted in some way shape or form we are already being impacted by the way in which we interact by the fact that we are now on a virtual platform permanently for a little bit and just being working in our homes so offer encouragement offer emotional support ask people how they're doing encourage people to breathe as you get on to a meeting let's all take a breath with all you know refocus this is what we're here for now provide opportunities for remote social interaction again looking at ways you can see each other I made a point this week that our staff meeting I wanted to see every face and then my internet went down so I had a call in so that was kind of a faux pas on my part but it was really good to see people and and that is healthy for all of us thank you sir you want me to do this one you can't your um suit this is this is just a you know your staff needs you it's it's a deeper slide on that point there are some pieces here from last week that we wanted to share again and some really excellent resources at the bottom if you want to drill down but um you know your employees are looking to you for cues and for how to handle different crises that are gonna come up so don't forget um that they they may need you more emotionally psychologically than they have need to do professionally during this time and don't neglect the other ways that people might need to connect we made this point last week as well just like people are doing the virtual happy hours like there's the virtual water coolers make sure that um as Amy mentioned like their time for humor there's time for some personal sharing and that you can really make sure that just because we're so physically social distancing ourselves that were not metaphysically social distancing ourselves again some fantastic resources down on the bottom if you want to drill down even further um in a final point that we shared last week is that it's so important to be kind to yourself during this time and be kind to your staff I mean we started with the message on empathy and we're gonna end with the message on empathy that with so many people working from home the bottom line is we probably won't be as productive as we're used to being to minimize frustration it's important to reset your expectations around what productivity looks like all productivity doesn't go out the window but we you do need to be flexible and adapt that was a great quote from a freelance writer from Oprah's magazine that we thought was very resonant here Amy I think we we're not gonna have much time for questions should we should we skip the questions and show the resources for next week and what else is this and the deck actually most of the questions have been where to find the resources which they'll show you that information can you're just a couple quick things you will get an email tomorrow it will have the video of this webinar it will have the PowerPoint as a PDF with hyperlinks of this webinar it will have any resources that we touched on today and it will also be on our page as the virtual thready in the virtual work place all of these materials are also shared on work nets so they are spent to working out and those should be up on their work net on what archive webinar sites so you have two places where you can find this information future webinars we have bring your best self to the virtual work place is next Wednesday so join us for that that is going to be a focus on self care and mental health and how do we create that balance between work and home when we're working in our home and productivity and / and productivity yes how did he keep produce productive when you know we're in our pajamas if we are in our pajamas in addition to that there is going to be a webinar on April 22nd or on the remind app and other tools that you can use for your clients and students I'll also send out some resources because there's other partners that are been doing those webinars already you can register an IC SPS for all of that and then I have been asked to make a public service announcement that the princess is being conducted and because of the Cova 19 we do not have a lot of people going outdoor store for the census so please go online and complete your census so thank you to the individual who asked that I say that because yes there's your PSA for the day and I'll turn it back over q4 resources yep just finally wanted to make sure that when you get this document you can see at the very end there are hyperlinks if you want to some of these many of the hyperlinks are embedded in the actual slide for citation reasons but some of the things that are not we're not directly cited in any of the slides can be accessed here so those are just a click away these are some resources if you really want to drill down further for instance I mentioned the beginning you can sign up at Harvard Business Review org and get a daily management tip of the day most of these companies so I know McKinsey I think Forbes which isn't on here and Harvard Business Review I think the MIT Sloan are all putting down their pay walls so it's a great time to use some of these business resources that you may not normally have you know on your reading list because they're free right now and then I don't know this might be a fun way to end but these are two very funny videos a conference call in real life and a video conference in real life of all the things that could go wrong and we thought it was a fun thing to share we also shared it last week but if you have three minutes and you need a laugh or need a break during the day these are great these are great links Amy I'm going to turn it back to you okay thank you all for your attendance today we are here to support you if you do have questions there are things that we're not covering that you'd really like to see I will share out that survey again this week that will come with the material tomorrow and we look forward to hearing from you and hope you are doing well hope you are staying safe hope you are washing your hands and we wish you well have a great afternoon thank you thanks everyone
