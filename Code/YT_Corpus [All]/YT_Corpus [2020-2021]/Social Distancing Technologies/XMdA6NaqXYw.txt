 [Music] good morning and good afternoon welcome to the second series of leadership and uncertainty my name is Manish Waldo I'm the founder of Humanity in business quickly bit about me humanity business has been around for seven hard years very passionate about leadership and what leadership looks like what we do is basically do lots of events but that's been disrupted now so we focused on going online but also our events are more focused on collaborating as well with the not for profit sector which is the other side of the business where we look at bringing together corporate executives and charities to work on projects together to foster collaboration and shared value and we're also partnering with community it was the online platform that enables us to do that but today is really all about leadership and these series are taking us kind of back to where I began which was all sorts of leadership conversations with senior leaders as well as senior thought leaders in this space so without further ado I'm going to jump in and introduce Alan Ryan who's a bit of a legend when it comes to innovation and collaboration he's been doing innovation collaboration for quite a long time and probably working with pretty much all the corporates out there if for Microsoft as well as other tech companies so I want a quick fast track and get Ellen to tell us a bit more about himself and tell us your story Alan welcome to the show okay thank you Manisha it's a pleasure to be here and I look forward to sharing some of our data that we've actually collected and I think because we started a little bit late I just died straight in and introduced myself and done up and get share my screen and I'll just do a very short little presentation and then we'll growth it up do some questions and discussion answers yep so I'm talking about social distancing for silos which is what's happening out is covered period the very first thing I'd like to do though is to acknowledge from the country and I'd like to begin by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land on which we meet today and I'd like to pay my respects to elder's past and present and this is even more important because this week we've had a really good example of leadership and uncertainty which is the topic of your series and this is a lovely quote from Reverend bill Lawson the funeral of George Floyd this week and he said is this going to be just like many other movements a moment of anger and rage then back to business as usual the reason why this is a very powerful quote is because he posed a question as a leader and he posed the question to the audience he didn't rage and he didn't read into demand things he posed the question to get people to think and I think this is the key message in funds uncertainty is that leaders have to pose a question and it's the different question so what we've been through in the last month has been this common experience and so we've done a lot of research as to what the precoded experience was what the covert experience is and what postcode will be like which is the uncertainty facing the future and what I'm to share is some data around different types of measurements that we'll be making so the first data is around telephone calls and what we found is on a standard day telephone calls started around nine o'clock they continued during the day they drop off around three or four five by two or three o'clock and you can see every hour where the telephones are being used for meetings you know during Colvin it was nine o'clock to five o'clock banked calls everybody was on calls all the time well now what we're seeing is that Friday afternoon beer o'clock is returning and the calls are dropping from about two o'clock in the afternoon okay and so what we're actually see is that people are becoming comfortable with remote work and people are actually liking it and just going back to normal so that's one piece of data the second piece of data is working with Microsoft and a company called super Linux we analyzed 55,000 teams using Microsoft teams and how they used it and it was exactly the same experience before the code had hit they had a certain level looking directive on Microsoft teams when Kovac in the middle of March it went flat out to a very high level and then now it's dropped back to a normal level people are getting used to this new way of working correctly but new things are happening that really want to send a message number one the number of teams on Microsoft teams is increasing but their autonomous teams their teams that are working within their own team they're not working across the business so silos are building inside companies using these electronic sharing whether it's Microsoft teams or Yemen or slack or or workplace but the most powerful bit of information we have comes from a customer experience coming over this comment period there was a major customer experience in the finance sector the retail sector and the healthcare sector on average the most powerful message is that customer experience did not change the amount of the level of customer experience and everyone's had an infamous for a scale of 1 to 10 would you promote would you recommend this business it did not change over that period what the average student what did change and this is the powerful message for leadership is the standard deviation of the scores of four kovin was small and very tight around the mean the standard deviation during code dramatically increased and so we have very very happy customers that were happy with what was going a little brighter and very very unhappy customers and this shows that what organizations where you have customer facing teams has to realize is their customers very very diverse more diverse than ever had before they're very very happy or very very young and so that's happening now the interesting thing for leaders is that now that we're entering the post-cold period it has not changed right and we expect and we predict and Here I am with my crystal ball ammunition so we can work with it we predict that this won't change for you or more because we just about to go through four majors shop which is child care is not going to be free anymore then job keeper is going to stop job keeper job seeker then banks are going to stop the motor naman much interest on homeowner payments and then it's going to be an awful lot of organizations doing retrenchments and resizing as the volume comes through as the fact they realized in this new world not selling what they do so there's going to be a significant disruption to companies in employment and this is going to take six to twelve months to flow through and at that time consumers will be completely happy or or thing on one hand or completely unhappy and we predict that what's going to that means for organizations that deal and selling product to consumers obviously is that you'll have a very very high chance of losing your customers because if look the change can happen and they'll leave and it also gives organizations are very very high chance of getting new customers right because what the current experiences things are people saying that we had five years of change in five weeks you've heard that reported many places what we see is that is that people are actually quite comfortably change and we we don't know this that I predict that if you had a problem with your bank for four kovin you put up with it and say our changing banks is too hard if you have a problem with your bank host coded you'll say I'm going to change changes are hard I can do change I'm gonna change and so the big message that we're seeing for organizations with customer facing teens and the big tension with customer facing teams is that the customers are very very good this you know hyper stressed or hyper happy and the Kings mainly becoming more like silos working internally and sorry I can't get the slides up but we have the dark behind this that's saying there actually wasn't very well as teens when they're coordinating and they're communicating and they're collaborating but they're not collaborating and for a leader facing uncertainty in yo t means collaborating and working across teams in order to address uncertainty and so that's the big message that I wanted to share in the first part is presentation yeah so what stuff so I know I guess this is going to be the next pieces like what is the strategies that some of the leaders have to adopt to manage that so first strategy most important strategy is you've got to get the data you've got to know what's happening with your customers you've got to know what's happening with your teams and you've got to look into the daf-2 understand because it really you knew pretty : is not relevant anymore all your customer data all your reports all the things that can be using creek ovid they're not relevant anymore you need to get data post code right now real data in real time and it's interesting because we work with a customer experience company in the retail space enough assuming all of their customers would cancel because the retailer's closed down and what they found is that no customer cancelled getting giving customer data because customer data is like gold data from your team's and pay your teams of working is like all so step number one is you've got to get the data right get the data step number two as a leader is you have to ask good questions like the quote that I had before you have to ask Buddha questions and so one of the key things that we help leaders with is how to understand one of the questions to ask and so let me give you an example we were doing some work sponsored by Microsoft and and a bunch of people around the modern workplace precoded we have a global network of consultants working we collect in a hundred interviews with senior leaders of major organizations like Spotify like Amazon senior leaders Amazon like Google major like commercial organizations like wd-40 we collected a hundred stories yeah we analyzed those stories and and what was the question in the leaders mind before they started their dramatic growth what was the question driving the leader on he asked that he or she asked the organization that got the organization to motivate and to accelerate let's just focus on the questions don't focus on we know how successful some of these like zoom from home we know how successful these organizations are what we have to look at is well what was the question and so what we what we look at when we work with leaders is what are the questions you are asking now this gives a challenge and this is the real challenge I would like to share coming up with questions is really really hard thinking of the right question is really really hard and to come up with lots and lots of questions however when you collect stories and collect questions from lots and lots of different locations you then and we can recreate them into a canvas and leaders these questions on this canvas they can then pick and choose what questions are important to them right then one of the key things about leaders is you know the toughness between being a creative leader and being operational leader and you will leave it that's out there trying to do anything different things or your business as usual when you see a list of a large numbers a list of questions that have driven the most successful companies in the world and then you choose which of those questions are important to you you can then in gay each with the process you firstly but you can also then engage your teens and engage your organization helping you answer those questions just because nobody think copy Google nobody can get the same success that Zuma's had over the period but what was the question in the mind of the people at Zoo when they started designing and building so what was it that actually hooked and drive that go forward so one of the key for leadership uncertainty get it per data get the questions and then the third part is engage your teams because leaders don't do the work anymore teams on the city to work teams are now empowered with all these tools teams are doing the work every day then you have to engage your teams so it goes data questions and teams and let the teams to got the answers and have a team things can deliver to the questions that have been asked that's the sort of things that that's the quick quick summary yeah interesting so so in terms of the question P is a very interesting one for me because I really struggle with questions in a in a big way I'm always an answers guy I jump straight to the answer because I want the bottom line really quickly and so for me a questioning is a big challenge so how do you how do you suggest frame questions what's some of the tips and strategies to actually frame a good question these are some examples you can share on that creating questions is the hardest thing to do creating questions is a how to see to do and yes everybody wants to jump to the answer and they think they've got a good answer and I think oh whereas maybe they've got to spend more time with the question and it reminds me that Donald Rumsfeld quote you know known unknowns and no no unknown knowns known unknowns right hey how can you come up with the right question from your own experience when the world is changing so fast around you you've actually got to come up with questions from other people's experiences what other people have seen and so the big challenge of the leader is a leader can sit at their desk and come up those two questions that they think is important then the leader can go to their senior leadership team and the organization and ask for different set of questions and gather a distance to the questions believe it can then go to the network and their customers and the people that they know and ask a different set of to particular like the different set of questions but what the only way to manage an uncertainty we believe is leaders then have to ask people that they don't know and connecting people that they don't know and find out what questions those people are asking I keep them which is even further out and so this is where the most important thing about about networks and collaboration and reaching out to your networks but not your network your network its network it's not your first connection I'm leaving that's the important it's it's your second connection third connection is important and collect questions from then and so our recommendation is that you don't come up with your own questions you don't sit there and try to be creating your own questions you ask other people and collect questions and we've got a whole series of questions to help you so you can go through our website our grades for a combination under three resources they're all free and you can download some question sets around collaboration and teamwork and these are being collected from leaders so I don't sit down in my team test Julian don't sit down and write these lottery questions we interview leaders we find out how they're thinking right and then we craft the questions that we then show other leaders and so I don't care how creative your ammunition or incredibly creative then I want to be more creative right there are lots of people out there had any experiences faster than us there are lots of people who are at the leading edge of change my firm belief is that we have to connect with them and find out what questions are near dressing and then bring that back into our own organized a mission and not for how they tell us what to do right and not not to them say this is the best view but for they must say how you thought about have you considered have you can have you look back okay and the final point also comes across a little bit innocent and sometimes your customers don't know what these questions are either no none of your customers could predict omit none of your cat or galatians customers keep pretty working from home and so you can't ask your pastor so the best thing to do please ask is to ask your teens ask your connections and then look outside if you really want to manage uncertainty collect questions from what other people are idealistic fascinating so what you're really saying as a leader we need to be kind of aggregators of questions I guess is really what saying terms are really organizing questions and putting it into sense and make sense of this question and putting them into buckets maybe to get clear on are the trends in questions or all the answers come on similar questions on being asked or you have to organize all these questions eventually write some questions and you have to pick the questions that are important to you and the question is it really cool your team and say these questions are important and good leaders hire people that are smarter than themselves in an organization and especially some experts and so would leader collects a lot of questions finds the questions that are important and then gets their team's to answer them you know it's their teams to respond to the questions and so a good leader should not be telling everybody what to do anymore we live in a creative economy and we've got incredibly smart people in organizations and good leaders should be setting the agenda asking the questions and then listening and letting them letting their teams respond and so the critical issue though is what's important to the leader what's important to the organization and yes there may be some chewing inference important but let me share one of the big critical points of leadership and uncertainty is that if you don't do something you've made a decision okay so leadership teams around a table talking about code we're talking about the future it cetera and they want to have a strategy and they want to have plans let me get done if they don't act that's a decision deciding not to act whereas a lot of the leaders in the old world will say that's being crude in their planning and we're being diligent what it means is is that they've decided to wait okay so the biggest challenge facing leaders today is what we call first step first step strategy how does a leader take that first step when they don't know what the second step is on the third step is and so getting leaders to be confident and connected so that they can actually take a first step or a second step is the most important thing that we can help organizations with and we're in the process of we've been doing this for 20 years and what we found with organ up the organization's is that once you get an organization to take the first step and maybe take the first step again they get they understand what they're doing and they can dress up and do it and so where I love working with leaders is actually in that first step how do we get people to take first fit and as especially tough when Komen's around because that meant there's uncertainty right but not taking a step is a decision taking us that so our first step strategy is critical because back in the creek over days it was let's do a claim that's predict for three years let's understand train let's understand that's all there at the window okay a lot of famous name but what it is then is what do I take is my first step right how do I take a first step that's what I really talk to leaders interesting so what you're saying is that the moment you take the first step then you have more data and you have more questions and therefore then you re-evaluate again to take the second step and then you keep iterating on based on their data the question and the Provost I was a third one again data questions end teens teams correct so therefore all the so at every step you start to re-engage with those three points so that you then learn as you go and it's like kind of iterative over time based on every step that you take and with one underlying provider and every step you come back and say what's important to us and this is where shame value comes in and this is we're working with a higher purpose comes in because the biggest risk with each rating and is Lean Startup and this design thinking's a whole bunch of children absolutely fantastic the biggest risk with iterating is you can iterate in your purpose and then hit off in a different direction you can be iterating and giving Clues and going in different direction when your purpose says I want to hit in a straight direction so every time the iterate you have to come back to say what's my what's important yeah what's my North Star what am I trying to achieve here is not nation as a team or an individual so that every iteration goes in that same direction because what we found and there was a piece of research done by a start-up organization where they they researched all Australian startups and which ones were successful in France or not and we know that 95 or 98 similar startups have to fail because that's what's taps ah and what was the difference between startups that were successful and the startups that were successful it wasn't the tools they used that wasn't the activities they be what it was was the fact that the startups were successful had a higher goal had a higher purpose they connected with the consumer in a different way and they kept on that track even though they were iterating they kept on the one clear high-value purpose and that drove the big organizational fault forward whereas a lot of the other startups with iterate features and programs and software and made it nice and pretty and all these sorts of things were incredibly valuable and the customers said ah yeah that's really really nice but they weren't actually delivering higher purpose a stronger than any proposition to your customers that was consistent over time so it's very interesting because I can do the research the research was done by the startup industry and they actually looked at it and said why are startups failing and they can merely predict from day one whether a start-up will be successful or not as to whether that but a very high purpose of their new composition that they're trying to deliver to yeah yeah interesting love to hear a story or an example of how of this in terms of you know the key key areas data questions and teams of any leader or business that you know that's probably used it to great success is there any stories you can share with us yes sir I can't be dealing with a lot of technology companies and so we're winning high grades was started we were dealing place to face and workshops and getting put into a room and then over the the journey we've realized that technology's the main draw so networking a lot of technology companies and technology companies that provide collaboration software and so there was one major telecommunication company that we were dealing for now where the leader is the founder founded the company about 12 years ago the company now employs 500 staff and the company is now growing and it provides voice over IP telephone calls I'm a straight for it and so when and how they hit that particular organization grew 40 percent because the amount of zoom calls and Microsoft 15 calls and meetings just grew 40 percent and this organization then had the problem is that they had to move their teams just completely remote work and grow 40 percent at the same time and if there was a problem they then would stop you wouldn't get a zoom call ok and so the to clear things were number one how to move everybody out of the office in George Street and to be able to work from home for the first time ever that was number one and number two was how did they then track their data to work out where was the best place to put the effort because they only had so many staff they couldn't they couldn't increase their star level when I had a 40% team so what the levy did number one delegated to the leadership team and delegated the different people in the leadership team none of their direct supports was responsible from moving from to move everyone out of the office right another one of the directors reports was responsible for data another one of the direct reports and so by delegating and by allowing the organization to flourish and actually empower and not tell the organization how to look and not tell the organization what to do to actually empower the staff to do it because if the organization itself besides how its kind of work from home then people will be happy and so that's what the leader was doing at the same time they were still doing we're helping them with their strategy going forward and the strategy on sites at the same time they're setting the objectives for the next next number of the next year so the leader in two things number one dealt with the data today by delegation and apparent teens and continues to look to the future as to what the next big step will be and I had a conversation with them and they loved another piece of data I love collecting data and stories after the global financial crisis if you analyze the companies that went through the major companies and concurrently to two buckets bucketz that saw the global financial crisis as an opportunity and to grow and invest in growth and other ones that said financial crisis is a crisis we have to cut costs we have to save money we have hunker down the companies that decided to grow have outperformed the companies that hunker down many times to one and so with that research the leaders then this particularly looked up and said I have to do something correctly I have to do something big involved I have to do something in order to take advantage of this crisis I can't just cut costs and just focus on delivering so how and the big challenge is how do you manage for the day-to-day when your business has grown 40 percent and everybody's working from home for the first time and they have to go out and buy a hundred laptops to get their staff the work at home compared to how do we do a big bold move because that's what the history has told us will make us incredibly successful ok and and covet the share price of this particular country he went from nearly five dollars down to two dollars fifty so the share part are like most companies now the share price is up close to $6 so as the share markets come back so one of the key stories of great leadership is to be able to manage today today and not take your eye off the big picture and it's tough because I'm sitting in their executive team meetings and advising them and helping them and you've got the teams struggling to keep up with 40 percent growth and at the same time the CEO and the company secretaries are talking about which company guy how do we restructure how do we grow how do we spend it with no but some cash to spring ahead and spin and so that's a and it's happening right now today and I think I've got another executive remote off site next week where they're struggling but what they're struggling with which is the most powerful thing is the leader wants to take that first step is not is not going to sit back and wait he's going to say we are going to take the first step we are going to do something opposed to code to be proactive and we're going to continue to do that and so that's that's an experience happening right now and one of the nice things though which I'd like to share in sister remote work has been around for a long time and there's lots of research around remote work and people more productive and it saves money online but it's all quite nice what's happened during this Kovach crisis is that the leaders have had to work remotely in the past with remote work it was work of these and coders and creative people who were working remotely and the leaders came into the office and they never experienced remote work now what's happening is that the leaders themselves are experiencing remote work and they're leading teams remotely and this is a huge huge opportunity because we've actually changed that this crisis has changed the mindset of leaders whether your old leader of your hand finger in the fact that you can understand what remote work is and you can look like and we do apologize to all the people attending that taking technical issues have stopped and we started 10 minutes late and I apologize has munition you know we can't get my powerpoint presentation up because it is won't run through the feet maybe I haven't painting the end enough however however is that these are the challenges that senior leaders have never had all that now they've actually got them and a senior leader sitting at home on and zoom or on Microsoft teams on Skype or any other typical tools and that's one of the other issues that we've discovered is that you can get you can have tip video and calls in a day on ten different systems and they're going to leave different places so the senior leaders realize the power of technology the senior leaders understand what technology can do and as we've said in fact five years of change in five weeks but it's the senior leaders that have actually experienced it and that's going to be a major major thing and it's also like the senior leaders have head zoom calls with their kids running around in the background right and so they've all experienced the exact words so one of the things that we predict is that there will be a new normal I call it the new modern workday because it won't be about workplace anymore it'll be about the work day and you will define your work day and the reason why I use the word modern is that modern is about technology and digital and all that sort of stuff the reason I use the word new is because it's how you actually engage with that technology right that's what's good that's what's gonna separate the successful people from the last successful be yeah correct and I totally get that I think I'm first time senior leaders are grappling with tech issues but they don't have tech support somebody can walk into their office and deal with the tech issues they were of kind of figured out themselves which is quite interesting I'm just curious about the questions guys I'm sure there's some questions that you have you have and I'm curious I'll make sure we check in with you guys if there's anything you'd like to ask from from Alan but until that comes to Alan so in terms of the teaming side of things Alan what do you suggest there in terms of actually leading teams I mean is this how do you how do you prevent or silos from taking place I mean is it simply a constant check-in or what is the leader have to do to ensure the teams are teaming what's you know in this remote sort of siloed operations of people are all separate and and what's happening that's a great question what's happening is that back in the old days you had a team leader and you had a team and I'd be in the office and the team leader would coordinate the team and walk around and have a chapter at 1:00 in the morning we communicate coordinate and get people to cooperate and it's all done by the team leader now we've got these sub organizing teams where everybody in the team has the power to do that everybody in the team so a question for the the ultimate leader is how do you empower teens and make sure that you can actually ensure that the teens are doing the right thing when the teens are so well resource through technology and in different locations we can see what they're doing so when we look at successful collaboration one of the key things is provide a safe environment provide trust to provide belonging and engagement and so leaders have to proactively do it and proactively check in and CRO actively engage with their teams and like everything on technology there are tools and dashboards and you can actually measure because teams don't want to be yelled at anymore teams don't want to be spoken to and he's attending video of the leader talking actually teams are self-organizing teams they want to ask the questions and answer the questions and discuss things and so the most important thing is number one you can is to give the team's technology you can now measure and help the teams use the technology because there's dashboards and things and then the leaders have to check in by as I said at the start asking questions and there is any right and how many times and our audience will sort of remember this how many times have you been in a town-hall meeting back in the old days where a leader would get up and do a big presentation like that's filling out the future strategy of the organization and at the end of the town hall meeting that asked other any questions no questions no questions right because it's really really hard and so now we have to flip it on its head we're the team leader puts up the questions and asks people to help answer them right and so that's one of the key things and I think there the second thing is something that you asked me you said tell me a story I believe his story are we working people right and so what a team leader has to be able to do or a leader has to be able to do is ask their teams for a story and then listen to the story or is the change that maybe you're going to an example we're working with a pharmaceutical company and they had an objective to be one of the best people led companies in Australia and everybody does start engagement scores as understand and and you don't have region is a bell-shaped curve and you want to be higher than built shaped curves just for your staffing gauge when compared to the industry outrage and it's big companies in this day and age and so we were doing a project with them around this first step its strategy a negative start engagement sir today and they got the results and they came as the highest we engaged company in the country with an engagement score of 94 percent right amazing so I mean when I say that people go wow that's nearly possible it's a bell-shaped curve somebody's got to be at the top and someone's gotta be at the bottom is an average in the middle so they were the highest and they then wanted to find out what was the magic that made him the highest so that they could keep that magic and so they and we were helping him on the operational side so we can do the research they point sensitive research and what they found was one factor which was interview culture but it was driven by stories and so they had one method of engaging the start which one of us every year in your performance review you have to tell two stories on how you've helped innovation to happen in the organisation and that simple that simple request which is the most powerful thing you can just imagine you have to tell two stories and you have helped innovation to have not delivered innovation you crave the idea groping the mall just have you help innovation and they asked everybody in the organization and that drive the change of culture okay and so one of the key is stories as you hallo to me leaders have to ask for stories stories we spend a lot of our time interviewing leaders to click their stories to determine think stories are the most powerful tool very powerful there's a couple of questions here some organizations up have lost good workers and leaders how would you create new leaders remotely or how would you create new teams remotely I mean how would you do that you can't you can't meet them so what we suggest there and if I if I had an answer that I could pull out of my pocket and say is the answer to do that I'll be very happy person that is the toughest question which is how do you create leaders so I believe in strength based leadership I believe and you have to understand people's strengths gathered find out what their strengths so never find their strengths it's not about priority it's not whether it is about strengths and so I have not got an answer to that question that's a really really good question there's not a lot of difference between doing it remote been doing it doing it face to face so it is to literally give people the opportunity to number one understand their strengths and number two to apply these friends okay and so this was where this first step strategy piece comes in game is that we're doing a project with a major rural supply house or across Australia they've got teams of people in every every small country town dealing with farmers and they want to develop their their staff and what we're working with leading University is their star don't tell us a story make a story go and create something do something participate in something and tell us the story and so that's and we can analyze the story and understand half of the start or what the starting and the skills are but that's a remote theme so it's it's finding out the strengths in people that don't already happens and then helping you to understand which can be done remotely yeah so it says what have you found to be the best way or platform for the for discussions to take place across different business units especially virtually so you know what sort of I guess it's a more of a hard virtual whiteboard to facilitate these questions so one of the key things about the technology and they're all good so I'll be frank they're all good we did using Microsoft chains or Yammer or slack or workplace by Facebook we love them all they're all fantastic another product for people against protocol mural which is an electronic whiteboard product there's one queen me Road there's a lot of these product there's so many of these technologies out there what we found the issue is then is how people facilitate the technology how people use the technology not which buttons to press etcetera but it's how that people actually connect and actually engage people with the technology so that people are actually using it and getting this is then you have so we've got a lot of research and whenever we're working with a global training organization called Kevin Trager we've got a program called fire box which is how you create a fire inside there locally where we're teaching people how to facilitate online how to actually get the best out of practices and I know today that I'm presenting and we haven't got a two-way conversation going but when we work with the client I would talk 40% of the time when the client go talk to 98% of the time so first thing for for the technologies get yourself the skills to facilitate technology to bring the best out of participants is the biggest message that I can share and we have some free resources on our website around and some free workshops coming up to test this method of how to actually get people to contribute participate and how to get people to get the best value whatever technology sound a d'amato is whatever technology you've got you've got that's fine don't cough and finally use what you've got it the best out of what you've got because most of the technologies we have some really he's not using hmm and in terms of I guess your experience where have you seen the most challenge is it around the questions is it around the teaming side is it around the data side where do you where do you feel is the hardest bit of those three to actually execute to do I know you have to do all three to get there is ideal result but where do you see leaders stumble most and what what if you know what which one is the biggest challenge of the three to actually deliver because the biggest challenge is the urgency challenge that I'm a leader I have to make something happen Alan's telling me to do something and when and if I will make some assumptions and go forward we I'm not saying that you have to rush the biggest challenge is rushing when you don't have enough information that's it so this is a very big tension between rushing and taking a good first step and the biggest issue that I see is leaders making assumptions leaders thinking of the smartest person in the room leaders saying well I know what the answer me so I think what the answer it's like that's the biggest mistake or they've got the data but the leader knows better and I'll give you a lovely experience mushy results were think the famous food company though developing a product that helps people barbecue and was a sauce he marinating very simple very lovely and they had the best consumer feedback they had ever received on any product they ever developed and I would go to the executive team and I was showing the product and asking for the money to get the next step and it was wonderful and how it's just so happy and still the leader said I learned barbecue that way and the products didn't whereas what the leader should have said believe it could have said is you know I'm not in your target market come up come up personally try to solicited it's like I don't barbecue this way so what would make this product right and so as leaders making assumptions leaders thinking in a smartest people in the room but it is not listening and leaders saying I'll put something up so I have you know I want to read or or big ladies wanting to be the winner winter when you compared the team being with that's the biggest issue because we have the tools we have the technology that they have to get the data so they're not investing in data collection and we've just got to do that because we didn't event yesterday we're Microsoft have a major initiative around providing free data services to not-for-profits and it's the most exciting thing I've seen where they're actually giving people giving not-for-profits access to a common data warehouse is like that because everybody knows that the futures can be good around data and not data it takes a month or two months or five months for you to get on annual with you it's done you can get you read out every juror so assumptions is the biggest issue and and I think there's a level of humility there which is so important isn't there I think to be able to ask those questions and also have that mindset of you know I don't really know anything or I don't not know anything but I don't know everything and I think that humility is probably one of the things that comes to mind is that how many leaders actually embodied the idea of humility within their leadership I couldn't I couldn't agree more and the humility is also how can they hire people that are smarter from selves highly motivated people that smart themselves because to be successful the team's have to be smarter than the leaders and so his humility is absolutely an important characteristic of leader and not just the CEO the team leader the general manager the middle manager so what's happened at the moment is because the release off for me teams you think Microsoft or slack or workplace the middle management round is changing because pre-code that we've organized a shion's year since the boss that wanted to change the world all the people on the front line whatever change the world but the little management what's called the molasses in the middle or the middle just now that's changed now the people on the front line can be in teams and get things done and so it's been a total change and so it's the humility of the biggest boss and middle sized boss and the people inside the team's to other people however the always underpin it with paint what is important to us keep coming back to that because you have to align every team to a common purpose you have to align every team to head in a common direction and the way you do that is by continually asking the question what is important to us what is important to our customers what is important to our company what is important to our organization or team that's the underpinning message any message from today is the messages is a set of data questions teams and focus on your North Star which is what is important and everything has to be compared to what is important to us yeah absolutely great great words of wisdom
