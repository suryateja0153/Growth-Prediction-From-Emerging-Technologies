 [Music] by 2023 more than seventy two million connected cars will be sold across the globe triple the amount recorded in 2015 while consumers are attracted to the convenience afforded by new technologies advocates in the accessibility community are raising concerns hello welcome to Comcast newsmakers I'm Ellie PI Hong joining me to discuss how new tech impacts the accessibility community is Eric Hika director of public relations for TDI telecommunications for the deaf and hard of hearing incorporated and his interpreter Adriana Featherstone thank you so much for being here thank you for having me here today you know hearing about all the technical technological advances happening today it must be such an exciting time for the disabled community to think about all the possibilities yeah I would agree with you I think it's wonderful with the technology technological advancements it gives people who are disabled an opportunity to participate with the greater community at large one of the advancements that I know that you guys are very excited about our self-driving cars right exactly so I think I'm really looking forward to that because I think it would give other people with disabilities for instance people who use wheelchairs or blind people more independence or ability to travel or to be able to be self drivers they could just get into the car and take and go so it's just wonderful but it's not as simple as that there are some issues that arise with having those technological advancements right so with the issue of how the car would be able to communicate with the drivers so to speak so people want to make sure that they're if they're tactile and you know with wheelchairs just making sure that they have enough space and mobility in the car so they could be seated comfortably and move about but for deaf people how they'll be able to communicate with you know the driver in the car if it's spoken or if there's an operator that's remote or they're remote from the car so I would assume that captioning would be a huge component to addressing that issue well you would assume that but it really depends on the makers of the vehicle whether or not they think about that accessibility feature and that's really one of the challenges with technology because the people who are the developers sometimes they forget about the fact that they need to think of this these people this group of people and some companies are very good with inclusion just like our company TDI but we can help counsel them and advise them for their technology just to make sure it's accessible for everyone in general and sometimes those unintended consequences can be quite tragic right yes so one a good example of that is like the fob so with the keyless fobs that they have then the keyless ignitions there's been so many people that are driving they're accustomed to just putting their key in the car and going in and just hanging their key on the hook and you know the thing is with the fob is that you still kind of have this thing that's there but the car and the engine itself can still be running so people are really in the habit of having that key and knowing that the key is used to turn the car off but that's not so with the fob so the car is still running and you know there's about 20 deaf and hard-of-hearing people who have actually died within the five year span from carbon monoxide poisoning because they put the car in the garage and it's still running the smoke and everything the carbon monoxide goes into the house and there they die in their sleep but car manufacturers are responding in terms of trying to come up with something to make sure that doesn't happen again right so they're aware of it and they know it and we've already brought it up and this is going to think since 2009 but it's not just deaf and hard-of-hearing people that it affects but it can affect hearing people as well so the thing is is that it's just the technology is changing and they're really not including disability people people who are disabled within that so they have it they have to retrofit their technology and so how they're able to do that it's still a work in progress so we're really trying to work with them obviously that would be a reactive approach to something that's happened but you really want the tech community to be more proactive in terms of the research yeah right and so with automated vehicles I know that there's one bini that's truly inclusion including the disability of disability organizations and they're working with us and people who are deafblind and making sure that the automated vehicles are actually including all of these features because they're thinking of us before we actually go ahead and start building that that car so that's wonderful that we're able to have that involvement in the build up process of the new technology and so that's where we really see the greatest impact on the greater community and real quick tell me about some of the other technologies that you're excited about but also concerned about so one of them is the text to 9 1 1 feature and so I thought that was really a game-changer for everyone so for instance if someone was to break into my house or something obviously I wouldn't be able to call 9-1-1 but you know I'd have to go into a secret hiding spot and text them so that's just really cool it's a cool feature to give deaf people an opportunity to contact 9-1-1 as well but the problem is there's only 11 percent of the 9-1-1 centers have actually implemented the text of 9-1-1 feature so it's really slow it's a slow implementation process well that would be a feature that would help everyone not just the disabled community so that would be a plus for everyone well thank you so much for your time Eric oh it's great to have you here and Adriana as well thank you and thank you for watching for more great conversations with leaders in your community and across the nation visit Comcast newsmakers comm I'm Allie PI hon [Music] you
