 [Music, Circular saw]  Locash: Things are always moving. Just looking over your head all the time with the cranes and accidents happen that way because you're stressed out.  Sanghyun Lee: Many of the construction accidents for example are associated with unsafe behavior, with this kind of technology we can identify where and when, what kind of job are causing the stress so that we can see where we have to put our effort to prevent potential accidents.  Narrator: Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering Sanghyun Lee and his team of University of Michigan researchers are placing inexpensive wearable sensors on construction workers to measure anxiety, fatigue, and heat stress while on the job.  Gaang Lee: I worked at construction company  for five years. Our research can help them to be safe. [construction site sounds] Per day we will check their perceived heat stress and perceived fatigue four times.  Narrator: The sensors will read body movement, temperature and electrodermal responses, while saliva samples verify some of the incoming data. The goal is to use the sensors to establish a model that will help predict when workers will become dehydrated, anxious, or when accidental falls are most likely to occur.  Harris: We're seeing that some of the guys are staying in the field longer. You know, they're wearing their bodies out given the type of work that they do and as we move along through this project, I wouldn't be surprised five, ten years down the road that some of the research that these guys are doing here today has changes in the way that we do things in the field in the future.
