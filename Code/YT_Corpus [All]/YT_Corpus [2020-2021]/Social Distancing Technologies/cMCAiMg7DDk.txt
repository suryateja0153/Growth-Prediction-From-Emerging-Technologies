 We use technology today to tackle all of society’s problems and challenges. Operating our parks and attractions in the era of COVID-19 should be no different. Technology already exists that can provide destinations with effective and safe ways to manage crowds, disperse visitors, and enforce social distancing. In order to reopen, lots of parks and attractions are relying on their staff to enforce social distancing and crowd control. But this exposes staff to possible COVID-19 carriers, takes them away from other duties and can even place them in physical danger in extreme cases. In Texas, a park ranger was assaulted, trying to enforce social distance regulations. In Miami’s South Pointe Park, city staff “were met with hostility and non-compliance." according to the City Manager.  Use your visitors’ own smartphones to communicate directly with them, send instructions, and enforce social distancing. Push notifications are better than signs as they can be quickly changed and adapted for different needs and can even be easily translated into the visitor’s own language with instant translation. Two-way chat and GPS navigable maps mean you can maintain the same high level of service to your visitors while minimizing direct contact between them and your staff - keeping everyone safer. This isn’t a time to depend only on old school solutions. It's a time for innovative and cutting edge responses that can quickly adapt to a rapidly changing world.
