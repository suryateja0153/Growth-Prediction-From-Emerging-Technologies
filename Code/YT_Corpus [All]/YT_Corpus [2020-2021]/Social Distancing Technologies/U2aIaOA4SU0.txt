 Welcome everyone, I'm Todd Bludworth, president of AMI. As live meetings come back into our day-to-day, here are some of the changes you can expect. Expect social distancing measures. Social distancing measures will be encouraged. This means venues may find themselves using larger spaces to accommodate less people. You should take into account these larger spaces when budgeting. Teller style windows, remote pay stations and technology will likely play a larger part in event management. Expect heightened sanitation. Some hotels have already announced their new health and sanitation measures, PPE for attendees and additional signage may be recommended or mandated to educate participants. Shared space such as registration tables, bell carts will be wiped down more frequently. More staff trained in proper sanitation procedures are likely to be working events and may even be more visible or prominent. Expect changes in dining options. Buffet style meals will likely be replaced with to-go or cash and carry models. In-room dining may become a better option for attendees. Open-air and outdoor spaces will likely be more popular to help with adequate airflow. Overall look for cleaner and wider spaces and more innovations from those of us in the meetings industry.
