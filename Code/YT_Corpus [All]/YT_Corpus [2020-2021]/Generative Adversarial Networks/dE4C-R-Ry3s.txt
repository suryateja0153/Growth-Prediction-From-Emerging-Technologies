 [Music] hi everyone welcome i'm vomitus kheh and i'm a technical program manager on the tensorflow team and hi I'm Jason Mays I'm a developer advocate on Potenza float J's team so here you'll be telling us about tensor float J yes indeed what is it very good question essentially tensorflow GS allows you to run machine learning anywhere that JavaScript can run and that's actually in many places such as in the web browser on the back end in no js' on react native for mobile apps and even on internet of things such as a raspberry pi so why would I use it instead of let's say Python good question so essentially we have several superpowers depending where you're executing so be on the server side or on the client side now on the client side one of the key features is privacy so that allows you to do all the inference on the client machine not having to send that data to a remote server somewhere which might be critical for certain types of data that you're dealing with now link to that we also have lower latency because there's no server-side recall you don't have to go from client to server and back again to get the answer and then of course moving on from there is cost because there's no server involved you don't have to have a GPU running 24/7 just to do that inference I mean the final point there is reach and scale because anyone with a web browser can simply go to a link and open that up it just works out of the box so there's no need to install a complex Linux environment we have other CUDA drivers and everything else and this is particularly important for maybe researchers because they could actually then utilize everyone in the world to try out their model they've just launched and see the performance and those edge cases that they may have not detected when doing it just with a few people in the lab do you have any demos we of course so I've got in addition to the existing demos that are open source and available online such as object detection and pose estimation and body segmentation we're going to launch three new ones at the summit this year so here we go there's what Prevost now now the first one is face mesh and as you can see it's running real time here in the browser as I move my face around it's tracking it pretty well opening closing my mouth and if I bring you in as well at the same time it can check more than one face you have glasses even glasses yeah and so this is actually tracking 468 unique points on each of our faces and then rendering it to the screen and we're even showing that in 3d on the right hand side they're in WebGL so we can actually represent a 3d model of your face in real time which is pretty cool how is it getting such are some performance very good question one key thing with 10ths on the client-side is that it supports multiple backends to execute on so if there's no specialist hardware we can run on the CPU of course which is the failsafe but if there's a graphics card we can actually leverage WebGL to do all that mathematics for you on the graphics card at high performance and we recently released webassembly support as well to get more consistent performance across maybe older mobile devices on the CPU as well so it's very chewy flavor very cool moving on to the next demo we also have hand pose and you can see here but this can track my hands in much the same way we're doing the face earlier but this time with my hand and this can track 21 unique points on my hands so you can imagine how you might use this for something like gesture or maybe even sign language but choice is yours whatever creative ideas you might have in your mind and then finally we have mobile Birds and if I just refresh the page here you can see the model loading and if you click continue we can now essentially ask questions about this piece of text that we have on the screen so I could ask something like what is tensorflow and you can see it's managed to find the answer to that question for us in the web browser so this could be really useful if you're not a really like large website or research paper and you want to jump to a specific portion of knowledge without having to read the whole thing this could help you do that and of course birth itself can be used for many other things but this is for the Q&A model that we've got we're working today so far and where can you remind me again where can I see the source code for this sure so all of this stuff is available and I'll get hub repository online just such 10 set radius in Google and you'll find our home page with all the good links that you need and maybe even in the description of the video as well excellent thank you so much thank you very many for joining us [Music]
