 hello we're team friendly from cogworks and today we'll show you our final project which we have been working on for the past four days creating meaningful friendships online has become challenging recently as everything is going remote so we wanted to create a platform that could connect people and add positivity to people's lives family connects users based on their own descriptions of themselves to create either one-on-one friendships or entire fin groups additional features including motion detection text generation and biography summarization we use speech recognition technology to best convey the speech patterns and thoughts of each user and use several natural language processing and vision technologies to help match users together in the first feature of our ui users are prompted to either create a profile or sign in to their existing one if this is their first time the users are asked to input their names and talk about themselves in their likes hobbies and so on the speech is converted to text which is analyzed through natural language processing techniques and is stored in a database then finally a picture is taken of the user and is stored as part of their profile if the user already has a pre-existing profile they can sign in with that same name this feature matches the signed in user's profile to another user in the database whose biography matches most similarly to find a new best friend this process involves comparing the overlap between the descriptor vectors produced by each respective user's biographies when they created their profile this feature is utilized when the user wants to read a story it would get boring pretty quickly if the stories were repeated so we created a text generator trained on fairy tales to generate a new entertaining story each time here the user is prompted to input the number of friends they would like to create a group with then that input is used to select a number of people with the most similar attributes from the database to form a new friend group the next feature in our user interface is show all friend groups this feature uses the whispers algorithm to display all friend groups loosper's algorithm is a non-supervised clustering algorithm trend groups are determined by the similarity of people from the brief description people give about themselves when they create a profile this feature allows users to see how positive or negative the algorithm believes their biographies to be the biography is squared between certain thresholds to determine whether it was positive negative or neutral so one part of our project was using a convolutional neural network to help us identify if a face is either displaying positive or negative emotion and so here you can see the loss and accuracy graph get generated by noggin this feature takes an image of the user and then uses a convolutional neural network to determine their emotions from their face they will receive a rating of either positive or negative the final feature we have is shortening my biography this feature takes someone's entire biography and highlights unique and specific attributes about it it utilizes document summarization techniques and inverse document frequency to pick out specific words that are infrequent among other users biographies the final list of words are tuned to summarize your own hobbies interests or even fun facts ryan scarleski is not only our cogworks instructor he is a researcher at mit lincoln laboratories his work consists of computer science mathematics and human cognition here our fine defense group algorithm has classified ryan in the same group as dr fauci and andrew dr fauci is a renowned doctor while andrew is a 17 year old student with a keen interest in science as you can see here all three of them share common interests and the whispers algorithm has classified them as one friend group and so that's friendly now go on create a profile and make some new friends
