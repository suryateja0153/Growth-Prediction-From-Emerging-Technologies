 [Music] so I've always been obsessed with this notion of the methodologies that we use to investigate what neurons like meaning what kind of visual stimuli trigger a neuron firing now normally what everybody in the field does is just show them thousands of natural images and find out that they're they'd like to respond to particular kinds of images like faces their hands or bodies but that's always a hypothesis and you can't possibly test all natural images so I've been putting this question to students in a class that I teach at Harvard I was new to the field and I was basically really excited about the idea of you know brains and neural networks and generative adversarial neural networks those are all very hot topics and really cool ideas to me so I wanted to find a way to put them all together and will because one of the first offers was one of the students in this class and and and he took up this question of the challenge and during his homework he came up with the idea of trying to combine generative algorithms with genetic algorithms to try to label the neuron dictate what it likes one day I received an email from Gabriele prime and telling me that he in rotating students in his lab will shall had developed a way to discover internal representations hidden in an artificial neurons of convolutional neural networks and they could demonstrate that through a process that involved a generic algorithm in combination with a generative adversarial Network they could evolve pictures that gave rise to activity in the cell that superseded those of natural images including the ones that had been used to train the very same convolutional neural networks and they asked me whether it was possible to translate this into primate electrophysiology so I have a lab that records from in fro temporal cortex in macaque monkeys and this student who was doing a rotation project willtao came up with a program that would allow us to use neural networks to explore a huge image space to try to figure out what what are the optimum images for afro temporal cortex neurons we did these experiments with chronically implanted arrays and rhesus macaques and these arrays allow us to study the same population of neurons across days so we basically put a new rung online together in a closed loop with a generative neural network and we put a genetic algorithm on top of this so that the responses of the neurons can be used to guide the evolution of images that's made by the generative Network so that these images become progressively better for the neuron so he and Carlos and Peter together figured out how to integrate wills program with our physiology rigs which was non-trivial because you have to have three computers talking to each other constantly and analyzing data and generating images I remember lots of shouting because we have to be in different rooms and I remember for the first few days not getting many interesting results until finally one day we seem to hit it and we saw that many of the cells that we were recording from began to exhibit increases in firing rate while at the same time the images began to take form over an hour - we would watch wills algorithm and a generative Network turn these black and white textures into these colorful scenes it worked so well the neuron we were recording from evolved something that looked just like a monkey face except it was distorted in a way that was really interesting everybody in the lab went crazy and then a few days later another cell evolved something that looked just like one of the care staff wearing the blue PPE that we all wear when we go in the monkey rooms and all of this happening a part of the brain that people used to think about much lower level information so when we sue this stimuli emerge it was eye-opening it was a essentially opening the doors to completely new world of images that's distinct from anything that anyone had ever tried so far that was one of the most exciting woman in my scientific career so this is the first time that we have a sense of neuronal preferences dictated by the neuron itself and this was like creating something out of nothing at all in this research we brought together tools and approaches from both computer science and visual neuroscience research and we developed a tool that's really useful for neuroscience research but can also be informative for the study of artificial neural networks as well I am incredibly proud of this paper and I really have to give a credit to the team this was one of those efforts that for which everybody was essential and everybody contributed something very important to it I hope to continue this type of collaboration in the future with a CBMM community it's an amazing community [Music]
