artificial intelligence and you can select one of the skies like dramatic sky look at that it just changes the sky which is really cool but they asked me to uh the problem with that is that you know

to take for example this one sunset 5 and boom check this out isn't that crazy look at the before and after so usually i always start with the sky replacement and then i go into the first section here called light and i usually you know open a bit of shadows i bring down the highlights exactly what i would do in lightroom if you fill on my lightroom stuff i would crush my blacks you know i would do my whites um i could even change the overall white balance to match even more that sky add a bit of magenta i love their smart contrast smart contrast is really cool check it out before and after also let me show you a few other things you can do in luminar so for example they have this crazy thing called ai augmented sky check this out so you can go here to object selection and for example i can go and take a balloon and i can put a balloon in in the sky okay if i want to change the size of the balloon i can click on place object and i can place it wherever i want i can make it smaller i can make it bigger and it masks automatically behind the mask that it created for the sky which is really cool you can even go crazy like you can even add like you know lightnings and and you can add like mountains check this out you can add a mountain i mean you know in case you think that venice should have some mountains you can add some mountains you can even change the the um the uh the warmth of the mountains so they match more the image you can relight the mountain so they match more the image i mean it's really sorcery you can do everything you want check this out it's it's really crazy you can do that or i can go back to the good old balloons i can go here for example and i'm gonna go to birds bird one a lot of birds uh birds too a lot of birds and bird three i think i'm gonna go for bird three and i'm gonna make them smaller and position them here and voila and it's not cool i mean i think it's just a small detail but it's really cool one thing i love is in the pro section they have something called advanced contrast advanced contrast is contrast for the highlights the mid tones and the shadows so i'm going to go here and add some highlights contrast there mid-tones also i like to add a bit of everything and you can see on anything in luminar you can go here and see the before and after so it just it just adds a little nice thing now i want to make the bottom of the photo a bit darker so i can go here to adjustable gradient and i can go here and i can go for example you see i want to make the the bottom a bit darker so i go to bottom and i can lower the exposure voila and then i can click here on set orientation and i can make this higher or you know i can make this maybe a little bit lower and just boom make the exposure maybe a little more i just i want to get people to look inside of the photo okay and i can go back and forth i can go back to my light just like in lightroom and i can you know lower a little bit the exposure maybe boost a little bit the shadows i want to make this really dramatic photo check it out before after i mean isn't this is like complete sorcery it is so easy to use and luminar has gotten so much stable over the years and you're like oh okay maybe i want to do something else you can just go back here in the sky replacement and you can take one of their sky you know for example dramatic sunset 3 whatever that is okay or
