 WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SESSION TOGETHER TODAY ON, UH, AUTO-AUTOMATED FIBER PLACEMENT AT ISAAC. UM, ISAAC IS AN AFP, UH, ROBOT AT NASA LANGLEY, AND, UM, IT HELPS US MANUFACTURING ADVANCED COMPOSITES, AND THE LECTURE TODAY WILL BE ALL ABOUT THAT. BEFORE I GO AHEAD AND START, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY A-- WE ARE IN A CLEAN ROOM ENVIRONMENT. IT'S ISO 7, CLASS 10,000. WHAT DOES A CLEAN ROOM ENVIRONMENT MEANS, AND I'M GONNA TALK ALSO ABOUT THE SPECIAL PERMISSION THAT WE NEEDED TO RECEIVE TODAY, SO THAT I REMOVE THE FACE COVER AND THE GLASSES, AS WELL AS THE GLOVES, IN ORDER TO, UH, GO LIVE WITH YOU TODAY. SO, A CLEAN ROOM ENVIRONMENT IS-- SINCE WE ARE DOING SOMETHING THAT IS VERY, VERY CRITICAL AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT, UH, WE ARE CONTROLLING PARTICLES, FOREIGN OBJECTS, AND WE ARE MINIMIZING ANY DEFECTS THAT MIGHT ARISE IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, WE ACTUALLY TRY TO CONTROL THE ENVIRONMENT. WE TRY TO CONTROL THE HUMIDITY. SO WHEN WE ARE IN A ISO 7 CLEAN ROOM, WE CAN CONTROL THE HUMIDITY PLUS OR MINUS FIVE PERCENT, TEMPERATURE PLUS OR MINUS TWO DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. AND WE DO A PARTICLE COUNT WHERE WE ACCEPT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PARTICLES IN A CUBIC METER WITHIN CERTAIN DIMENSIONS. WE-- AND WE ARE TALKING IN MICRONS AND LESS THAN MICRON. SO, WHAT IS IT THAT I REMOVED? IT'S ACTUALLY THE FACE COVER. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT USUALLY I SHOULD BE WEARING, WHERE I AM COVERING THE WHOLE FACE. I'M GONNA BE REMOVING IT NOW SO THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY HEAR ME PROPERLY WITHOUT, UH, ANY ISSUES. THE GLASSES FOR PROTECTION. SO, AS WELL AS THE HAND GLOVES THAT, WHENEVER YOU'RE TOUCHING SOMETHING, THE MATERIAL FROM TWO PORTIONS. FOR THE CLEAN ROOM ENVIRONMENT, AS WELL AS FOR YOUR OWN PERSONAL SAFETY. BECAUSE SOME OF THESE MATERIALS THAT WE'RE TOUCHING ARE UNCURED. WHAT ARE THE OTHER ELEMENTS THAT ARE-- THAT I AM STILL WEARING THAT ARE NEEDED IN A CLEAN ROOM ENVIRONMENT? WE HAVE THE COAT, WE HAVE THE HAIR COVER, AND WE HAVE THE BOOTIES. ALL RIGHT, SO, NOW THAT I GAVE THE JUSTIFICATION, WHY AM I IN A CLEAN ROOM, AND HOW IS IT ALLOWED THAT I DON'T HAVE, UH, THE FACE COVER AND THE PERMISSION THAT WE HAVE? LET'S GO AHEAD AND START OUR DISCUSSION TODAY AND OUR LECTURE AND TALKING ABOUT AUTOMATED FIBER PLACEMENT. THE WAY WE WILL DO IT IS GONNA BE APPROXIMATELY SPLIT INTO THREE SECTIONS. THE FIRST ONE IS ABOUT COMPOSITES AND THE IMPORTANCE OF COMPOSITES, AS WELL AS COMPOSITES MANUFACTURING. WHAT WE WILL DO IN THAT FIRST SEGMENT IS WE WILL JUSTIFY THE REASON WHY AUTOMATED FIBER PLACEMENT IS IMPORTANT, AND WHY IS IT THAT TODAY WE'RE GOING LIVE FROM NASA TALKING ABOUT SUCH AN IMPORTANT THING. AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON IN THE SECOND SEGMENT AND I'LL TAKE YOU AROUND IN THE ROOM, AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT TWO THINGS. THE AFP TERMINOLOGY, SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHEN I'M EXPLAINING CERTAIN THINGS, AS WELL AS THE AFP PROCESS AND WHAT ARE THE PRINCIPLE AFP PROCESS, UH, PARAMETERS THAT WE NEED TO CONTROL. AFTER WE FINISH FROM THESE TWO SEGMENTS, WE WILL MOVE TO ANOTHER LOCATION WHERE WE'LL ACTUALLY BE MOVING THE ROBOT, WE WILL BE DOING THE PLACEMENT, AND WE WILL BE TALKING WITH THE ISAAC LEAGUE, THE PROCESS PLANNER, AND SEVERAL PEOPLE, AND WE'LL FINISH IT UP WITH AFP INSPECTION AND DEFECTS. SO LET'S START WITH COMPOSITES AND THEIR IMPORTANCE. SO, FIRST OF ALL, IT'S VERY, VERY IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT COMPOSITES ARE NOT A NEW DISCOVERY. COMPOSITES HAVE EXISTED LONG AGO. SINCE THEY DISCOVERED THAT WHEN WE MIX TWO COMPONENTS TOGETHER, THE AGGREGATION OF THEIR BEHAVIOR TOGETHER MAKES A BETTER, UH, RESULT OF THEIR PROPERTIES. NOW, SOMETHING VERY, VERY IMPORTANT TO SAY IS THAT WHEN WE TALK COMPOSITES, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A HETEROGENEOUS MIX, WHICH MEANS EACH MATERIAL IS STAYING IN ITS OWN STATE. WHEN WE SAY "FIBERGLASS," WHEN WE SAY "CARBON FIBER "REINFORCED POLYMER," WE HAVE THE POLYMER AND WE HAVE THE CARBON FIBER. EACH ONE IN THEIR OWN-- THEY STAY IN THEIR OWN MATERIAL AND WE ARE COMBINING THEM TOGETHER. SO, WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY IS THAT WE HAVE TWO PHASES IN COMPOSITES. WE HAVE THE REINFORCEMENT AND WE HAVE THE MATRIX. AND COMPOSITES HAVE-- THIS IS VERY, VERY CRUCIAL. AND THIS IS WHERE MOST OF THE GAINS WE ARE TRYING TO REAP OUT OF COMPOSITES, THEY HAVE DIRECTIONAL PROPERTIES. WHICH MEANS HOW YOU ORIENT YOUR COMPOSITE, THIS IS HOW IT'S GONNA RESPOND TO [ INDISTINCT ]. THIS IS HOW YOU'RE GONNA EXPECT THE BEHAVIOR THAT, UH, WE ACTUALLY GET. SO, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT DIRECTIONAL PROPERTIES, IN CONTRAST BETWEEN METALS AND COMPOSITES, WE TALK ABOUT SOMETHING BEING ISOTROPIC METALS AND ANISOTROPIC COMPOSITES. LET'S GO BACK A LITTLE BIT TO THE REINFORCEMENT AND THE MATRIX. THE REINFORCEMENT AND THE MATRIX. THE REINFORCEMENT IS WHAT IS BRINGING TO THE GAIN THE STRENGTHS, THE STIFFNESS. THE MATRIX IS WHAT IS HOLDING THINGS TOGETHER. WHAT IS MAINTAINING THE SHAPE OF THE STRUCTURE. THE MATRIX MATERIAL CAN BE-- WITHIN THE WORLD OF POLYMERS-- CAN BE THERMOSETS, CAN BE THERMOPLASTIC, AS WELL AS WE CAN HAVE SOMETHING TO JUST HOLD THE FIBERS TOGETHER. AND THIS IS WHERE WE END UP IN THE WORLD OF WHAT WE CALL DRY FIBERS, WHERE WE HAVE, UH-- REMOVE THE MATRIX AND WE WILL BE USING A SUBSEQUENT PROCESS OF ACTUALLY, UH, INFUSION. NOW, THERMOSETS ARE THE 7-- BOEING 787, THE-- THERMOSET ARE RIGHT NOW WHAT IS THE PROMINENT MOLD OF MATRIX MATERIAL THAT IS-- THAT IS BEING USED. HOWEVER-- AND THIS IS WHAT WE WILL BE USING TODAY-- A THERMOSET MATRIX SYSTEM WITH CARBON FIBERS. HOWEVER, THERMOPLASTICS ARE HEAVILY UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR SEVERAL REASONS. FOR EXTREME TOUGHNESS. EN-ENERGY ABSORPTION. RAPID PROCESSING BECAUSE-- SOMETHING VERY, VERY IMPORTANT. IF YOU USE A THERMOSET, YOU WILL NEED TO DO A CURING PROCESS, AND YOU WILL NEED AN AUTOCLAVE AFTER THE FIBER PLACEMENT AND THE [ INDISTINCT ]. IF YOU USE A THERMOPLASTIC, YOU CAN USE WHAT WE CALL AN [ INDISTINCT ] CONSOLIDATION, AND THEN YOU WOULD HAVE AN OUT OF AUTOCLAVE, UH, PROCESS. SO, NOW THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE MATRIX MATERIAL, AND IT CAN BE THERMOSETS, THERMOPLASTIC, OR SIMPLY NOT HAVING ANY-- OR, ACTUALLY, NOT HAVING ANY MEANING INJECTING IT AFTERWARDS, AFTER AUTOMATED FIBER PLACEMENT, WE CAN THINK ABOUT, UH, REINFORCEMENT MATERIAL. REINFORCEMENT MATERIALS CAN BE IN SEVERAL FORMS. CAN BE ALONG CONTINUOUS FIBERS AND CAN BE FLAKES, CAN BE PARTICLES, AND SO-- AND SO ON. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT CONTINUOUS FIBER, THIS IS WHAT BRINGS ACTUALLY THE STRENGTHS, AND THIS IS WHY, UH, WE DESIRE TO HAVE THE CONTINUOUS, UH, THE CONTINUOUS FIBER AS A REINFORCEMENT. NOW, COMPOSITES DO EXIST ALSO IN, UH, NATURE. WOOD IS ACTUALLY A-A NATURAL COMPOSITE. IT IS COMPO-- IT IS A HETEROGENEOUS COMPONENT OF TWO ELEMENTS, WHERE ONE OF THEM IS ACTING AS A MATRIX AND ONE OF THEM IS ACTING AS A REINFORCEMENT. ANOTHER THING IS, HUMAN BONES ARE ALSO ACTUALLY CONSIDERED AS A COMPOSITE BECAUSE IT IS A HETEROGENEOUS, UH, MIX. NOW, BEFORE WE MOVE ON AND WE START TALKING ABOUT COMPOSITES MANUFACTURING, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT COMPOSITES AND ADVANCED COMPOSITES IN OUR SITUATION PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE IN-- WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CREATING APPLICATIONS THAT ARE ADVANCED, UH, APPLICATIONS. AND THE PROPERTIES THAT WE LOOK FOR, WE DON'T COMPARE STRENGTHS TO STRENGTHS OR STIFFNESS TO STIFFNESS. WHAT WE SHOULD DO AND WHAT WE SHOULD COMPARE, AND THIS IS THE ADVANTAGE THEY BRING, UH, IS WEIGHT, WHICH IS STRENGTHS TO WEIGHT RATIO AND STIFFNESS TO WEIGHT RATIOS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT MATERIALS. NOW THAT I HOPEFULLY CONVINCED YOU THAT COMPOSITES AND ADVANCED COMPOSITES ARE VERY, VERY IMPORTANT, LET'S MOVE ON TO TALK ABOUT COMPOSITES MANUFACTURING. ALL RIGHT, WE'RE CONVINCED. LET'S GO AHEAD AND MANUFACTURE WITH, UH, COMPOSITES. LET'S HIGHLIGHT FIRST THAT COMPOSITES HAS DRAWN FROM ITS PREDECESSORS. SO, A LOT OF OTHER MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, IN THE-- WHETHER IN THE TEXTILE INDUSTRIES OR WHETHER EXTRUSION AND CASTING PROCESSES, HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATED TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. AND COMPOSITES CAN ACTUALLY BE-- COMPOSITES MANUFACTURING AND AUTOMATED FIBER PLACEMENT CAN ACTUALLY BE SEEN AS A GIANT 3-D PRINTER IN THE WORLD OF ADAPTIVE MANUFACTURING. MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN-THAN 3-D PRINTERS. NOW, FIRST OF ALL, HOW WE STARTED IS-- WAS HAND LAYUP. WHAT THIS MEANS IS, WE STARTED TAKING LAYERS OF MATERIAL AND WE STARTED POSITIONING THEM. SO, AN EXAMPLE, THIS IS A-- THIS IS A WOVEN FABRIC. WE CAN IMAGINE THAT WE'RE TAKING THIS WOVEN FABRIC. WE PUT IT ALONG A CERTAIN ORIENTATION. WE PUT-- TAKE ANOTHER ONE, WE PUT IT ALONG ANOTHER ONE. WE'LL BE APPLYING THE MATRIX, THE [ INDISTINCT ] SYSTEM IN BETWEEN, AND AS SUCH, WE'LL START ACTUALLY CREATING OUR-OUR COMPOSITES. HOWEVER, THIS IS A WOVEN ONE. IT HAS-- THIS ONE ACTUALLY HAS ZERO ORI-- DEGREES ORIENTATION AND 90 DEGREES ORIENTATION. AND THE HAND LAYUP PROCESS MEANS WE ARE USING THIS-- WE ARE USING OUR HANDS AS A MANUAL OPERATION, RELIABILITY, HUMAN ERROR, AND WE'RE FLYING WITH THOSE THINGS. SO THIS IS WHERE WE START, OKAY, WE NEED TO MAKE A PROCESS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY CONTROL BETTER AND WE CAN ENHANCE, UH, THE QUALITY. SO, WITHIN HAND LAYUP, WE STARTED SAYING, ALL RIGHT, UH, AFTER HAND LAYUP, WE STARTED SAYING, ALL RIGHT, WHAT ARE SPECIFIC SHAPES THAT WE MANUFACTURE THAT WE CAN APPROPRIATE A CERTAIN PROCESS FOR IN THE WORLD OF COMPOSITE MANUFACTURING? AND THIS IS WHERE, UH, COMPOSITE MANUFACTURING METHODS SUCH AS PULTRUSION, FILAMENT WINDING, FORMING, AND SO ON ACTUALLY TOOK PLACE. PULTRUSION IS A PROCESS THAT ACTUALLY-- IF YOU-- WHEN WE TALK IN EXTRUSION AND THE METHOD OF PROCESSES, PULTRUSION IS A PROCESS WHERE IT ACTUALLY MIXES TWO DIFFERENT STEPS INTO ONE. YOU TAKE THE FIBERS. YOU ACTUALLY IMPREGNATE THEM, AND AS YOU IMPREGNATE THEM, YOU ACTUALLY TAKE THEM AND YOU FEED THEM INTO A, UH, A, UH, A SHAPE LIKE FOR-FOR EXTRUSION PROCESSES. HENCE THE WORLD PULTRUSION BECAUSE IT'S LIKE WIRE, AND [ INDISTINCT ] YOU ARE ACTUALLY PULLING THE FIBER INTO THIS PROCESS. THE ISSUE IS, THE MOMENT I SAID WE ARE MIXING TWO THINGS AT THE SAME TIME, HOW DO WE GO ABOUT QUALITY? HOW DO WE GO ABOUT, IF SOMETHING HAPPENS SOMEWHERE, WE CANNOT REALLY CONTROL IT. AND THIS IS WHY IT'S REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT, UM, IN THE PULTRUSION PROCESS, TO ACTUALLY WATCH OUT FOR THESE THINGS. NOW, FILAMENT WINDING IS-- WE THOUGHT ABOUT, WE MANUFACTURE A LOT OF CYLINDERS, A LOT OF BARRELS, A LOT OF SPHERICAL SHAPES. SO FILAMENT WINDING CAN ACTUALLY REPLACE THIS HAND LAYUP PROCESS BY TAKING THE OBJECT AND ROTATING IT. AND AS YOU ARE PLACING THE FILAMENT, UH, AROUND IT AND SO ON. SO, WE HAVE ALL OF THESE, UH, SPECIFIC MANUFACTURING PROCESSES THAT ARE LOOK-- RELATED TO A CERTAIN, UH, SHAPE. THEN WE SAID, ALL RIGHT. WHAT IF WE WANT TO MANUFACTURE WHATEVER WE WANT TO MANUFACTURE? WE DON'T-WE DON'T WANNA BE LIMITED TO A CERTAIN SPECIFIC SHAPE. WE WANT A DEVICE THAT CAN ACTUALLY HELP US MANUFACTURE DESIGNS IN A GENERIC FORMAT. AND THIS IS WHERE WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT ATL, AUTOMATED TAPE LAYING, WHICH IS-- WHICH CAN BE CONSIDERED AS THE PRECURSOR OF, UH, OF COMPOSITES. AUTOMATED TAPE LAYING IS... IS WHEN WE TAKE A TAPE, A NARROW WIDTH, SOMETHING ALONG THREE INCHES, SOMETHING ALONG SIX INCHES, AND WE START FEEDING THAT TAPE THROUGH A MECHANISM. THIS IS AUTOMATED TAPE LAYING. THE FACT THAT IT HAS A FINITE WIDTH, THE FACT THAT IT HAS A THREE INCH OR A SIX INCH OR, DEPENDING ON THE PROCESS THAT YOU HAVE WIDTH, MAKES IT VERY ADVANTAGEOUS BECAUSE YOU CAN TAKE A SHAPE AND YOU CAN START LAYING IT UP ON. HOWEVER, AS WE DISCOVERED-- AS WE DISCOVERED, THE MOMENT YOU START GOING OUT OF REGULAR SHAPES AND YOU-- THE MOMENT YOU START HAVING SHAPES THAT ARE DOUBLY CURVED OR WITH SINGLE CURVATURE, BUT THEY ARE-- THEY HAVE SOME COMPLEXITY, AND YOU START TRYING TO PUT YOUR TAPE ON THEM ALONG AN ORIENTATION, YOU CAN SEE A MAJOR LIFT FROM ONE LOCATION. AND THEREFORE, WE'RE LIKE, ALL RIGHT. THIS IS GOOD. NOW WE CAN MANUFACTURE DIFFERENT SHAPES WITH A MACHINE AND NOT BE RELATED AND SPECIFIC TO A CERTAIN SHAPE. HOWEVER, WE NEED TO MANUFACTURE COMPLEX SHAPES. SO HOW DO WE GO ON FROM HERE? AND THIS IS WHERE WE SAID, ALL RIGHT. INSTEAD OF MANUFACTURING WITH THREE INCHES, LET'S START GOING DOWN. AND WE STARTED GOING DOWN. AND THIS PROCESS, INSTEAD OF GETTING OUT ONE TAPE OF A FEEDING MECHANISM, WE CAN GET WHAT WE CALL TOWS AND SEVERAL TOWS OUT. HOW DOES A TOW LOOK LIKE? THIS IS A TOW. THIS IS A QUARTER INCH TOW. AND WHAT WE START DOING RIGHT NOW IS WE START LAYING UP SEVERAL TOWS AT THE SAME TIME WITH EACH OTHER. AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE REDUCING THE WIDTHS OF THE TOW ACTUALLY MAKES IT MUCH MORE FLEXIBLE, AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY START PUTTING ANY SHAPE THAT YOU WANT WITH IT. OF COURSE, UH, TO A CERTAIN LIMITATION, AND THERE IS A LOT OF RESEARCH ABOUT TOW WRINKLES AND THE FORMATION OF TOWS, AND WE NEED TO-- BUT, HOWEVER, IN COMPARISON WITH ATL, WE HAVE UNLOCKED THE CAPACITY TO CREATE COM-- ANY COMPOSITE MANUFACTURING SHAPE IF WE MEET, UH, CERTAIN CRITERIA. SO, HOW DO WE GO ABOUT THAT? THE WAY THAT WE GO ABOUT THAT IS WE TAKE-- LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A CERTAIN TOW. YOU HAVE PLACED THE TOW. YOU NEVER REALLY ACTUALLY PLACE A TOW. WHAT YOU ACTUALLY DO IS, YOU PLACE SEVERAL TOWS WITH EACH OTHER AND YOU GET-- YOU END UP GETTING A COURSE. SO THIS IS SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA START TALKING ABOUT IN A SECOND ABOUT, UH, THE TERMINOLOGY SPECIFIC FOR AFP PROCESS. BEFORE I GO AHEAD AND MOVE FORWARD, I JUST WANNA SHOW YOU ONE MORE THING. THIS IS HOW WE START THE-THE MATERIAL. BEFORE WE CREATE ANY STRUCTURE, THE-THE BOEING 787, THE DREAMLINER, THIS IS-- IT IS A BUNDLE OF HALF INCH OR QUARTER INCH CARBON FIBER REINFORCED, UH, POLYMERS AND TOWS. SO, I HOPE IN THIS FIRST SECTION I'VE CONVINCED YOU COMPOSITES ARE IMPORTANT. DIRECTIONAL PROPERTIES. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS RESEARCH ONGOING ON USING THE NEW MATRIX MATERIALS SUCH AS THERMOPLASTICS AND THEIR PROPERTIES. AND THE SECOND ONE IS MANUFA-- COMPOSITE MANUFACTURING. WE'RE MOVING FROM HAND LAYUP TO THE PREMIUM METHOD OF COMPOSITE MANUFACTURING, WHICH IS AUTOMATED FIBER PLACEMENT. NOW, FOR THE SECOND... NOW FOR THE SECOND, UH, STEP, WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY START TALKING ABOUT AFP TERMINOLOGY AND WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE AFP PROCESS. SO TO DO THAT, LET'S FIRST OF ALL TAKE YOU A LITTLE BIT ON A TOUR IN THE AFP ROOM. SO, ISAAC, UM, NASA'S, UM, NASA LANGLEY'S AUTOMATED FIBER PLACEMENT, UH, MACHINE IS A ROBOTIC BASED AFP MACHINE. SO IN AFP, YOU HAVE A GANTRY BASED AFP MACHINES AND ROBOTIC BASED, UH, AFP MACHINE. WHAT WE HAVE IS A SIX DEGREES OF FREEDOM ROBOT, AND WE'RE GONNA TALK IN A SECOND ABOUT- ABOUT, UH, THESE-- THE DEGREES OF FREEDOM AND TRY TO BUILD THE UNDERSTANDING OF THAT. AND WE HAVE THE AFP HEAD MOUNTED. THIS AFP HEAD IS FOR-- IT CAN ENABLE US TO FEED 16 TOWS AT THE SAME TIME AND THESE TOWS ARE A QUARTER INCH. AS WE SAID BEFORE, WE WENT DOWN ALL THE WAY TO AN EIGHTH OF AN INCH. RIGHT NOW, INDUSTRY DOESN'T REALLY LIKE AN EIGHTH OF AN INCH BECAUSE, UH, PRODUCTION AND PRODUCTIVITY GOES DOWN THE MORE THAT YOU'RE, UH, NARROWING THE STRIP. SO QUARTER OF AN INCH, HALF AN INCH, AND ONE INCH ARE SOMEWHAT, UH, THE STANDARD NOWADAY. MORE AND MORE, I SEE A QUARTER OF AN INCH IN RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT, AND HALF AN INCH AND AN INCH IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT. SO, THIS IS THE AFP HEAD. UM, WE'RE GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT, UH, WHAT WE SEE IN THE AFP HEAD. SO THESE SPOOLS THAT I TALK TO YOU BEFORE, THESE ARE THE CARBON FIBER, UH, REINFORCED POLYMERS THAT ARE LOCATED ON THE TOW HOLDERS. WHAT HAVE IN HERE IS, WE ALSO HAVE A DANCER. THIS IS, UH, HELPS IN THE CREATION OF THE TENSION. AND ALSO WE HAVE THE BACKUP, UH, TAPE HOLDER. SO WHAT IS THE BACKUP TAPE? AS YOU HAVE SEEN BEFORE WHEN I SHOWED YOU THE SPOOL THAT WE USE, THE BACKUP TAPE ACTUALLY YOU CAN SEE THERE IS THIS YELLOW, UH, MATERIAL. THIS YELLOW MATERIAL DOESN'T END UP GETTING INTO THE PART THAT YOU'RE BUILDING. THIS MATERIAL ACTUALLY PROTECTS THE TOW ONE FROM THE OTHER ONE. SO THAT THEY DON'T TACK ON TOP OF EACH OTHER. AND THEN EVENTUALLY THE TOW ITSELF GOES TO THE REDIRECT ROLLERS AND GOES THROUGH THE MECHANISM. THE MECHANISM, UH, YOUR OUTPUT FROM HERE, THE TOWS. IN HERE, WE SAID WE CAN OUTPUT UP TO 16. TODAY FOR THE DEMONSTRATION WE'RE USING FOUR SPOOLS. SO WE HAVE ACTIVATED SEVEN, NINE, AND FROM THE OTHER SIDE, EIGHT AND TEN. WE'RE GONNA TALK IN DETAILS ABOUT THIS, BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT INFLUENCES THE AFP PROCESS, BUT UNDER THE AFP TERMINOLOGY LET ME JUST SAY THAT THIS IS THE HEATER. THIS HEATER IS, UH, IR, INFRARED HEATER. IN A SECOND WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT OTHER HEATING MECHANISMS THAT CAN BE USEFUL IN OTHER MATERIALS. THIS IS THE ROLLER, WE HAVE THE SCOOP, AND THIS IS AFP-- THIS IS AFP HEAD. SO, WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY NOW IS THAT WE ARE-- NOW THAT WE UNDERSTOOD THAT TOWS AND TOW WIDTHS PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE, AND IN HERE, WHAT WE HAVE IS A, UH, QUARTER INCH TOW. I WOULD LIKE BEFORE I ACTUALLY MOVE FORWARD, UH, FIX THE CONCEPT OF HOW DO WE BUILD A COMPOSITE PART. HOW WE BUILD A COMPOSITE PART WITH AUTOMATED FIBER PLACEMENT IS IN FOUR STEPS. TOWS, COURSES, PLY AND LAMINATE. WHAT ARE THESE FOUR STEPS. THE FIRST STEP IS THE TOW. EACH TOW INDIVIDUALLY, THIS IS THE FIRST STEP. WHEN YOU PUT TOWS TOGETHER AND YOU PLACE THEM AT THE SAME TIME, SO LET'S SAY YOU HAVE 16 SPOOLS THAT ARE LOADED AND YOU HAVE 16 TOWS COMING AT THE SAME TIME, AND YOU ARE PLACING THEM ON THE MACHINE, THIS IS HOW YOU GET A COURSE. SO NOW FROM ONE TOW WITHIN ONE PLACEMENT WE GOT A COURSE. THEN WE TAKE ANOTHER COURSE NEXT TO IT, AND THE OTHER COURSES TO FINISH FROM ONE ORIENTATION, THIS IS HOW WE HAVE CREATED THE PLY. SO OUR LAMINATE THAT WE'RE GONNA BE MANUFACTURING TODAY, WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE LAYING DOWN ON THE THIRD PLY. WE DID THE FIRST PLY OF 45 DEGREES, THE SECOND PLY OF I THINK 90. YEP, A SECOND PLY OF 90, AND WE WILL BE DOING A THIRD PLY TODAY OF ZERO DEGREES. SO... SO THE LAMINATE, THE COMPOSITE, IS THE AGGREGATION AS WE START BUILDING THE THICKNESS OF- OF THE MATERIAL. SO NOW THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE HEAD, LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE IN DETAIL ABOUT THE MOTION OF THE AFP MACHINE. SO I'M GONNA ASK ROB TO COME WITH ME, AND WE'RE GONNA POSITION OURSELVES IN HERE. SO THIS IS A KUKA ROBOT THAT, UM, IS MODIFIED BY ELECTROIMPACT. WHAT WE HAVE IS A SIX DEGREES OF FREEDOM KUKA ROBOT. WE HAVE AN A1, ALL THE WAY UP TO A6 MOTION. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A DEMONSTRATION IN, UM, IN A LITTLE BIT OF TIME, WHERE WE ACTUALLY SEE THIS MOTION, HOW IT PLAYS OUT TOGETHER. NOW, WE ARE NOT IN A SIX DEGREES OF FREEDOM SYSTEM. LET'S START ADDING THE DEGREES OF FREEDOM. SO THE-THE ROBOT ITSELF, ALL OF IT IS ACTUALLY ON A RAIL. AND THE RAIL PROVIDES A SEVENTH DEGREE OF FREEDOM THAT WE CAN ENABLE THE MOTION. WHEN WE ARE LAYING UP ON A FLAT OR A STATIONARY TOOL, AND WE'RE GONNA BE DOING THAT ON THE TABLE OVER THERE, I-- IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT I MENTION THE TERMINOLOGY IN AFP WHERE WE LAYUP, WE TALK ABOUT TOOL. WE NEVER TALK ABOUT MOLDS IN THE CONTEXT OF AFP. WE USE TOOLS AND WE LAYUP ON THE TOOLS. WHEN WE'RE LAYING UP ON THE TOOL, BASICALLY YOU WILL HAVE THE SIX PLUS ONE, SO THE SEVEN DEGREES OF MOTION THAT ARE ACTING IN CONCERT, AND THE PROGRAMMING OF THAT IS VERY, VERY CRITICAL. AND THE SIMULATION AND VERIFICATION IN ORDER TO ACTUALLY PLACE THE, UM, THE-THE PLY AND THE PROCESS OF BUILDING THE LAMINATE. SO-- BUT OUR MACHINE IS NOT ONLY SEVEN DEGREES OF FREEDOM. IT'S ACTUALLY EIGHT DEGREES OF FREEDOM. AS YOU CAN SEE IN HERE, WE HAVE THE ROTATOR WHICH ACTUALLY PROVIDES A CERTAIN ROTATION. SO, AS THE WHOLE MOTION OF THE HEAD THAT IS ON THE RAIL AND WITH THE SIX DEGREES OF FREEDOM IS MOVING, WHAT WE HAVE IS THE TOOL ITSELF ON A ROTATOR. AND THIS ENABLES US TO ACCESS AN EIGHTH DEGREE OF FREEDOM, WHICH IS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT WHEN WE ARE MANUFACTURING CERTAIN COMPLEX SHAPES. NOW BEFORE WE WRAP UP THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE AFP ROOM, YOU CAN SEE IN THE BACK WE HAVE THE AFP STANDS. ISAAC IS THE MOST VERSATILE AFP MACHINE IN THE WORLD. ACTUALLY IT'S MUCH MORE THAN AFP. YOU CAN DROP THE HEAD AND ACTUALLY PICK OTHER, UH, PLACEMENT HEADS AND PERFORM CERTAIN OPERATIONS. SO I'M GONNA ROTATE TO THE SIDE TO ACTUALLY SHOW YOU ISAAC, THE INTEGRATED STRUCTURAL ASSEMBLY OF ADVANCED COMPOSITES, WHAT ACTUALLY IT CAN DO. WE HAVE IN HERE A PROJECTION HEAD WHERE WE CAN DROP THE AFP HEAD, PICK THE PROJECTION HEAD, AND ACTUALLY WITH A GREEN LIGHT WE CAN ACTUALLY ENABLE TO SEE WHERE WE ARE PLACING, WHAT WE ARE CUTTING, WHAT WE ARE ACTUALLY PERFORMING. SO THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP, ESPECIALLY IN THE DEFECT ASSESSMENT. THIS IS PRETTY COMMON. HOWEVER WHAT'S REALLY, REALLY COOL, WE HAVE A STITCHING TOOL. AND WE HAVE ACTUALLY TWO STITCHING TOOLS. THESE STITCHING TOOLS ENABLE US TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE THROUGH THE THICKNESS STRENGTHS. SO WHAT YOU CAN DO IS DROP THE AFP HEAD, IF YOU'RE PLACING WAS DRY FIBER PLACEMENTS, STITCHING DOESN'T WORK WITH RESIN SYSTEMS. AND ACTUALLY USE THE, UH, STITCHING TOOLS TO PROVIDE THIS THROUGH THE THICKNESS. AND THIS IS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT. ANOTHER HEAD YOU CAN SEE AT THE END IS A BLADE CUTTER. SO IT HAS ACTUALLY-- IT HAS ACTUALLY A BLADE, WHERE ACTUALLY WE CAN PRODUCE-- WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY PRODUCE SHAPES, AND AFTER WE LAYUP, BEFORE WE MOVE ONTO THE CURING PROCESS, WE CAN ACTUALLY COME WITH THE BLADE AND CUT INTRICATE AND COMPLEX, UH, SHAPES. SO THIS PRESENTS THE AFP ROOM. WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO NEXT BEFORE WE ACTUALLY START PUTTING THE ROBOT INTO MOTION IS WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT WHAT GOVERNS AFP. AND WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE AFP PROCESS. SO WE'RE GONNA MOVE BACK NEXT TO THE AFP HEAD. AND WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT FIVE THINGS. THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS THAT CONTROLS THE QUALITY OF THE LAMINATE THAT, UM, THAT WE END UP GETTING. THERE ARE FOUR PROMINENT PROCESS PARAMETERS. THAT WE TALK ABOUT SPEED, WE TALK ABOUT COMPACTION, WE TALK ABOUT PRESSURE, AND WE TALK ABOUT, UH, THE TOW TENSION. THESE ARE THE FOUR PROMINENT PROCESS PARAMETERS. HOWEVER, A FIFTH ONE-- AND THIS IS WHY WE ARE IN A CLEAN ROOM, IS ACTUALLY THE ENVIRONMENT. CONTROLLING THE TEMPERATURE, CONTROLLING THE HUMIDITY, THE PARTICLE COUNT, AND SO ON. NOW, THERE ARE OTHER VARIABLES BUT THESE ARE THE FIVE PROMINENT AFP PROCESS. IF YOU WANT TO GET YOUR AFP PROCESS UNDER CONTROL, THESE ARE THE FIVE ONES. SO SINCE WE TALKED ALREADY ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT IN MY PRESENTATION OF THE CLEAN ROOM, WE'RE GONNA SKIP THAT, AND WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE FOUR ELEMENTS OF THE AFP PROCESS. SO WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE HEAT, WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE COMPACTION, WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE SPEED, AND WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE TOW TENSION. ALL RIGHT, PERFECT. SO, WITH RESPECT TO HEAT, IN HERE, WE HAVE AN IR HEATER. THIS IS-- AN IR HEATER WORKS GREAT WITH THERMOSET MATRIX, UH, ELEMENTS. THIS IS WHAT PROVIDES THE HEAT AND THE AFP PROCESS. I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND EXPLAIN THAT FOR A SECOND. WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE IS YOU HAVE THE FIRST PLY THAT YOU HAVE LAID AND THE HEAT MECHANISM IS ACTUALLY NOT HEATING THE TOWS THAT YOU ARE FEEDING OUT. IN THIS SETUP I'LL TALK IN A SECOND ABOUT HOW WE CAN HAVE HEATING FOR THE TOWS, BUT IN THIS SETUP, AND IN AFP SETUPS, THE HEAT MECHANISM ACTUALLY IS HEATING THE UNDERLYING LAYER. AND THE NEW TOWS THAT ARE BEING PLACED, ARE GONNA-- WE'RE PROVIDING ENOUGH TACKINESS, SO ACTUALLY THAT THEY WOULD ADHERE TO EACH OTHER. NO THIS IS OF COURSE IN THE CONTEXT OF IR HEATERS. I MENTIONED BEFORE HAVING-- USING OTHER, UH, MATRIX SYSTEMS SUCH AS THERMOPLASTICS WITHIN THE WORLD OF THERMOPLASTICS, WE'VE USED, UH, HOT GAS TORCHES, WE'VE USED-- WE ARE USING NOWADAY LASER HEAT. SO THERE ARE OTHER HEATING MECHANISMS. HOWEVER BY DEFAULT, THE MOST PROMINENT ONE ON AFP MACHINES WITH THERMOSET IS DEFINITELY IR HEATERS. SO NOW THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AFP HEAT, WE CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ROLLER AND ABOUT THE MECHANISM THAT PROVIDES THE COMPACTION. A SECOND COMPONENT OF THE AFP PROCESS IS ACTUALLY THE COMPACTION FORCE. ONE HUNDRED POUNDS, TWO HUNDRED POUNDS... AND IT HAS SEVERAL, UH, SEVERAL REASONS. ONE OF THE REASONS IS YOU'RE ACTUALLY REMOVING SOME OF THE VOIDS AS IF YOU ARE APPLYING A CERTAIN PRESSURE TO REMOVE THE VOIDS, BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY THE REASON. WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS YOU'RE TRYING FIRST OF ALL TO MINIMIZE AFP DEFECTS SUCH AS BRIDGING AND WHATNOT. SO LET'S SAY WHEN WE HAVE-- LET'S SAY WHEN WE HAVE A CERTAIN SHAPE, AND THE ROLLER IS COMING ON TOP OF IT, YOU MIGHT HAVE-- YOU MIGHT END UP WITH WHAT WE CALL A BRIDGE. AND BY HAVING THE COMPACTION AND THE ROLLER FORCE, YOU ACTUALLY REMOVE THOSE, UH, BRIDGES. THE SPEED IS ACTUALLY VERY, VERY IMPORTANT. THIS WHOLE MECHANISMS TOGETHER ACTS IN CONCERT TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE THE VALUE OF THE SPEED AND TOW TENSION IS HOW YOU MAINTAIN YOUR TOWS UNDER TENSION DURING THE PLACEMENT. WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE DOING NOW THAT WE HAVE-- HOPEFULLY YOU'RE CONVINCED COMPOSITE ARE IMPORTANT AND COMPOSITE MANUFACTURING. AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE AFP TERMINOLOGY AND THE AFP PROCESS-- I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO THE OTHER SIDE, TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE PREPARED AND THE PLACEMENT THAT WE HAVE PREPARED. AND THEN WE'RE GONNA ACTUALLY START TRYING THE MACHINE AND YOU'LL STOP HEARING ME TALKING A LOT. SO, I'M GONNA MOVE TO THE OTHER SIDE. ALL RIGHT, SO, TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT, UH, WHAT WE ARE SEEING IN HERE. UH, WHAT WE HAVE IN HERE IS, WE HAVE PLACED A LAYER OF MYLAR. THIS IS-- WE ARE USING THE TABLE AS A TOOL. UM, WE CAN AS SIMPLE AS PLACE A COMPLEX TOOL ON THE TABLE, AND AS WELL USE IT. RIGHT NOW SINCE WE ARE DOING A DEMONSTRATION OF A FLAT PANEL, WE ARE PLACING IT DIRECTLY ON THE TOOL. WE HAVE THE MYLAR WHERE WE'RE MAINTAINING IT UNDER VACUUM. WE HAVE THE BREATHERS AND BASICALLY WE-- AND THIS IS PART OF THE GOOD PRACTICES. WE HAVE CREATED A GRID ON THE PANEL. AND LIKE THIS IN THE DOCUMENTATION PROCESS, WHEN WE SEE A CERTAIN DEFECT AND WE WANT TO REPLACE IT, WE CAN ACTUALLY DO THAT VERY EASILY. WE HAVE LEFT INTENTIONALLY TWO DEFECTS-- SEVERAL DEFECTS THAT ACTUALLY YOU NEEDED TO REPLACE USUALLY. SOME OF THEM IS SPLICES. SPLICES IS A NATURAL DEFECT THAT OCCUR BECAUSE OF THE MATERIAL, THE SPOOL, CANNOT BE-- YOU CANNOT HAVE INFINITE LENGTHS OF THE SPOOL. AND AS SUCH, WHAT HAPPENS IS WE END UP CREATING A MATCH BETWEEN TWO TOWS, AND THEY END UP IN A SPLICE. USUALLY YOU HAVE TO REMOVE THAT. AND ACTUALLY, YOU HAVE TO REPAIR THAT. OTHER DEFECTS CAN BE SUCH AS TOW WANDERING. AND THE GRID SYSTEM ACTUALLY ENABLES ME TO SAY AND TO LOCATE ALL RIGHT, IN C, 4, 5, I HAVE A SPLICE AND I NEED TO REPAIR THAT. AND WE WILL BE SEEING SHORTLY AFTER WE DO, UH, PLY NUMBER 3, WE WILL SEE A LITTLE BIT THE INSPECTION PROCESS. SO, LET ME MOVE TO THE OTHER SIDE, AND ACTUALLY WE'LL START RUNNING THE MACHINE. SO, VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE MACHINE IS, UH, PUT IN A SAFE, UH, STATE. I'M GONNA ASK MY FRIEND JAKE IN HERE TO ACTUALLY, UH, RUN FOR US A DEMONSTRATION OF MOBILITY. SO WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT THE MOTION OF THE ROBOT AND HOW THE ROBOT ACTUALLY, UM, MOVES-- AND WE CALL THIS THE SWING DANCE. AS YOU'RE DOING THAT, I WILL BE COMMENTING ON WHAT IT TAKES TO REACH A STAGE OF MANUFACTURING FROM, UH, PROGRAMMING, SIMULATION AND DRY RUNS. SO, LET'S GO AHEAD AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE SWING MOTION. SO WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IS CERTAIN JOINTS OF THE ROBOT ARE MOVING. AND WE ARE DEMONSTRATING HOW WE CAN ACTUALLY REACH CERTAIN POSITIONS AND CERTAIN COMPLEX POSITIONS. WHILE YOU ARE SEEING THAT, WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT IS HOW DO WE GET TO THE POINT OF ACTUALLY MANUFACTURING A COMPOSITE PART? FIRST OF ALL, WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE DESIGN PROCESS AND USING CERTAIN SOFTWARE. HERE AT NASA, WE USE VCP, UH, BY CGTECH TO ACTUALLY CREATE THE G-CODE. SO ONCE AGAIN, YOU-YOU'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE. G-CODES ARE VERY IMPORTANT EVEN IF THE MACHINES REQUIRE UNDERSTANDING OF G-CODE. ONCE YOU HAVE THE CODE OF ACTUALLY HOW YOU'RE ACTUALLY BUILDING YOUR LAMINATE, YOU NEED TO VERIFY-- YOU NEED TO RUN A CERTAIN SIMULATION BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY GO TO THE ROBOT. AND YOU CAN SEE IN HERE THE A6 MOTION. THIS WAS THE-- THE FULL SWING ROTATION. THAT WAS THE A6, UH, AXIS. NOW SEVERAL OTHER AXISES ARE ACTING IN-IN CONCERT MODE. I WANT YOU TO CONCENTRATE BEFORE I CONTINUE TALKING ABOUT PROGRAMMING ABOUT THE MOTION THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN NOW. AS YOU CAN TELL, ALL THE MECHANISM IS MOVING, HOWEVER THE HEAD IS STATIONARY. THIS IS WHAT WE CALL H.A. THIS IS WHAT WE CALL HIGH ACCURACY. YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONTROL A CERTAIN POSITION, NO MATTER WHAT ELSE IS ACTUALLY MOVING. SO GOING BACK AS THE ROBOT IS CONTINUING ITS SWING DOWNS, GOING BACK TO THE PROGRAMMING, WE HAVE FINISHED, WE HAVE THE G-CODE. THE NEXT STEP AFTER THE G-CODE, ACTUALLY, WE HAVE TO VERIFY SIMULATION. WHAT IS THE SIMULATION? RO-- THE ROBOT RIGHT NOW WILL BE IN AGREEMENT WITH ME. IT'S GONNA NOD ITS, UH, ITS HEAD AT THE END. THE SIMULATION IS WHEN WE TAKE THE SOFTWARE THAT MIMICS THE MACHINE KINEMATICS AND ACTUALLY WE VERIFY JOINT LIMITS AND WE VERIFY ACCESSIBILITY AND COLLUSION. BASICALLY WHAT WE WILL VERIFY THAT THE MACHINE WILL NOT HIT ANYTHING AS WE ARE RUNNING THE CODE THAT WE NEED TO RUN. AND ISAAC IS IN AGREEMENT WITH WHAT I JUST SAID, SO NOW YOU CAN BE SURE THAT I'M NOT LYING TO YOU. SO NOW THAT WE HAVE RUN-- WE HAVE FINISHED THE PROGRAMMING PORTION OF IT, A VERY IMPORTANT THING TO MOVE IS TO ACTUALLY TAKE A LOOK AT THE DRY-RUN OF THE AFP MACHINE. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE DRY-RUN, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT DOES IT DEFINITELY DO AS THE NEXT STEP, THE DRY-RUN IS ACTUALLY WHEN, INSTEAD OF PLACING OUT THE MATERIAL, WE ACTUALLY RUN THE WHOLE PROGRAM WITHOUT LAYING UP THE MATERIAL. AND WE VERIFY THAT ACTUALLY IT WILL BE BEHAVE AS EXPECTED. AND WE ACTUALLY DO IT ON-- AT SLOW SPEEDS AND TAKING ALL KINDS OF PRECAUTIONS POSSIBLE. WHEN WE'RE DOING THAT, WE ARE NOW SURE, JUST LIKE HOW WE'VE ALREADY DRY-RUN THE PLIES THAT WE-- WE ARE DOING TODAY, WE ARE SURE THAT THE ROBOT WILL BEHAVE THE SAME MANNER EVERY TIME WE'RE RUNNING THE PLY. SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO NOW IS I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND LAUNCH, UH, THE PLY THREE, THE MANUFACTURING OF PLY THREE. THEN I'M GONNA ASK MY FRIEND JAKE AGAIN TO TAKE OVER THE CONTROL OF THE ROBOT AFTER I LAUNCH IT. AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SMALL INTERVIEW WITH THE ISAAC LEAD, UH, DAWN JEGLEY. SO WHAT I'M GONNA BE DOING IN HERE IS-- SO THIS IS A LITTLE BIT THE INTERFACE, THE-THE HMI OF, UH, OF ISAAC. WHAT I'M GONNA BE DOING HERE IS-- THIS IS A PROGRAM LIST. WE HAVE ALREADY HAVE THE SEV-SEVERAL PLIES. I'M GONNA REACTIVATE, UM, MY PLY THREE, WHICH IS, AS I TOLD YOU, IS A ZERO DEGREE. AND YOU CAN SEE IN HERE, PLY THREE AND THE BUILD UP OF MY COMPOSITE. AND YOU CAN SEE THE SEVERAL COURSES. SO WE WILL START THE ACTIVATED PROGRAM. AND AS YOU CAN TELL WITH THE MACHINE MOTION... WE'RE GONNA START WITH THE ACTUAL LAYOUT OF THE PROCESS. SO RIGHT NOW, WHAT'S-- WHAT WILL TAKE PLACE IS ACTUALLY WE'RE GONNA START LAYING OUT COURSE ONE. AND WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS I'M GONNA REDUCE DOWN THE SPEED. I'M GONNA GIVE THE CONTROLS TO-TO JAKE, AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SMALL CHAT WITH-WITH DAWN. GOOD MORNING, DAWN, HOW ARE YOU DOING?  GOOD MORNING, THANK YOU.  ALL RIGHT, DAWN, WHY ISAAC AT LANGLEY?  SO I WORK AT THE NASA LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER, AND AT A RESEARCH CENTER, OUR GOAL IS TO DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES FOR AIRCRAFT AND SPACECRAFT STRUCTURES. ISAAC ALLOWS US TO DEVELOP NEW MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES AND CAPABILITIES AND INCORPORATE THOSE INTO THE DESIGN OF NEW STRUCTURES. LANGLEY'S BEEN HERE FOR 100 YEARS, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY FOR AIRCRAFT AND SPACECRAFT, AND ISAAC WILL HELP US DO THAT.  THIS IS AWESOME. I'M GONNA ASK YOU ANOTHER QUESTION. HOW DO YOU SEE THE FUTURE OF AFP, OF AUTOMATED FIBER PLACEMENT?  AFP IS IN WIDESPREAD USE IN INDUSTRY TODAY. IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN WIDESPREAD USE. BUT ITS FULL CAPABILITIES AFTER TRENCHING ARE NOT BEING EXPLOITED. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO IS USE CURVED FIBER PATHS INSTEAD OF JUST THE STRAIGHT FIBERS. UM, THERE ARE OTHER NEW TECHNOLOGIES COMING ON BOARD. THESE WILL ALLOW US TO GET TO LIGHTER, MORE TAILORED AIRCRAFT, WHICH WILL LEAD TO MORE FUEL EFFICIENT AIRCRAFT IN THE FUTURE. LANGLEY WANTS TO PLAY A ROLE IN THAT AS WE MOVE ON.  ALL RIGHT, THIS IS AWESOME. THANK YOU SO MUCH, UH, DAWN, FOR SEVERAL THINGS, MOST IMPORTANTLY FOR ALLOWING US TO ACTUALLY BE HERE, UH, TODAY IN THE ROOM. DAWN IS ACTUALLY, UH, THE ONE THAT APPROVED THAT WE GO LIVE TODAY FROM NASA, SO THANK YOU SO MUCH, DAWN.  THANK YOU.  ALL RIGHT, COOL. SO NOW LET'S ENJOY AND WATCH A LITTLE BIT SOME OF THE PLACEMENT. SO WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND I'M GONNA COMMENT A LITTLE BIT ON THE MANUFACTURING THAT IS TAKING PLACE LIVE ON THE OTHER CAMERA. SO WHAT WE CAN SEE IN HERE IS-- AND WE ARE PLACING-- WE HAD A 90 DEGREES LAYER THAT WAS PLACED BEFORE THIS ONE. AND RIGHT NOW WE ARE PLACING A ZERO DEGREE PLY. YOU CAN SEE THE SEVERAL COURSES AND HOW WE ARE BUILDING THE LAMINATE. NOW WHEN YOU SEE THE FLASH, THIS IS ACTUALLY THE HEATING MECHANISM. THE HEATING MECHANISM THAT IS PROVIDING THE HEAT FOR THE UNDERLYING LAYER AS WE ARE PUTTING THE ADDITIONAL TOWS ON TOP OF THIS, UH-- ON TOP OF THIS LAMINATE. YOU CAN SEE HOW THE WHOLE-- HOW THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS ACTING IN CONCERT TO ACTUALLY PERFORM THIS PLACEMENT. SO I WANNA TALK ABOUT ONE SPECIFIC THING THAT YOU ARE SEEING IN FRONT OF YOU IS ACTUALLY WHAT WE CALL BI-DIRECTIONAL PLACEMENT. AS YOU CAN TELL, THE ROBOT, WHEN IT REACHES AT THE END OF A CERTAIN STATE, IT ROTATES THE A-6 AXIS, ROTATES IN THIS LOCATION, AND ACTUALLY STARTS THE PLACEMENT ON THE OTHER SIDE. SO AS THE PLY IS BEING PLACED, WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND TALK A LITTLE BIT WITH, UH, JAKE TURY. JAKE IS OUR, UH, PROCESS PLANNER. JAKE, SO I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU.  YES.  FIRST ONE IS YOU ARE A PROCESS PLANNER, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?  WELL, AS A PROCESS PLANNER, I ACT AS SORT OF A BRIDGE BETWEEN THE DESIGNERS AND MANUFACTURING. SO I WORK WITH THE DESIGNER TO ENSURE THAT A DESIGN CAN BE MANUFACTURED BASED ON OUR CURRENT MANUFACTURING RESOURCES. I THEN TAKE THAT DESIGN, I PROGRAM A PART, I SIMULATE THAT PART ON A VIRTUAL ROBOT, AND THEN I DRY-RUN THAT PART WITHOUT MATERIAL ON A NASA ROBOT TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN BUILD IT BASED ON THE ROBOT'S SCHEMATICS. THEN DURING THE ENTIRE PROCESS, I PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO THE DESIGNERS TO ENSURE THAT IF WE BUILD ANOTHER PART, WE CAN IMPROVE THE PROCESS FROM A MANUFACTURING PERSPECTIVE.  SO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME, IT'S NOT YOU PRESS A BUTTON SOMEWHERE AND WE GET THE COMPOSITE PART?  IN A PERFECT WORLD, BUT SADLY, IT IS NOT.  THAT'S NOT THE CASE?  IT'S A BIT MORE COMPLICATED.  ALL RIGHT, JAKE, WE'RE GONNA-- I'M GONNA LET YOU GO BACK TO THE CONTROL. WE'RE GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT AGAIN TOGETHER ABOUT BOOKKEEPING AND ABOUT INSPECTION AS WE GO BACK IN-INSIDE THE ROOM.  OF COURSE.  ALL RIGHT, AWESOME. THANK YOU SO MUCH, JAKE. SO WE'RE GONNA TAKE A LOOK BACK INTO SEVERAL OF THE COURSES THAT ARE BEING PLACED RIGHT NOW. SO OBSERVE ONCE AGAIN, UH, THE MOTION. YOU CAN SEE THE SPOOLS PROVIDING THE MATERIAL. THEY ARE BEING FED THROUGH THE DIFFERENT MECHANISMS AND TWO DIFFERENT GUIDES, AND THEY ARE BEING RELEASED, ACTUALLY, FROM, UM, NEXT BETWEEN THE ROLLER AND ACTUALLY THE SPOOL. AND YOU CAN SEE AT THE OPERATOR STATION, WE ARE IN COMPLETE CONTROL OF THE PROCESS, WHAT'S HAPPENING. AND IF AN ISSUE HAPPENS, A DEFECT HAPPENS AT A CERTAIN INSTANT, WE CAN STOP THE MACHINE IF WE WANT TO, WE CAN RETRACT IT, AND WE CAN CONTINUE THE-- WE CAN FIX THE ERROR THAT WE HAVE AT HAND AND CONTINUE THE MANUFACTURING. I'M GONNA LET YOU ENJOY THE LA-THE LAST COUPLE OF COURSES BEFORE WE ACTUALLY RETRACT THE ROBOT AND WE GO INSIDE TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT. ONCE YOU FINISH FROM EVERY PLY, YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY INSPECT IT. AND AS YOU ARE INSPECTING IT, YOU ARE LOOKING FOR WHAT YOU CAN CORRECT. AND WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT INSPECTION MECHANISMS, AND THEN YOU HAVE TO PROPERLY DOCUMENT IT. SO... WE ARE IN COURSE THIRTY. WE STILL HAVE TWO COURSES TO GO. THE MACHINE SOUNDS IS ACTUALLY MUSIC. I'LL LET YOU ENJOY IT FOR A MINUTE. JUST LIKE WATCHING A RACE, A CAR RACE. ALL RIGHT, SO WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND PARK THE ROBOT ON THE OTHER SIDE IN ORDER TO GO INSIDE AND PERFORM THE INSPECTION, THE REPAIRS THAT WE NEED TO REPAIR, AS WELL AS DO THE BOOKKEEPING AND THE DOCUMENTATION. SO THE ROBOT RIGHT NOW IS MOVING ALONG ITS A-1 AXIS. NOW THE RAIL IS PUSHING IT BACK. AND THEN WE'RE GONNA MOVE ALONG THE A-1 AXIS AGAIN TO PARK THE ROBOT AND PARK THE HEAD. ALL RIGHT, JAKE, AM I ALLOWED TO GO INSIDE? PERFECT. SAFETY FIRST. ALL RIGHT, SO, AT THIS STAGE, WHAT WE'RE DOING IS, WE HAVE OUR PLY BOOK. WE'RE GONNA TALK A SECOND ABOUT THAT. WE HAVE SOME OF THE REPAIR ELEMENTS THAT WE NEED. AND I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND PUT ON MY GLASSES. AND IF I NEED TO TOUCH THE MATERIAL, I HAVE TO ACTUALLY, UH, USE THE GLOVES. SO WHAT I WAS START-- WHAT WE STILL DOING IS, ACTUALLY, WE START TAKING A LOOK AT THE LAMINATE AND TRY TO SEE IF WE CAN FIND CERTAIN DEFECTS. JAKE, YOU DID A, UH-- YOU DID A BAD JOB. I CANNOT FIND ANY DEFECTS TO SHOW THEM. SO, ACTUALLY, IT'S A GOOD JOB. THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT. YOU DON'T WANT DEFECTS. SO-- AND THEN YOU START LOOKING AT-- WE'RE GONNA- WE'RE GONNA SUPPOSE THAT THIS, THOUGH, THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH IT. YOU COME AND YOU ACTUALLY REMOVE THE TOW IN QUESTION. AND LET'S SAY THERE WAS A CERTAIN SPECIFIC DEFECT. I'M GONNA GO GET CLOSE TO THE CAMERA. AND THEN YOU TAKE ANOTHER TOW, A FRESH TOW, AND YOU ACTUALLY GO AHEAD AND PLACE THAT TOW AND REPAIR IT. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT AFP INCLUDES A LOT OF ARTS AND CRAFT. AND THIS IS BECAUSE THERE IS MANUAL REPAIRS IN CASE YOU END UP HAVING CERTAIN DEFECTS. ALL RIGHT, SO, THIS BRINGS US TO TALK ABOUT THE-- THE FOLLOWING AFP DEFECTS. WHAT WE HAVE IS-- NOW THAT WE HAVE DONE THE PLACEMENT, WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE LOOKING TO APPROXIMATELY 15, 16 AFP DEFECTS, AND WE'RE TRYING TO REPLACE THEM AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIX THEM. WHAT ARE THE AFP DEFECTS THAT ARE POSSIBLE? YOU CAN HAVE DEFECTS SUCH AS A TWIST. SO BASICALLY, AS YOU CAN SEE IN HERE, THE TOW TWISTS AT ITSELF. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL INFLUENCE, IT WILL MASSIVELY INFLUENCE THE RESPONSE TO THE DESIGN THAT ACTUALLY YOU DESIGNED YOUR COMPOSITE ON. SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO FIX. ANOTHER POSSIBLE DEFECT IS-- I'LL TAKE THE OTHER SIDE FROM IT, IS ACTUALLY A FOLD. SO IF THE TOW FOLDS ON ITSELF. WHAT THIS HAPPENS IS ACTUALLY MAKES ONE TOW AS WAS A DOUBLE THICKNESS AND IT CREATES A VOID. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT AFP DEFECTS, THERE ARE FOUR PROMINENT ONES. OF COURSE, ALL DEFECTS ARE IMPORTANT, ALL PROCESS PARAMETERS ARE IMPORTANT, BUT THERE ARE FOUR PROMINENT, UH, DEFECTS. WE TALK ABOUT GAPS, WE TALK ABOUT OVERLAPS, WE TALK ABOUT ANGLE DEVIATION, AND WE TALK ABOUT WRINKLE THAT ARE COMING FROM STEERING VIOLATIONS, WHEN YOU ARE CREATING AN ANGLE WITH YOUR PLY-- WITH YOUR-WITH YOUR TOWS. WE'RE GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT BOOKKEEPING, WHICH IS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT. SO THIS IS A PROCEDURE. I'M GONNA ASK JAKE TO COME AND CHAT WITH US A LITTLE BIT. SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT-THAT I TOTALLY LOVE. CAN YOU-CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS BOOKKEEPING PROCESS?  OF COURSE. SO WE CALL IT A PLYBOOK, AND WE USE IT TO CAPTURE AS MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT BUILDS AS WE CAN, EVERYWHERE FROM MATERIAL INFORMATION, ITS-ITS OUTLIFE ALONG-- OUT OF THE FREEZER, HOW OLD IT IS, WHO MADE IT, UH, WHAT TYPE OF MATERIAL IT IS. AND THEN WE CAPTURE INFORMATION ABOUT THE ACTUAL, UH, AFP, INCLUDING THE TIME IT'S TAKEN TO LAY DOWN THE-THE-THE COURSE, THE TIME IT'S TAKEN TO, UM, DO ANY REPAIRS, TO TAKE PICTURES. AND WE RECORD THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, UH, TEMPERATURE, HUMIDITY AND THE PROCESS CONDITIONS, UH, SPEED, COMPACTION AND TOW TENSION.  ALL RIGHT, THIS IS AWESOME. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE SHOULD BE A STANDARD IN ANY AFP, UH, PLACEMENT FACILITY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. SO BEFORE WE START WITH THE Q&A AND WITH THE FINAL PORTION OF, UH, OF OUR, UH-- OF OUR LIVE FROM NASA LANGLEY TODAY, I'M JUST GONNA REFER TO INSPECTION METHODS, WHAT YOU SAW ME-- THIS IS-THIS IS WHAT WE REFER TO THE ROLE OF THE HUMAN IN THE AFP PROCESS. THE INSPECTION METHOD, WHICH IS MANUAL, WHICH YOU SAW ME GO AND LOOK AND ACTUALLY TRY TO FIND THOSE AFP DEFECTS. THERE IS A LOT OF EFFORTS, AND AS LANGLEY AND OTHER PLACES ARE DOING EFFORTS ON ACTUALLY AUTOMATING THE INSPECTION, UH, TECHNIQUE. AND THEY CAN BE BASED ON THERMOGRAPHY. THEY CAN BE BASED ON PROFILOMETRY AND OTHER TYPES OF, UH, OF SYSTEMS. IT WAS VERY EXCITING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT AFP. I HOPE THAT, UM, I WAS ABLE TO IN A VERY GOOD MANNER TO REPRESENT HOW MUCH NASA LANGLEY IS AT THE CUTTING EDGE OF TECHNOLOGY. WE'RE TRYING NEW THINGS. WE'RE TRYING NEW METHODOLOGIES TO COME UP WITH LIGHTER AND WITH BETTER METHODS TO ACTUALLY CREATE THINGS THAT WILL ENHANCE-- UH, WILL ENHANCE OUR LIVES. WITH THAT, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
