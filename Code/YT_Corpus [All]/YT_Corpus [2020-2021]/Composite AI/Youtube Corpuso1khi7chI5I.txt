 hey guys this is Eckhartsladder hello and welcome  to another star wars squadrons video over here on   x2 now we are covering squadrons more and more as  the game gets out and we really dig into it so if   you're enjoying these type of videos make sure  to subscribe and consider supporting the channel   either through patreon or joining the discord or  whatever else we'll be covering lots of in-game   strategies best loadouts kind of first impressions  on whatever so make sure you stick around anyway   today i want to talk generally about the best  tactics and loadouts for attacking enemy capital   ships and we've got a lot to talk about here  so i just want to jump right into things with   a brief discussion about the classes that you  can actually use to take on capital ships now   it is true that bombers are perhaps best  situated for taking on enemy capital ships   not necessarily because of their hull strength  but rather because of the equipment and the   weapons they get but that notwithstanding you can  also do devastating capital ship attacks using   interceptors and fighters for both the alliance  and the empire but in my opinion especially the   empire so let's talk about that our first topic  will be precision strikes using fighters and   interceptors however we've gotta lay some basic  principles down first there's a few things that   are necessary when attacking an enemy capital  ship first of all you need to know where you're   targeting large capital ships i.e the mc75 and the  isd2 have systems weapons and tractor beams while   smaller ships usually have just weapons first of  all even when attacking a frigate or corvette you   should be trying to knock out any guns because it  will make subsequent attacks less deadly however   when it comes to the large flagships you'll  need to use your targeting to go through capital   subsystems and if you just have a basic xbox or  playstation 4 controller this is something you   can do with the targeting wheel but if you have  a hodus or a keyboard i recommend you set target   subsystems as a hotkey either way once you've got  your point of attack finalized you want to attack   at an intelligent time because if you just run in  and play the game solo you probably will get blown   out of the sky either by a defending capital  ship or a series of fighters instead you want   to time your attack in a way that makes sense now  that's fairly vague and that's sort of on purpose   an attack can make sense if most of the enemy is  away from the target but it can also make sense   if you're coordinating with friendly assets a  simple thing to do is just attack alongside a   corvette enemy fighters will be preoccupied with  fighting the corvette as much as fighting you   or alternatively if you're safe facing off  against the two frigates you can attack the   other base while most attention is elsewhere but  enough generalities let's talk about this one   specific strategy when playing as a fighter or an  interceptor you can take a huge gamble and focus   on a capital ship subsystem there's two ways to  damage a capital ship first of all you can take   down the shield then attack the vessel or you  can fly under the shield and attack the hull and   systems directly i've had a lot of success making  an interceptor loadout meant to do just this   fly under the capital ship's shields destroy a  hardpoint and move on and if you're good and maybe   a little bit lucky you can destroy a hardpoint in  one run and even live to survive there are however   principles you need to follow when doing this  attack first of all if you have shields before   launching the raid get them fully powered when  actually attacking the capital ship itself even   if you do have a good distraction or covering fire  you want to maintain constant speed and mobility   until the point of attack move back and forth go  full power to engines don't stop moving however   once you've reached the target you'll want to stop  right in front of it and quite simply unload as   much as you can into the hardpoint imperial ships  have a decided advantage here because you can use   your advanced power shunting technique to keep  your weapons at full power basically indefinitely   now it means that you're extremely vulnerable but  taking out a capital ship subsystem is worth dying   especially if you can do it in one shot and some  of this comes down to loadout preparedness as well   if you're in a fighter or interceptor and you  know you're going to do this you'll want to   take a loadout that will be effective at this  task maybe that means something like blind fire   rock it's where you can just continue firing them  and because you're so close up you don't need to   worry about lock-on alternatively i've personally  had a lot of luck with the barrage missile either   way once you've destroyed your target either  continue moving and look for another or bug out   of battle because your job is done let's move on  to bombers now and talk some basic strategy first   of all bombers are very slow when i talked about  coordinating attack runs earlier i think if you   watch yesterday's live stream where we played with  the full team you'll get a good idea of what that   might look like whenever a bomber on our team was  attacking the enemy capital ship we tried to have   it covered by fighters basically they would fly  alongside the bomber if anyone started harassing   the ship they would try to chase them off or  destroy it and what's more in cases where we   had two or more bombers we would try to coordinate  attacks that way even if one is destroyed there's   still a chance to get some serious damage off  anyway just now i referred to loadouts first   of all to keep it simple if you're building a  bomber meant primarily to take on capital ships   use the rotary cannon it's unguided but  it seems to be the best option available   at this moment for a bomber at least until we get  any sort of nerf basically you spin the blaster   up then it fires indefinitely it's really really  effective the up close attack we discussed earlier   can actually work really well with a bomber  instead of an interceptor as well but you do   have to make some changes one element that helps  the interceptor or fighter be successful is its   speed that's not available to the bomber so you  need to make up for it with sheer firepower and   survivability usually if i'm going to go for  a precision attack on subsystems i'll go with   the rotary laser the high powered charge laser  plus another weapon or the assault shield that   heavy laser slash rotary laser combination that  i just mentioned actually works really well for   destroying unshielded targets generally however  there are other options including heavy missiles   and whatever else however that's only one role  in one way that an interceptor can to be played   so let's talk about some others and at least ones  that i use first of all i find that the early   stages of attacking capital ships whether that's  on the frigate stage of the battle or the flagship   stage involved taking down the ship's shields i've  got a loadout made specifically for bombing runs   and it contains ion bombs and proton bombs if you  throw these together not only will you take down   the shield of a ship but you'll also damage the  hull when it comes to the specific loadout aside   from the weapons i've got a few principles which  help me out here i like to use the jet engines   because they provide you with extreme speed  although apparently only for a short period   of time if you're playing empire however you  can use the emergency power shunt to give   more power to your engines to keep you moving  faster for longer the obvious issue with advanced   imperial power management is if you're powering  your engines for example there's literally the   possibility that you drain your weapons completely  to the point where they're no longer functional   now within certain thai bomber layouts that may  be problematic but for an actual bomber class   where you're dropping ion bombs and proton bombs  that's really completely fine you help your speed   bring you to the target you fire off as much as  you can then you get out of there which moves us   on to our next two points first of all when it  comes to actual bombing runs there is a little   indicator to show that yeah there's a ship under  you generally you'll want to drop your ordinance   get the ship shields down if you can which you  can often do in a single run even if it is the   flagship then get back to a resupply point  and live to fight another day the resupplying   is crucial as bombers it allows your team to  continually make attack runs and this is one of   the reasons why you want to keep at least one of  your two cruisers alive for as long as possible if   you're playing a full bomber loadout with proton  bombs and ion bombs you can literally just drop   your bombs off get back resupply and continue to  attack that being said there is also a difference   between attacks meant to take down enemy shields  and attacks which will eventually kill the enemy   and this is one of the reasons why you want to be  flexible with your bomber loadout maybe if you get   the shields down and you get back to the flagship  and not only do you resupply but you switch   classes completely if you're not doing this on a  death you can do so very very quickly especially   with smart power management alternatively when we  were playing last night typically i would go in   heavy with my double bomb loadout help drop the  shield and then any other bombers in the match   could then focus on hull damage and if it was  the final ship sub system damage which is really   important if you can get the shields down you  have a lot more room for error when attacking the   flagship and this is where you can use the rotary  cannon or the heavy composite beam from a distance   when it comes to which capital ship components to  target in which order a lot of that comes down to   personal preference i like to take down the shield  first because i see that as the main detriment for   future bombing runs but on the other hand it's  nice to take down the ship's targeting first   because once that's dead resistance becomes a lot  lighter either way regardless of the order you do   it you should endeavor to take down the shield  generators the power generator and the sensors   after which you'll start seeing weak points on  the ship which you can attack for massive damage   destroy those take the ship's hp down and you've  won if you don't manage to take the capital ship   down you will be driven back to the defense  and although it is tempting to switch to an   interceptor and if you have the time feel free  to do so bombers can certainly hold their own   if the enemy is desperate to take on your  capital ships you can literally sit with   a bomber fire ear heavy weapons and take down  incoming ships bombers are the sturdiest thing   on the battlefield especially if there's something  like the assault ship and if you're loaded up with   the rotary cannon you can output a lot of damage  so you're essentially standing between the enemy   and your ship the only downside of course being  that you're not very nimble whatsoever and you   need to have a really good aim but guys that'll  be all for me today just to summarize my points   very quickly here first step when taking down  an enemy capital ship is knowing the difference   between ion damage and hull subsystem damage  use whichever one you need for a given situation   capital ship attacks are not limited only  to bombers however bombers should attempt to   resupply and survive after they've launched  their ordinance there are several techniques that   can help with the nuances of fighting capital  ships including targeting specific subsystems   using teamwork and the ai to your advantage  and just generally you need to find a good   balance between being aggressive and not giving  the other team pointless death for loadouts i   recommend the rotary cannon for pretty much  any bomber loadout the ion bombs do a great   job with taking down shields and you have  a lot of them and i think the beam weapon   is a good choice for hull damage that of course  is just my opinion make sure you make several   bomber classes with whatever specifics you like  anyway guys until next time please
