 we're building new tools to accelerate how scientists can discover new materials [Music] everything is a computing platform these days not just our phones but our watches our cars as computer chips become ubiquitous we really need to make certain that all the materials that are used are sustainable as possible we are trying to use advanced simulation including quantum computing ai deep search and advanced automation to help us develop better and more sustainable materials that are used in the production of computer chips more sustainable materials and manufacturing processes will enable more sustainable computing which will enable a more sustainable planet
