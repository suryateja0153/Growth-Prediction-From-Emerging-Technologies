 [Music] Kyle Faulkner here with our codec of Raleigh Durham come to you live from my home and beautiful Hillsboro North Carolina and I want to do a quick video on the care and maintenance for your composite deck all right here we've got timber tech low maintenance composite decking all rights the terrain addition and it's covered and pollen mildew algae dogs we got some some pot stains here a little bit of dirt and debris so about everything that you would expect to encounter on your deck at home so what we're going to do we're going to do two methods for you method number one a simple detergent and brush method where we're gonna put some detergent on it and clean it off with the brush and Method number two is we're gonna use a pressure washer and a rotary attachment and see how both of a match up and what kind of results we get so stay tuned for that so before you start check the care and maintenance recommendations for your specific and decking and railing and followed their approved procedures and list of cleaners all right you don't want to put something on there that could possibly damage or ruin the decking and railing products you have alright next go ahead and remove any furniture accessories from the deck and then go and either sweep or use a blower to remove large leaves any other debris that's a given item once the decks cleared off you can mix up your detergent solution and wet down a portion of the deck space you'll notice I'm working in small areas at a time and this prevents any cleaner from drying out on the decking which can leave a slight film or haze you can now go ahead and add your detergent solution with a soft bristled brush gently agitate and lift the dirt from the deck and rails surfaces all right you may want to use different size and style brushes depending on the surface you're working on as soon as you feel like you've got the deck and rail surfaces nice and clean go ahead and rinse off all the excess soap and detergent and move along to the next area you plan to tackle once the entire decks been cleaned and has had time to dry I think you'll be amazed at how much of a difference you can make with a little bit of soap and detergent and some light brushing all right so onto the pressure washer now look I can't stress it enough just how careful you need to be these things can really do a lot of damage to your deck and home so please use caution and take your time so like before you're going to start off by wetting the surface of the deck and railing and then go ahead and use the pressure washer to apply your detergent next go ahead at at your rotary cleaner and begin working it back and forth moving in the direction of the deck boards but this attachment here it's a Ryobi I've picked it up at homes depot for around 70 dollars and there's a variety of makes and manufacturers through these attachments just make sure whichever you choose it's compatible with your specific pressure Washington all right so here I just wanted to show you kind of halfway through how much of a difference this rotary attachment and pressure washers make you can see the area on the left is what we've already cleaned that black dirty space to the right is what's yet to be played some significant improvement of what was there before okay so now as we start to finish things up make our way over to the railings we're going to use that same method wet everything down use our detergent apply it on top of the railings and then go back over it with the lowest setting nozzle okay so the lightest pressure we can apply and just really take your time making sure not to damage the the paint or the finish on the railings themselves and fully rinse away all that dirty breath all right so we've got things all finished up here we've got both sides cleaned I got to tell you they look great and standing back looking at it I don't even know if I can tell the difference between what we did by hand and what we did with the pressure washer so both great methods to use the by hand section took me about 15 minutes pressure washer portion took me maybe ten if that so extremely quick extremely fast and you know much much less time than what it would take to do a traditional wood deck and pressure wash drip restain wreak lean so if you're thinking about doing composites you know it's a great time-saver and it looks fabulous year after year [Music] you
