 what is up people down here and today we're gonna be taking a look at a new piece of software that I've been trying out for the last couple of weeks that I am very excited about its Scylla m-- lumen r4 and I've been using it as a replacement for my normal photo editing software now originally when Scylla reached out to me and said they wanted me to try their new software and they wanted me to do a sponsored video for them about it I thought you know what I'll do a big overview on like everything you can do as far as editing a photo but it is just way way too much stuff like it would probably take me several hours to get through all of the different options that you have with this it really is an extensive piece of software so instead of doing a whole overview and making a whole big thing out of it I'm actually gonna do a quick overview and show you some of the different parts and pieces but then I'm also gonna show you six of my favorite parts of the software alright so one of the cool things about luminar is that if you're used to other software it's not gonna be that hard of a jump to get into it so we're looking at our library tab right now if I choose a photo and I go over to edit it's gonna take a second it's analyzing and then we can hop into our main panel here and we're gonna see some things that are very very familiar this is all stuff that we've seen in our other software before we've got color we can go through this entire thing and we can see what we can do from a base level standpoint but there's also some really cool stuff in there like AI enhance which we're going to talk about later ai structure and then on the right hand side here is where it really gets cool so the first tab is the essentials tab and if we go down from that we've got the creative tab so we got things like sky replacement sun rays what they call dramatic so we can make our photo more dramatic we've got the matte look Mystikal again making it look more mystical we've got lots a texture overlay built right into it a glow film grain and we can add fog so this is all stuff that you would have to take from like a basic editing software into something more like a Photoshop and start adding layers and that kind of stuff which you can actually do up here you can add more layers but it's got it dealt right in so you don't actually have to leave the software then if we go down from the creative tab we've also got a portrait tab so some tools specifically made for portraits and then below that we've got the professional tab so just some more tools that you can use stuff that again you might have to go into different pieces of software to do if you're using other photo editors so like I said there's a lot to dig in there so that's just like a really really quick overview of some of the things that are offered but now I want to get into my six favorite things that I've found so far and I'm sure there'll be more that I find later but these are my six favorite things that I've found so far in playing with luminar 4 ok the first thing that I want to talk about is just the layout and this seems like such a simple thing but I just like the way that the software looks so first and foremost when I'm in my library I can see on the right-hand side all the folders that I've added the album's are like what you would call collections if you're used to Lightroom so you can make specific collections of photos that you want to do the folders are actually folders on your hard drive so I can go in here and I can add any kind of a folder that I want so I've got my two different days of Victoria I've already added those so you click add and it just imports them just like that you can see them like this and I really love the way that this is laid out it's just nice and big on your screen you can see it either as a single photo with the bar on the left hand side where you can view all of your different photos in that folder or you can view it in this kind of grid mode and they're nice and big and they're easy to see it's just I don't know I just really like the way that it's laid out it makes everything seem really simple to get - really nice to see you can do your rating and your your favorites in the corner there so number one on my list is just the layout just the look of the software itself super simple I know but it's just something that I've really enjoyed so far now let's get into something a little bit more crazy for number two so number 2 on my list of my favorite things in luminar 4 is the sky replacer now this isn't something that might be useful on every photo but it can be something that can enhance your photos and give them kind of a crazy out-of-this-world look if that's what you're going for so we're gonna choose this photo we're gonna go up to edit and we're gonna go into the creative tab so we're gonna go to the AI sky replacement and all you have to do at this point is choose sky selection after it's done it's it's run its AI on it and it's figured out where the sky is choose sky selection and then pick from one of their automatically included skies so let's say we go with a dramatic sunset give it a second to process and bam we've got a dramatic sunset and it's done such a nice job you can just really dial in the way that it works so if we relight the scene it's going to affect more of the bottom part of the scene with that kind of you know the Golden Hour look position the horizon so if we want the horizon to move up or down we can blend the horizon a little bit more if we find that it needs kind of fine-tuning and if we go into the advanced settings we can defocus the sky so for example if we had kind of a shallow depth of field and the sky will should be a little bit out of focus we can actually defocus it we can flip it so that it's the other way the craziest part to me isn't necessarily all of the things that you can do to dial it in it's just the fact that it doesn't take a whole lot of time for it to assess where the sky is going to be and it does such a good job of cutting out and putting the sky where it needs to go so you can do some crazy things with it if we just reset this we choose another sky something maybe a little bit more realistic a nice blue sky like what was in the original one or you can go crazy and go with something like a galaxy sky like this and if you relight your scene a little bit you can make it look like they were out their nighttime skating and you've just got the crazy crazy Milky Way in the background there so again this is like something that was like a little out of this world but if that's what you're going for it does a really great job at it but moving on to number three this is something that I probably will use on a lot of the photos that I edit in luminar I'm gonna go to my essentials tab first and I'm just gonna choose a profile this is something that I do in almost any editing software that I use they give you not only the luminar default the Adobe standard and then they your camera profiles and typically I'll choose a camera standard or camera portrait in this case I think camera standard is going to give me a similar look to what I was seeing when I took the photo on the back of my camera obviously this is a very dark photo but before I even do anything to our exposure contrast high light shadows or even the curves I'm gonna close that and I'm gonna go to AI enhance and this is my third favorite thing in this software is this AI accent I'm just gonna start to drag this up now I'm gonna be completely honest I don't know specifically what this is trying to accomplish but I do know that AI meaning artificial intelligence it's taking a look at the photo and it's accenting the colors and the contrast and I don't even know what else there might be more going on in the background there but what I do know is that obviously you can overdo it but if you dial it in the right amount this works on so many photos it seems to bring out a lot of the shadows a lot of the main colors in the photo it gives it a nice contrast curve accent is the perfect word for it it just enhances it so nicely so just by using that AI accent no other adjustments whatsoever we go from what's obviously a underexposed photo that is kind of lacking in contrast and lacking in the the nice vivid colors and stuff and by using AI accent we've just dialed it in to be what's already a pretty nice looking photo and the only other thing that I might do looking at this photo is pull down the highlights just where that that leaf has a lot of reflections on it and stuff might just pull down those just a little bit and then maybe just bump it up just a little bit more on the exposure there we go so going from that to that it's looking pretty good so AI enhance being number three number four we're actually gonna apply to this same photo and that's moving over into the creative tab and going to the matte look I am a sucker for that vintage kind filmic look and it's really popular right now and it's easy enough to achieve sometimes if you go into your curves and you start to kind of pull up that bottom of the curve and create a bit of a contrast curve and then maybe pull down the highs that kind of thing you can get it going but it's never quite perfect I'm gonna reset that and we're just gonna go over to this creative tab go down to the mat look and we're just gonna start dragging up the amount and you can crank this pretty high and just like that all of a sudden you've got what looks like a nice vintage kind of filmic like look at what it's doing to the the shadows and the nice roll-off from black to gray in the back there and then if you really want to slap it with a faded kind of film look you can crank up the fade - personally I think you can keep that down pretty low and have just the amount up pretty high and then even in these nice and white bright parts there - it's kind of fading out the whites into a gray which is something that you would typically see on like a vintage film so we're getting that look with literally just two seconds of pulling this up and you're good to go so going from my dark gray muted contrast 'less ai enhance just a couple of little adjustments and then our matte look and all of a sudden we've got this very cool hip looking vintage photo of this leaf on this mossy rock moving on to number five is going to be the portrait tools so we're gonna choose a photo that actually is a portrait we're gonna make a couple of minor adjustments here to start with and then go into my light I'm gonna pull down the highlights because I obviously overexposed this a little bit on the skin just pull down the overall exposure I'm gonna choose my profile as camera portrait it's looking nicer and then I'm also going to use my AI enhance here just to go there so let's leave it like that for now and we're gonna go over into our portrait tab we're gonna focus on where these top two so the AI skin enhancer does is it looks for the face in the scene the skin in the scene and it's actually going to do your skin softening for you while trying to keep the texture in the skin so we're just gonna drag this up to a ridiculous amount this is gonna be way too much but just to show you the effect drag it up all the way you see that it picked only specifically the skin and softened it in the face but it still kept the texture so we're gonna dial that back to a more reasonable amount and it just saves you having to make like a pile of masks and stuff like this is a nice quick way to get this done quick and easy and you can still edit the masks everything that in this whole software seems to have this edit and ask button so you can still dial it in further if you want and then the next thing that we're gonna see is the portrait enhancer and this is really cool to face light option so it detects where the face is and you can just add a little bit of light to the face so instead of again having to make your own masks and stuff it detects it for you and you can just bring up the light on the face which is super handy I can't count the amount of times that I've had to do that just to try and kind of bring a little bit more focus to the face in my photo in this case I overexposed a little bit so the face is already pretty bright as is so we don't really need that we've got red eye removal we can whiten the eyes a little bit so bring a little bit more white into the eyes so that they kind of pop a little bit more I really like this eye enhancer I'm gonna take it way too far again to show you the effect but it's gonna kind of sharpen the eyes and brighten them up a little bit so that obviously like you can see this is a little bit too far just just but it's if you dial it into the right amount it can be really handy you can try and remove dark circles from the eyes then you've got options like slimming the face and large in the eyes so we can get a little ridiculous with it here going to kind of anime territory eyebrow improve which kind of darkens your eyebrows lips saturation lips redness lips darkening and teeth whitening so number five is the portrait tools I think it's something that's going to be very handy for people who are shooting a lot of portraits and want to just speed up their workflow things that they're already probably doing but they're doing like manually I think that that's gonna be really helpful for a lot of people and my sixth and final feature that I really like about luminar for is the pro tab and this isn't necessarily a single feature but it is a set of features that I think really take it above and beyond and make it just so much easier to get where you're trying to go so in this tab moving back to this other photo here if we go down to the pro tab the first feature that we see is something called advanced contrast now in the essentials tab we've also got something called smart contrast which acts more like a typical contrast slider would but in advanced contrast we've also got contrast for highlights contrast for mid-tones and contrast for shadows so all of those can be dialed in separately which is just super handy to have that much extra control but still in kind of a convenient way next we've got the adjustable gradient which would be super handy if you're doing something like let's say a landscape photo and you want to brighten up the bottom half or darken the top half let's say you've got your skyline needs to be darkened a little bit or your bottom half where the ground is needs to be brightened up in this case it could almost be the opposite this is just a super handy and easy way to do it and not only can you change the exposure of that but you can also change the warmth of vibrance you can change contrast shadows and highlights as well so you've got a lot of control again in just a super convenient way and that's really what I like about this it's not so much that these things aren't necessarily available in some other software but they just make it so convenient for you where they have them we've got dodge and burns so again making things brighter and darker specifically by painting them in you choose start painting and you've got these parts at the top here where you can click lighten you can draw in a light part and then you can click darken and draw a dark part obviously this is nonsense what I'm doing here but it's just that easy this is something that is pretty common for a lot of photographers to want to dodge and burn their photo so it's just super convenient again we've got a color enhancer so we've got brilliance and warmth so it's kind of like color ballads after the fact not necessarily the first thing that you're gonna do but at the end of the editing process so let's say we've got our nice fade on this photo here and we want to add a little bit of warmth afterwards but maybe we want to cool it down make that rock look a little bit colder or just crank up the brilliance and really bring up the kind of color contrast in this photo we've got photo filter which is basically putting a kind of a hue on top of your entire photo you can do a little bit of safety a tone if we want and then finally we've got good old-fashioned split toning and the nice thing about the split toning is that you can actually dial in the amount overall so you can turn up your saturation and find where you want the split tones to be so let's say we want that kind of Orange and the highlights teal in the shadows and then we can dial it back with the amount or dial it way up so if you like doing split toning you've got just a little bit more control here than you might have in some other editing software now like I said those are my six kind of favorite features that I found so far but there is so much going on in this software I've been really impressed with everything that's available and how they make it just so easy to understand if you're already familiar with other editing software I think this will be a really good thing that you can hop in to nice and easy and start to take advantage of some of these cool features like I said those are six of my favorite but there's so much more that you can go into in this software huge thank you to Scotland for sending me the software to try out and giving me the opportunity to dive into a new piece of software I'm really impressed and thank you for sponsoring this video if you guys have any questions make
