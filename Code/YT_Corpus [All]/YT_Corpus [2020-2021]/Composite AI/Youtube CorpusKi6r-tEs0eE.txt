 have you ever seen those ugly blocky pixelated artifacts that completely ruin your all JPEG images in this video I'm going to teach you how to use a powerful Photoshop filter to instantly remove compression artifacts from your JPEG images hi I'm mrs. Ramirez from the Photoshop training channel this is going to be a fun and informational tutorial so make sure that you stick around to the very end so that you catch all the tips and tricks in this video if you're new to the channel be sure to click on that subscribe button now so that you don't miss any future Photoshop tutorials okay let's get right to it this is the image that I'm going to work with it's a photo of free to the cat everybody say hi to Frida I'm a really big cat person and you probably have noticed that I use a lot of cats in my tutorials but anyway if you want to follow along with this image I'll place a link to it right below in the description first let me just explain the problem I'm gonna press the Z key on the keyboard to select the zoom tool and I'm going to zoom in so that you could see the artifacts that were created by the JPEG compression on this image I'm sure that you can see the blocks that create the pixelation on this image this is caused by saving a JPEG with low quality settings or by saving a JPEG over and over again since every time you say with JPEG you compress it just a little more I'm sure that you have seen this before and if you want to fix this in Photoshop let me show you what you do first go into the background and make sure you unlock it in right click and convert it into a smart object we're going to apply several filters and we want to have the ability to edit them a smart object is a container that can hold one or more layers and it allows you to apply adjustments distortions filters and transformations non-destructively which means you can always come back and edit them go into filter and go down into the noise option and select reduce noise this will bring up this window where Photoshop will immediately apply a blur to smooth out any noise and notice the preview box here make sure that you enable it so that you can actually see this happening on your actual image by the way here's a quick or shortcut that you may not know on any window that has the preview checkbox if you press the P key on the keyboard you will enable or disable that checkbox so that's P for preview so use that keyboard shortcut and then you can see like a quick before-and-after as you're working on any window in Photoshop that has the preview checkbox you can then use the sliders found in this window to control how the algorithm blurs the image to remove any noise first you have the strength slider this slider allows you to control the amount of luminance noise reduction apply to the image channels I know that sounds confusing but basically you're blurring the image on all the channels at the same time if you are an advanced user and you want to use channels you can use the advanced option and from here you can adjust the blur per channel basis so it only blurring the red Channel or only blurring the green channel or only blurring the blue Channel and what type of strength and preserve detail amount you have but in this case we don't need to do all of that we're just gonna stick with the basic so we're only gonna deal with all the channels at the same time so you can use this slider to control the amount of blurriness that happens with the noise reduction then you have the preserved detail slider which controls how much detail you keep especially in areas that have hair or texture objects in this case we have fur so you have to use this slider accordingly to see how it affects the rest of the image obviously you can bump it up too much because you'll actually make the pixelation stronger and you can't come down too low because the image will be very blurry so you have to play around with the settings and see what gives you a good result in your image so in this image maybe a setting of about 15 will work you could also zoom in on this window to see different parts of the image so I'll zoom in more and I can look at the image and see how these settings are affecting it another very common problem with images that have been compressed too much is that colors will tend to bleed like you can see colors bleeding through the image and actually you can't really see it now because it's already been reduced but if you look at the reduced color noise I have a pretty high setting but if I bring that down to zero you'll see that the noise comes back you can see a lot of noise in these areas see that so make sure that you adjust a reduced color noise accordingly to remove that extra color noise see that that's before and after it just smooths out these blotches of color next we have a sharpening slider to sharpen the detail let me zoom out a little bit so that we can see how that works if I increase it to 100% you'll see that the image gets much sharper but it creates other issues and of course if I reduce it to 0% the image might be a little too soft so again adjust this slider accordingly so that you can get a good result on your image notice that I'm not really giving you what percentages to use because it just wouldn't be valuable to you the values depend on the image that you have so you can use the values that I use as a starting point if you like but at the end you'll have to use whatever values work best for your image so this is gonna be a very important checkbox remove jpg artifact this will remove these lines that you see here the algorithm will try to determine what artifacts were created by the JPEG compression so watch what happens as soon as I check this checkbox here see how it smooths out all those lines so now we don't really see any of that JPEG compression which is great and it's exactly what we want next I'm going to press ok to apply these adjustments and I'll pan over to this area in the layers panel you'll see the Smart Filters if I click on this eye icon you'll see that before and I'll click again so you can see the after so as you can see it's a massive improvement I'll double click on a hand tool to fit the image to screen and now I'm going to apply another filter to further enhance this image I'm gonna go into filter Camera Raw filter with the Camera Raw filter I can do so many cool things to this photo for example I can maybe make the shadows a little bit darker and increase the contrast just to hide some of those imperfections I can also increase the texture to make the first stand out a little bit and I can increase clarity which is contrast on edge pixels and the image is a little D saturated so I can use either the saturation slider or the vibrance slider to add saturation the difference is that saturation just bumps up the saturation and all pixels equally while vibrance only increases the saturation of pixels that don't have a lot of saturation and it also protects skin tones so it's a great slider to use especially in portraits in this case I can bump it up I really want these colors to stand out and I'm not getting the oranges that I really want behind the cat so you can do in a situation like this is go into the HSL tab which allows you to control the hue saturation and lightness of individual colors for example with the oranges you can slide this lighter to control the luminance because we're in the luminance tab or you could switch over into the saturation tab and control the saturation of the oranges which will make the orange behind the cat pop next I'm gonna go into the detail tab and I'm going to increase the sharpening when I sharpen I do an overall sharpen in the image and usually that's not the best thing to do that's why we have the masking slider with the masking slider Photoshop will find the edges of the image and only apply the sharpening to those edges but if I simply drag on the slider you really can't tell what's going on if you want a visual representation of what's going on you can hold the Alt key on Windows that's the option key on the Mac and click everything will turn white so you can think of this as a layer mask white reveals black conceals if I drag to the right you'll notice that Photoshop will start finding edges and we only get white on those edges so that means that the effect will only be on the white areas that you see so maybe we just want the effect on the cat not so much on the background so this might be a good setting here and I can just release before and after a subtle effect but I think it works and finally I'm gonna zoom in just to show you one other thing we were blurring the background to try to remove the pixelation so that means that we have a lot of soft pixels I'm gonna go into the effects tab and just increase the grain just a little bit it helps the image regain some of that film quality it doesn't look so computer generated because of the blur so I think that adding grain always helps I'm going to press okay and these are my results let me zoom in so that you can see I'm gonna click on this eye icon to hide the Smart Filters before notice all the artifacts that are found in the image tossed by the JPEG compression and here's the after notice how they're all gone and you can't even see them the image looks much much better so I hope that
