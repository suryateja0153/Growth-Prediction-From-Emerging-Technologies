 what's up guys welcome back to the channel my accessor here boudoir photographer in los angeles california and today we're gonna be taking a look at some luminaire software luminaire for has come out about six months ago and just so you know i am totally not sponsored by them i just got a ton of questions asking about what i thought of the software i actually even reached out to them and asked for an affiliate code and i haven't heard back from them if your boudoir photographer who is looking to grow your boudoir business i've created an exclusive private facebook group or we do live weekly photo critiques we hold each other accountable for getting work done and focus on your business to become part-time or full-time photographers that sounds like you then link in the description send a request to join now as in most of my videos i'm gonna be talking about specifically how the software applies to me and my business which oftentimes doesn't apply to most people so take that with a grain of salt and what my needs are our quality skin smoothing and speed of the software so right now i use a magic portraiture i've used it for about five years and it has been amazing i know what luminaire you can do crazy things like replace the skies and i don't really plan on my images looking like they're in Battlestar Gallactica can't even can't even pronounce it let's see sky replacement let's see galaxy alright guys I now offer galaxy sessions your photo shoot will be out of this world now if you followed me for any amount of time you'll know that detailed editing is like one of my least favorite things to do it's right behind watching like a bad Netflix show because with this quarantine I've literally gone through all of them so the more I can automate the better right now I use porch tour for that I have an action for it however porch there's about $200 whereas this software is only 90 it's less than a half so if it checks some of the boxes I'll be switching but let's go ahead and jump in and see what works what doesn't work what I like about it what I don't like about it and if I think you should get it now with luminaire 4 you can either use it as a desktop application or as a plugin to photoshop so for our purposes we're gonna be using it as a photoshop plugin we will edit in photoshop command e then after you install it all you have to do is filter skyline software luminaire for now the first thing that you'll notice is that it takes a little while for it to start up now I'm on an iMac Pro 10 core 64 gigs of ram we'll continue the trial and here we are in the software now let's zoom in a little bit here we go sorry image already looks pretty pretty good her skin looks amazing but let's go ahead and see what happens when we start to apply some of these things so here's all of your typical adjustments that I would normally do in Lightroom first before I brought it into a software like this however if you want to do the entirety of the editing you can do that in luminaire for the second one is our creative effects and this third one is going to be everything for portraits so let's first do these skin enhancers so this slider is basically going to do the effect that portraiture does it's designed to smooth the skin without affecting too much of the actual detail the pores and things so let's see how well that works let's go all the way extreme we'll go all the way up to a hundred and we'll zoom back in alright here's without and here's with it's it's pretty impressive it's a little you know obviously it's a little much any anything you do at a hundred percent is going to be a little much but I'm really really impressed that you're able to let zoom in even another even another level there's still texture in the skin it's essentially doing the bottom layer of frequency separation and it's doing a really good job of it if we come back out let's do fifty percent that's a little bit more normal of what I would expect so here's without and here's with that does a ton that saves me a ton a ton of time now the next tool that it uses in here is the shine removal we bring this up all the way it's gonna take all these highlights and just mute them I think this works better than the highlight slider in in Lightroom if you're gonna be using it for something like this but I typically like having really really bright sections of the photograph this might be a little bit bright but on her on her face I want to have some of that brightness it also has the ability to do AI skin defects removal which is gonna see larger blemishes and take them out but the next thing I want to do is the portrait enhancer so now this has all kinds of really crazy stuff and this might be the reason to go for the software over something like portraiture I have typically try and get my face is really bright and you can do that just by just by sliding this is going to brighten only her face that's amazing the next one that I think is actually really cool is this eye enhancer now take a look at her pupils see how it brightens up the catch lights in her eyes now this is where I think it gets a little bit goofy is stuff like this how to slim your face or enlarge the eyes I understand that that this can be helpful and that this has its place but I'm personally like I think adjustments like this it's not as much of an honest representation of what your client looks like and so I'm morally against doing stuff like that so we're gonna take that completely out improve eyebrows is actually pretty cool it darkens up the eyebrows makes those look really nice and then it's got some different things with lips and whitening up the teeth so let's kind of get a quick little scroll and see the difference that it's here in this image that is pretty amazing to me I mean if we take a look at the quality of her skin we take a look at the brightness on the area that matters if we take a look at the catch lights in her eyes all of that to be done with a couple of different sliders that I can save as a preset is pretty amazing all right let's take a look at another image filter skyline software [Music] now this is where the artificial intelligence of the software I think struggles a little bit here we have your typical general portrait it's picking up her face just fine but if we look at the picture as a whole we're gonna go to skin enhancer and we're gonna do a hundred percent we're just gonna go overkill just so you guys can see what's going on here so as we zoom in her skin is super super smooth her arm is super super smooth but as we get down here you can see it's actually done nothing to her legs so if we look here at this arm section you can see that that's doing a ton but if we look here at this leg section and we click here you can see that it's not actually doing anything at all so to me what that's saying is that for whatever their software is however they designed it to pick up a face or a body or what that's supposed to look like it's going to interpret it based on what it thinks is a body part and smooth that whereas the way porch door works is it's a color mask so you choose a color or it has a good idea of what the skin tones are and then it's wearing a mask and smooth only the areas that match that color the negative of that is sometimes if their skin is relatively similar to the hair color like if they're blond the hair can kind of get a little bit blurred as well I was super curious about the software to see if that would be a problem since it does everything AI and if it was going to be an issue to wear if it wasn't just a close-up headshot would it apply it to the all the right areas of the photo and it looks like in certain situations like this the answer is no all right so let's talk a little bit about reasons why you would choose something like luminaire and the main reasons I've come up with on the portrait side of things is if it's really important to you to be able to do those localized smart adjustments like brightening skin and taking out dark circles and brightening up their eyes and those sort of things I think luminaire is an amazing software it's also amazing if you want to do crazy cool sky replacements I mean like that looks like magic to me that's absolutely unbelievable that they're able to just like pop different skies and this is so crazy dramatic sunset who's so dramatic why don't we just have a swimsuit photo shoot under the stars and it can also do crazy stuff like this sunray like place the Sun you know wherever you want the Sun to be you can have some sun rays coming through like look at this as you move it like the sun rays move behind the leaves of the trees that is just ridiculous now to be fair this is just me kind of clicking around the software for an hour and seeing how I think I could use it my business it doesn't necessarily mean that's going to be everything that you could use it for in your business but back to what I need it for the two main things that I need are speed of the software how quickly it can I can use it and go through the images because I do same-day sales sessions so after a photo shoot I edit 60 to 80 pictures all in an hour get them ready for a client to purchase and portraiture is super fast for that and the second thing I need is is how good is the skin smoothing how well does it kind of see the whole image and pick the skin out of the rest of the picture and apply a quality skin smooth so let's go ahead and take a look at how long it takes for luminaire to turn through 70 pictures and to see how long it takes portraiture to do the same so let's first run this with with portraiture we're going a batch we're gonna choose my boudoir bias a supporter bias a sir preset action and then we'll just hit OK and when we do that I want to set the timer on my phone all right so we have a stopwatch here I'm gonna click OK and tap this at the same time [Music] we are off to the races [Music] all right 6 minutes and 17 seconds we're gonna go to batch processing and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna go to user settings then we'll choose sass number one that's the preset I did for skin smoothing at 50% la lumière onto the end of the name of the scheme go ahead and get it going 1 2 3 [Music] alright 5 minutes and 34 seconds alright so let's go ahead and compare the differences in actual quality of the portraiture verses of luminaire so let's go ahead and zoom in here and you can see here this top layer is luminaire and this bottom layer is background that means this bottom layer with portraiture this top layer was luminaire so if I uncheck this you can see almost almost no difference luminaire looks a little bit softer a little bit more refined so if I move this line to the left that's all luminaire if I move this to the right this is all portraiture so you can see especially in her forehead I don't know if the compression of YouTube but you can see it's a little bit cleaner not hugely they're pretty comparable as far as quality so in comparison for me the two most important things speed and quality I'm gonna give it to lumen are as far as quality goes I thought that the just the texture that was retained while doing the skin smoothing was really impressive so I'm gonna give it to them as well as being able to do things like just brightening up just the faces and also enhancing the eyes I thought that was amazing to be able to do as like one batch edit however it did seem to be about twice as slow I came out to be 1.7 times slower than portraiture on the tests that I did here and then are another one that I did recently it's 1.8 times slower so if you're really trying to keep things super super fast then portraiture is gonna win but I think it's worth it as far as at least of your batch editing to use luminar plus it's like around half the price but I want to hear from you have you used both softwares have you compared them do you like one more than the other let me know in the comments and come join me in my facebook group if you're interested in being a professional boudoir photographer full time part time whatever it is will get you where you need to be and I will see you guys and then video [Music]
