 Melissa: When I still had my tooth gap, I always put my hands in front of my mouth when I laughed. It was just a reflex of mine. When they showed me the video of how my teeth will look in 4.5 months, I was still a bit sceptical, as well as before the appointment. But I still found it super interesting how they did it or how it will be done. I've noticed that my teeth started to change when I was at the 3rd or 4th aligner. And then I thought: wow, awesome! I showed it to my friend when I noticed the first improvements. 9 00:00:39,500 -- 00:00:44,200 She said: "Wow, I didn't think that it would work!" So, neither did she. Imagine, I've had my tooth gap for years and within 4.5 months – in such a short time – I could solve my problem and I am super happy.
