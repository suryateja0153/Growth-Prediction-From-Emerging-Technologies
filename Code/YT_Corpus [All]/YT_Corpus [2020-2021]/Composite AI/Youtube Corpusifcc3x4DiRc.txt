 good morning good afternoon or good evening thank you so much for joining us from around the world for a first ever all digital Microsoft business application summit my name is Aaron Ola Garin the power bi engineering team Amunet is our CTO and technical fellow the two of us are going to talk to you about where we are with power bi where we're going we have some exciting demos and announcements throughout the day so let's get started so want to let you know that we have a bunch of folks from the power bi team that are actually Manning the team's channel so if you have questions please chime in if you're excited about something chime and we're waiting to hear from you and we will get to as many questions as we can the way we're going to run today is in this session Amin and I gonna describe our overall vision and roadmap kind of giving you an end-to-end view of a three major areas of investment in the sessions that follow that you see on my slide we will go deep into each one of them and in each one of those following sessions you will see demos with live code as well as announcements that are making today all right so as we get started I just wanted to kind of start out with what our industry is trying to solve for the last two decades the industry has pretty much been about you know helping end-users go from data to decisions and we know that this is not easy there's a pretty substantial gap between you know getting the from data to decisions and the question that our industry has really been struggling with is how do we close the gap is it really a matter of just using the right bi tool and we would argue that it's that's probably not the case if you look at what's going on in the world today only about 30 percent of our users best case have even access to a near bi toll when you look at most medium to large enterprise customers they have anywhere from half a dozen to a dozen or more bi tools and this fragmentation makes it very hard for everybody to be on the mix on the same page to make decisions together and lastly in today's world the data is not just all structured neatly sitting in a relational database there's unstructured data there's human interactions its product telemetry there's text that's voice this video so it's really important to be able to work with all of these data formats to be able to get the insights that you need and if this was hard before in the last few months this has become much much harder many of us in our organizations are now working from home and as we work remotely it's really hard to walk down the hallway and ask a question or get something clarified if trust and security were import before it's become even more important as people work with data from home as they you know data that leaks into post personal machines and it's really important that to be able to govern and secure the data even when it's outside of the corporate firewall and lastly we know that many of our customers around the world are facing severe economic pressure so an economic model that makes sense for them is really really important I probably we have a little bit of a different perspective we think bi is fundamentally about just one thing which is about people it's about empowering people so that they can make great decisions and when you think about people you really think about culture what are your people wake up in the morning into how do they get access to data how do they make decisions how do they share and collaborate around the insights all of these things become critically important to be able to get insights and to be able to move from data to decisions and so we really think that the problem of a data culture is really something about everyone you know it's about everyone in your organization your customers your suppliers and even your citizens and it's about every decision it's about empowering you to be able to make every decision based on data and when we think about it this way that's you know really enlightening because when you think about getting access to everyone it experiences really need to be intelligent and familiar you can't expect the end users to find the insight themselves the two leads to be smart enough to find the insights for them and it's really important for users to be able to have a familiar experience one that they already used to so that they can build on experience they know as opposed to having to learn everything from scratch that's how you get you know the tool in the hands of everyone it's really important for it to be unified for IT and business to be on the same page so the tool that IT recommends is the tool that business users love and it needs to be ubiquitous you need an economic model where you can put intelligence and analytics in the hands of everyone when we think about every decision it really starts with teamwork you know the insights that we share are much more valuable than the in sight to behold for ourselves bi is inherently a collaborative process Trust is foundational you need to be able to trust the data you're working with you need to be able to trust the tool it needs to meet your compliance and regulatory requirements it needs to respect your geography Co boundaries and it really needs to be integrated everywhere you don't expect people to just make decisions in the bi tool they may be working in Excel they may be working in PowerPoint they may be working in other application it's really important for the insights to be infused across all of the experiences that your users are doing and that's really what we're trying to do with power bi we're really trying to help everyone Drive but every decision to help them drive a data culture and this approach that the power bi team has taken has really really resonated it's been close to five years since power bi was launched I became generally available and we are very excited about the growth that we see the usage that we see from power bi customers so this is the fifth year of triple digit paid usage growth we have over a hundred and fifty thousand customers from around the world using power bi when I look at you know where it all began with power bi desktop you know the tool that everybody uses to get access to data to be able to shape it and build these beautiful visualizations I'm very excited to announce that we have now crossed two million monthly active developers using power bi desktop to be able to create the analytics that that makes sense for their business uses power bi mobile also continues to do really really well you know we've taken a lot of care on a mobile experiences highly rated on our app stores and if you look at the usage of power bi mobile 50 times as many reviews as everybody else combined so it really gives shows you the care and attention that we have paid for our mobile experiences our party has started out as a global cloud service we've had five years to mature it I'll be probably as available in 43 languages it's available for 40-plus data centers around the world we support three national clouds us Germany and China and a host of certifications so you can feel confident when you use power bi one of the parts that I'm really excited about is the participation of the power bi community we have 280 plus user groups around the world so in most major cities you you know there's a local user group that's now interacting digitally with each other so you can find the people or passionate about Barbie and work with them what's also exciting for me and gratifying is the engagement of the community and helping us build the product so over 300,000 members of the community have either created an idea or voted on an idea on ideas or power bi comm and they pay a ton of attention and we try to deliver capabilities on a very very rapid cadence so you know that we ship new features in the power bi service every week we ship a new release of power bi desktop every month today you know we have the April release of power bi desktop becoming available will also ship the may release in a couple of weeks and you can see that the pace of innovation of our team is really really exciting for our customers and it's really focused on what you are asking us to go build on ideas or power bi comm so we'll keep going we'll keep innovating we'll keep delivering what our customers care about we have many of our customers joining us here at M baths are here you can see some of the customers who will be sharing with you their stories with power bi how they're driving a data culture their challenges their opportunities and how their users using it so I encourage you to attend many of these sessions I think you'll find them incredibly helpful but these customers are not alone you know we have customers around the world in every industry every geographer using power bi and you know we're very very grateful that over ninety seven percent of the fortune 500 use power bi today you know this is why when Gartner came out with their most recent magic magic quadrant in February this year they put power bi you know as the clear leader in both access both ability to execute and completeness of vision you know we've been working with Godin for a number of years we're very excited about you know about the latest Magic Quadrant and we also in a forester came out with a Forrester wave in August last year and again they put Microsoft power bi front and center as the cloud bi service for customers to bet on so hopefully this gives you a quick sense of you know where we are with power bi one of the things that I wanted to call out is our our partnership with the power bi community we're very excited and very grateful for the amount of support we have this really is a partnership you know the community has leaned in and helped us build the product and shape the product to what it is it has helped us both grow together so as you know both you know power bi and the community you know has has a really good partnership that helps us grow quickly and I'm very excited to announce it the power ba community in just over the four years now has a million plus members so hopefully that gives you a sense of where we are with power bi I wanted to thank you as the power bi customers the power be a community for being a part of a product for actually engaging with us and helping us build an amazing amazing platform so with this I wanted to invite Amir Nets Amir is a technical fellow and CTO he's going to talk to you about where we're going with power bi and he'll share with you some of the announcements we have he'll provide an end to an overview and the sessions that follow you'll actually be able to see these these demos in action all right I mean over to you thank you so much you're ruinin and I'm so excited to being here one more time with our you know with you guys you know you just made us come up to you know wake up in the morning and come to work and these days and just have fun and we have a lot to share with you today but we'll start by building a framework a framework to understand how we think about implementing the vision of a data culture a data culture is really at the center of our vision and it's all about making sure that everyone in the organization has the data and the tools to drive insights in that every decision is being powered by those insights and how do you get that how do you get to a data culture we'll introduce the three circle framework and essentially our session will follow that framework so we start with everyone we need to make sure that everyone is part of that data culture we need to win the minds and hearts of every single individual in the organization and for this we need them to make meaning to make sure that they're falling in love with data they are they the talk date that they sleep data they eat data the communicate data and it's all about experiences we want to win them over we need them to make make sure that they fall in love so we are making power bi is so easy to use instantly familiar if you know itself you know PowerPoint you feel at home day one and then we make it to also very easy to find those insights with the power of AI and this is how we get to win those individuals now if you want to have a real culture you need all the individuals and that's a different set of problems because how do you scale these the data crafter to hundreds of thousands sometimes of employees sometimes it's a thousand sometimes ten thousand but and a lot of those and that is a scale problem that is the problem of governance and your quality data and processes that is a problem of IT and building a modern enterprise bi platform that can meet the most demanding enterprise needs is the we'll talk a lot of the about the innovations that we are creating Empire bi for the IT folks to really scale it to hundreds of thousands of users now the last circle is not just about everyone it's about every decision and every decision means that we are going to go and bring power bi to the places where decisions are being made you know this is not being made in the BI system people don't go ahead you can make a decision but to launch the BI tool this is a made every day constantly during the course of the normal workday when you talk to people when you work on systems you think about stuff it needs the insights to show up where you are and we are spending a lot of effort this year and in the next year's on bringing the insights where decisions are made and we are weaving bi into the fabric of their organization and we're just going to talk about how we're into the data start into the action platform into the trust centers and into the productivity tools that you're in so that these are the three circles this is going to be the framework for today and what I'm going to do now is I'm going to spend the next you know 15 minutes or maybe 10 minutes just do a quick flight buy a trailer what you're going to see the next three sessions so we start with amazing data experiences and I said it's all about making sure that we are on boarding those user that make it super easy to use and they don't want to fall in love with the system and it starts with what we call the power point for data right it's all about making it easier that it's so easy that anybody's using PowerPoint can't feel at home there and one of the problem that we have to deal with is how do people who just call the power bi and see this back canvas how do we make sure that they are really you know knowing what to do and we spend a lot of effort on better onboarding which means you're going to see these watermarks on the canvas you want to get these coach marks that shows you the controls and how to operate we want the first five minutes to be productive people to be able to achieve or it is something cool and it's for them to say wow and you're going to see a lot of work going around it onboarding to the desktop but it's not just the on board it's also about really making sure that that everything is familiar and you know we've been shamelessly stealing ideas from PowerPoint and we'll that is some pretty amazing demos of new ideas coming from PowerPoint including templates there are templates you know use my place in PowerPoint these are the templates of power bi they are just an amazing way to create beautiful report pages with a couple of clicks well design based on the best practices of our designers and practitioners awesome awesome experience you know you know if the plates apartment you know this Barbie and you see other stuff you see lots of select you pretty stunning them or Justina is going to give you in the next hour and it's not just the ease of use it's also currently because I know many of you have been with us for a long time and you it had as four more core analytics improvements some more articles topping the list you want those small multiple charts we're working on them not the demo today but it's coming another thing if you're gonna see is kind of the small improvements just make everything better like visual zooming is inside charts lots of selects inside charts coming to you students actually show you some of that as well and then AI this has been an amazing journey over the last year we started with the keen for answers and then we released the competition tree as a preview we are really excited today is the general availability date for the composition trees and we have a whole lot of additional improvements into that visual this has been taking up even in preview mode it just became so popular it's been growing hundred percent so usage and we have some more coming there so wait for that demo and because AI visuals you know when I talk about the key influence or the decomposition tree the QA you want to see some cool cool improvements for Q&A as well they've been so successful then you are going to you know going to be very excited about the next AI video and that one is the smart narratives so smart narratives is all it's been amazing it's just a I ate its best it takes a look at what's on the page and automatically figure out what's interesting providing you a narrative it just Auto generate a narrative and the narrative is context sensitivity changing based on your selections you can actually edit it you can enhance it it uses Q&A is authoring language for it it's pretty amazing so wait for that demo Justine again in the next session is going to show that one and something else a little bit more in the distant future we're moving into automated insights and this is really about automatically taking things that you may have not noticed oh you don't know how to notice things like outliers in your system where this will just run automatic statistic analysis on your time series charts and detect what is exceeding the statistical boundaries of the chart and then automatically do what close analysis and show you why this may be happening so automated analytics with anomaly detection it some of the best IP that we have at Microsoft is going to come into the power bi for time series analytics so that's kind of a flyby off the curve exciting data experiences that we are creating but then you know once we know we know users love this but we need to move the next level which means we have to now capture all the individuals in the organization and be able to manage hundreds of thousands of those users and meet the most rigorous enterprise needs and this is where in the last couple of years we have made massive investments in a whole host of IT centric areas IT is the driver here without IT we are not going to be able to really get to every individual in the organization so we've made massive enhancements in everything Enterprise o matic model Enterprise reporting program ability application development real-time it here on the data Lake administration government so I want to just take you give you a teaser of what you are going to see there so we'll start with some matter of semantics models and these have been driving the adoption of our bi massively in the large department we have been seeing four hundred and fifty percent year-over-year growth in large power bi deployments you know people are really appreciating those in the investments you have been appreciating those investments you took you took power bi and really made it the data culture engine of the organizations using those capabilities so semantic models they are at the center these are the the models that really represent the one version of the truth power bi is supporting the XML a protocol which means that not only power bi reports can connect to the somatic models but Excel to connect to them and the host of third-party applications can connect to it so if not everybody in the organization is ready yet to move to power bi they want to use another tool the earth XML 8 protocol is an industry standard for the last 20 years and it is supported by a lot of BI tools and we support it we you know we were the founders of that protocol so you'll be able to connect from everything and we semantic models are so so much at the heart of power bi that we are introducing massive enhancements to them today we are going to see for the first time the introduction of the number one requested by enterprise voice which is the composite models composite models are all about striking the balance between a centralized you know IT driven high quality one little truth model that you don't want anybody to change and ability to extend it at the edge by the business unit by the subsidiary with local data without having to replicate the data out without having to touch it modify the center that extensibility model is really giving you the balance between self-service and central a semantic model and you can reuse that centralized semantic models across multiple businesses multiple subsidiaries any number that you want and it is stunning you know it seems like something very nerdy and geeky but you should see cretians wait demo mind-blowing so some composite models they sound excited about it it's because it's pretty much amazing ok not only that the semantic models are available for composite motors XML read/write was just introduced so we now have the whole ecosystem of analysis services tools now working against those semantics mortals in Barbie I every workspace in the power bi service is looking to those tools like an analysis services server so you can use all your favorite tools and you know we have analysis around for more than 20 years it's been the workhorse of the BI industry for the on-premises world and now the same engine it's powering power bi and here is all the tools that your you love I know we're mighty just working or your scripts working fully compatible because it is analysis service it's not an imitation it's a real deal and then the other workhorse of the industry reporting services or the paginate report feature power bi you know we released it in the full massive adoption unbeliever people just cannot have enough of those pixel-perfect paginate the header footers massively distributed in PDF in your mailbox reports we are continuing to enhance it you're going to see here that page view format support so you can your beautiful pages showing up it has been supporting for royal security and subscriptions base bursting and they that driven subscriptions all of those are coming to reporting services and then we enhance of the API surface of analysis or of RBI that means that you can actually take those reports and embed those into your application both in SAS embed and pass embed you build those applications you want to deploy them to hundreds and thousands of users and you know that's that's quite the responsibility so you need to be in control application lifecycle management and the pipelines were introducing today are just an amazing way to have control deployments of large scale enterprise applications you can have a different development environment test environment and production environment you can have different parameters so click on exit B for data with different power your parameters you can compare the differences the do selective progression of the deployment of artifacts that change from the development environment to the test of the test of the deployment to production and it's it's super easy to use beautiful and so functional the feedback has been amazing and now you guys can experience it yourself really full-scale the point pipe our pipelines in power bi and just going hand in hand when you build those very complex projects when you have in the enterprise hundreds of thousands of or dashboards and data set with intricate relationships you need to have an actionable lineage impact analysis functionality where you know that if you're making a change in a data set you need to know what will be impacted down this down the line so we will show you the affected artifacts in your workspaces other workspaces that you own that other people or we even let you know who owns those those artifacts and allow you to communicates and email to these people directly form the power bi system so you can make sure that you are not breaking anybody else who's you're using your data so really exciting innovation there the last area is around admin and governance we have constantly added more and more control to more and more information for administrators to make sure that they are in compliance to make sure everything control and save and what we what we are going to do is instead of just trickle more and more improvement we're just going to deliver everything to you immediately and we wanted to do that by basically giving you the full dump of all the telemetry events all the compliance events all the activities that are happening in power bi directly into your own as you log on oolitic so you can analyze it to kill your heart to gain content you can integrate it with other telemetry coming out from other systems you can have a single pane of glass to understand everything that goes on and your whole infrastructure is not just limited to power bi so really exciting ability to go and be in full control of what's going on in your system as an administrator to make sure that the governance is complete end-to-end so that's kind of a flyby into the second circle which is all about IP and now let's talk about the lustre and the last one Sirica is kind of new this is where a lot of our new investment coming because we realized that it's not just enough to build a standard its traditional bi platform we need to go outside our shell we really need to bring those inside directly into the places where people are making decisions we want to impact every decision to make sure the insights are where every decisions are being made and we are just integrating weaving party are into the fabric of organization every tier at the data stack the de Power Platform the trust centers and the office for that activity where collaboration is being made so let's go one by one data stack this is where a lot of the work is done with Azure around something that we call as your setups as you're seeing us analytics is the evolution of the Azure data warehouse but it's much more expanded it is where all of the analytical infrastructure is being managed whether it's a data like the spark cluster the machine learning are they the ETL the data warehouse and also power bi so a single environment for a data engineer to build a complete analytical application you can see how Barbara is integrating into the user interface here but it's more than that we're actually working deep into the service architecture to make sure that power bi in the data warehouse in synapse are fully optimized to each other Harvey is actually emitting special events special telemetry events that are analyzed by power bi algorithm that sits on the scene that's outside of the house do you optimize the data warehouse automatically without you touching anything to make sure it's the most responsive data words you can have for the pattern of where is that your users are sending to a to power bi so the system just constantly optimizes itself and that level service deep service level integration it's just making unbelievable improvement in the performance you want to experience when using the data warehouse and power bi together and you have to see some cool them or that kind of improvement coming from will in the last session today let's talk about about power and about action be more and more line of business applications are being built using the power platform some organizations have tens of thousands replications built in the power platform this is where there's a line of business applications are not analytical applications but they need insights when they run those applications and this is where we're making deep investment into integrating with the rest of the power of platform we are going to introduce the directory to the common data service this is database that powers power absolute power automate so you can get real-time reports directly from power bi that are connecting to the same data that your line of business application is saying without any delay or latency super cool even more cool in my opinion is the continuation of the journey we started with visual for power absolute you guys just adopted so much and now we extending it to have a visual for a power automate flow you can actually offer the full flow inside power bi and it shows us a button and we pass the context of your selections of the in the report to the flow that is running in power automate so you can build some amazing actionable reports and activate business processes directly from power bi wait and see wheels demo it's amazing ok trust I talked about trust you we you know you guys know trust you know yeah those those email that you get that says do not forward or those does document that are labeled as confidential that you get in PowerPoint and Excel award and all this this is kind of this is the Microsoft is investing in security and information protection and in trust heavily we have over 3500 engineers and researchers and developers that are working on it and we are integrating car bi deeply with that stack we're not making our own information protection framework so for example you can label artifacts in power bi and those artifacts are getting making those labels that you've exported to excel so no information leaks we are also integrating those labeling into the power bi desktop and we are also going to now and I to inherit those labels if you mark the data source as secured all the downstream artifacts will be inheriting those labels lastly they we have the integration with the admin center of the security center of Microsoft ok let's start with the last part I'm going to really ratchet was running out of time but collaboration this is really bringing power bi into office you want to see amazing demos today how we are going to basically integrate Harvey that into every SharePoint place no work requires from it administrator or from an analyst of a pre creation of pre modeling just one click every user get immediately a chart report automatically generated for them para bajar in every place you're going to see also the integration in teams amazing level of integration you can chat in team about every visual on the report and a lot of other goodies wait for wheels demo pretty stunning and lastly I want to talk about the things that we're doing with Excel Excel will now recognize power bi datasets natively it will know how to connect to them it will show you the certification certified dataset for motivators it and then it will actually understand what data in the sheet and how it's related power bi when you have a list of customers that you typed in or list of property you type it you can tell it to commit the power behind and identify those entities and then give me more information about them static unbelievable science fiction you're going to fall in love with it hundreds of millions of Excel users are going to fall in love with it and that's it that is the three circles you're going to see amazing sessions coming down the line so this is what it's all about data culture everyone every decision join us just learn about power bi we have three sessions amazing demos are starting at 10:45 I will join with Justyna who is going to lead you through some of this experiences and then we're going to have preach and wait you're going to show you ID folks what we're doing for large scale deployment to get to a hundred thousands of users and then we'll is going to blow your mind with the integration with the power platform with synapse and with office so excited amazing see you there thank you
