 hi my name's Adam Horowitz I'm a PhD student in the Media Lab in the fluid interfaces group and I'm really happy to be joined by Agnieszka current forecasts three questions serious and we're gonna be speaking through a couple projects that Ignacio did and her visiting artist residency and one that we did together ignition key I do wanna start just by introducing yourself to people hello everyone and thank you so much to cast for hosting this talk my name is Scott Corum I'm a visual artist and I was visiting artists at MIT cast from 2016 to 2018 I know that in past works like production line or the end of the signature for you automation collective intelligence and shared authorship have been big themes in your work and so I just thought we could start with how those were points of departure for your your collaboration with Boris Katz and info group at MIT I doing my residency at MIT I was collaborating with csail and artificial intelligence lab of Boris Katz and we were working together with Boris's fantastic a PhD and postdoc students Andre Barbara and David Mayo on a project that stemmed from my earlier research and projects that I've done before so I would like to share with you a couple of images so I've been interested in the phenomenon of collective intelligence that can be perceived in both nature and culture for a very long time and this for example is one of my projects where I source or crowdsource my artworks to colonies of living termites and together was entomologist from University of Florida we gave termite colonies very vividly colored suns gold and broken crystals and each colony built one of these mounds so this here what you can see as a series of works called the end of signature where I collect signatures of thousands of people of various communities of social movements of people supporting one cause such as against climate change and a different kind of activist groups but also members of the workers unions and in this serious I work each time with computer scientists our programmer to kind of morph aggregate together thousands of these signatures and create one single collective signature that represents a kind of collective personality of a given community this is a facade of the Guggenheim Museum where we collected signatures of the visitors this is on the facade of the Cleveland Museum of Art where these are all the workers all the employees of this museum as contracts workers from the members of the board to the guards and the cleaning ladies this is a collective signature of all the people living in this group of buildings in this end and this council project the the themes with the end of signature and production line in terms of hybrid authorship and hybrid production and and materialization of a collective intelligence um I think it's a good segue into the animal internet project if you could take people there perhaps yes absolutely this is the image from like a work in progress after of the project done at Boris cats lab was with his PhD and postdoc students so with Boris we collected thousands of self-portraits taken by workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk and we created a program that aggregated all these portraits one line of pixels from photograph to collect to create this composite collective portrait of this new working class then we created these 3d sculptures that were acrylic art resin was copper and nickel plated that were this kind of collective portraits of this working class this was a point of departure for our project for animal internet animal internet it was based on my interest in how today social energies in society are being mined in a similar way to oil and gas how expressions of our joy anger frustration and 2-z asthma Happiness are constantly being monitored by corporations and and harvested and how can we ourselves take advantage of this of our own social capital and maybe use it for other type of projects so I looked at this phenomenon called animal internet that was described very interestingly in a book by Alexander Shara that's three years ago a book of the same title and he described this phenomenon where people start perceiving and nature and start being with nature in various different ways and for example there are animals that have chips under their skin and they are being tracked on animal tracker apps around the world there's about 150,000 of these animals and at the same time a lot of scientific institutes install webcams in jungles or in the North Pole to watch completely wild and completely unaware animals and this broadcast are being transmitted online and people start following these animals these animals are being given Facebook pages fan pages names so there's this kind of hybrid situation of this animals being completely wild and unaware and meanwhile they become celebrities online and people follow that so in our project was Adam and our other collaborators we used to broadcast from two webcams with two real webcams that you can see here one is polar bear in the North Pole and one is wild tiger in jungle and Thailand and we juxtapose these two broadcasts with two other broadcasts did we created from scratch was was our group of artists and engineers and so we basically created two fictional animatronic animals one is an animal in the upper left corner you can see an image of in a furry animal just wanted to say that we didn't that all the fur used in this project was artificial no animals were harmed so we used this artificial fur to hide an animatronic mechanism and we included real plants and stones and fragments of wood in a like a terrarium the this animal this artificial animal was its movements were powered by inputs from thousands of people who were sending us information on Amazon Mechanical Turk about how they feel at any given moment this were aggregated and Adam will tell a little bit more in that and in a couple of minutes about the technical side of this project but just to mention the other bottom right corner camera this broadcast was from the webcam that we also kind of built from scratch in another terraria and these are robotic animatronic gerbils and this one of gerbils was kind of their movement work it was powered by well program that was parsing Twitter feeds for a protest of members of protest movements around the world and this was then analyzed in an artificial society model which is an animation model of artificial frictional society that our fantastic engineers wrote and so basically this four cameras where juxtaposing real animals and artificial animals into one broadcast where for the people who watch this this animals online it doesn't matter whether the real designate in nature of the real animals exists because anyway they only see their images and I will maybe let Adam say more about the technical side of this project that was a content loaded and awesome summary one piece that's that's fun for viewers is is how we created the project because you initially approached us to collaborate as part of the signature hacking hacking arts so the the largest parts of this project was done in 24 hours where you stayed up with us until 3 a.m. and where we created the robotic movements by stripping apart a bunch of robots in creating our own strange hybrid organism from multiple mechanical animals and then also where agnes coated up a sugar scape model and then ish on was scraping the emotion using natural language processing from twitter to see the intensity of emotion related to tweets that had had the word protest in them and that was then driving the gerbil movement and we're then Owen was connecting with Tim many different hex bugs so we could make gerbils which could communicate with each other using radio frequency and the whole time one thing that was really fun for me is the discussions that we were having we're always tied back to neuroscience tied back to the idea of how humans are a hybrid organism both in terms of being cyborgs hi birds and and then also being hybrids in terms of our collective intelligence on the Internet changing our own self-reflection and so one really fun thing is the production happening in such a hurry and the other I think is all of the residents and themes between the neuroscientific aspect of it and the human-computer interaction aspect of it and that tying in to the themes that you're speaking about in terms of hybrid and collective intelligence and for me also the the work has really continued we were speaking about this just a few days ago but I'm starting a new project with support of caste and Kemet at MIT we're again working with deconstructing robotic animals and reconstructing them and connecting them to humans so that they can materialize different sorts of changes in cognition and right now the part that I'm working on is a dream activated animals project where we tie a sleep sensor to somebody leave them in a room but it's full of robotic animals that we've created and when that person enters a dream state when they experience this sea change in cognition all those animals will wake up and start walking so their life only comes at the onset of your unconsciousness but it's really a tie between that idea of how is it that we materialize and mechanize and create these hybrid human robot organisms and how is it that we can show this energy in active form and was a real continuation of this project and so was just wondering also how maybe the sugar scape model that we built or maybe the actual collective mechanical hybrids how many of those themes have continued in in your work going forward if any are still around this is absolutely fascinating what you said Adam and I I do believe that we will continue working together and so yes I mean there is not enough time here to explain all the implications for this project but of course this hybrid situations of like nature culture overlap and basically also the idea of their look at the collapse of the of the concept of self I mean the self is we knew it no longer exists because it turns out that itself is a pool if any is an aggregate of various kinds of agencies from microbial to algorithmic to to kind of collective intelligence as humans being part of society so all this has and continue to inform my and my practice and and I want to just briefly show you two two works that I've recently I love is it one of them is I think particularly interesting because of what has happened in the world since our project together especially what's happened in the world's the past couple of weeks so this project is called collective Rorschach test this is a lenticular print so here you can see three different views of the same what it depicts it's three snapshots from let's say a life of the of this collective organism that was created on the platform reddit as part of the social experiment called place which took place soon after our experiment was was was adamant and and others and so basically this experiment consisted in over 1 million people who were who ever wanted to join reddit platform at this moment and this project they could put a single pixel in a chosen color on their white canvas so if I'm actually see the white in the background and people started collaborating and using using various channels to collaborate on various collectively built forms from portraits of politicians that you can see here from from Flags and like the European Union flag Puerto Rican flag and so on artworks here we can see a very small fragment on the Mona Lisa - to various kind of slogans of protest movement and so on and at some point a very interesting form emerged this form was later named the black void and this is this this black kind of and this this form changed over time and you can see here how its evolving and it looks like a slime mold or a virus or another kind of collective organism and of course today was what's happening in the world whenever we're looking at the pandemic and how people are on the world are trying to define what this pandemic is what this virus is it itself becomes a kind of collective Rorschach test where everybody recognizes something else in it and it collectively it constantly evolves this is the second very big project that I've been recently developing and presenting and I will say only a few words very briefly this series of works called conversions and it's directly connected to the experiments that we have been doing with Adam and I continued working with Agnes Cameron on this project so this these are paintings they are liquid crystal paintings so it's they're executed on a copper plate with a paint that contains particles of liquid crystals and these paintings are ái paintings they are powered by the changes in the artificial society model and this models like in the experiments we did together are based on constant parsing of the protest movements Twitter feeds members of the protest movements whitter feet and it these changes cause differences in artificial society model and this in turn causes the delivery of various electrical charges and temperature changes to the back of this painting so this is how the painting changes over time you can see how it's just few minutes later and a few minutes later and so it oscillates between a map a colony of bacteria geology a slime mold and it perpetually evolves so these are paintings that like my earlier works are collectively authored so the authorship is obviously hybridized and complex but also they are in a way mining social energies and they always evolve they're like living organisms and last but not least I wanted to mention something very important for both the works that we did was Boris Katz and his students and also for these works and which remains a very important issue for me is that the proceeds from the sales of these works if they ever get sold is always were distributed in the case of the works that you're now looking at the conversions I give back a portion of the profits to the protest movements in the case of the works that we did was borrow Scott's this the process from this works are we distributed evenly among the workers of Amazon Mechanical Turk that participated in it and so I'm interested in continuing the exploration of redistribution how our distribution of capital can be explored with artificial intelligence and how we can today think about the crossover of collective intelligence and artificial intelligence in the arts cool.i I think that it's almost time for us to sign off but I just wanted to say that I think the the project and speaking with your for me was a real onset of using hybrids outside to think about hybrids inside I'm so excited about the idea that we are many more intelligences and we give us credit for ourselves and we can think about that in terms of the gut brain or we can think about that in terms of the intelligence and our left foot or we can think about that in terms of biological neural networks but this idea of your work showing these outside hybrids taking us and putting us in touch with our our hybrids inside and also how that demands that we then think about collective authorship and redistribution of benefits from from what it is that we make as hybrid organisms um but I I think it's time to sign off I just want to give a big thank you to cast um for this series but also for the opportunity to collaborate with Agnieszka which has been awesome and will continue and that's about it thank you so much thank you thank you thank you I would like to give my special thank you to Lila Kinney who was the person who invited me to join cast Thank You Katherine Higgins
