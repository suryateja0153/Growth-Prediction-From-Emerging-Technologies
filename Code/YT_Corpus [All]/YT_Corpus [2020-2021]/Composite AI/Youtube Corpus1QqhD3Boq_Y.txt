 I can upscale pictures with great success using AI it can fill in the gaps and make a convincing result but what about videos surely they're just lots of pictures put together wouldn't it be great to be able to convert all your old home videos and fraps recordings to 4k I've actually been experimenting with this since last August and I think I have done a little crazy what started off as one or two projects has ballooned to hundreds occasionally I'll put them all in a folder somewhere we're going to immediately start on something new now I've got so many up scaled videos to show you that I don't even know where to begin what I learned from all this is that upscale videos aren't as convincing as upscale pictures when motion is a factor it amplifies any of the bugs and imperfections of upscaling so while the upscale video might look sharper or more detailed it's also so distracting to look at that you might be better off watching the smoother blurrier original instead for video upscaling to work you'd somehow have to invent an AI that could intelligently carry details across frames to reduce the spindly shimmery nature of upscaled videos and that's exactly what the makers of gigapixel AI have done with her creatively named gigapixel AI for video it was kind of separate from the main site in a secret beta stage for a while but now you have to buy it or stick to a free 30-day trial alternatively you can use this site to upload up to 60 seconds of footage for free and it'll give you a side-by-side comparison before and after or you can upload a full video and get it up scaled up to 16 times the resolution you pay for this per pixel plus $2 since I still have a 30 day trial I can tell you a thing or two about it and how it performs for a start you'll want a powerful PC I have a geforce 20 80 TI and well that kind of power is useful for gaming I think I've actually been using it more for a high upscaling it can upscale low resolution videos almost in real time but upscaling HD to 4k still takes about an hour a minute so you can only imagine how long it would take on less powerful hardware but any kind of automated video upscaling is better than having to manually upscale thousands of pictures I suggest you make the most of the free 60-second upscaling they offer to test different resolutions to see how the results will look before you invest the time or money into upscaling though thing I've been using this AI video upscaling as an opportunity to return to some of my older videos and to see how much better I can make them look this is a bit of a trip down memory lane for me and I'll be releasing these over the coming days in new high-resolution glory in this video I'll briefly talk about each of them the challenge is involved with upscaling them and what I hoped to get out of it also be sharing some tricks I use to improve them in other ways which might help you if you're looking to restore some of your own videos going low in csgo friends this is personally my favorite going low in csgo video that I've made no narration is required to tell a tale of pity and romance you'll see for yourself when you watch it this video was already done in full HD 60fps I chose to upscale this one to 4k my reason for choosing this one is for the intro sequence I was only recording in 1080p at the time and this sequence required a lot of zooming to the point where the end result looked far blurrier than I'd have liked and that's a shame in fact it was this video that drove me to make future ones in 4k never could I have imagined that the day would come when I'd be able to bring the details back to this video but here we are the key to good upscaling with videos is the same as with pictures you ideally want the resolution you're upscaling from to be as small and as crisp as possible so because the intro to this video was so zoomed in I actually up scaled it several times at various different lower resolutions decided which one looks best for each scene and then piece them all together back to a full video the result of this upscaling isn't perfect everything looks a little bit painted in and the chain-link fences are still a mess but I feel I've done as well as I can given what I had to work with going low in csgo crazy knife tude and well the same applies to this video which was the first to be uploaded in 1080p 60fps I up scaled this one up to 4k as well the inferno map has brighter colors and more contrast which I think results in better quality upscaling even though the video itself is older recorded way back in 2014 you can tell because although it's a gold Nova game everybody in it would be low silver by today's standards fascinating to see how things have changed and how harshly older videos can be judged by today's players in 2012 before shadowplay was even a thing I filmed this trailer 4d Elysium and map for csgo that I made just months after the game's release this was captured at 1080p 30fps now this is a dilemma do I keep it at 30 FPS to retain maximum sharpness to show off the upscaling or do I use frame rate conversion software to upper to 60 with nice motion blur which I think would make it look more modern right now I'm thinking I'll upload both then we'll let you decide for yourselves which is best but before any frame rate conversion takes place the upscaling must come first it always should if you do the frame rate conversion first then it adds artifacts to all 60 frames rather than just a 30 which are then smoothly transition between so actually I think frame rate smoothing being applied after upscaling will help to mask the upscaling effects and shimmer I didn't record this with anti-aliasing on I don't know why I knew I was doing in 2012 I even had ambient occlusion forced on in the Nvidia drivers so while the result is nice and sharp all of the chagi edges are upscale to look horrible and sharp this presented me with that dilemma - I upscale the 1080p original and remain aliased or squished the original down to 540 P which will make the edges look smoother have a lot of some surface detail I chose to use both the 1080p upscale with moving images to reduce shimmer and 540 P for the still images to cut down on the aliasing will anyone notice probably not but that's not a percent of my life in a nutshell the one new scene I added was just after the bomb explosion I always regretted not having some awesome far-out shot here so use this project as an opportunity to add one plus it'll let you compare the rest of the video to a native 4k 60fps shot see if you can spot the difference almost a decade ago I juggled up in the Lake District some of it was captured at 50 FPS other bits 50 fps interlaced and this presents another upscaling challenge interlaced videos only capture half the videos lines at once good software can try to join it together again but the result is never as good as if it had been recorded properly in the first place going slightly off-topic sometime last year I have scaled all of the episodes of Peep Show and some of these suffer badly from interlacing I discovered that by resizing the image to half the vertical resolution and then by upscaling that back to the normal shape again it preserves a lot more detail than having both dimensions at once and it also removed interlacing pixelation from all this work I am now the proud owner of the finest quality peep show episodes in the world and you can see non copyrighted results in this upscale juggling video although the pet shop boys honest but probably still copyrighted is from the era now for something a little different in 2011 an intro for atomic amnesia was made the show was going to be about naked old men floating about in space I wrote a song for it my friend did some character art and we came up with some pretty amazing episodes that we wanted to make then life got in the way and then reckon water came along and used such similar ideas it would have made it look like we were copying it whatever here is the mock-up I made for the start of the first episode it seemed a little desperate to upscale perfectly good video clips so instead I just upscaled the still images to bring the whole thing up to about the same level of quality I just saw this upscaling project is the best excuse I'll ever have to release this video so after nine years I can finally get the project files off my hard drive if I was ever to return to it I'd start again from scratch anyway now for something else a little different in 2008 I have what is one of the final things I did with my counter-strike source Claire we decided to make the greatest machinima ever if you'd like to know the story behind final stearic um shower is that they discover a brilliant planet full of a liquid called spherical the people really like to shower it so they build a huge cable going from that planet to Earth's and it results in world peace because everybody's too busy rubbing stearic amour ever each other's bodies but for whatever reason the pipe is cut what will happen I'm not sure how that machinima was eventually going to explain this but that's fine because we only filmed this injury sequence anyway you know how old black-and-white footage makes stuff the colder than it actually was I feel the same with Cal strike source videos they would normally recorded in terrible quality and uploaded to the YouTube in 360 P but for whatever reason I did this one right by capturing a full 720p but unfortunately I rendered it all at the wrong frame rate of 25 hence all these horrible ghostly outlines around anything moving but I have a solution to that how do you get rid of horrible motion blur you had even more I upped the frame rate to 200 frames a second and then I crushed it down to 50 with resampling enabled the result higher frame rate and better motion blur I'm not saying this is the ideal solution it's probably far too much blur to be acceptable but I'm proud of this botched solution where I fought resampling with yet more resampling said their frame rate conversion will result in a weird morph when the camera suddenly changes angle so I had to cut out these mutant frames and stretch the clips either side to fill the gap this means that the action will slow down just before and after a cut I tried to stretch the scene with the least action to make it less noticeable and even a points used it the cinematic effect but it's amazing how your brain filters the slowdown out I guess it's a bit like how you don't see yourself blinking with all this work done I've end up scaled again to 4k remember how I said you should always upscale first before upping the frame rate yeah didn't take long for me to ignore my own advice to it but in this case I did it to save time that framerate confession took over 4 hours at 1080p I just couldn't be bothered with a ton that 4k would have taken now back to 2007 back then everybody on the messaging software crossfire was addicted to solitaire a dark time indeed in a cry for help I made this video I warn you now there's only so much you can do with such limited quality my room was dark my camera bad and when I compared the upscale result to the original I was horrified to discover that it looked no better other than for the color and contrast adjustments that I had made to it but with the resampling to get it to work effectively I had to crush the video dontist such a small resolution that it no longer had much information to work with I was close to giving up with this video completely but by happy chance discovered that my upscaled face looked terrifying though this is only when using the picture upscaling software and I had to upscale each and every frame of the video individually but I'm proud of this video because it's an example of using upscaling to achieve something other than better quality I'm using it here to make it look trippy and sinister every time my face is on show I manually adjusted the resolution to get the software to upscale my face in the most unflattering way possible suddenly this video has a new purpose to exist and releasing it as a new standalone video it's justified now back even further to morrowind I'm not sure when exactly I made this video the Blood Moon expansion I used came out in 2003 and I was heavily inspired by the two towers so I was probably 12 I hope I was but I might have been 13 or 14 or 16 I don't know anyway this is an absolute worst case at example for video upscaling low resolution pixelated dark and 10 FPS it's like upscaling on hard mode I think per pixel I have obsessed more over this video than any other it's not even a good video I just see it as a challenge to restore to the best quality that I can I've run every frame through a JPEG artefacts remover I have tried blending several different of scales together I've tried anything that could possibly have helped and more besides but after that I eventually decided just to run it all through the upscaler and to be done with it in the future this video should be used to benchmark how good video restoration software is it's got everything it's got snowy scenes which finger pixel fills in with lots of snowflakes which weren't really there it's got dark scenes where it has about dozen blocky squares to make a picture from it's got high contrast outdoor scenes but without enough detail to generate believable textures from and it's all at 10fps here's the problem with framerate enhancing it's most needed on low framerate videos but it's low framerate videos that it performs worst with 25 FPS is bad enough but the jumps between each frame on a 10 FPS video are so big that it has no choice but to do weird transformations that look utterly nauseating to the point where although I see it as an overall improvement I know already the uploading this to youtube at 60fps will result in dozens of comments from people saying it looks weird and I sure have kept it at 10 FPS and now I've said this Hill Lee to dozens of comments from people ironically saying that it looks weird and that I should have kept it at 10 FPS I know you so well I was even thinking of making it 60fps in the center of the screen and having it fade to the 10fps original around the sides which is where the frame rate conversion bugs aren't only the most obvious but the contrast between a smooth 60 in the center and a juddery 10 around the outside was equally distracting this video is health to upscale but that's also its appeal I'd be better off just loading up Morrowind and re-recording this entire project but that would be cheating and that's it that's as far back as my videos go but in secret another upscale was made no not a lot of the Rings I'm talking about the true Lord of the Rings lastly a decade ago I worked with the fart master on a movie but production stopped after some disagreements about the plot because at some point you really need something of them farts but I've been keeping tabs on this legend he had a video scheduled to be released every month spanning centuries into the future clickbait channels have their fun with him they showcased this works and laughed at him his chocolate ring dude appreciating his craft he seems to enjoy this but while others mocked him to me he was a misunderstood genius ahead of his time unfortunately in a bid to make youtube more child-friendly last year they sent him a hundred strikes within a matter of seconds wiping him from the site which is a shame because he'd managed a two and a half minute long fart the longest on record more than twice as long as mr. methane's best so out of respect for this legend this Rain Man of the gaseous elements I hand up scaled each and every one of this videos frames to 8k and I think this video perfectly encapsulates the beauty of upscaling it's to respect the past to acknowledge videos which deserve better than whatever format they find themselves bound by it is the timeless content that you want future generations to appreciate long after those who recorded Etta gone from this world it's truly remarkable and a testament to mankind's drive to better themselves it takes my breath away thank you for your service ai upscaling
