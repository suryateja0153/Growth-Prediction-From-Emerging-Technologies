 to see a man that I've known for 35 years if not 40 years IDI Yardeni is back with us and it's great to see you again my pleasure indeed after all these years yeah read your stuff and you were saying a look this market is due for a breather right is this the breather I don't know I tell you the truth I I do hope that the market just kind of stalls for a while because it's well ahead of the earnings fundamentals were but at about 18 18 and 1/2 forward p/e and 15 is kind of average historically but 18 18 and 1/2 makes sense with interest rates and inflation rates so low my concern is we just kind of keep going here and get up to 20 or 22 kind of multiple well that's what it looked like yesterday it looked like it was just gonna keep going better and melt up situation yeah yeah I'm worried about a mouth up actually but this doesn't look like much of a now I'm strange you know I've been keeping a diary of sell-offs in this bull market I've kind of 65 what I call panic attacks and six of them were actually outright Corrections of 10 to 20% that's in the last what 11 years oh well since March 2009 okay that was a low six days we've had a lot of these sell offs and they've all been buying opportunities and maybe we've just kind of got this knee-jerk Pavlovian reaction here in the market where anytime this thing goes down for any reason whatsoever people come in and buy this thing and part of that is because Fed Chairman Powell has told us that he's not going to be raising interest rates this year and that's inflation it really makes a big comeback and bearing in mind what happened overnight right the killing of Syl Molly right I doubt that the Fed is going to be enthusiastic about raising rates now know absolutely so I think the markets starting to kind of think well how does this play out with Fred policy what do you think of the odds I mean we're down 182 right 179 there you go well the odds that we ended a high here I don't know I don't do day trading quite something you know I deal with the trend but I think it's really quite possible and if it is and I'll be worrying again about a melt up I'd like to have sort of a civilized leisurely bull market here I've been forecasting 3,500 on the S&P 500 by year-end I just hope we don't get there in the next few weeks but the market wants to go up the Margaret wants to go you can just feel it yes yeah every time you get a pullback like look what you're getting look at what you're getting in fixed income you're getting very little return and I mean you've got dividend yields that are above the bond yield and so people are continuing to buy the market so help me out as a person only for many many years right I owned Microsoft for years and years and late last year last literally last week right I sold a chunk of the Microsoft that I've been holding for my condolences liberated a lot of profit and I'm a hammer then okay good that I'm happy for it what should I do with the cash well maybe put it back in Microsoft have some you know sellers remorse already yeah do don't do individual stocks but it is a great company and that's a wonderful thing about the US and our stock market there's a lot of really great companies that are extremely well managed at our world-class you and I have been around for many many years well you've been around for many years because I haven't well we've we I mean the the 1990s was an extraordinary bull market and particularly in the tech sector but it was all tech all the time this one has been actually very broad every now and then people take a snapshot of it the set is too narrow but if you look at the dynamic so but it just keeps broadening out now maybe what this event in Iran is in Iraq Iran causes is for the laggards like energy stocks to start to do some catch up here and as you said the defense stocks are looking awfully good so instead of thinking of what's gonna go down think about what might actually go up as a result of this I'm thinking I'm thinking cuz I got Microsoft cash on my hand see right here well so the energy the energy sector may be a good place to look for some value I just can't see it but you know who knows who knows after all these years it was great to see you again my pleasure in they don't be a stranger for another 35 it was please I'll be back and Yardeni here all right thank you appreciate it
