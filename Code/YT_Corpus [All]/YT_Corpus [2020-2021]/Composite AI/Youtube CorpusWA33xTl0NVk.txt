 if you have a winery for example and you're selling your products online people can go to your website pick the type of wine they would like to purchase select the quantity and then click Add to Cart but what if you want to make people order more than one or two bottles well a pretty good way to make them buy more is to add a quality based discount like three percent for three bottles five percent for five and so on they should see the discounts in a table above the Add to Cart button so if you want to know how to implement these on your WordPress website for free when using WooCommerce stay with me I will break down the entire process in five easy steps besides WooCommerce you'll need the dynamic pricing with discount rules for WordPress plugin which you can easily find on your dashboard once installed you will see this new element on your dashboards menu where you can change the general settings and set up the look of your pricing table as well as the way it works then you would have to add some product lists which will be used in the pricing rules let me go to the general settings first so in this field you would have to pick the name that will be displayed as a notification above the product for example if you put together these words in the message field below and the discount label is quantity your clients will see a notification like this once they add to cart a product that qualifies for discount based on the rules you will learn how to setup in step four so keep watching just make sure the show discount applied message on a cart page is enabled before you click Save Changes here are the settings of the pricing table which I recommend this being before the Add to Cart button so people can be incurred to buy more of your products you have three options for how your table will display values if you select discounted price it will display only the value of the reduced price while the discounted value will display the percentage of your discount if you select both people can see the percentage followed by the discounted price the title of your pricing table should be something like buy more to get the discount and then you have to label the columns of your table if you select both in this drop-down your table will consist of three columns where the first price label will display the discount the second label is for quantity and the last one will show up the result at price feel free to adjust the font size as well as the border color which is black as default then you can change the default text in these fields before saving the changes if you keep these fields empty it will display the default text as you can see here now that everything is set up we can move to the following step which is to create our product lists if you don't have too many categories and it will use only one pricing rule you can go ahead without an list I guess when adding a new list you need to pick the name let's see the main product category then you have to select the list type which could be a dynamic requests based on taxonomy relation and combinations as you can see below if you have just a couple of products that you want to add pricing rules to pick the product selection in this drop-down and type in your product name once you start typing it will show up available products with that word and you need to click on the product to add it to the list remove all products when you click here where one product if you click on the X icon near the product name finally click publish to create the list and go to the pricing rules click add new above and it will open a forum where you need to add the rule name quantity discount or something different based on the rule you want to create activate the priority level one which means that court based rules have the least priority and will be applied when the product is added to the cart you can apply a discount only for registered customers but remember that the discount table will be displayed only when people are logged in then you have to carefully select the product list and the discount type well the discount type can be based on product rules cart rules or simple quality rules I would use the quantity based discount which is the easiest to setup and control I guess the type of it should be discount on individual product quantity but you can select this count on court Eaton's count or discount on court quantity show the pricing table select the table layout which I would recommend as horizontal and then enable consider variations as a single product if you want to merge all quantity variations of a single product in your cart the minimum quantity should be 2 but the maximum value is up to you for example if you want to offer pre percent for a quantity of max2 products you should enter 2 over here for 3 enter 3 but never use a value lower than the minimum quantity then select the discount type as percentage or fixed price I would recommend a percentage which is much easier to control otherwise you would have to carefully check the price of each product if the discount is 3% enter 3 in this field and then add as many variations as you want let's see I want to have three levels of discount for this product so I add one more line here with a minimum discount as 3 and the maximum is also 3 a discount type percentage but for this amount of products I would cut off 5% from the list price then I set up for as the minimum and again for as maximum 7% discount could generate a fair product price for this quantity and so on if you want to setup pricing rules for limited time you can use the settings available in the schedule tab for example if you want to keep the pricing rule active for two weeks starting today the from date should remain as it is while the to date will be two weeks from now just click update when you're done and then you can set up more rules and restrictions in this tab you can start by clicking add group select the Eaton product price for example select relation add your value and then click update to add more rules to this group click the plus icon over here select the relation between these rules and feel free to add as many rules as you want to remove a rule click this icon for more groups you would have to click on add group again select the behavior in this drop-down and you already know what you need to do for the things below click update but pay attention to the delete button which will delete the entire rule so you'll have to start over now before publishing the pricing rule I want to let you know that you can disable the pricing rule automatically if the product is on sale let me show you what that means so if I activate this feature and publish the rule when I go to the product page I can see that the pricing rule is active and the table is displayed which means that if I add more than one product to my cart it will show me the notification and it will show me the final price in the car - that discount but if I edit that product and set the sale price in this field after updating the product when I go back to the product page the pricing rule is deactivated and people get the same price even if they add more than one product to the cart this could be a very important earning safety feature which will help you make sure you won't got anything from the already discounted price of a product i guess i've covered every important aspect of this plugin but if you have questions feel free to shoot them in the comments below I will answer each of you guys you can come with suggestions for videos about WooCommerce and WordPress or anything else that can help you step forward with your online presence I would like to create something based on your preferences instead of publishing videos that are just ideas of what you would need keep up the good work and see you in the next video Cheers
