 hello everybody welcome back thanks so  much for joining me today we are going   to basically look at how to remove the  lead and the human when you have followed   the steps from a previous video which  means that compositing is straightforward. that was a really confusing introduction  essentially in this video we're basically going to   go through how to do composites this is Zara she  is a fox terrier and she is awesome as part of   this shoot she needed to remain on lead the whole  time so she's on lead here with the owner stood   here now in an ideal world the lead would be more  like this coming out the back of the dog's head   and to be honest with you it makes sense for  me to use that picture rather than this one   but we're gonna do this one anyway so I need  to basically remove the owner and the lead   you absolutely could go ahead and clone all of  this out but that's gonna take some time and I'm   all for efficiency so if I've got a dog on a lead  I will make sure that any of my setups are done   in a way that I take a second picture the second  picture is always taken using back button focus   on the camera so that the focus point and the  focus plane doesn't move so in this situation my   second picture was this one which is an empty shot  it's not perfectly lined up so there is some work   to do there but other than that it's pretty solid  the same thing happened with the little dashhund   where there were empty shots taken from that one  as well and essentially what we're going to do is   remove the owner and the lead from this in a clean  straightforward and efficient fashion because   if you're wasting time doing things like this guys  you've got better things to spend your time on   so as you can see from this empty shot  here there is actually slightly more   of the lower edge of the log and the angle  isn't perfect that's fine because that's   basically we're just going to fix that through you  could use this exact same technique for removing   you know dogs from pictures for doing head  swaps for doing eye swaps for doing anything   you want so essentially what we do is we  need to open both of those images up into   photoshop remember that the treatment on both  should be the same so this has had the same   exposure and white balance adjustments on as this  one and it has also been run through topaz labs AI   denoise because we were in the woods and it was  raining so we'll open those up when we are in   photoshop we will have both of those pictures  now you can see that they aren't lined up right   this one is angled up slightly this one is lower  so what we need to do is match them now I actually   prefer more of the log being in shot and therefore  instead of putting the clear background version   onto the busy version I'm gonna do the other  way around and I'm actually gonna put the dog   into my other one so how do we do that well guys  you need to select all of one of your pictures to   select all press control and A or command an A  on your keyboard that will make sure that there   is a little marching ants around the entire frame  when you've done that you need to copy now just   use your keyboard shortcuts which are command  C or ctrl V on a windows go to your other image   and paste so that's command V or ctrl V if you're  on a windows what that's done is that's put my dog   on my empty picture there right so if we line  them up perfectly again like so you will see   that we're out of line let's look a little bit  closer here at the log can you see we are out of   line however can you also see that the focus point  remains in the exact same section of that log? Right so we need to line it up and we need to  line it up as best as we possibly can so look   for objects and elements that don't move so  for me I tend to look for landmarks I guess   so I'm looking at this edge over here and I'm also  looking probably at the back of the log here and   potentially this groove in the bark you need to  have at least two or three different things that   you're looking at then make sure that your top  layer is at low opacity so maybe 50% thereabouts   and you can see that there's loads of this that  doesn't match up now so what you need to do is   match up kind of as best you can somewhere  so that's pretty much there matched up but   then all of this is wrong right and you can see  that there's a rotational shift so if we zoom out and look at that rotation so Zara needs to  rotate this way to make this composite work   so what I'm going to do is  I'm going to do command T   or ctrl T which brings up your transform  options here and I'm going to start to rotate and when you do that you can  fine tune where you're putting it   and assess do we need any more  yes we do need a little bit more do it in little bits now there is a slightly different angle of  view so we're not going to get it perfect   but our focus needs to be on these landmarks which is pretty much there I think slightly higher up I'm using my keyboard just to nudge that is as good as this shot is  gonna get because there's a rotation   over the log there so if we turn  that on and put it up to full there's still a shift but it's because the  angle of the shot changed this is why it's   super important to stay still between your  shots but this is absolutely fine and we   can work with this this is not a problem at  all so with that done and your lines done   you then need to mask out things you don't  want therefore that includes any hard edges   like that any hard edges and the human on the  lead so we just add a mask down here at the   bottom and with a mask on at this layer that  we've got on the top grab a brush a big soft   brush it's very important  that it's soft at this stage   and the mask is white therefore you paint  with black and you just want to start to bring bits that you want back in  taking away the hard edges and then when you get to the lead  you need to be much more careful much more careful I can't stress how careful you  need to be here guys and you need to go through   your general edges and you'll clean it now you  could absolutely add your mask masking around   hair which I'll link above you could absolutely  add your hair mask to this section to speed up   going around the edge of the dog and on a wiry  dog like this that mask will act perfectly and   we just blend it out so we can get a bit of  a bigger brush and remember bokeh is circular   so therefore we need to make the circle complete  and bring some of that through so with that done because we're focusing on the area where  the two connect that is pretty solid so then   the last thing to do is clean up your objects  which are sharp because there's a shift there   right so what I tend to do is I actually use a  harder brush right and I start to bring through working with the hard edges  in the reference document   to reference image which is the just the  blank clog and I start to bring through chunks with hard edges so the hard edge gives you  a better cut I guess of objects that are sharp   so now there is a nice soft line that follows  actually the shadow of the dog which is great   down there and you would never guess that that  is a composite you would just never guess that   so then what I do because I think it's worthwhile  mentioning I duplicate both of those layers   so that there's two copies of my layers I then  merge the top two and that becomes my working   document and then I group the bottom two layers  so you will need to have a new background so   you can either duplicate that or just double click  to unlock the layer and then select those two and   then command G or control G to group and then I  will call that my composite without a capital O   and what that does is that keeps that safe  if you ever need to go back to it but this   is then our working document right and then you  continue with your edit and that's literally it   so if you had a situation where you had two dogs  you would do the exact same thing where you could   do head swaps and whatnot from one picture to  another by overlaying one on the other and then   masking through the finished version of this image  should be on the screen now for you guys so you   can see where it went after being edited if you  have any questions please do drop them down in the   comments box below find us on Instagram because  I would love
