 the latest jobless numbers show the economy's on life support and it appears May won't be much better economic analysts say don't expect any signs that we are immediately emerging from the policy induced coma look at the stock market Dow futures show it opening up more than 150 points this morning that's an anomaly Spencer McGowan's the senior portfolio manager from the Gowen group asset management welcome so I look at history during the Great Depression stocks lost bought nearly 90 percent of their value the S&P 500 this go-round is only down 11% the Nasdaq Composite back in positive territory for the year the economy is in a freefall so why isn't the stock market well you went from 29,000 out of 18,000 18,000 would be like no recovery and the beauty right it's not that bad and so the 24,000 is really anticipation so you're at the midpoint I would say from here you're 21,000 to 27,000 for a long time it's gonna take about three years before earnings can recover to the point they would justify a new high in the meantime you know the cyclical there are some trading opportunities there and in the technology whether that's the technology companies benefiting from the work from home trend that's a big part of why the Nasdaq is up now we have to realize the stock market is not the economy but it does seem to be divorced from what's happening on the ground well the bad news just came in obviously from the April shutdown by the end of the week tomorrow we get the numbers on the unemployment filings they'll probably total about 36 million people what the markets are just fading is about 12 million come back to work immediately like the restaurants a lot of the doctors were completely shut down and they're starting to reoperation so about a third of the jobs come back probably in May which is good news then another third take maybe you know 90 days to a hundred days and another third are gonna be sticky you know before we reach record employment that's probably 2020 late in the year so people want to know is this I'll use a football analogy here a head-fake is the market gonna tank well I think if it goes back under 21 thousand which is likely as we get more bad news right so that trading range is is the proper approach we believe where you say okay below 21,000 I'm going to add some stuff if we if we spiked up to 27,000 from the current 24 then it might harvest a few things in terms of short-term trading in a 401 K you want to up your contribution take advantage of this because three to five years you'll be glad you did it yeah I was gonna say you have to have this long-range vision so what do you do today do you buy do you sell just stand pat well right now we'd like the corporate glove into the corporate and global high-yield market that's the berated bond market the Fed is stepping in there you get you've got yields out there over ten percent in some of the high-yield bond funds those are deeply discounted great game potential and then we've got positions in the medical dividend plus the pipeline companies do oil and gas companies pipelines traded to 80 percent of the value of the steel in the ground that's silly so I saw quote from one goldman sachs analyst who said if i'm being dead but honest then I kind of cleaned it up a little bit he says nobody really knows what's going on you kind of gree with that well the one thing we do know there are more bargains out there and if I can get paid to wait you give me a big old I can reinvest that I get day to wait I'm okay alright so you gotta have a little bit of patience Spenser McGowan appreciate you have a great day stay safe thank you Bruce we'll be right back
