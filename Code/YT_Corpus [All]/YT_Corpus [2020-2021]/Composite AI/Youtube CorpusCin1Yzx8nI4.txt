 hello astronomy picture of the day december 16 2020 today's video is about sonified the matter of the bullet cluster what's the matter with the bullet cluster this massive cluster of galaxies 1 e0657 to 558 creates gravitational lens distortions of background galaxies in a way that has been interpreted as strong of evidence for the leading theory that dark matter exists within different analyzes though indicate that a less popular alternative modifying gravity could explain cluster dynamics without dark matter and provide a more likely progenitor scenario as well currently the two scientific hypotheses are competing to explain the observations its invisible matter versus amended gravity the dual is dramatic as a clear bulletproof example of dark matter would shatter the simplicity of modified gravity theories the featured sonified image is a hubble slash chandra slash magellan composite with red depicting the x-rays emitted by hot gas and blue depicting the suggested separated dark matter distribution the sonification assigns low tones to dark matter mid-range frequencies to visible light and high tones to x-rays the battle over the matter in the bullet cluster is likely to continue as more observations computer simulations and analyzes are completed submitted to a pod notable images of the 2020 geminids meteor shower thanks for watching and don't forget to like comment and share
