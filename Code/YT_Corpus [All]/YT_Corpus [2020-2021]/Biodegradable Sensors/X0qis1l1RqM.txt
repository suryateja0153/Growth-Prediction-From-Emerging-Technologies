 403 hello everyone thanks for joining us this afternoon this is our first virtual mickey colloquium very interesting to do it in this fashion not in person but it's hopefully as exciting as it would be in person at mit i'll take the opportunity starting a bit early to make a couple of comments about this colloquium series and then hopefully i will leave enough time for professor zhong sao to introduce our speaker professor alan rosch very exciting seminar today my name is matthias koller i am the junior faculty organizer of the me colloquiums and i'm doing this together with tony poulson who's also here with us as a panelist and the other colonist is our department head professor evelyn van we'll scaffold and moderate these colloquiums but my goal is to go out of the way and let the speaker and faculty host be prominently presented now um ellen will be introduced by sean hey but let me say a couple of words about the mickey equilibriums more generally what we're trying to do here is to invite a renowned and very accomplished speakers in the broad field of engineering across different disciplines that scaffold our seven interest areas in mechanical engineering in design and manufacture robotics installation control instrumentation control but also ocean science energy science bioengineering and micro nanosciences and ellen captures uh several of these areas including bioengineering design manufacture and also micro nano manufactured to some extent we invite speakers based on faculty recommendations and this often comes from the area heads or from individual faculty but i think in order to help diversify and make our uh make it look more inclusive i would also love to have feedback from the audience about speakers that would sort of represent all different walks of life and enrich our perspectives on how to do science how to do engineering but also how to sort of aim for a better society so i'd like to task the audience to let me know if you have good ideas for speakers that we should invite going forward in spring and fall day after and next year for our ecology and i will certainly still draw on my faculty colleagues to get information on who else we should invite but i think uh if the mit mechanical engineering community would chime in and so that would be wonderful and so with that i want to make one more announcement before we get started and that is that uh we will take questions and answers through the question on the panel today uh please put them in as they come to your mind and i will try to sort of uh look at them see how we can structure them and then moderate the question sessions afterwards and probably ask a couple of people to unmute and i would like to focus on giving students a word in this but also we'll pick a faculty member here and there so they don't get this disgruntled with that i'd like to hand over to shanghai please go ahead and introduce our speaker ideas first of all thank you so much for

experimental approaches for device validation and testing without further ado i give you a large you so much i appreciate the introduction um and thank you everyone for uh coming today it's great to see your names popping up and i'm excited to share some work today at this first mecchi colloquium so i will go ahead and share here okay can everybody see my screen okay okay i'll get started so uh today i'm going to be speaking about augmenting native function in dynamic organs and creating physiologically realistic ex vivo approaches for device validation and testing before i get started i want to say thank you to the wonderful group of people that i work with um some of them shown here last summer on our summer retreat and without them none of this work would be possible so it's really a credit to them and i'm lucky to work with such great people here at mit some of our research highlights are shown on the right and i look forward to discussing them in more detail so as an introduction and the background to my research we look at dynamic organs and cyclical dynamic motion is essential to the life-sustaining function of organs and these organs like the heart that's shown here are in constant motion they have complex tissue architecture and composite mechanical properties because of all these reasons it's challenging to support or repair these organs when they become impaired when they become diseased or dysfunctional we believe that overcoming these challenges is possible by blending principles of physio physiology pathophysiology design state-of-the-art materials and robotics my vision is to create a new approach first sorry my vision is to create a new approach for supporting and repairing organs that have this intrinsic mechanical function by designing solutions which fundamentally adhere to and integrate the technology into the inherent complex biomechanics of tissue ultimately we want to either supplement or supplant current approaches by matching and supporting native organ function which will eventually improve the quality of life for those with dysfunctional organs my research is divided into three interrelated research streams the first of which is augmenting organ function this is global mechanical augmentation of of organs that are at end-stage failure another research stream is repair or replacement of focal deficits of tissue before they advance to end-stage failure a third area is the development of organosynthetic simulators that are designed to enhance the testing of these devices before they advance to pre-clinical and clinical testing the approach we take to these problems is to use dynamic actuation and soft robotic techniques to augment organ function we also design implantable devices typically bioactive devices to allow replenishable therapy delivery and also to modulate the immune response so that we can deliver therapy more efficiently and we use these soft robotic approaches to reanimate organic tissue and that's explanted for benchtop simulators to do this we require a lot of different tools this work requires a deeper understanding of the biomechanics of the physiology and pathology we also use advanced imaging approaches such as cardiac diffusion tensor imaging we use a lot of computational modeling as you'll see throughout my talk and we employ advanced materials and robotics so i'll get started talking about my research i'll begin with research strand one which is augmenting organ function and i'll step through a few case studies of instances where i'm using mechanical assistance to to augment cyclical organ function and just some background typically devices that are are designed to help organs that have advanced stage failure take over the organ function so two examples here are a ventricular assist device and a ventilator and they can actually cause further tissue damage and they have considerable comorbidities like blood clotting or lung damage our goal is to augment rather than to replace organ function and we do this by mimicking native biomechanics and trying to avoid tissue trauma or comorbidities the first example i'll give is a cardiac compression device the clinical problem here is heart failure and when the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the demands of the body current treatment is by ventricular assist device the left ventricular assist devices the nail fat this can cause tissue damage it's very invasive and it can cause um its blood contacting so so it can risk causing clots our solution is a heart sleep that mimics native contraction it augments but doesn't does not replace function so it works with the heart and it helps the heart to pump without contacting blood during my doctoral studies i worked with professor walton mooney my co-advisors on developing a sleeve and that go a silicone sleeve that goes around the heart to augment function in an animal model we restored um cardiac output from acute heart failure here back to baseline which with our ventricular assist advice so we were able to restore um normal cardiac output using the sleeve around the heart without contacting blood at all since starting at mit we took this a step further we looked at designing this device out of a textile material and so we use a medical mesh material to fabricate the sleeve we showed that coupling the sleeve to the heart tissue and imparts greater functional improvement than the previous silicone sleeve we also demonstrated that this bio integration that happens between the textile device and the tissue can be used to achieve efficient coupling the idea is that you would place a sleeve and use it for passive restraint until you get some tissue integration with the heart and then you start to your active assistance and this efficient coupling improves the performance of the device in a porcelain model and so we can increase the augmentation of heart function in these patients with end-stage heart failure another example of a mechanical assist device is an implantable diaphragm assist device the clinical problem here is respiratory muscle weakness and especially in the case of neurodegenerative muscular disease or diaphragmatic paralysis the diaphragm is a major muscle of driving pump function when um patients have severe diaphragmatic dysfunction they have respiratory failure and treatment can be it's usually artificial ventilation this can be non-invasive or invasive via tracheostomy both methods significantly affect the quality of life of the patient our proposed solution is an implantable ventilator that mimics native breathing mechanics while preserving key aspects of quality of life goal is that we design soft robotic actuators that move the diaphragm and are implanted so the patient doesn't have a tracheostomy or a ventilator on their mouth so they can continue having normal breathing and talking swallowing functions to do this we had to design a new class of actuators uh soft robotic actuators are typically initially straight we made some that are flat are initially pre-curved and that can either flex further or counter flex depending on what motion is required we designed an analytic and a finite element model for these actuators they're made of silicone and reinforced with fibers to achieve the desired motion we also quantify them with digital image correlation and we found a great match between the analytical the finite element and the dic are the digital image correlation models um we took this a step further and we looked at the motion of the diaphragm with mri images using that motion we could define a trajectory of the motion of the diaphragm in various planes the sagittal cross section and the coronal cross section we could input put this motion trajectory into an algorithm and which would enable us to design an a segmented fiber reinforced actuator that would mimic that biological motion on the bottom left here you can see the output from the algorithm and we can use 3d printed moles and multi-segment moles to fabricate this actuator then we can follow the trajectory with these segmented actuators part of parts of these are linear so they contract linearly segments will bend and segments will counterflex or unbend what we were able to do was to replicate diaphragmatic motion pretty accurately this is in one plane okay i'll shift gears now and talk about research strand two which is repair or replacement of focal tissue deficits and the main problem here is localized tissue damage and one a good example of this is when a patient suffers from a heart attack or a myocardial infarction this is when the coronary blood supply to part of the heart is blocked um and that part of the tissue um is diseased and can't beat as well anymore it can progress to heart failure unless there are strategies to biologically repair it or mechanically support it the limitations with current treatment is localized delivery of therapy to this part of the heart and be it regenerative or not is typically limited to one dose of therapy because to deliver it locally is invasive and there's also no sustained delivery um and implantable devices can also be plagued by foreign body responses like fibrous capsules which impede their their function our solutions are multi-pronged the first is using an implantable reservoir that targets delivery to that part of the heart so we have localized uncontrolled release this reservoir is also replenishable from the outside of the heart through a subcutaneous port and and we've also done some work to show that we can make this reservoir immunomodulating by applying cyclical mechanical actuation another project is using advanced tunable biomaterials for mechanically reinforcing part of the heart which will prevent it from advancing to heart failure first of all i'll talk about the therapeutic epicardial reservoir this device is designed um to deliver either small molecules biologics or cells it's a hemispherical reservoir one side is selectively porous and the other side is non-porous it's sits on the outside of the heart and we did an animal study in a rap model where we um we delivered cells in this case it was mesenchymal stem cell delivery in a rat model of a heart attack wrap model we delivered cells at day 4 and 14 and we took multiple echocardiographic images to measure function throughout the course of the study what we found in this work was what started in my doctoral studies with professor million watch um was that if we used our device with cells and multiple refills at day 28 you could you had significantly better um ejection fraction which is a measure of cardiac function compared to the no treatment group to the group where we injected one dose of cells or two and the groups where we had no cells or um just one dose of cells so we showed here that multiple refills of cells really does contribute to improving cardiac function we did a lot of computational modeling after and my doctoral work and my postdoc and when i started my group and that was really um using computational tools to characterize the transport of biological therapies from these devices into the heart so we looked at multi-scale modeling of therapy transport through a biomaterial inside this reservoir across the membrane and into cardiac tissue and how how and the transport would happen through these media we also use diffusion tensor and imaging it's a method of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging which allows you to identify the anisotropy of tissue and the orientation of cardiac muscles we use that to track the diffusion of therapy into the heart tissue and for to predict temporal and spatial therapy distribution to allow us to optimize these implantable reservoirs other applications of these reservoirs are widespread one is one example is for ovarian cancer the problem with ovarian cancer at the moment is that um it's detected late to begin with and sometimes there's resistance to platinum-based therapies or chemotherapies and then there's insufficient concentration of drug at the target so we propose using these implantable reservoirs for localized delivery and we're looking at using immunotherapy with these devices and we started a study with a version of this reservoir that we call immunocell and we have a mouse model of ovarian cancer that we've um we've started at the koch institute and we put these devices in the mouse model and we deliver natural killer cells along with il15 and chemotherapy directly to the tumor here we show the tumor model where the tumor is shown in these colors at day 36 before we put in the device and then at day 46 after we put in the device and delivered these therapies through it so this is a project that we're excited to continue more we've also looked at developing a sleeve that goes around the heart to deliver therapy in various different places of the heart and this can be controlled so you have spatial reservoirs that deliver therapy to different areas we made this sleeve so that it has an adhesive channel that can secure the sleeve on the heart and it can be minimally invasively delivered and so this shows how the device will be minimally invasively delivered there's a suction tool that stabilizes it on the heart and then alarms that will deploy the sleeve onto the heart in an animal model we used contrast to show that we could fill reservoirs and on the sleeve either globally or with a micro catheter we could fill them individually one of the big issues with all of these implantable reservoirs is that the diffusion of therapy out of the transport of therapy out of these devices is limited by a fire and body response that develops when you implant um something into the body we characterize this more and by removing devices after after 20 days and putting them in a france cell which in which we could measure measure diffusion properties so what we found was at day four if you take a device at a day four you get much better diffusion than if you do the same at day 20. and so there is a decrease in the amount of therapy that diffuses across across the device over time and we set up a study and to see if we could use mechanical cyclical mechanical actuation to prevent this fibrous capsule from forming around the device so this is a milliscale dynamic soft reservoir so now we have two reservoirs one is for therapy and one is for actuation and what we did was we m we cyclically actuated it which modulated the biomechanics of the the tissue device interface so it altered the strain that the device saw and the capsule around it saw altered surrounding our prairie implant fluid flow and then cellular activity we did come we conducted a study where we had an actuated and non-actuated control device in each animal what we found was in the control device the fibrous capsule was thicker than the actuation group and so we showed a significant reduction in the thickness of the capsule in the actuated reservoir we also show did some histology and showed significant reduction in myofibrils fibroglass and an increased therapy transport through the device that was exposed to this cyclical actuation we think this could be a versatile tool for elucidating host response to implantable devices and ameliorating transport of drug from these reservoirs another ongoing project is mechanical reinforcement of the heart after a heart attack so there's been a lot of studies showing that if you can put a patch on the heart after a heart attack to reinforce it it will prevent it from dilating and from going into advanced heart advanced stage heart failure we're working with professor zhao on creating a tunable patch where we have um anisotropic reinforcement that's tunable we have published some work what professor jazz group have published some work that we were involved in where we helped with um implanting their double-sided tape adhesive onto the epicardial surface of the heart um further in a study that was published this week was using the same material as an electric bio adhesive interface for measuring ecg on the heart we're now using a similar adhesive and we're 3d printing onto it with these um with these sinusoidal patterns which allow us to have tunable and isotropy and this is a 3d printed patch on the with the hydrogel and this allows these patches to be delivered without sutures which is a huge advancement over what's done currently one of the big limitations to using these patches is that the implantations are invasive so we believe that if we can um catch a heart without having to do an invasive surgery by using the sutureless material and designing a minimally invasive delivery tool that it will have a much better chance of of having clinical benefit by tuning the thickness of these patches we can tune its mechanical properties and stiffness okay i'll move to research stand three which is organosynthetic simulators so the reason we need to work on um organo synthetic simulators which is where we couple organic expanded tissue with soft robots is that there are limitations in the current models for device testing you see a number of different models presented here each have limitations one is um replicating the mechanical properties of the heart another anatomical this is a computational model this is an explanted heart that's passively driven by flow but none of them are dynamic while preserving anatomical features but simultaneously recapitulating the biomechanics of the heart and this moving and dynamic three-dimensional environment of the heart and this is really required for high fidelity testing and something that i noticed in in my time during industry as well as an unmet meet my vision is to develop an organosynthetic thoracic simulator so an entire thoracic model that will have organic components for the lungs and the heart and synthetic biomechatronic soft robots driving these tissue elements so we will have um a hybrid by robotic heart that uses soft soft robotic actuation to reanimate passive tissue and we'll have a robotic diaphragm that moves organic lungs this can be instrumented to measure things like flow volume pressures both in the vascular system and in the respiratory system and the fact that the two systems are coupled in the same simulator is also useful for reasons i'll explain this device would have um merits for teaching purposes i teach um hst 100 respiratory pathophysiology and we've brought the simulator to class to um to teach some of the respiratory mechanics and principles it's also useful for testing medical devices for understanding the pathology better in a tunable way and elucidating the interdependency of the cardiac and the respiratory system three examples of these simulators are listed here and i'll talk about each one in turn the first is a biorobotic hybrid heart second respiratory model and an organosynthetic model of respiratory mechanics and in the third we combine the respiratory simulator with a cardiovascular flow lip flow loop to mimic the phantom physiology which i described earlier i'll start with the hybrid heart the overall concept is that we take an explanted porcelain heart we unravel it into a flat band which allows us to image it in a very specific way and in this way we can identify the orientation of the muscles in that part of the band which forms the left ventricle or the main pumping chamber of the heart with this flat pattern we can take it as a template to make a soft robotic or synthetic ventricular band and when re-wrapped around a dissected heart this will uh allow us to tunably and controllably re-animate the heart so we're replacing the dead left ventricular muscular tissue with a soft robotic and muscular substitute so how do we do this um clara on my team spent a lot of time dissecting hearts in a layer wise fashion so that we could remove all the muscle and only maintain the intracardiac stroke the very inner layer of muscle and the intracardiac structures including the valves and the chordae tendineae that drive the valves with with this structure we could then um come up with a molding process where we had an outer mold of the original intact heart and then we could fill the voids that were created by the removed tissue with silicone so we created a synthetic myocardium that was an exact replica of the original um myocardial tissue our heart muscle and we collaborated again with professor zhao to develop an adhesive this time to adhere fixed tissue to silicone and when we joined them together we got this structure that was a bio hybrid heart it was basically organic tissue with a synthetic myocardium in this case it's not active it's just to show that we could we could connect a synthetic muscle substitute with the tissue this is just a little bit more of the adhesive on how it looks um so it integrates very well by mechanically interpenetrating into the tissue and it allows us to bond silicone to fixed tissue it's shown here in green interpenetrating and tissue shown in brown on the heart which is shown in red the adhesive is shown in yellow and the synthetic myocardium is here in gray if you look at the cross sections with ct you can see excellent coupling of the synthetic and organic components this is what the structure looks at if you take slices through the heart so you can see organic tissue in lighter gray and then the myocar synthetic myocardium in darker gray and both are very well coupled to each other as well if you come from the top down this is going through the vessels in the atria the top chamber you can see the left ventricle here the right ventricle here again the organic tissues on the inside and the synthetic is on the outside and both are coupled together completely we wanted to make this active though and so that we could recreate motion um so i mentioned the scanning that we did to identify the muscle orientation this is diffusion tensor mri again in collaboration with professor chris newton at the martino center it allows you to get the vector images of the fastest um path of diffusion of water which you can then project onto a 2d plane and use a technique called tractography to identify the orientation of the muscle fibers in the heart from this we get a coarse grid on which we base a cad layout of a soft robotic band these um actuators here are aligned following the same orientation these are called flat and pleated artificial muscles when you pressurize them with air they'll contract axially and they'll expand radially and we can use finite element models to predict this motion so when you um pressurize these you can get this motion this is echocardiography showing the change in volume of the ventricle when you're cyclically actuating this compared to a reference heart and if we look at stills of this we can see um this is the end of the relaxation phase this is the end of the systolic or contraction phase the purple stars show the inflated bladders and you can see the change in volume of the chamber that happens in the long axis view and in the short axis view and this was similar to this is similar to what we see in a real heart so we've coupled them together and preserves the organic tissue and recreated myocardial motion next we want to recreate the entire pressure volume loop that happens in a cardiac cycle and we want to decellularize this tissue towards um having it as an implantable total artificial heart and i'm part of a consortium that's a finalist for the british heart foundation big challenge so we're hoping to get some additional funding to make this a replacement hard to avoid people on long waiting lists for transplants i'll move to and the organosynthetic model of respiratory mechanics so the vision here is that we have organic lungs and we have a synthetic diaphragm that drives the motion of these lungs that's powered by pneumatic artificial muscles again this can be used as a pedagogical tool for teaching and it can be used as a training model for ventilation or as a model for testing devices and as an in vitro test bed for um surgical procedures a video of this simulator working is shown here so as the synthetic diaphragm moves down the lungs will inflate and deflate and this motion is tunable by the pneumatic artificial muscles underneath it these are organic lungs they're cow lungs that are fixed in a way that maintains their um their prop mechanical properties and this simulator was part of an exhibit in the science gallery in dublin on plastics by tuning the input pressure to the actuators that move the diaphragm we can create different abdominal pressures and pleural pressures which change during the breathing cycle so we can control um the depth of breathing from shallow to deep breaths we can also modify the compliance of different components like the lungs or the abdomen and by doing so we can achieve different amounts of flow and volume entering the lungs with each cycle so this is nice for simulating pathological conditions like covert for example when the lungs get stiffer we can also use it to test ventilators which is topical at the moment we show and when we connect the simulator to a ventilator that we measure similar similar measures with our sensors compared to the ventilator sensors but we also have additional measurements of pleural pressure which is a pressure that can't be measured by a ventilator and we also show that we can trigger ventilator breaths by using our simulator the final model i'll talk about is the biomechanical mimic of the fontan physiology i explained how dependent the hemodynamics of the fontan physiology are on breathing so what happens is when the diaphragm moves down and up it affects the the venous blood return in the passive shunt that sits inside the thoracic cavity so we combined a flow leap a cardiovascular flow loop with a patient-derived image of the fontan cross where the fontan is surgically um placed and we put this inside our simulator and now what we can see is just by moving the diaphragm alone we can get flow in in the vena caval part of the of the fontan um setup and this has been instrumental in designing a device for helping with the fontan flow without it we wouldn't have been able to really test our devices and for for this physiology there's no existing ana model animal model that recreates this condition and there is no benchtop model that that couples the cardiovascular and the respiratory system so this has been really important for developing therapies for these patients we can replicate flow with this model this is um clinical data that shows how the flow in the vena cava changes with breathing and we show with our mock loop that we can replicate it we can also look at the effect of deeper or shallower breathing um on on flow in in the vena cava and the effect of breathing rate on the flow there also varying vessel compliance can affect the flow and all these are really interesting biomechanical influences of flow and that haven't been elucidated previously and we're working with dr pedro del nido to um set up an imaging study to do mri mris on these patients at boston children's hospital to validate these models and to potentially propose non-invasive interventions that can help these patients as well as developing our device so that kind of wraps up the three strands of my research you will notice i spoke a lot about computational models throughout my talk we use these computational models for multiple different reasons for modeling things like injection into the muscle of the heart flow in involves both healthy and diseased um for modeling our therapeutic reservoirs and for modeling the flow of or the transport of therapies into tissue recently we've done a lot of work modeling both heart contraction and how it couples with fluids and how this is affected and for different disease conditions so we can look at fluid structure interaction models of fluid and mechanical models we can also look at the mechanics of valve leaflets and recreate things like mitral regurgitation where um the mitral valve is not functioning anymore recently we use these fluid models to develop a simple low-cost tool that would convert a c-cap or a continuous positive airway pressure machine to a ventilator for patients during the pandemic and we use these cfd models to create this fluidic oscillator that converts constant flow into oscillating flow so to summarize my research effort is focused on restoring or or improving the function of mechanically active organs specifically like the heart and lungs um all my work depends on the use of physiological and pathological biomechanics so that we can or um design devices that mimic physiology or augment mechanical function as i mentioned this relies on a number of tools advanced imaging computational modeling and advanced robotics and materials we use and expand on our understanding of biomechanical behavior both in a healthy a physiological and a diseased context and we take into consideration factors that allow us to minimize foreign body responses to implantables in the long run our vision is to translate these new approaches and technology so that we can supplant the current approaches by better matching and supporting native organ function i want to say a huge thank you to the current members of my group shown here on the left and they're just a fantastic group of people to work with all my collaborators on the right here and the department head professor wang director of arms professor edelman and my mentoring committee have been really really helpful over the past few years since i started my group so i'd like to thank you all and these are my founders who i'd like to acknowledge um and these are my pandemic pals that have been my new workmates over the past few months so thank you i'm happy to take any more questions and thank you awesome talk uh great work mates and a little body of work um that is fantastic all right there's a few questions in the chat i see six right now from a couple of people and we can go through the question answer in that context you can also raise your hands and i would actually given the number of questions go by asking the first person who came first that was would have been amos amis if you want to unmute and ask a question yourself we can do that and see how that works i guess allow to talk is the button have to push oh here we go uh sorry i'm on my phone watching this um my my question alan was um as you implant these devices like in the heart or to assist lung function could the person grow more dependent on the devices and actually lose some natural function or vice versa could they be used almost like a physical therapy device to add stress and strengthen the organs yeah it's a great question and we're hoping for the latter so the hope is that by supporting these organs when they're diseased that we can help them to recover function so there have been some studies with left ventricular assist devices for example that have shown that when you unload the heart so you know the disease muscle is trying really hard to pump if you unload it and pump the blood for it that muscle can recover some amount of function and we're hoping that that we can show the same effect with our both our sleeve and our implantable ventilator that we can support the muscle long enough for it to recover and then we can turn off the actuation and leave these as passive you know redundant structures but we're not causing any further damage to the tissue can you do something akin to weightlifting and can you like change the phase of the loading or anything like that to strengthen muscle yeah absolutely you can so even the passive mechanical and reinforcement can do that so depending on you know how full the heart is for example it can achieve um if it's over fully can't achieve its full stroke and there's a french starting principle so if we can reinforce it we can do that and yeah i think like weightlifting or retraining and rehabilitating and is the way we would think of supporting the emotion and then you could think of having some kind of closed loop feedback so as the native function is getting better you kind of wean the patient off this assistance over time cool thank you thanks thank you felipe has a question that just came up that is nice and concise so i'll give philippe the option to to ask well thank you first for the final was really great so my question was well does any of the device present immediately immunological problems of the time of implications such as the first one that was the sleep for the heart the of you do not have the such follow-up for that information thank you yeah thank you um so you're wondering about the immune response to the cardiac sleeve yeah you got your question yeah so we don't have chronic studies on the active cardiac sleeve in a large animal model but we have implanted the same materials into a small animal model and conducted chronic studies we can reduce the immune response that happens and by one example is where we used a um a tough gel which was developed in in the moonie lab at the interface of the sleeve and the device and this reduced local information um for example so we have longer term studies that and use optimal materials to make this leave out the question of biointegration is is one i mentioned where we use the textile sleeve and there you're relying on some level of immune response to integrate the tissue into the sleeve but it has to be a controlled level and once coupled then you start your actuation with efficient mechanical coupling and you can tune that immune response by things like mesh design knit pore size uh coatings so you can you know really um control the level of immune response to those materials yeah yeah it answered my question thank you very much and very interesting thank you thank you daniel had two questions daniel gilbert so i would say daniel maybe ask the more pressing ones so that we get other people a chance to ask a question as well and i just allow you to talk um sorry yeah can you hear me yes hi oh so um for the heart where you where there seems to be some fibrous uh patch that develops and you have a hard time delivering the drugs after that if there was some i guess i could combine my questions if there was some way you could extend needles out of your drug delivery system or um i guess encourage like angiogenesis uh i thought that cancer is good at encouraging angiogenesis um if you could do the same thing so yes absolutely and yeah there are a number of coatings we could use to chemically modify and the external surface of these reservoirs and my postdoc will be delighted that you mentioned these needles because last week he showed me a preliminary video of um of micro needles that will eject from a reservoir an implantable reservoir to kind of break through this barrier so we're working on it all right thanks and then i will bring up saeed um who has a number of questions and uh nice complimentary comments on your work ellen um so let me find him a list of of people and then i can give him here we go say it it was yours and i think you have to angle it hi hmm say it can you can you speak or should i i'll give you a few seconds and then i i will resort to reading your questions if you're okay with that maybe you read them yeah i think the audio is a little problem so he asks and this is actually his second question oh sir he was reactive how is the resonance frequency of an oscillating ventilator tuned not everyone is breathing at the same respiratory rate or intake an exit ratio an exhale ratio and tidal volume right so how do you what sort of degrees of freedom do you have to adjust this to an individual patient yeah mainly it's geometry based the the rate of oscillation so there's different chambers and you by tuning the geometry you can influence the frequency but there are also adjustable screws in the channels so you can increase um the size of those feedback channels which can also um tune both the frequency and the the positive inspiratory and positive expiratory pressure at peak expiratory and peak inspiratory pressure so you have um some level of tunability once you have this device and we matched um i didn't show all the data but we were able to achieve clinically relevant uh frequencies and pressures with with this device do you hear me or am i talking now hello we can hear you but it's a bit low level yeah oh i see so um i'm gonna speak loud so uh regarding the process of making or attaching pneumatic actuators on on heart to assist it so i mean as we know you need uh like gas tanks and valves to operate those pneumatic actuators yes um what do what do you suggest uh as an actuator to to resolve this issue because you know people cannot carry a tank you know to for the hard to work i mean this is at the earliest stage i understand but what do you see the future for this yeah absolutely um yeah so we need um an electro-pneumatic control system for this device and we have looked at miniaturizing it so that it could be wearable like on a belt or in a backpack and that's what happens currently with these left ventricular assist devices ideally the goal would be to have it fully implantable and often they will implant um pumps in the abdomen where there's more space and then charge them through the skin so that's a research that's going on in industry for left ventricular assist devices that we would likely adopt so the goal is to miniaturize the pneumatics and electronics and be able to have them either wearable or fully implantable i also just saw your question about um the process of cutting the heart and imaging it so yes this is invasive and this is not something we would do for a um a device that augments function this is um just to replicate function on the bench so as a benchtop simulator the sleeve does not cut into the heart at all that wraps around very atraumatically wraps around the heart i see okay thank you very much yes thank you fantastic uh i think that brings us to the full hour so that's sort of the framework that we want to keep you in the seminars and this was a fantastic talk thank you thanks thank you for introducing ellen um she's obviously very much available if you have more questions but at that point i think it's a good point to to conclude the seminar and to stress that we will have more of those uh next week it's professor bill tuckerland from our department and hopefully you all can join us ready with questions and excitement good to see you all thank you
