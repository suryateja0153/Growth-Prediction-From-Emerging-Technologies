 bioplastics are plastics derived from renewable biomass sources such as vegetable fats and oils corn starch straw wood chips food waste etc bio plastic can be made from agricultural byproducts and also from used plastic bottles and other containers using microorganisms common plastics such as fossil fuel plastics also called petrol based polymers are derived from petroleum or natural gas not all bio plastics are biodegradable nor biodegrade more readily than commodity fossil fuel derived plastics bio plastics are usually derived from sugar derivatives including starch cellulose and lactic acid as of 2014 bio plastics represented approximately 0.2 percent of the global polymer market 300 million tons topic applications bioplastics are used for disposable items such as packaging crockery cutlery pots bowls and straws few commercial applications exist for bio plastics in principle they could replace many applications for petroleum derived plastics however cost and performance remain problematic as a matter of fact their usage as favorable only if supported by specific regulations limiting the usage of conventional plastics typical as the example of Italy where biodegradable plastic bags and shoppers are compulsory since 2011 with the introduction of a specific law beyond structural materials electroactive bio plastics are being developed that promise to be used to carry electric current biopolymers are available as coatings for paper rather than the more common petrochemical coatings topic types topic starch-based plastics thermoplastic starch currently represents the most widely used bioplastic constituting about 50% of the bioplastics market simple starch bioplastic can be made at home pure starch is able to absorb humidity and as the cisu table material for the production of drug capsules by the pharmaceutical sector flexible Iser and plasticizers such as sorbitol and glycerine can also be added so the starch can also be processed thermoplastic aliy the characteristics of the resulting bioplastic also called thermoplastic else touch can be tailored to specific needs by adjusting the amounts of these additives starch based bio plastics are often blended with biodegradable polyesters to produce starch poly lactic acid starch polycaprolactone or starch eco flex poly butylene adipate co terephthalate produced by BASF blends these blends are used for industrial applications and are also compostable other producers such as Rockette have developed other starch polyolefin blends these blends are not biodegradable but have a lower carbon footprint than petroleum-based plastics used for the same applications due to the origin of its raw material starch is cheap abundant and renewable starch based plastics are complex blends of starch with compostable plastics such as poly lactic acid poly butylene adipate terephthalate poly butylene succinate polycaprolactone and polyhydroxy Alka knowit's these complex blends improve water resistance as well as processing and mechanical properties starch based films mostly used for packaging purposes are made mainly from starch blended with thermoplastic polyesters to form biodegradable and compostable products these films are seen specifically in consumer goods packaging of magazine wrappings and bubble films in food packaging these films are seen as bakery or fruit and vegetable bags composting bags with this films are used in selective collecting of organic waste further a new starch based film was developed by Agricultural Research Service scientists can even be used as a paper topic cellulose-based plastics cellulose bio plastics are mainly the cellulose esters including cellulose acetate and nitrocellulose and their derivatives including celluloid cellulose can become thermoplastic when extensively modified an example of this as cellulose acetate which is expensive and therefore rarely used for packaging however cellulosic fibers added to starches can improve mechanical properties permeability to gas and water resistance due to being less hydrophilic than starch a group at Shanghai University was able to construct a novel green plastic based on cellulose through a method called hot pressing topic protein-based plastics bioplastics can be made from proteins from different sources for example wheat gluten and casein show promising properties as a raw material for different biodegradable polymers additionally soy protein as being considered as another source of bioplastic soy proteins have been used in plastic production for over 100 years for example body panels of an original Ford automobile were made of soy based plastic there are difficulties with using soy protein based plastics due to their water sensitivity and relatively high cost therefore producing blends of soy protein with some already available biodegradable polyesters improves the water sensitivity and cost topic some aliphatic polyester 's the aliphatic bio polyesters are mainly polyhydroxy Alka knowit's PHAs like the pol III hydroxy butyrate phb polyhydroxy Veiler 8p h v and polyhydroxy hexa no 8 PHH topic polylactic acid PLA poly lactic acid PLA is a transparent plastic produced from corn or dextrose superficially it is similar to conventional petrochemical based mass plastics like PS it has the distinct advantage of degrading to non toxic products unfortunately it exhibits inferior impact strength thermal robustness and barrier properties blocking air transport across the membrane PLA and PLA blends generally come in the form of granulates with various properties and are used in the plastic processing industry for the production of films fibers plastic containers cups and bottles PLA is also the most common type of plastic filament used for home fused deposition modeling topic Paulie three hydroxy butyrate the biopolymer poly 3 hydroxy butyrate pH B is a polyester produced by certain bacteria processing glucose cornstarch or wastewater its characteristics are similar to those of the petro plastic polypropylene phb production as increasing the South American sugar industry for example has decided to expand phb production to an industrial scale phb is distinguished primarily by its physical characteristics it can be processed into a transparent film with a melting point higher than 130 degrees Celsius and as biodegradable without residue topic polyhydroxy Alka knowit's polyhydroxy Alka knowit's are linear polyesters produced in nature by bacterial fermentation of sugar or lipids they are produced by the bacteria to store carbon and energy in industrial production the polyester is extracted and purified from the bacteria by optimizing the conditions for the fermentation of sugar more than 150 different monomers can be combined within this family to give materials with extremely different properties PHA has more ductile and less elastic than other plastics and it is also biodegradable these plastics are being widely used in the medical industry topic polyamide eleven pa 11 as a biopolymer derived from natural oil it is also known under the trade name Wilson be commercialized by our quema PA 11 belongs to the technical polymers family and is not biodegradable its properties are similar to those of PA 12 although emissions of greenhouse gases and consumption of non-renewable resources are reduced during its production its thermal resistance is also superior to that of PA 12 it is used in high-performance applications like automotive fuel lines pneumatic air brake tubing electrical cable anti termite sheathing flexible oil and gas pipes control fluid umbilicals sports shoes electronic device components and catheters a similar plastic is polyamide 410 P a 410 derived 70% from castor oil under the trade name eco packs commercialized by DSM P a 410 as a high-performance polyamide that combines the benefits of a high melting point approximately 250 degrees Celsius low moisture absorption and excellent resistance to various chemical substances topic bio derived polyethylene the basic building block monomer of polyethylene as ethylene ethylene is chemically similar to and can be derived from ethanol which can be produced by fermentation of agricultural feedstocks such as sugarcane or corn bio derived polyethylene as chemically and physically identical to traditional polyethylene it does not biodegrade but can be recycled the Brazilian chemicals group brass cim claims that using its method of producing polyethylene from sugarcane ethanol captures removes from the environment 2.15 tonnes of co2 per ton of green polyethylene produced topic genetically-modified bioplastics genetic modification GM is also a challenge for the bio plastics industry none of the currently available bio plastics which can be considered first generation products require the use of GM crops although GM corn as the standard feedstock looking further ahead some of the second-generation bioplastics manufacturing technologies under development employ the plant factory model using genetically modified crops are genetically modified bacteria to optimize efficiency topic polyhydroxy urethanes recently there have been a large emphasis on producing bio-based and isocyanate free polyurethanes one such example utilizes a spontaneous reaction between poly amines and cyclic carbonates to produce poly hydroxyl Thane's unlike traditional cross-linked polyurethanes cross-linked polyhydroxy era things have been shown to be capable of recycling and reprocessing through dynamic transcarbamoylase in reactions topic lipid derived polymers a number bioplastic classes have been synthesized from plant and animal derived fats and oils polyurethanes polyesters epoxy resins and a number of other types of polymers have been developed with comparable properties to crude oil based materials the recent development of olefin metathesis has opened a wide variety of feedstocks to economical conversion into bio monomers and polymers with the growing production of traditional vegetable oils as well as low-cost microalgae derive oils there is huge potential for growth in this area topic environmental impact materials such as starch cellulose wood sugar and biomass are used as a substitute for fossil fuel resources to produce bio plastics this makes the production of bio plastics a more sustainable activity compared to conventional plastic production the environmental impact of bio plastics is often debated as there are many different metrics for greenness eg water use energy use deforestation bio degradation etc hence bioplastic environmental impacts are categorized into non renewable energy use climate change eutrophication and acidification bio plastic production significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions and decreases non-renewable energy consumption firms worldwide would also be able to increase the environmental sustainability of their products by using bio plastics although bio plastics save more non-renewable energy than conventional plastics and emit less GHG compared to conventional plastics bio plastics also have negative environmental impacts such as eutrophication and acidification bio plastics induce higher eutrophication potentials than conventional plastics biomass production during industrial farming practices causes nitrate and phosphate to filtrate into water bodies this causes eutrophication which is the richness of the nutrients in body waters eutrophication as a threat to water resources around the world since it kills aquatic organisms creates dead zones and causes harmful algal blooms bio plastics also increase acidification the high increase in eutrophication and acidification caused by bio plastics as also caused by using chemical fertilizer in the cultivation of renewable raw materials to produce bio plastics other environmental impacts of bio plastics include exerting lower human and terrestrial ecosystem carcinogenic potentials compared to conventional plastics however bio Plastics exert higher aquatic ecotoxicity than conventional materials bio plastics and other bio-based materials increased stratospheric ozone depletion compared to conventional plastics this is a result of nitrous oxide emissions during fertilizer application during industrial farming for biomass production artificial fertilizer increased nitrous oxide emissions especially when the crop does not need all the nitrogen minor environmental impacts of bio plastics include toxicity through using pesticides on the crops used to make bio plastics bio plastics also cause carbon dioxide emissions from harvesting vehicles other minor environmental impacts include high water consumption for biomass cultivation soil erosion soil carbon losses and loss of biodiversity and they are mainly are a result of land use associated with bio plastics land use for bio plastics production leads to lost carbon sequestration and increases the carbon costs while diverting land from its existing uses although bio plastics are extremely advantageous because they reduce non-renewable consumption and GHG emissions they also negatively affect the environment through land and water consumption using pesticide and fertilizer eutrophication and acidification hence one's preference for either bio plastics or conventional plastics depends on what one considers the most important environmental impact topic biodegradation of bioplastics biodegradation of any plastic is a process that happens at solid liquid interface whereby the enzymes in the liquid phase depolymerize the solid phase both bioplastics and conventional plastics containing additives are able to biodegrade bio plastics are able to biodegrade in different environments hence they are more acceptable than conventional plastics biodegradability of bio plastics occurs under various environmental conditions including soil aquatic environments and compost both the structure and composition of biopolymer or biocomposite have an effect on the bio degradation process hence changing the composition and structure might increase biodegradability soil and compost as environment conditions are more efficient in bio degradation due to their high microbial diversity composting not only biodegrades bio plastics efficiently but it also significantly reduces the emission of greenhouse gases biodegradability of bio plastics in compost environments can be upgraded by adding more soluble sugar and increasing temperature soil environments on the other hand have high diversity of microorganisms making it easier for bio degradation of bio plastics to occur however bio plastics in soil environments need higher temperatures and a longer time to biodegrade some bio plastics biodegrade more efficiently in water bodies and marine systems however this causes danger to marine ecosystems and freshwater hence it is accurate to conclude that bio degradation of bio plastics in water bodies which leads to the death of aquatic organisms and unhealthy water can be noted as one of the negative environmental impacts of bio plastics topic industry and markets while plastics based on organic materials were manufactured by chemical companies throughout the 20th century the first company solely focused on bio plastics Marlboro biopolymers was founded in 1983 however Marlboro and other ventures that followed failed to find commercial success with the first such company to secure long term financial success being the Italian company Nova mon founded in 1989 the expense and time requirements of researching and testing new bio-based and biodegradable polymers have placed bio plastics at a commercial disadvantage compared to petrochemical based plastics bio plastics remain less than 1% of all plastics manufactured worldwide and until very recently have been an average of two to four times more expensive to manufacture than petrochemical plastics most bio plastics do not yet save more carbon emissions than are required to manufacture them in addition to the cost of research bio plastics lack the versatility of application that petrochemical plastics possess with many conventional plastics having no bio-based equivalent that can match their quality finally the industry faces logistical problems with both material sources and waste disposal infrastructure as most bio plastics are produced from plant sugars starches or oils it is estimated that replacing 250 million tonnes of the plastic manufactured each year with bio-based Plastics would require 100 million hectares of land or 7% of the arable land on Earth and when bio plastics reach the end of their lifecycle those designed to be compostable and marketed as biodegradable are often sent to landfills due to the lack of proper composting facilities or waste sorting where they then release methane as they break down and aerobic Li despite this the bio plastics industry has grown by 20 to 30 percent a year BCC research forecasts that the global market for bio degree polymers would grow at a compound average growth rate of more than 17 percent through 2012 and this rate of growth has actually been exceeded bio-based plastics are predicted to make up 5% of all manufactured plastics in 2020 and 40% of all manufactured plastics in 2030 Sarah sonna predicts that when bio plastics reach 5% of the plastics market in 2020 the market for bio-based plastics will be worth 5.8 billion dollars three times the size of the bio plastics market in 2014 the largest demand for bio plastics has been in packaging driven by widespread concern over the use of petrochemical plastics in disposable one-use products that are then sequestered in landfills or the natural environment packaging continues to provide 60% of the market for bio plastic and to account for the largest share of growth in the industry there has been a shift in the market for an increased demand of bio plastics especially for sustainable packaging this has been seen specifically in Western Europe which accounted for more than 45 percent of the global biodegradable plastics demand in 2014 this demand from consumers for more sustainable options was also seen in recent policies Italy has banned the use of petroleum-based plastic bags and there is a tax on use of petroleum-based plastic bags in Germany however the industry in bio-based polymers has not grown as rapidly as some have predicted the nn FCC predicted that the industry would exceed 2.1 million tons produced each year by 2013 but by in 2017 only 2.0 5 million tons of bioplastic were produced in that year this remains only a small fraction of all plastics manufacturing which produced a total 292 million tonnes of thermoplastics in 2015 as production expands no universal standards governing bioplastics and their manufacturer disposal this includes a lack of any regulation on the amount of sustainably sourced material in a product required for it to be marketed as a bioplastic it should also be noted that according to market and market the global biodegradable plastics market as just beginning and only accounts for less than 1% of the overall plastics market because of the fragmentation in the market and ambiguous definitions it is difficult to describe the total market size for bio plastics but estimates put global production capacity at 327 thousand tons in contrast global production of polyethylene PE and polypropylene PP the world's leading petrochemical derived poly olefins was estimated at over 150 million tonnes in 2015 Copa committee of agricultural organization in the European Union and Co GE GE a general committee for the agricultural cooperation in the European Union have made an assessment of the potential of bio plastics in different sectors of the European economy catering products 450 thousand tonnes per year organic waste bags 100,000 tonnes per year biodegradable mulch foils 130,000 tonnes per year biodegradable foils for diapers 80,000 tons per year diapers 100% biodegradable 240,000 tons per year soil packaging 400,000 tons per year vegetable packaging 400,000 tons per year tire components 200,000 tons per year total 2 million tons per year topic history and development of bioplastics 1862 at the great London exhibition Alexander Parkinson displays parkin e-zine the

inventions pulled by the author to show versatility of bio plastics and important breakthroughs new applications and inventions of bio plastics happen each year topic testing procedures topic industrial compost ability and 13432 ASTM D 6 400 the N 13432 industrial standard as arguably the most international in scope this standard must be met in order to claim that a plastic product is compostable in the European marketplace in summary it requires biodegradation of 90% of the materials in a lab within 90 days the ASTM 6400 standard as the regulatory framework for the united states and sets a less stringent threshold of 60% biodegradation within 180 days for non-homologous and 90% biodegradation of hama polymers with in industrial composting conditions temperatures at are above 140 F municipal compost facilities do not see above 130 F many starch based plastics PLA based plastics and certain aliphatic aromatic copolyester compounds such as succinate sand Atta pates have obtained these certificates additive based bio plastics sold as photo degradable or oXXO biodegradable do not comply with these standards in their current form topic compost ability ASTM D 600 to the ASTM D 6002 method for determining the compost ability of a plastic defined the word compostable as follows that which is capable of undergoing biological decomposition in a compost site such that the material is not visually distinguishable and breaks down into carbon dioxide water in organic compounds and biomass at a rate consistent with known compostable materials this definition drew much criticism because contrary to the way the word is traditionally defined it completely divorces the process of composting from the necessity of it leading to houmous compost as the end product the only criterion this standard does describe is that a compostable plastic must look to be going away as fast as something else one has already established to be compostable under the traditional definition topic withdrawal of ASTM D 6002 in January 2011 the ASTM withdrew standard ASTM D 6000 - which had provided plastic manufacturers with the legal credibility to label a plastic as compostable its description as as follows this guide covered suggested criteria procedures and a general approach to establish the compost ability of environmentally degradable plastics the ASTM has yet to replace this standard topic biobased ASTM D 6 8 6 6 the ASTM D 6 866 method has been developed to certify the biologically derived content of bioplastics cosmic rays colliding with the atmosphere mean that some of the carbon as the radioactive isotope carbon-14 co2 from the atmosphere as used by plants in photosynthesis so new plant material will contain both carbon-14 and carbon-12 under the right conditions and over geological timescales the remains of living organisms can be transformed into fossil fuels after approximately 100,000 years all the carbon-14 present in the original organic material will have undergone radioactive decay leaving only carbon-12 a product made from biomass will have a relatively high level of carbon-14 while a product made from petrochemicals will have no carbon-14 the percentage of renewable carbon in a material solid or liquid can be measured with an accelerator mass spectrometer there is an important difference between biodegradability and bio-based content a bio plastics such as high-density polyethylene HDPE can be 100% bio-based ie contain 100% renewable carbon yet be non biodegradable these bio plastics such as HDPE nonetheless play an important role in greenhouse gas abatement particularly when they are combusted for energy production the bio-based component of these bio plastics as considered carbon neutral since their origin as from biomass topic anaerobic biodegradability ASTM d 5 5 1 102 and ASTM D 5 5 2 6 the ASTM D 5 5 1 1 12 and ASTM D 5 5 2 6 12 our testing methods that comply with international standards such as the ISO dis 15900 85 for the biodegradability of plastic equals equals see also
