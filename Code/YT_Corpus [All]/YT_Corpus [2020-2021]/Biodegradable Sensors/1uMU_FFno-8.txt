 New AI System Could Smell Meat Freshness Many people have a sharp scent for food, including meat They can easily tell if the meat is still fresh and contains the best level of aroma But a team of scientists led by Nanyang Technological University showed that AI may do it too The system boasts an electronic nose to sniff gases that may present in meat This e-nose has two parts: a barcode and a reader The barcode reacts to the gases while the reader feeds information to the AI, which interprets the colors on the barcode A barcode includes 20 bars that serve as receptors, similar to the receptors in mammals' noses Every barcode is made of natural sugar called chitosan When the sugar is exposed to gases from decaying meat, it changes color that the AI can interpret The combination of color changes describes the mixture of gases and their concentrations In simpler terms, the barcode can show the scent fingerprint of meat One example is the first bar containing a yellow dye It means weakly acidic When exposed to nitrogen-containing compounds from decaying meat, the yellow dye will turn to blue That tells the rising levels of the compounds as the meat decays To train the AI, scientists used more than 4,000 images of the barcodes from six meat packages, each taken at different times They trained the system to detect scent fingerprints in 3,475 barcode images Then, they tested it on the remaining barcode images The performance test showed a 98.5% accuracy across three freshness levels: fresh, less fresh, and spoiled While 100% accuracy for spoiled meats, 96% accuracy for fresh meats, and 90% accuracy for less fresh meats They compared the AI to the Euclidean distance analysis, a measure for the response of sensors, which are barcodes in the e-nose The analysis showed an overall accuracy of 61.7% Chen Xiaodong, the study's co-lead author, said: "Its non-destructive, automated and real-time monitoring capability could also be used to recognise the types of gases that other types of perishable food emit as they become less fresh, providing a broadly applicable new platform for food quality control, which is what we are working towards now" The main purpose of the AI system is to help customers save money when purchasing meat products Customers may consider the AI's assessments when doubting freshness Doing so may reduce the chance of discarding meat products that are still fit for consumption The dyes are non-toxic and biodegradable They published the findings in Advanced Materials
