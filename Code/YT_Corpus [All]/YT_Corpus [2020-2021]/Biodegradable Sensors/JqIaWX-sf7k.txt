 Hey guys just because the weather's bad outside doesn't mean that you need to have that dirty smoker I'm gonna show you how to quickly clean this Traeger pellet grill in under 15 minutes. Hey guys welcome back to the channel, if you're new here my name is Todd and first I'd like to ask you guys if you like what you're seeing please take a minute to smash that subscribe button tap that Bell so you don't miss a thing. So this is the time of year where the weather is pretty bad across the country and with the different things that are going on nowadays you know washing your hands and sanitize and everything you don't want to forget about the most important appliance in your house or your backyard that's your smoker in this case the Traeger LilTex 20 Pro or elite or any number of pellet grills you want to take care of these things so let's say so they take care of you so what I like to use is a nice plastic scraper I don't use metal scrapers on these because I don't want to chip any paint or cause any gouges in there that need to also what I found that works really well if you don't are these wooden little throwaway shims that a lot of people that are in the construction use these are great for getting in some of the corners in here I'll show you in a minute and obviously a clean surface you want to use a nice quality oven cleaner spray down that surface of your grates let them soak a little bit and then use a non abrasive kind of scrubber and a little handle that they come with to help scrape those off don't use any stainless steel any metal or anything like that use something that will wear way before the surface of your grates we're way some of these grates have some kind of coating ceramic or other stuff and you don't want to get any you want to lose any of that coating unless you are spending the money on those trigger throwaway protective aluminum trays get yourself some extra wide aluminum foil and unless you've got a lot of hand cleaner laying around nowadays there's not a lot to be found use some cheap throw latex clothes it'll help you up alright without further ado let's get started alright guys so here we go so it's really not that dirty I actually keep mine fairly clean but what you want to do get yourself some room here and since I'm going to be spraying these down with an oven cleaner but I'm not hosing down or introducing any water moisture while I'm cleaning here I'm going to take these grates out and I'm gonna put them over the top of a bucket or something to actually do the spraying I'm just gonna pull these off set them aside the grass works good ok I'd suggest you guys keep your pets away while you're doing this now this drip pan here the trigger has in these little Texas I like to cover mine with foil again trigger maybe a couple other companies make these little inserts here but you know they cost money most people have foil laying around so that's what I'm using this just lists right on out again on to the grass next thing we got here is this baffle plate now at least get warped a little bit there are some companies that make replacement ones that are pretty heavy-duty steel but you know this is doing its job perfectly fine so I'm not going to need to replace this okay the first thing I'm going to do is take my plastic scraper here and I'm just gonna start scraping down okay okay for areas like this I like to use this wooden scraper that shown earlier just get in there the wood will break before the finish does or any metal surface in here any paint brands like that I just go around get the worst of it over here you can see a lot of grease kicked up there all right and then right here in the grease catch trough here I just get the big chunks knock it down and interestingly enough this is exactly the same size as the square drain tube here so that just goes right on down you can make sure it's unclog and there's no chunks in there you want to make sure that all smokers that your grease train stays nice and open exhaust tube here mine is pretty wide open again I I do some deep cleaning about every six months or so okay guys this took about ten minutes a little bit longer than I thought it would because I always I always end up doing more than I intended to and so that's my fault but but I went ahead and did is I scraped all the sides down and the got the fire-pot really well and I went ahead and I did break out the shot back just to sucked out suck out the fire-pot a little bit you want to be careful of the little igniter that's in there make sure that you wipe that off you know don't spray anything in here just get a nice little cloth or something and kind of wipe it off and one thing I wanted to point out that's really critical is this thermometer here this is really important for the function of your trigger or any pellet grill that relies on an ambient temperature sensor so I went ahead and sprayed some of the cz off on here let it soak then I took the non abrasive you know kind of a sacrificial kind of scrubber and I just lightly kind of went over it wiped it down got a little bit of water and just kind of wiped it down wanna make sure this area is clean of anything that might flare up any hotspots of grease that will get hot and give you a really weird temperature being on your trigger this is often an area that people neglect and then they wonder why their pellet grill isn't working properly so always double-check this including down here and around the bottom of this auger here that's running this is just basically just a shell here there is a way of getting this out but we're not gonna go that deep on this video but when you're scraping around the sides definitely get your shot back under there look for any chunks of grease that might flare up there's been some people that have complained about paint burning away on the outside that's because a chunk of grease gets stuck on the inside here and ignites and it gets super hot and there's not a whole lot of paint that can withstand that so so look for those little chunks pull them off and you should be good to go okay another little spot to keep extra clean is any aftermarket thermometers you have I have this tell true here and you see here it has a similar type of probe here so you want to make sure that's clean as well obviously that's not part of the function of the electronics or anything but I like to clean off too so you might see some loose carbon up here on the door just knock that off it's harmless it's not peeling paint it's just carbons you can just wipe that stuff off it's really it's harmless alright guys like I said I sprayed these down they've been soaking while I was doing the smoke chamber I'm just gonna give another hit and again using this sacrificial scrub brush here little pad I'm just going to knock off the heavy stuff look for any rust kind of like rust so it's looking pretty good you know lock it down a little hose there you go do the other one that's ones been soaking a little bit longer some of you probably think well hey this stuff is part of the seasoning and stuff well yeah if you want your beef tastes like pork and your pork tastes like chicken hey go for it there we go see that you don't want that yeah next thing we want to do the drip tray just pull off that little foil I like to inspect it make sure there's no cracks or anything it's perfectly fine I'll probably knock off some of this thicker grease and you don't need to watch me putting new foil on there but ever you feel like doing it boil that sucker up it's ready to go all right guys here we go so I don't have to do anything to this deflector plate yeah it's a little warped but you know nothing drips on this it's strictly to deflect that heat that's coming right off there you can see how there's a little key way here that goes into these notches so goes right in there you go so the next thing go in here is the drip pan so there's a longer end here that goes into this trough and then the shorter in goes right up here in this little shelf here and it just sits there I kind of like to Center it a little bit just make sure that it's sitting there and I give the foil one last little pet oh yeah that likes to be pet all right okay next thing we got to do is put in the grates okay put the top or bottom grate in first now the top there we go always take care of that thermometer right there it's looking pretty good all right there we go it's ready for the zombie apocalypse thumbs up simple as that folks not too hard it takes 15 minutes a few basic little tools you might have stuff sitting around the house you can use any kind of biodegradable cleaner that you want I recommend doing it on your grass keep it small pets away and clean all that waste up before they come out here otherwise they're gonna eat that stuff and you don't want that in your little critter stomachs so all there's left to do is clean the outside I'm pretty sure you guys know how to do that and I'm not going to bother showing you so folks if you like what you see please smash that subscribe button hit that Bell so you own this thing you see on next cook you
