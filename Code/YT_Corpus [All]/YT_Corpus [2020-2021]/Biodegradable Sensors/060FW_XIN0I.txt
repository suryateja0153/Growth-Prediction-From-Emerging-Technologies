 welcome to today's webinar single stranded dna production for gene therapeutics and vaccines my name is john roberts director in mit corporate relations this is part of the event this part of the event will run for about an hour there will be a members only discussion that will follow through a separate zoom meeting i'll have more to say on that at the end so it's a pleasure to be your host since its founding in 1948 the ilp has been a gateway for industry into the innovation ecosystem that surrounds us here in cambridge massachusetts there are more than 300 registrants for today's event from 17 different countries it's interesting to note that some of the technology that brings this large number of people together in this virtual fashion was developed or began at mit today during this challenging time the iop has developed an extensive webinar series for more information please go to ilp.mit.edu it's time for our first speaker mark bada is professor of biological engineering and an associate member of the broad institute of mit and harvard he will introduce us to his group's work and i really look forward to your presentation mark over to you thank you very much john and uh thanks very much for the opportunity to present here today welcome to everyone we look very forward to sharing some of our work with you today um so i'm a professor in the department of biological engineering and i'm going to be starting off with an overview of work in our group in the area of dna origami and nanotechnology and then flores engelhardt is a postdoc in my group who's going to be spending time talking about a single ceramic dna production for gene therapeutics and also as the substrate that we use to self-assemble dna origami for a variety of applications and therapeutics uh so suffice it to say that there's a pressing need for novel vaccine and gene therapeutic delivery technologies there's over six thousand genetic disorders that have been identified from uh next generation sequencing to date the us alone has suffered from over half a million deaths from cancer in 2019 and as we're all acutely aware of currently in the pandemic from covid19 we've seen approaching a million but well over half a million deaths in the short time that this pandemic has been with us worldwide and then we shouldn't forget that there's been an ongoing pandemic for decades still without any cure or vaccine that's successful from hiv-1 and aids with over 30 million deaths worldwide so in our group uh we're developing novel nanotechnologies that are based on uh nucleic acids to try to address uh the pressing need in these various areas um suffice it to say that there have been a has been a revolution in medicine and it's ongoing and it's transforming our opportunities in therapeutic spaces from genetic disorders to vaccines to cancer that's rooted in several modalities of therapeutics including messenger rnas that have been in the news recently for vaccine applications as well as srnas and crispr and antisense oligos so these are uh new classes of medicines uh that are available to uh address a variety of pressing medical needs uh one challenge for all of these modalities is in the targeted delivery in vivo for patients and in our group we are exploring how to use structured and programmed nucleic acids shown here to try to help solve this problem so we produce virus-like particles out of either messenger rna that you're seeing here in red that's folded into a discrete particle shape it's folded using synthetic oligos that then offer us the capability to target this messenger rna to cell subtypes and organs as well as facilitate targeted or programmed translation in cells alternatively the messenger rna can be put inside of a dna nanoparticle shown here and similarly one can encapsulate crispr ribonuclear protein complex together with guide rna with or without srnas and with or without an hdr template for gene editing applications and finally we uh in vaccine applications are presenting uh either peptides or or protein antigens for immune cell stimulation so these are particles that are vlps virus-like particles on the 10 to 100 nanometer scale they're relatively inexpensive to manufacture compared to viral vectors and some biologics they facilitate active targeting through the display of small molecules or sugars or peptides or ligands or aptomers and also facilitate immune cell stimulation they offer targeted uh and triggered cargo release in specific cell types of interests uh and they're also biodegradable because they're made from from nucleic acids so we're all here today in the webinar online um and we are all acutely aware of the current pandemic that's really scouring the the earth and i don't need to remind anyone of the severe need for both vaccines but also therapeutics that are of course being developed and in the vaccine space alone there's over 160 vaccines that are in development for sars cove2 the virus that causes covid19 the disease that are at a variety of different stages uh from pre-clinical out to to phase three and even approval in one case for limited use in the military um and so one one can ask well why do we need more vaccines or another vaccine and i think the the answer to that or one answer to that is the the fact that there are so many vaccines and development speaks to the fact that we are uncertain at this present time which vaccine will be successful uh if any and for how long and and what the degree of efficacy and safety will be of course a number have already passed the safety bar um including some in our own neighborhood here in kendall square but there's still plenty of efficacy uh to be demonstrated in the months and years ahead um so aside from source cove two we should also be reminded that we've struggled for decades to develop a successful hiv vaccine hiv was identified all the way back in 1984 as the cause of aids and after a large-scale vaccine trial um that began in 1998 uh there were prominent failures in in 2004 um and it was only recently in 2010 a decade ago when antibodies brco1 and vrco2 vr co2 that are neutralizing antibodies that were developed in patients living with the disease that were identified as targets for therapeutics and also for vaccine development uh of course in the case of cyrus cove ii this has moved much much faster since we already have uh very soon after the pandemic set on uh identified those neutralizing antibodies and targets both for antibody therapeutics as well as for four vaccines thanks in large part also to the large amount of funding and work that had been done on coronaviruses prior to the onset of this current uh pandemic so there are four classes of vaccines at a high level that i just wanted to briefly review and set the stage for the approach that we're developing um there's genetic vaccines that are dna or rna-based vaccines um companies like curvac and moderna and translate bio are producing messenger rnas that are vaccines that then produce antigens of interest for sars cof2 the spike protein or the receptor binding domain that facilitates entry into airway cells during infection um and uh also inovio who's on the west coast and producing dna best base vaccine that has a similar goal of producing the antigenic protein of interest or subset of anagenic proteins of interest to stimulate immunity and humoral response another class is viral vector vaccines uh so specifically adenovirus that's a variant of the common cold vaccine that has a very highly efficient transduction mechanism to also deliver and express the engineering protein of interest and then in the latter two cases uh whole attenuated virus vaccines which are weakened or inactivated versions of the virus there's one such in development in in china an inactivated version of sars code 2 and then protein subunit vaccines that consist of anagenic protein assembled into a particulate form in many cases or conjugated with other polysaccharides depending on the application and so if we look at the fda approved and licensed vaccines that are out in the clinic they largely consist of these two technologies or approaches that have also been in development considerably longer for a whole host of different infectious diseases and the two that are bolded on the left are virus-like particles that are self-assembled from angiogenic protein into a repetitive array of antigen on on a virus like particle surface for hepatitis b and hpv that are clinically approved and these are the classes that are uh dna-based vaccines that we're making where we use scaffolded dna origami to make virus like particles that display antigens fall into these classes this uh class of or these two classes of successful vaccines uh are in part uh efficacious because as a nanoparticulate form they traffic to secondary lymph organs lymph nodes robustly and are stable for long periods of time they also are presented by dendritic cells in an intact form with a repetitive array of antigens that are presented to b cells where bcr the b cell receptor then recognizes the antigen and is crosslinked and it's the repetitive array and multiple or multi-valence display of those antigens that's very important for triggering b cells in that first recognition and selection process from a naive b cell pool which then allows the b cell to go on and process the antigen and elicit t cell help through mhc2 to enter germinal centers where the b cells undergo a process of somatic mutation and basically antibody maturation and refinements uh so they're repeatedly mutating their antibodies and then if the mutations are successful in the sense that they increase the affinity for the virus-like particle or antigen presented by follicular dendritic cells here then they can proceed uh and if not then they undergo apoptosis and the goal of this is to produce of course then long-lived plasma cells that may migrate to bone marrow to produce high levels of antibody for [Music] for long periods of time reaching decades in some cases or and also to produce memory b cells then that can rapidly be activated in response to to reinfection and so this important sort of repetitive array of antigen presentation has been facilitated in some synthetic vaccine cases where one can reconstitute protein-based particles from ferritin uh this is from gary naval who was formerly at the nih vaccine institute where he in his lab uh self-assembled uh hemagglutinin [Music] protein antigen from h1n1 into a self-assembled nanoparticle that consists of 24 copies of this protein antigen uh by simply expressing it in a in a genetic fusion with with ferritin that then self-assembles and presents this antigen as you can see in a in a sort of 20 nanometer or so size uh protein particle that's that's synthetic uh david baker and neil king at the university of washington have taken this type of strategy and extended it significantly um through molecular engineering to produce many different variants of protein self-assembled particles with ability of changing the size and copy number of these protein-based particles but still have limitations in the total copy number of antigens that they can present the spacing between uh those antigens that may be important for b cell recognition and triggering as well as a number of different types of antigens that one might want to present they also have potential challenges in generating neutralizing antibodies that may limit the ability to boost uh the vaccine in multiple rounds and in some cases the glycosylation that can be very important for some pathogens like hiv may be non-native if not produced in the native mammalian cells of interest so in our lab uh we've been developing virus-like particles made from dna origami the idea here is to take a long single strand of dna what we call a scaffold that flores we'll be talking more about that can be on the order of 1kb up to 10 kb and fold it into a virus-like shape shown here with a set of synthetic oligos and uh those synthetic oligos hybridized through an annealing that then produces this this target shape and uh this is showing sort of an icosahedron then where we design these sequences using software that our lab has developed and then fold these through a pcr annealing reaction and because the synthetic oligos are present we can either using click chemistry or simple hybridization attach antigens as well as therapeutic nucleic acids to any site within this particle with very high yield and as flores we'll be talking about in the next part of the talk we can produce the single stranded dna scaffold with a custom sequence that can be either used for gene therapeutic applications or to modulate the cpg content for example within these dna nanoparticles to control their immunogenicity through tlr9 as well as sea gas signaling pathways in cells and these are produced in in fermenters that are fully scalable these particles are produced at very high yields exceeding 95 or so just looking at an atomic force microscopy image of the individual particles shown here um and this is evident as well in high resolution cryo-electron microscopy that we can reconstruct from these particles where we can see the individual dna duplexes running through the edges of of the particle so turning to an application to hiv vaccines we worked with daryl ervin's lab and william chief at the scripps research institutes daryl irvine is in biological engineering and hhmi at mit um and focused on a clinical vaccine construct that is called the engineered outer domain of a germline targeting immunogen that bill sheepslab had designed um that self-assembles into a virus-like particle based on an e coli protein that's expressed with 60 copies of that protein and you can see the particles around 20 nanometers in size this construct has no control over the copy number of the antigen or the spacing between the antigens um but it has been shown in vivo also to be able to robustly target and trigger germline cells to produce intermediate antibodies that are in the lineage of the rc01 class antibodies of interest that are therapeutically relevant for an hiv vaccine in our work we were interested in using the versatility and power of dna nanotechnology to ask questions about what the design principles are for molecular vaccines where we can control the copy number and spacing and geometry in which these antigens are presented to b cells to try to elucidate what the general rules are for optimal triggering of b cells and vaccine design and we also are able to change the antigen out from different affinity versions of our variants of the eod from bill sheep's lab as well as look at some peptides from from daryl ervin's lab and this work is published so i'll just kind of go through it quickly to give you some of the highlights uh this was published uh just a few months ago in nature nanotechnology um so what you're looking at here is an in vitro cell line that's a ramos uh sort of a blank b cell reporter line that expresses igm that's specific to the vrco1 class antibody of interest and and targeted by this eod gt8 antigen courtesy of daniel lingwood who's at the reagan institute at mit um and you're looking at a vertical axis calcium signaling that tells you the degree of of b cell activation over time as you add the antigen or molecular vaccine construct and what you see is uh the baseline is yeah casahedron with zero or one copy of the antigen that does not activate b cells and then the positive control is the system or protein nanoparticle that's a clinical construct that's in red and the first interesting result that we found from this study was that we could activate b cells uh to a similar level as that positive control with only five or ten copies of antigen and that's shown here also on the right with a bar graph that looks at the total degree of activation where you see a monotonic increase in activation as you increase the copy number of antigens that was a surprising result to begin with so we looked at that a little more carefully and and looked at a very simple dimeric construct where dna origami allows you to put two antigens in a fixed spacing uh and increase that from seven to fourteen to twenty one and thirty in nanometers and again we saw this monotonic increase which when in contrast to the classical sort of belief or notion that you should just put antigens as closely as possible to trigger b cells and get the highest level of activation so this study shows that in fact uh allowing more space between antigens is is actually preferable we also saw a plateau in activation beyond sort of 30 nanometers that requires a bit more data to look into and understand the mechanism of this finding of monotonic increase also held true for a pentameric display of anagen using the icosahedron that i showed previously in addition to the dimeric presentation and then we also wanted to ask the question does it matter whether the antigens are presented on a rigid fixed spacing or whether they're presented for example using a polymer like peg or a single strand of dna where the spacing between those antigens can fluctuate or change and the answer is yes the signaling was significantly abrogated when the antigens were not presented on this fixed rigid scaffold and so this is an interesting observation because we can see that some of the successful vaccines for virus-like particles and inactivated particles they have that fixed uh multi-valence um display of antigen uh that's not present when you only have a monomeric engine for example um and uh some viruses like hiv also have a lipid membrane and variable copy number and spacings of antigens that do not present uh that rigid fixed array like some other viruses and so i think that that observation is also interesting in light of the biology and structure of hiv we also tested this uh finally in um a three-dimensional construct looking at uh liposomal formulations from daryl urban's lab so in this case we took an origami and presented peptides of different affinities p5 and p31 and compared that to a liposomal formulation or a lipid nanoparticle that had a similar density of antigen but what you can see in the bottom left and also just is discussed in more detail in the paper that when presented by the rigid origami uh the triggering inactivation was significantly higher at short times compared to the liposomal formulation in gray and this again can be hypothesized to be due to the fact that the liposomal formulation does not uh present the antigen at a fixed spacing but but they're free to diffuse and move around much like in a polymer and so they don't activate the b cells as as robustly um we present some imaging as well to just uh corroborate the signaling that we we see um from the fluorescence imaging from the calcium reporter so looking at it for example in a casahedron with 30 copies of antigen um you can see punctate uh binding to the b cell surface in red together with actin uh in in blue which is a cortical uh protein that that self-assembles and facilitates clustering and and internalization of of virus-like particles and you can look also we looked downstream at signaling kinases sick and limb that are involved in bcr activation and b cell activation and see a similar degree of activation um with uh an icosahedron 30 murder compared to the positive control um so with that i'll i'll be ending and turning it over to flores i just wanted to add that we are also active now on source code 2 um and testing the uh both of these constructs in vivo extensively which i don't have results to share on today here with you in the limited time we have um but uh the platform technology of dna nanotechnology offers the ability to quickly swap out or easily swap out the antigen so in this case from aaron schmitt's lab at the raygun and hms who's been working in the coronavirus field for some time he was able to conjugate or modify i should say the receptor binding domain protein from the spike protein of sars cof2 in just a couple weeks and we then were able to conjugate that new protein to our nanoparticles in several weeks for preclinical evaluation that's ongoing um and so this is a demonstration of how you can then swap out the antigen relatively quickly and you can also look at effects of different sizes of the particle and copy numbers and also spacings for example trimerization of the antigen which is all really facilitated by dna nanotechnology and the versatility and rapidity through which one can modify these these uh features in a facile manner so that i'll thank uh everyone in the group who did the hard work and my excellent and wonderful collaborators uh dr zirvin schmidt and lingwood um and uh hand it over to flores for uh her portion of the presentation great so i guess i'll ask one question before we move on what is the in vivo stability of your virus-like particles yeah it's a great question that comes up a lot so uh as alluded to in the question um because our nanoparticles are made from dna with their antigen conjugated unmodified dna is subject to degradation by the dnase one in particular um on relatively rapid time scales um so uh they're they can be stable in in serum in vitro for anywhere from an hour to several hours if they're unmodified so we modify them in various published approaches varying from percolation to adding minor groove binders that stabilize the particles um and those then facilitate in vivo stability up to 24 hours so there are more tricks in the toolbox obviously great so we'll bring you back um as part of the the q a it's it's time to move on to flores as part of the talk
