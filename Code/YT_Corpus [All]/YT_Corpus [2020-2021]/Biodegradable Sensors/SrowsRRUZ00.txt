 Implantable Sensor Could Safely Biodegrade and Monitor Bodily Functions Current devices used outside the body to track gas levels are bulky and may not be as accurate as an implantable device Since implantable devices need to be removed, that could mean another operation for the individual Fortunately, a team of international researchers designed a highly sensitive and flexible gas sensor that monitors forms of nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide gas in the body Published in “NPG Asia Materials,” the sensor is manufactured from materials that are all biodegradable in water or in bodily fluids without compromising functionality The sensor’s conductors are made from magnesium For the functional materials, the team used silicon, which is highly sensitive to nitric oxide All the materials the researchers used can be safely absorbed by the body The design allows the materials to dissolve at a slow enough pace to enable the sensors to function during a patient’s recovery period The team tested the sensor in humid conditions and aqueous (eykweyus) solutions to demonstrate how it could stably perform in the harsh conditions of the body They also created computer simulations from ICDS Roar supercomputer’s computational resources The computer simulations can calculate minute changes caused by slight changes of shape or deformations of the material For Huanyu “Larry” Cheng, a Dorothy Quiggle Career Development Professor in the Penn State Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics, silicon is unique as it is the building block for modern electronics It is also considered by individuals as “super-stable,” said Cheng, who is also an affiliate of the Institute for Computational and Data Sciences Silicon is also biodegradable and depending on the environment, it can dissolve slowly at approximately one to two nanometers a day Further, it might be more advantageous to monitor the gas levels from the heart surface or the internal organs Cheng added that a patient no longer needs the device if they fully recover from surgery, making biodegradable devices practical Monitoring gases in the body is important considering that they are the hallmark of health Nitric oxide, for instance, relaxes the blood vessels to improve blood flow Additionally, exposure to nitrogen dioxide from the environment is associated with the progression of health complications like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease According to the researchers, future work could focus on designing integrated systems that track other bodily functions for healthy aging and other disease applications
