 welcome this morning to uh the fall honors symposium this is a most unusual semester and as i don't need to explain to any of you i want to but i do want to express my thanks to everyone before we go further if you can go to the next slide we'd like to start with the land acknowledgement we recognize that berkeley sits on the territory of huichin the ancestral and unseeded land of the choceno olone the successors of the historic and sovereign verona band of alameda county this land was and continues to be of great importance to the illinois people we recognize that every member of the berkeley community has and continues to benefit from the use and occupation of this land and that it includes its use for research and student learning um so again so that's a pleasure to do and and also a pleasure as some of you know that we are really expanding our in the college our role in native american studies on the campus with hires of new faculty and this has been really exciting but that's a side that's another story i'm just here to welcome the students who are presenting and other attendees who've come to listen thank you i want to really acknowledge especially for all the students and all of their advisors the extra effort that it took to do research under these circumstances and i'm thrilled to just see it continue it's amazing how well people have been able to adapt i know it hasn't been easy and um curious to see the combination of the work that was that was done remotely um you know anything that can be remote should be remote and a lot of a lot of work has continued uh and then also you know i know people have been in the lab and in the greenhouses and some of that has continued that's been more difficult so thank you all for for persevering under these circumstances and then a huge shout out and thanks to sophia and anna for continuing to keep the honors program running strong and i will turn it over to them so thanks so much thank you david and welcome everybody welcome to the presenters welcome to the faculty that joined us to support you guys you are really the best that we have in our college the undergrads that took the extra step and developed an independent research project we are so proud of you and i hope you can send this video if they're not live to your family so that they can see how cool and exciting your research is i want to give you some background and also give you the logistics of what's happening um the research uh that you will present stands on the shoulders of a big giant professor tasya melis devised the honors program in our college he started thinking about it in one year it took a while to go through the berkeley campus and then it was formally instituted in 1995. the first student was a single presenter there was one honor student in that year and that first spring was the first symposium but look this is the first student in 1996 and then you see spring spring spring and then eventually in 2005 students as you guys are creative why should you always have the last semester be the spring so sometimes students start in the spring and finish in the fall fall symposium that's you guys and the fall symposium starts coming up and this year you are this orange bar here last spring we have one presenter here from last spring thank god she was still around but a lot of them did not get to present it was the highest group of honor students it was in spring 2020 and we were so sad as i'm sure they were and also so impressed that they just regardless of that huge disruption in lab access they were able to not only finish their project but have very exciting results and if you go to our website you can see the projects that they had they're all listed for all semesters and you have certain samples of these projects and the benefits for you is you will get honors in your major at graduation in cnr the best presenter today will be awarded an additional honor the melis medal and you have writing rights that you are honors students in cnr and today it is my honor to present the cohort of students and if you wonder what number you are the first presenter today is 770th um remind me who that is elizabeth elizabeth you're 70 770. young ling you're going to be 777. if seven is a number you don't like we can switch you around because you have a lot of sevens um so this is you elizabeth's going to kick us off then lauren then katrina then chris then sonnet then ariana then jerry and then finally youngling i think and anna and i thank all these amazing mentors and advisors from tons of departments it can show you the breadth of our college we have social scientists and we have the hard lab scientists and as dean accurately said i am so impressed that despite the disruption all these especially hard science projects were developed to completion again congratulations to all of you and before i give it to elizabeth i'm going to turn it over to anna to formally thank her for everything she does for you guys and she fights for you she emails me about exceptions that you need because our main goal is not to grant you exceptions we want to be we're going to give you an exception our main goal is that you can continue research it's about you so anna i give you the floor to have the opportunity to say a couple of words to this amazing group yeah thank you sophia and then and we welcome all of you here today we're excited to see all of your research and we're we're looking forward to the first presenter coming up in a few minutes but thank you for letting me work with all of you and for submitting this and thank you for all the time that you've put into this we know this has been a big commitment over the last couple of semesters without further ado elizabeth you have the floor great thank you so much let me just share my you have the screen so i will give you a warning when you are uh five minutes to go probably i'll put it in the chat let's see if you see it five minutes do you see it well if you see a chat it's probably means five minutes if you're not paying attention to anything i say i'll unmute and say you're about to explode all right i've got my timer going so i'll be all set and if you can all stick around that would be great but if you cannot for some reason let me just do something before elizabeth starts let me just put it in gallery view and put you all here um why don't i have everybody so i only have okay just going to take an official photo of us for the records i was trying one two three four five six why did i lose people okay i'll just do this one now all right one two three and then i'll photoshop you you missed you missed you get it from the recording too but let's go ahead with you elizabeth yeah yeah yeah you missed me going around and taking photos of you guys so i apologize uh okay so my project was all about the hormonal regulation of petal senescence in ipam and purpuria which is also known as morning glory and also i'm in the plant in microbial biology department and my major is genetics and plant biology and just a huge shout out before i begin to my mentors which were alan sims and no whiteman from ib and ben blackman from pmb so so to kind of introduce what i was studying within morning glory flowers um petal senescence is something that happens in in most flowers and it's actually just the essentially like closure of the petals and also wilting that you see with most flowers and what's interesting in in april may preparia is that this happens the flowers open and then completely close all within one day um so why is why is potential associations really important and we can see that really pollinators are impacted by pedal senescence because turgid petals that are completely open attract pollinators and senescing petals that are closing the flower do not attract pollinators as shown in the figure on the right and so if you align if the plant is able to align petal senescence with pollination this can promote outcrossing which would be a pollination between different flowers rather than sulfine which would be the flower pollinating itself so ethylene is really what i was interested in studying in this process because i had a hypothesis that ethylene would control petal senescence and be able to impact the alignment of petals in essence with pollination in the morning glory flowers so looking at the more molecular side of this the enzyme acs which is acc synthase becomes a really important player and that's because acs is the rate limiting enzyme in the ethylene biosynthesis pathway and also it's a very unstable enzyme and this is important because that means if you see the presence of acs it's very likely that ethylene is being produced at that time and previous studies have found that acs is present in the stigma and style of the flower which are reproductive organs so it therefore it seems that the regulation of acs has something to do with pollination since you see acs appear in the exact organs that are involved in pollination within hypomia purpuria what's also important to know about ethylene is that it's a gas and interestingly enough as shown in the figure on the left we can see that although acs and ethylene the acs enzyme is present in the sigma and style in the center of the flower the actual receptors of ethylene are in the petals and so this kind of shows us that although ethylene is being produced within the sigmund style in the center of the flower that the ethylene is traveling through the air in its gaseous form to receptors that are actually on the petals so that could be then a way that ethylene is coordinating pollination with petal senescence because of this gaseous dispersal to the petals so on the right this is a little bit more of a zoomed in view of what's actually happening when ethylene binds to those receptors and there's there's the receptor keeps responses constitutively off in the absence of ethylene but once ethylene binds um the receptors are able to trickle trigger us a stigma cascade that can activate the responses to ethylene that could include um in in my experiment the focus pedal senescence so it's also important to know that ethylene sensitivity is observed over a lot of flowers that are closely related to hypermaia including pellegronium porturim which is carnations sorry dianthus caropholis which is carnations in the orchid ac family in petunia across the solanaceae family and also within ipo mayo which was my study system so in order to actually test my hypothesis and and really learn about pedal senescence and iphone propria i really had to grow those plants and do some experiments so i first started out by germinating the seeds um in the lab and then i would transfer them to the greenhouses down at the oxford tract and grow up a lot of morning glory plants so that i could get a lot of flowers to do some experiments with so my actual experiments it were the main experiment would be these box assays where i created boxes out of clear plastic which would be airtight and have the capability to hold two flowers so the idea would be to emasculate both flowers the day before the experiment before the flowers opened so that they could not self-pollinate and then put two flowers with different treatments in each box so the first treatment would be two emasculated flowers that could not self at all and we're not treated with any pollen and then and the second treatment would be having one flower that is emasculated and untreated and then one flower that i've hand pollinated um the the day that i put them in the box and then the second or the third treatment is ha to have two flowers in the box that both have been pollinated artificially once they've been put in the box by myself so this um then once we put the flowers into the box the ideas have time lapse cameras above the box to cl to measure how quickly the flowers are closing so the the speed of petal senescence is then is measured by the time lapse camera because i'm measuring the time that it takes for flowers to close um and this is kind of a sample of of the the video that would result so the time i would measure goes all the way from the most open point of the flower all the way to right about now when the flower is completely closed and you can no longer see the stigma in style so that would be the time increment that i'm measuring and the idea is is that if you have a pollinated flower in with a non-pollinated flower that you'll see an increase and or a decrease in the time that it takes for the flower to close or an increase in speed of flower closure because ethylene is being produced whereas in unpollinated flowers ethylene isn't being produced and so the flowers take longer to close so these were results so i'm one of the students from the spring and so my research was unfortunately cut somewhat short so i have hypothesized results due to the closures of the greenhouses um so and uh these so these figures were generated with hypothetical data based on my hypotheses and using an anova analysis so i hypothesized that pollinated flowers would release a gaseous compound theoretically ethylene that would stimulate petal senescence and speed up flower closure so i expected to observe a gradient over the three treatments that i had in the box assays in which the treatment with two unpollinated flowers that were just emasculated so they couldn't self-pollinate would take the longest time to close and then you see a gradient of increasing speed of closure all the way down to the two pollinated flowers closing the fastest because both flowers would be producing ethylene and therefore they would there would be a higher concentration of ethylene to trigger those receptors in the petals and cause the flowers to close a lot faster then if i if the results showed did not show this gradient and showed similar flower closure times across all three treatments as seen in the figure on the right then that would nullify my hypothesis and essentially say that there was not a gaseous compound that would that was affecting the petal senescence times so to kind of conclude from that um if if the figure on the left kind of shows the results that would confirm my hypothesis so if these were the results that i had gotten from my experiments then it would it would give me the information that there is a gaseous compound that is affecting petals and essence however that that experiment alone would not tell me whether that compound was ethylene or not so as a follow-up experiment kind of future direction for the project if getting this confirming result from the box assays i'd like to do gas chromatography experiments in order to determine if the gas being produced is indeed ethylene and these are kind of experiments that yes since the last spring we were kind of shut down i'm hoping to proceed with this spring since the plants grow best in the spring so i couldn't do it this fall and hoping to get some interesting results then when i can perform these experiments so that's my presentation and if anyone has any questions please let me know yeah we have time for one or two questions so please feel free to either send them in the chat or speak round now yeah we also have the q a so you can put them in the q a or you can put them in the chat if there's any questions out there also if any of the other presenters have any questions for elizabeth you're welcome to speak up too i have a question and a suggestion um you should try to team up with an undergrad in a lab or if imagine worst case scenario you're not able to do it in the spring i think you should still try to see if you can test it when eventually the greenhouses above open up and then test and hypothesize whether what you were your data graphs will actually be the the outcome yeah yeah i'm definitely hoping to be able to do them um soon so we'll see hopefully the spring is a little bit a little campus is a little bit more open so what are your plans for next steps after graduation um so i'm i'm kind of i'm applying to a graduate program to do a master's and then um also applying to jobs so just kind of seeing what opportunities arise but overall i'm pretty interested in going into industry rather than academia so um very interested in in sustainable agriculture and kind of the applications of plant science well done and i think your advisor is here so think ben oh dennis what dennis i don't remember if he's here or not no yeah all right so to keep us on time say again congratulations elizabeth and um we give you and it is my honor to give you honors uh in uh cnr for uh about your bachelor's degree and all the best wishes and we turn now to um laura let's see our next student will be lauren lauren you have the floor okay hi i'm lauren um and this is i'm going to present about the identification of amino acid transporters sensing protein availability and hunger neurons and i'd like to thank my faculty research mentor dr liu and the members of the blue lab and my faculty sponsor dr olsen for supporting me throughout this project so first i'd like to start about talking about hunger and how hunger is regulated so sensing nutrient availability generates nutrient-specific hunger that is required to maintain homeostasis within organisms so neurons regulating hunger specifically dopaminergic neurons regulate feeding behaviors so we seek to understand the components of this mechanism and specifically looking at how amino acid transporters can act as nutrient sensors and regulate and alter feeding behaviors and metabolism so ultimately how does this apply to human health and the goal is understanding the mechanisms that regulate feeding behaviors will provide greater insights into mechanisms that could be implicated in diseases such as obesity especially since obesity and the comorbidities associated with it pose a serious burden on human health so in order to study this the drosophila model was utilized so specific amino acid transporters the genes encoding those were knocked down and feeding assays were performed and so during those feeding assays flies were allowed to feed for two hours and they had the option of eating either sucrose or yeast and ultimately we were looking at seeing do does their feeding preferences and behaviors change from their normal feeding behaviors if this gene encoding a specific amino acid transporter is knocked down so now i'll get into the results of that genetic screen and the feeding assay so there's a lot of data here but this is more to show the the spread of the data so this is from a knockdown of amino acid transporters in all neurons and this was achieved using the nsyb gal4 driver and this is in only female so in general females tend to consume more protein and that's indicated by values closer to positive one on these graphs so a vast majority of the female flies um tended to consume protein but values closer to negative one showed a sucrose preference which was different than their normal feeding preferences and so using this quantified data in addition to looking at visual observations so the food that they consumed was dyed red for yeast so to see protein and then blue for sucrose to see sugar preference actually looking at the visual data as long as as well as this quantified data allowed us to determine there are 13 genes that could be potential candidates from this data with the female flies and so this knockdown also was done in the mail flies and generally male flies um have a sucrose preference and that is indicated by most of the flies having feeding preferences closer to this negative one value that we determined um and so generally male flies they tend to consume less food than female flies and so drawing conclusions from the male flies there's just not as many uh potential candidates so only one gene was determined to be a potential candidate from the male flies just because they do consume less food than the female flies and so after these screens were done uh the genes were knocked down in a specific subset of neurons and so this was achieved using the c2 gal4 driver and this driver it knocked down the gene and specific neurons including the dopaminergic neurons which are a hunger neuron so this is again the female flies and so generally female flies show a protein preference most of the values are close to positive one but the ones that do have a sucrose preference we looked at as potential candidate genes and about 18 genes were determined based on this data as well as visual observations and so knocking down this gene uh genes in a specific subset of neurons was also done for male flies and in general male flies have a sucrose preference uh but some do have a protein preference and those ones were looked at and considered as potential candidates and so one gene was determined to be a potential candidate from this screen and so after the lab closed one part of the project was looking at all of these genes that we determined as potential candidates and finding human orthologs for those genes so then i'll get into talking about that so after looking through all the candidate genes i narrowed them down to five very strong candidate genes which are listed here in this table and then i also have the human orthologs that were identified listed here so looking through all of the human orthologs i was trying to see which ones occurred most frequently throughout all the potential candidate genes and so the families of human orthodox that were the most frequently identified were the slc-6 slc-7 slc-25 and slc 36 families and so we'll talk a little bit more about these four most commonly identified uh families of human orthologs so the slc6 so i'll start with soc stands for solute carrier transporters so slc-6 includes four subgroups of transporters inhibitory neurotransmitters monoamines and two groups of amino acid transporters slc7 includes uh two types of amino acid transporters that sense and transport amino acids and both slc6 and slc7 families share a similar structural feature which is this loot t fold so that indicates that there are similar regulatory mechanisms that occur within both of these families of transporters and then another family of soc transporters that was frequently identified was the soc 25 family of transporters and so these are mitochondrial carriers the transport amino acids across the inner membrane of the mitochondria and so the genes identified in the study uh there were two orthologs that were identified that corresponded with them soc25a15 and soc 25a22 and they transport ornithine and glutamate respectively so ornithine and glutamate are both components of the urea cycle so mutations in these two genes identified could potentially cause dysfunction in the urea cycle and then the last family of that i identified was the soc36 family and within this family there are four genes that function as amino acid transporters and so on another study slc 36 was also associated with regulation of neuron growth and this is also in a drosophila model and so ultimately these strong candidate genes that were identified should be tested further to by running additional behavior assays and feeding assays like the ones that were performed in this project also testing different rnai lines for each of these genes and directly observing the neuronal activities and potentially identifying the specific amino acids that are sensed and transported by these genes so ultimately molecular networks that dry feeding behavior metabolism are evolutionarily conserved so hopefully this will provide a foundation for translational research in other organisms like mammals and hopefully humans so understanding these molecular mechanisms may help us have a better understanding of disease pathologies and provide a basis for future drug targets and understand diseases such as obesity to a greater extent and that's the end of my presentation that's spectacular lauren i have a very quick question that i put in the chat and you kind of brought it up a little bit in the end um first why flies and are the insights you found in flies applicable to other organisms insects mammals completely different from flies uh thank you right so flies are a really good model organism and because of conserved genetics hopefully we can apply it so that was the component of the study where i was looking at these slc transporters those are the human orthologs so hopefully looking at these genes and identifying them and how they factor into these feeding regulatory mechanisms can eventually apply to other organisms so um drosophila is a very a good model organism to start with and then moving to like mice and many trials in the future any other questions if you're a new attendee also audience members you can put your questions in the chat or q a if you have them as well is there previous research on these gender differences because that that has huge implications for you know behavioral and obesity relationships yes those are uh generally observed trends and just dystopia in general we have a very quiet audience um any any other questions from uh i know lauren you're on your way to medical school and any any interested in in continuing on nutrition and obesity you haven't decided yet right i haven't decided but i really do like nutritional sciences and learning about how it impacts human health so continuing some form of research in that field would be really interesting for me you mentioned environmental factors so one thing i know it's kind of hard to do in the lab but if you induce certain stress or temperature or because i i know in the social sciences there has been some research on the effect of temperature on how you eat how you behave and make decisions that are not the best decisions so it was something to consider expanding this work because you have kind of a lab setting i i know you should be not be manipulating flies but to the extent that you not completely annoy them just a thought to have additional treatments all right we can continue on with our next presenter then who would be katrina hi everyone um i'm katrina and i did my honors thesis on volatile organic compound emissions or vocs from agricultural burning and i was mostly looking into how they vary um with crop type as a function of modified combustion efficiency and i promise i'll explain all that jargon um soon enough um my research project was part of an internship i did with nasa over the summer and before i start i'd like to thank my faculty advisor dennis baldacci who's here as well as my nasa advisor glenn wolfe i'd also like to thank dean ackerly for the land acknowledgement in the beginning because i think one of the most important things i've learned at cal besides the formal academic stuff is acknowledging how we benefit from stolen land specifically here alone land so um to get started um for some reason okay there we go so the goal of this study was to look into what the drivers of variability are in emissions of volatile organic compounds um and i hypothesized that would mainly be crop type so what is actually burning as a function of modified combustion efficiency which i promise i'll go into more detail about soon enough so this is important because agricultural burning is understudied compared to wildfire burning and also most models that simulate emissions from fires don't take into account variability within the category of agricultural burning so most models only have one broad classification for crop burning but don't take into account any differences between different crop types that might be burning so um besides the fact that agricultural burning is understudied the burning of crop residues contributes significant trace gas and aerosol to the atmosphere and by furthering our understanding of variability within the category of agricultural missions hopefully we can build better models to simulate emissions and impact on air quality and climate in the future so um to go and see some details about sampling samples were undertaken during a campaign by firex aq which is a joint mission between nasa and noaa to study north american fires and the aircraft that they use is called the nasa dc8 which measures a variety of gas species and these samples were collected in institute in the southeastern u.s so you can see on this map here the paths in white are the flight tracks and each of these points is the location of the fires that were sampled and they're colored by crop type and we sampled a total of 56 agricultural fires and again the variety of crop data that we have is significant because most other studies on agricultural burning um haven't had available crop data to look into variability within the classification of crop residue burning so as promised this is modified combustion efficiency a metric that's really important to understand for um this study that i focused on so basically modified combustion efficiency or abbreviated as mce as a metric that is used to indicate to what extent a fire is flaming versus smoldering so i have this image here so flaming just picture like your typical fire that's full of flames when a fire is flaming temperatures are a lot higher and that means that combustion is complete and so we would expect more carbon dioxide to be emitted whereas when a fire is smoldering and you can picture some glowing like embers it's not fully flaming um temperatures are lower and combustion is incomplete so we would expect different emissions from a fire that's flaming versus smoldering so an mcv value mce excuse me value closer to one indicates that a fire is more flaming whereas lower values indicate smoldering so in comparison comparing mce amongst our different crop types we found that corn tends to mostly be flaming most likely because it's dryer when burned whereas grass tended to mostly be smoldering so another important metric to understand is emissions ratios and emission factors so the emission ratio is um basically a way to measure the concentration of a certain species in the plume in this example that i have here it's formaldehyde um and we quantify that by looking at the concentration of a species x again in this case formaldehyde relative to the concentration of carbon monoxide and so in this example that i have in this plot the emission ratio is the slope of this fit we use the emission ratio to calculate the emission factor which is another way to quantify the amount of a gas species in a plume um and it's defined as grams of a gas species x per gram kilogram of biomass burned and as you can see in this equation here emission factors are a function of modified combustion efficiency so when we looked at emission ratios for all of the vocs that we measured we looked at 35 voc species total and we found the highest emission factors for acetaldehyde acrolein glycoaldehyde formaldehyde and a few other species so that means that these are the dominant species in the plume this is what is mostly being emitted from these agricultural fires whereas the lowest emission factors were for c9 aromatics so um to look into the drivers of variability in these emissions so we wanted to know why um certain species were emitted more than others and differences in the fires that we measured so we plotted emission factors for each of the vocs that we looked at as a function of modified combustion efficiency so you can see mce here on the x-axis emission factors for in this example we have methanol um which is one of the dominant species in the smoke plumes that we measured on the y-axis and we have the points here colored by the crop types um i mainly focused on corn and grass because that's what we had the most available data for um and so of the 35 species that we measured 21 had strong negative slopes which indicates that the emissions of these vocs that had strong negative relationships with mce really depend on smoldering for high emissions so for example with methanol here we would expect higher emissions when the fuel is smoldering than when it's flaming and you can see here in this plot that the um patterns for corn emissions here in yellow are a little bit different from that of grass emissions so i'll show you another example with formaldehyde and in this plot you can see that grass you can see the distinct modified combustion efficiency distributions between corn and grass you can see most of the data points for corn are here closer to the flaming range whereas grass is mostly in the smoldering range and you can see for most of the data points that we have we saw higher emissions for grass than corn and we saw similar patterns with a lot of other species especially ones that had really strong negative relationships with modified combustion um so i did some comparisons to literature as well notably two papers um akagi 2011 and andre 2019 um and what we found so first of all these two papers are syntheses of multiple other studies um on agricultural burning and some of well most of these studies actually didn't have available data on crop type or modified combustion efficiency um and so when comparing our emissions factors from our study versus um these other studies we found that for some species we reported much higher emission factors and others were lower and i also compared emission factors from this study to emission factors from the literature so i have this reference line with a slope of one um points in yellow for corn green for grass and circles for andre 2019 and triangles for akagi and we found that our emission factors for grass were more similar to emission factors reported in the literature which suggests that they mostly looked at smoldering fires so that's all i have basically we found that emission factors show really strong negative correlations with voc emissions and we did find variability with crop type um and we would expect higher emissions of vocs such as formaldehyde and benzaldehyde um at lower mce values namely for crops like grass so that's all i have thank you so much for listening um and i'm acknowledging here the people who helped me um as well as people who provided data so if you have any questions let me know anyone from the audience have a question if if they don't can you go back to the slide of um the graph yeah um two more remember which side that one for example that one or that one what what what is a okay that one um what what is a point is it i put it in the chat is a point a certain time and space observation read or because you just have a regression if you have panel data you can actually control for a lot of things right so that that's mainly what i wanted to ask yeah i actually forgot to go over that so each of these points um actually this will be easier to explain if i go back to the slide that shows how we sampled so each of those points represents a transect which you can see here we have for example these points representing these fires and you can see by the flight paths that the plane intercepts each fire multiple times this is because um as the smoke is diluted in the atmosphere chemistry changes so instead of just um averaging emissions for each fire it's actually more beneficial to average points for each time that we intercept the um smoke plumes so if i go back to that plot as an example um each of these points is um represents a transect and the average emissions factor per transect chris has a question oh you have another question too kind of related question go back to your um flight picture yeah so i guess i was curious what are the skill sets you learn in terms of dealing with these data i assume you had to accept and reject various data points as you were flying through the plume and not flying through the plume uh was that one of the biggest challenges of doing this analysis um luckily someone else not b um went through the data and um identified which points belong to each transect so luckily i didn't have to deal with that but i think actually the harder part for me is that um all of the crop data came from wasn't collected by the nasa dca aircraft it was gathered separately based on ground surveys that were done after the fact and were identified using google earth and also some planet labs data and so actually one of the most time consuming parts of this process was identifying or was basically matching up which crops went to which fires since that data was gathered separately so that involved looking at i guess first one of the things that was used was we geo-referenced some images that were taken by the gc8 because they had some cameras as well and also used some planet labs um cropland data to match up the coordinates that we that were collected by the plane to um images from planet lab that were taken on the same date um to figure out what exactly was burning for each fire perfect thanks yeah chris you want to ask the question and then after katrina answers then you take the floor sounds great um i noticed that the soy had an nf6 and i just it's such a common crop um why is soy so under-sampled whereas it's almost as commonly grown as corn um but it seems to have such a low number of samples yeah so i'm actually not an expert on agriculture but i would guess mainly because of the location i'm not 100 sure but for example i know that um rice is more commonly grown um in other locations in like the north american continent um and this the area that we sampled i believe is part of the corn belt um if i remember correctly um so i think it would mostly just have to do with the location that we sampled i'm not 100 sure though great thank you all right chris you go for it all right um i don't know why this is happening what is going on wait hold on ah here it is okay um so uh my my name is chris mccarron um my faculty advisor is richard dodd my postdoc advisor is angel fernandez marty and uh my graduate student advisor is prelotta papper and i studied from my honors thesis the population genetics of the serpentine endemic leather oak uh quarkus dorada i also wanted to start off by echoing what dr ackerly said um about native americans i'm currently on a loaning land and oaks were an incredibly important species for food and also cultural resources for the illoni people as well as native americans throughout california so first i'm going to begin by starting um talking about a little bit about geology um and also california's floral diversity and how this actually links into a single species which was my study species uh the leather corcus dorado variety to prada i'm going to talk about some hypotheses and questions methods that i had and then future analysis so shown here is a rock called serpentinite serpentinite is the california state rock and ultimately once um serpentine rock begins to degrade it forms a soil referred to as serpentine soils and these are renowned for their unique floristic assemblage in california so serpentine soils shown here on the right hand side this is the serpentine habitat um they're interesting for several reasons so they're low in calcium and high in magnesium and what i mean by that is that normal soils or normal soils typically have one parts magnesium to nine parts calcium whereas serpentine soils have nine parts magnesium to one part calcium they're also high in toxic metals like nickel cobalt and cobalt and chromium and because of this um it makes it extremely hard for plants to actually exist in these soils and so plants that occur on these soils actually have unique adaptations and my study species corcosterata is a species that's entirely restricted to serpentine habitats shown here on the right is a map of serpentine throughout california in pink and as you can see it occurs in these scattered patches throughout the state and so they essentially create these landlocked islands um for species and populations that are restricted to serpentine soils uh because of this they have a high number of a very endemic taxa because they're hard to actually exist on and so species that exist on serpentine soils often occur there because they can adapt to actually living on these harsh environments but it means reduced competition and because of their insularity it means that there's a lot of rare species and one good example here is in the genus streptanthus and that's shown on the right hand side streptanthus has almost 20 species that are entirely restricted to serpentine soils and the reason that it has such a high number of species is because different populations of what were once the same species are no longer sharing genes between different isolated populations and so over time they ultimately speciate to become different species my study species the leather oak is an anomaly um as i pointed out there are numerous genera that have speciated because of their restriction to these serpentine islands um and my species is also a serpentine endemic but the the exception is that it's one of only two widespread species that are entirely restricted to serpentine habitats uh the other species would be hesperus cyprus sargentii or the sergeant cyprus now as you can see here with this map overlaid over its distribution you can see that corcosterotto within with the points in blue occurs on much of the serpentine soils and serpentine habitats throughout the entire state and being that it hasn't speciated really the question is why what's going on with corcosterota and its genetics between different populations is this really a single species or is there cryptic diversity occurring and has there been genetic drift that ultimately doesn't have any sort of morphological differences um but there are different genetic populations if it is a single species how much gene flow is actually occurring among these outcrops and then also what is the history of the species ultimately there's two different ways that it could have occurred over such a large range in these isolated habitats one would be that it was a very localized species um and that there was a migration that occurred and one hypothesis would be that native americans um because of food sources might have actually spread the acorns or it was a widespread species that because of um for instance changes in climate or changes in uh habitat dynamics ultimately moved on to serpentine and became restricted as a reduced as a way of reducing competition so this has several important implications um first of all for conservation there might be genetically unique populations uh but also a species like orchestrata that's only found on serpentine islands it's not going to be able to migrate if climate change as global warming continues to occur and so ultimately if we're going to have assisted migration of the species we need to actually understand what its genetics are also understanding the past um what is the uh what is the reason that you can find a species that's distributed over such a large distance or such a large range but is found only in these very unique habitats and what is the influence of climate changes in the past on actually making this occur and then also just basic scientific inquiry asking this question expands our knowledge of california's flora and also expands our knowledge of oaks in north america and so some methods that i used for site identification i use california consortium liberia records seen here and ultimately what i needed to understand was that uh collections that occurred on serpentine and on public lands would equate to the most viable sites and so what i did was i used usgs geological maps of serpentine habitats shown in green and then also a california protected areas database maps shown in beige and also gray and i queried with the arcgis and as you can see there are sites that are found in public lands but not on serpentine there are sites that are found on serpentine but not on public lands and then there are also sites that are found on both and so the most viable sites would be the turquoise dots and then other considerations would be for instance blue dots as well as the orange dots to inform where else i might be able to sample this ultimately led to a sample size of 31 sites and 10 samples from each site would equate to 310 samples upon actually going out and collecting i was only able to get to 26 sites which led me to have 256 samples once back at the lab i did ctab dna extractions and oaks are notoriously hard to get dna out of and so this actually led to 26 sites with only 188 samples we actually just sent it last week to have reduced genome sequencing done and they're going to look at the nuclear dna and they're we're going to use the novaseq s4 to do reduced genome sequencing now uh obviously because of covid um this led to numerous problems actually going out sampling and then also getting into the lab um to do dna extractions as i pointed out upon actually going getting into the lab and doing dna extractions on my samples i found that it was very hard to actually extract certain sample sites because of different phenols and tenons in the leaves and so i was going to go back out and resample from these sites so i had more an ability to actually increase my my the number of um individuals that i was going to include my study but then the wildfires happened and so i couldn't actually get out um and then ultimately what happened is i waited because i anticipated you know i'll be able to go after the fires and then i found that every single site that i needed to resample from burnt um so then there was that uh so ultimately this led to numerous problems but what i wanted to do here was ultimately just propose some some future analysis that i'm going to do using structure what this does is a bayesian analysis and this is from a different publication calling him at all but what they did was they looked at lodgepole pine and jackpine and what they found was that um as you can see here lodgepole is in beige and then jackpine is in blue and then there's a hybrid zone and so this would be the sort of analysis that i would be looking to do among all of these different populations um and i just wanted to also point out uh last night we had a meeting with my advisor my postdoc advisor and what's great is that we came to the conclusion that because i only have 188 samples that actually leaves room because the novoseq s4 can hold a lot more samples than that and so what we're going to do is we're going to include a single individual of corcosterota and we're going to be able to sequence the entire genome which is very important and this actually adds a significant amount of data to my study that i didn't actually think i was going to be able to have so i want to just thank my pi advisor richard dodd my postdoc advisor angel fernandez marty and my graduate student advisor palette paper as well as my haas scholars fellowship advisor leah carroll as well as the funders of this research because without them this would not have happened and any questions well done chris there's a couple of questions so i will ask the people that put him in the chat to unmute please richard uh hey can i jump in while we're waiting for richard yes please david um chris is this is gonna be it's gonna be so cool to see the sequences so if i understood your second scenario you're saying a widespread scenario that contracted onto serpentine does that require a kind of massive parallel evolution of the serpentine tolerance and that it's an unusual scenario and a pretty cool one yeah it would it would require like that ultimately hypothetically speaking i i wouldn't say that that was actually what occurred um my hypothesis would be that it was some sort of localized um thing that once again native americans or someone spread it but that would have occurred that would have had to have occurred in some sort of scenario where it was tolerant of serpentine and then maybe during the pleistocene or something like that either climate changes or differences in um ecological variables maybe competition with other species that if it was tolerant of serpentine um maybe throughout its range it found a way to actually begin to shift onto serpentine as a way of reducing competition yeah yeah hey i think you have a chat question from um professor dodd but he's on the webinar and can't on mute you can take a look thanks so much um let me see oaks are often referred to as oh man okay yeah it's i mean so actually so prahlad is a student in david dr ackley's lab um and what he found was that it's likely that the um its closest ancestor is berber defolia and it's likely that um corcus dorada as well as berbertofolia are actually hybrids of um either uh i believe it's gary honor or de glacier um and so there there might be um i would say that yes it would be essentially a multi-species taxa and once again um they they love to hybridize so it kind of comes down to what is actually going on with the species um i it very well could explain the anomaly um really i've had this question for several years and it kind of just there's so much up in the air that cork is drought it's just every time i show up on a serpentine habitat it's like what what's actually going on here with the species um so yeah katrina go ahead yeah um oh first of all i'm so sorry that your site's burned that's really sad um but yeah i was just curious you mentioned that oak is difficult to extract dna from why is that um they have a lot of tannins in their leaves and the reason what you need to have high quality dna is to actually get sugars out of the different samples um you don't want to actually have your samples have a high amount of tannins or sugars in them um and because oaks are so high in these compounds that the quality of dna that you get out of them i must have extracted some of the same samples probably about 20 times um and i was ultimately unsuccessful in actually getting anything out of them so cool thank you and great job thank you well done chris sonnet you have the floor and i saw that um you have at least a couple of mentors in the house so bree's here and i can't see the other panelists so thank you for joining us and we're looking forward to hearing your research on it you have the floor and i know your mom's watching as well welcome mom thank you um hi i'm sonnet my project's called accommodating the anthropocene conceptual metaphor in eco-poetics it's an interdisciplinary project that draws on perspectives from cognitive linguistics and philosophy and in english and the environmental humanities so i want to begin with a quotation from robert hass about the relationship between poetry and other fields of knowledge i want to make a case today that one of the roles that poetry can play is taking things that we already know kind of unconsciously or subconsciously in science and other disciplines and bring them to our attention in different ways um so throughout this presentation i'm going to build up this notion of eco-poetic renovative ecopoetic poetics that first word i'll explain but eco-poetics broadly is the study of poetry that engages environmental questions so one of the things that's kind of lurking in the back of our minds is the proposal by geologists that the present geological epoch is called might be called the anthropocene which says that it's primarily characterized by the impact of humans on the earth and i think what this suggests is that we these embodied biological social beings are intervening in diffuse and abstracted ways in deep geologic time so acknowledging both the questions of subjugation and dispossession of subtler colonialism and slavery that are obscured when we try to understand humanity as this undifferentiated collective um i want to sort of ask this driving question of how we can understand the disjuncture between our immediate perspective and the diffuse impacts that we're having so to answer and approach this question i draw on conceptual metaphor theory which is a body of work in cognitive linguistics and the central claim is that meaning is fundamentally embodied so metaphor is how we bring things that lie outside the realm of our immediate experience into tangible and human scale terms um it's grounded in empirical research that suggests that when you the source domain is activated um when you invoke a metaphor so if i say i'm going to kick this habit it might activate the motor cortex even though i'm using kick metaphorically um conceptual metaphor theory also tells us that metaphor is ubiquitous in all areas of human discourse it's particularly integral to science and scientific communication so it captures concepts like natural selection or deep time or genetic drift as chris was just talking about these are all metaphors another thing that i want to pull on from conceptual metaphor theory is this idea of a spectrum from novel to conventional metaphor um novel metaphors are those that structure our kind of everyday unconscious understandings of of complex phenomena so here are a couple of conventional metaphors from climate discourse i'll pull on the example of carbon footprint which is a really useful metaphor that lets us quantify and communicate about the contribution of each individual to carbon dioxide emissions but it's not a perfect metaphor because footprints are discrete and traceable and eventually get washed away whereas so it doesn't account for the fact that emissions are diffuse and uncontainable and as we know well really hard to get back into the ground um so the contribution that i think poetry can make is to recover some of what's obscured in these conventional metaphors that we need to use in other in other domains um so one of the ways it can do that is by recombining familiar domains in unexpected ways like this example from cody rose clevedance of the trees or the eyelashes of creeks another thing that poems can do is to actually re-novelize conventional metaphors so um this is an example of ed roberson invoking the word footprint knowing that it brings up that frame of carbon footprint but explicitly offering an alternative and maybe lesser known definition of the surface of what over which a phenomenon exists so he's kind of turning the concept on his head and suggesting that instead of the negative impact it's also the fundamental substrate of life so he's kind of reinhabiting this defaultized concept with its plurality of sense and possibility so this brings me back to this notion of renovative eco poetics my professor john chapter uses the word renovative to talk about poems that reinhabit traditional poetic formal features but i want to argue that in the view of conceptual metaphor theory as i just demonstrated it's possible also for concepts so the content of a poem to be re-novelized or renovated as well um and one of the components for this is this idea of embodiment that i talked about with the motor cortex activation and the sort of the ability of a metaphor to invoke to put things in terms of the body um and and also this idea of contextuality in which poets are working working within the scientific and discursive context that they're writing out of and into and complicate or trouble the assumptions that are embedded in it so here's an example from joy graham using this kind of like economizing or capital capitalistic jargon that's from the ambient culture you can see here i found it um on glassdoor is this idea of like economic growth and i think in using these terms she's both invoking the sort of ecological dimension so growth as like bodily organismal growth um maybe accumulate backlog you can hear kind of like log or the idea of decomposition in a forest floor and i think consumer obviously is a is a species role that an ecological concept as well and so i think that in also in placing these concepts in a poem that's titled self-portrait at three degrees she's implicating the unspoken attitudes that this jargon is associated with or reinforces in the accumulation of the three degrees of warming that we are um as of now approaching and i also want to point out this phrase shapeless and spendable future that she offers i think one another really conventional metaphor is the framing of time as money like i love to spend time with you or you're wasting my time um and here she's framing this futural concept of time as unspendable um and kind of troubling that conventional notion that we have of time which is conveniently really kind of an underpinning of of capitalism um so another of the sort of um sensibilities that i want to bring into this idea of renovative ecopoetics is the sense of ambiguity and simultaneity as i talked about with the anthropocene there we have to be kind of inhabiting all these different scales at the same time um and she talks about this as the poem has always been interested in the immediate instant and the embodied subjective self but i think this poetry kind of demonstrates its entanglement with deep futures and remote processes um because unlike science poems don't have to be deterministic and precise in the in the picture that they paint when they and they can recombine comment concepts and shed new light on them so i want to offer this poem from jane hirschfield's ledger it's called as if hearing heavy furniture moved on the floor above us as things grow rarer they enter the ranges of counting remain this many siberian tigers that many african elephants 300 red-legged egrets we scrape from the world its tilt and meander of wonder as if eating the last burned onions and carrots from a cast iron pan closing eyes to taste better the char of ordinary sweetness i don't have time to give you a really close reading but i want to highlight the tension here between the titular matter metaphor which conveys a sense of remoteness or detachment and the metaphor of the cast iron pan which implies a lot more direct agency and intimacy with the subject of species extinction and i think she tightens this relationship by including the words tilt and meander together tilt like the axis of the earth but also like what you do with a pan and meander both like observing animals but also like the animals themselves moving um it's also worth noting that the word extinction comes from the word extinguish which relies on the metaphor that life is aflame so i think that she's pulling on the sense of these the burnedness and the sense of the extinguishment of life um so i think that in offering this tension she's kind of posing a challenge um saying that we we get to decide the level of immediacy with which we engage with and think about the kind of on one level very distant realities of the anthropocene or whatever we want to call this time and i think so on one level our relationship can be voyeuristic or remote but on another level it can be one of felt immediacy um and so i just want to leave with a discussion of what i think poetry can and can't do i think that this this project demonstrates the way in which language in addition to scientific and technological solutions is a site of intervention in facing climate change global warming anthropogenic forces forcings because it's a site of a point of access to our deeper conceptual structures and so flexing or stretching those structures can jostle or challenge the assumptions that are lurking in the conventional metaphors that we encounter all the time as we look at headlines or when we're scrolling endlessly um and poems can also as this poem just demonstrated bring scientific realities that are inherent in metaphors or terms consciously back into human scale because all metaphors rely on embodied human experience but you can use them in a way that is actively relying on that on that ability of metaphor and i think what these poems also do is force us to take a really hard look at this reality um there's a lot of ambiguity um you know the complexity of the climate system eludes even our best climate models so we we're trying our best but we can't reliably predict everything that's going to happen and a lot of times the best we can do is present a number of different outcomes that are likely and so i think that in resisting resolution poems can enact this plurality of possible outcomes and finally this is an idea that comes from joy graham the possibility that this ambiguity that we're facing understanding it less as a scarcity or lack of information but rather as a site of abundance and possibility because our fate and the world's fate isn't yet sealed um i just want to end by expressing my immense gratitude to everybody on this slide in particular the wishek fund which um sponsored my surf fellowship as well as my advisors brie and eve um and everybody else who's um had conversations with me about poetry in the past year um and to you all for your attention thank you i'd love to hear your questions well done sonnet and i think it was uh opening my mind to approaching these topics from this completely different lens thank you for this is like the beauty of teaching at berkeley you never know the the angles that students go about and brie um you have a question so you have the floor please unmute yourself hi sonnet so great to see the combination of this really exciting work it's been a joy to be involved i was curious because this part of your presentation focused more on the poetics and i was curious if you'd speak just briefly on what you think scientists should do about how they communicate given that you're thinking really deeply about metaphors and whether they're an accurate representation of reality and that as scientists we often don't even think when we say things like tipping point like we don't even think that's a metaphor so if you were going to give like a short piece of advice to professors that wanted to try to be more mindful about how they're thinking about and communicating these metaphors about a changing planet what would that be sure yeah thank you for the question um i think what's important what's what's interesting about metaphor is it operates differently in the mind of the of the listener so whatever kind of inferential structures you have when you encounter it are going to be activated in different ways so a metaphor like tipping point for a biologist or a climate scientist they have all of these inferences about how ecosystems can approach and pass slipping points um but for like a person who doesn't have all of that inferential structure um it might have different inferences that are not intended or that are oversimplifying um i think i've i've observed a connection between the tipping point metaphor and this sort of apocalyptic framing that we often see with climate change um and there are some serious drawbacks to that um and so i think it's just it's useful for people who are you know communicating their science to the public to consider what inferences inferences people will have access to and what they might not do and might not and then might need to be informed about or choosing a different metaphor that has kind of different um sort of natural inferences yeah thank you um can i ask questions on it or so um well first of all this was such a beautiful presentation and i love interdisciplinary studies and i really feel like we should stop separating um disciplines into disciplines and communicate with each other across those lines more often but one question that i was curious about since you talked about the power of language in communicating science and concepts and poetry i was wondering um if you had any thoughts on the broadness of the use of anthro and anthropocene um and the implications of um using such a broad term such as anthro to describe anthropocene when there's a lot of disparity within that term yeah yeah thank you for for calling that out i think that's really important um and i think i think one thing i would say is that metaphor conceptual metaphor theory talks about how meaning is brought to the scale of an individual human so i think there's a question about whether or not trying to scale up our imagination of humans to the collective level is actually useful because um it kind of it's like i don't know how to think about that because i can just i only have access to my own experience um and i think also there's possibilities for different framing so like donna haraway calls the anthropocene um the capital ocean plantation scene cthulhu scene and so she and i think that pluralizing um the framing and adding kind of additional components can help complexify that and not totally eliminate the problems that are inherent in trying to collectivize humans but to recognize that it is humans and not something else that's causing all of these um you know changes but also that there are kind of forces within that that are also contributing thank you thank you thank you i think there's going to be a couple other questions but you can go ahead and answer those in the chats on it we'll just try to yeah enough time for everybody great ariana you have the floor awesome thank you and thanks so much for that really cool presentation so um today i'm going to be presenting on my thesis about exploring climate change adaptation pathways for the gunayawa who are an indigenous group in san blas panama and big thank you to my mentor and professor sofia villaspoas for her help during this project so oh um some background on this issue and kind of what i'll be talking about today the san blas islands are off the eastern coast of panama and on the 400 coral islands reside the guna gala which are an indigenous group that are extremely poor and have a um very low international welfare index and this will become important later um some important things about the gunayala is that they reside in an autonomous area and the panamanian government has pretty much no control over governance in the area which results in very low data availability in the area but also higher vulnerability due to lack of infrastructure and lack of assistance from the government they are a really strong indigenous group that has kind of lived by themselves for many years but face the threats of climate change because of their low-lying elevation islands and because of both storm surges and sea level rise that i'll talk chat a little bit about so first in my project i kind of intended on trying to find a way to model the migration of the guna gala from the san blas islands as they will we predict that they will have to eventually migrate and so i did so first by looking at current approaches to climate modeling so these three instrumental variable gravity models and coupled mobility and sea level rise models were some some options that i explored and i wanted to make some observations on kind of what these models had to offer but also what their limitations were and i came up with three key observations as to um like what i learned from the literature that's firstly that specificity is essential for planning particularly for um in in the case of an indigenous group that has so little resources that data availability is a significant limitation to the type of approach you can take um and in this area where the census only tracks even basic population data once every 10 years that certainly was a limiter to my approach and that current methods lack integration of cultural resilience so the literature at this point currently um tends to gloss over the perhaps the like resilience of these people and their particular adaptations with nature so i wanted to i developed a methodology kind of in concurrence with this analysis um to couple a sea level rise and mobility model and envision integrate indigenous adaptive practices into a suitability analysis which essentially determines potential relocation destinations for the gunayala so my methodology here was firstly to do a model of sea level rise based off representative concentration pathways 2.6 and 8.5 to provide a very conservative and generous estimate of sea level rise um unfortunately this 2.6 is you know not really possible anymore given current emissions profiles um so we're looking more at 8.5 as being realistic i also looked at storm surges as a climate event that are going to become predicted to be annual by 2100 as a main driver of migration notably that not just climate processes like sea level rise will affect these islands but the extreme flooding that is likely to happen due to weather shifts and sea level rise as well so then i secondarily developed a suitability analysis for relocation that took advan kind of calculated the viability of different areas in panama for relocation based off of the following opportunities and constraints i'm going to incorporate indigenous resilience into the coding decisions for the suitability analysis such as their maintenance of a relationship with ecosystems high social cohesion and collective management of resources that informed the selection of areas that have high highly arable land um that are not near other community settlements and that um are close enough to sandblast that they allow proper transportation to even be possible so the following is a sea level rise model you done in arcgis from my the inputs of increased sea level rise so we can see here that by 2050 on the like left most image uh that the majority of the islands in the san blas region will be in fully inundated and then by 2300 we see the mainland start to become significantly inundated and all of the islands be underwater so this was meant to serve kind of as a visual representation both for the panamanian government and for you know general literature that um this problem is going to be extremely upcoming and is something emergent to plan for so particularly the impact of storm surges as you can see like amplifies the effects of flooding up to 2 300 and will essentially devastate these islands based off of my predictions so here's a short animation of what flooding will likely do to the like panama panama mainland um and we can see that like the flooding significantly impacts coasts and this was interpreted in the suitability analysis to restrict areas of like relocation as well so i did also did a case study on gardi sugdev which is a small island that has over 2 000 people living on it and predicted through the models what sea level rise will do to the island in 2050 and 2100 um we can see from the first image on the left that 36 of houses are underwater this equates to about 720 people being displaced and by 2100 almost all of the island is underwater so this problem is definitely um something that is extremely emergent for these people so the final outcome of this analysis and like the key deliverable here is a suitability map that determines potential relocation um for the sandblast for the people who live on the san blas islands so i've demarcated the san blas airport just to offer some kind of geo-referencing there um and essentially this locates the areas kind of to the east of panama city which i don't know if you can see my cursor are around here as being most viable for relocation so the key findings of this study were that the guardi sugg and the majority of islands will be likely forced to migrate by 2050 under all rcp scenarios and that eastern infrastructure is most at risk on this on in gaardi subdiv particularly and secondarily under both rcp scenarios the majority of islands are at risk by 2050 and by 2300 the mainland will be impacted this is particularly relevant because current relocation projects suggest that the guna gala should simply relocate to their like indigenous mainland which is about 100 kilometers away from where they currently live um but we can see that this is not a long-term solution based off of these current climate projections and that storms we lastly see that storm surges will flood all 400 plus islands that are in san blas right now and that even if this happens before the sea level rise eventually inundates the entire island that storm surges will likely devastate infrastructure to the point at which migration will have to occur anyway so the other findings um specifically related to my key deliverable of a suitability analysis are that four in specific districts offer the highest suitability based off of socioecological factors um so those are panama chepo chiman and san miguel and i think it's important to note here that these areas all present um a like areas that are viable not just in terms of their like ecology such as their ability for arable land access to electricity away from that they're away from other communities but they also capture at least in part the indigenous resilience of this community by allowing them and empowering them to be autonomous even after um they're forced to migrate away from their initial homes and i think that is kind of the thematic um like like summary of my research which is climate migration it's not just driven by governments driven by um like general research that we can apply to specific areas but research that's useful for these groups in particular um their local governments as well as laguna's indigenous government to plan for their own relocation and i think that my research kind of in my actual thesis summarizes the literature's um lack of focus on the autonomy of these people and hopefully through increased um initiatives that support their autonomy we can offer not just solutions that help them overcome the effects of climate change but help them do so together and proactively before they're forced to kind of move and not able to plan yeah thank you if you have any questions let me know well done ariana i have a question what are the key parameters that you are most sure of and most unsure of that you feed into your sea rice level model you have two basically scenarios in order for us mere mortals to understand it can you just give us a brief idea thank you so um the sea level rise scenarios are based off of ipcc reports on what they predict sea level rise to look like based off of a variety of different factors i think that these these estimates are based off of global mean sea level rise they're not specific to the caribbean sea so we expect that these estimations of sea level rise are actually rather conservative considering the fact that the equatorial adjacent area in the caribbean sea is likely to result in more thermal expansion higher fluctuations with tropical storms and things like that um these predictions i think rcp 8.5 even though it's seen as more of a like like the probably the worst scenario um is actually more realistic significantly more realistic than the conservative estimate of 2.6 anyone else from the audience or [Music] let's see they're giving you praise so i think if you have more questions for ariana and it's been working really well put them in the chat and then ariana will go through and answer them it's hard to do everything in real time so that's a great way to do it thank you so so much and well done thank you i will ask jerry please to uh come up and share his work on his thesis if you share your screen i think ariana will unshare automatically jerry yeah is it working perfect you can do it in full screen yes perfect hi everyone today i'm sharing my thesis on the effect of california wildfires on perceived fire risks and home values so we did a case study of santa clarita valley after multiple fires in the time period of the study i really want to give special thanks to my mentor professor sophia velazquez for supporting me and encouraging me to turn my small idea into my thesis so first off let me can i stop you jerry can i stop you jerry yeah can you share with the group how we you asked me to do this oh yeah i was just um i was in sofia's class and i was like yeah i was thinking about this little project and then we were talking about it on her way back to her office and it was just really casual and really like the vibes that like the how like professors and students can be so close and just talk about like what you have in your mind and maybe we can turn this into an honor thesis yeah so jerry encourage the the people from high school watching right now to be brave and approach the faculty when they join berkeley right we don't bite yeah it's just like a small talk and like a small casual chat after class or on the way to the professor's office and you can really get a lot from like just the chat itself yeah should i um continue thank you jerry sorry to put you on the spot no problem yeah so before i start i just want to give a quick background in the history of california wildfires so in fact california wildfires um especially in the western united states are not used to us they happen prehistorically all the time before the population boom and they have been shaping the ecosystem in california for thousands of years and lightning has been identified as the major cause of wildfires in the western united states prehistorically from the graph on the left we can see that over the past 1500 years here the fire frequency is going down as indicated by the purple line in part d and now we're actually at a trove of fire frequencies however what is alarming is we have reached a record high in terms of temperature in the past 200 years and also in part c we can see that in biomass burning we have accumulated a record high of fire deficits which just means accumulating excess fuels for the next big fire to explode and this will pose a huge fire risk for the 21st century and indeed we do see an increase in fire frequency and severity recently and the fires in the past several years have been record setting not necessarily in terms of size but definitely in terms of costs and its damage to home and to human lives so we can see from the table on the left out of the top 10 costliest wildfires in the united states all of them are in california and all of them happened after the year 2000 and six of them happened in the past five years and this table was even made before the fire season of 2020 the year we observed the largest fire season in the recent history so if the year of 2020 data were included the figures would even be more astonishing and for example the fire in 2018 um the campfire destroyed the entire town of paradise which was super tragic and this was the first time we seen such a big impact human lives of the wildfires so this raises the question that why the recent fires have been so costly and severe well the first part of it is due to the accumulated fire deficit in the late 20th century due to the fire suppression policies in the united states another huge part is due to the increasing human interactions with the wildlands by moving into wi wi which stands for the wildland urban interface in inter mix here's an example in the graph on the left as you can see from part a and part b and this the leftmost graph both types of wis have large area where many houses and wildland vegetation intermingle which provides no barrier but excess fuels when the area is hit by a wildfire what's even worse is in california we see the number of homes in wi areas grew by 33 from 1990 to 2010. on one hand people are moving into the wi wui areas on the other hand um the fire um informations and the fire damages have been making the headlines of the newspapers and interviews on the television so this motivated our research question are people actually aware of the fire risks when they decide to purchase a home so for this study we look at a case study in santa clarita valley which is on on the map you can see is right above san fernando in the red um area here it's surrounded um by mountains uh to the to the east to the west and to the north so that would be a perfect area for us to study and also it has been a rapidly developing wise before the time of the study and was hit by multiple fires in the time frame of the study and for the control group we're looking at we actually did not choose the city of san fernando because it was very close to two of the fires we're looking at and we don't want the control group to be secretly treated and alter our um evaluation of the fire on housing values so instead we choose the little bit further 30 of burbank which is also a very good control group because it's right next to some other mountains which makes it also a part of the wi so we're controlling for something that are both changing in that time frame when the houses were expanding to the wi areas and also we looked at the city of pasadena which i will mention a little bit later so the data and is acquired from zillow especially the housing transaction and sales data was the house characteristics and the fire informations are acquired from cal fire oh sorry the study uses a difference in differences research method that compares if the fire leads to a differential trend in the trajectory of housing prices in santa clarita compared to in burbank so we're controlling for the city specific effects and then the time specific effects we only want to look at how the fire changes the slope of the price trajectory in different groups the treatment and the control so santa clarita has experienced multiple fires during the time frame of the study which makes it perfect to study um the evolution of people's perceived fire risks fire risks and then see if they actually adjust their perceived risk based on a huge fire event so here are the summary of the fires happened during the study time so in 2003 we had the city fire which burned approximately a hundred thousand fires in 2004 we have foothill fire which burned approximately 6000 acres in 2007 we had two major fires buckwheat and magic fire right next to santa clarita which burned around 41 000 acres and in 2008 we have seri fire which burned around 11 000 acres so under the difference and differences model assumption the price trend in both the treatment group uh santa clarita and the control group burbank would have evolved similarly had it not been fired so if not for the fire then we should see the same price trend so we can make sure all the um changes in housing trends are represented by the fire as we can tell from the left part of this graph this does look true um before the fire it seems like those two housing trends trends has been falling quite similarly and in the fire years 2004 let's look at the following year 2005 we see a deeper drop um and also in the fire years 2005 we see in those two years there's a deeper drop in slopes compared to in the red line burbank and for the um fire years 2008 and 2009 we see a flatter increase in the housing price trend compared to burbank and then for the model result here is the regression table that we did so the first two columns indicates the linear model and the third and fourth column indicate the log transform model which allows the um the marginal effects of the fire to vary depending on the levels of the covariance so for the linear model um we included a lot of covariates like the housing characteristics like the lot size year builds a number of bedrooms and number of bathrooms which are common um factors that people consider when purchasing a home and we also included fires and the interaction of treatment and fires what we want to focus here is um in the interaction terms so for the interaction terms we concluded that holding other variables constant semi-fire would reduce housing price by on average 40k and buckwheat magicfire reduced the housing price by around 50k and sale fire reduced the housing price by around 31k and all at the significance level of one percent for the log transfer model we see um the semi-fire reduced by um housing price by six percent buckwheat and magic fire reduced the housing price by seven percent and sarah price reduced the housing price by three percent all at a significance level of one percent so the foothill fire's effect on housing crisis is actually very small and statistically insignificant to test the validity of the model the city of pasadena is chosen as the fake treatment group because it's obviously not affected by the fires and if and it is geographically close to treatment and the control group so if the model is right then we should not pick up any of the fire effects on the interaction terms which is indeed true because we can see here um the small exception is the buckwheat fire and magic fire in column two at the significance level of ten percent all other coefficients are not statistically significant so for a con oh for the conclusion so from the case study of santa clarita valley we can see that the fire risks have not been priced into the housing values and we see an average drop of five percent of the housing values office after a severe fire however we do see learning that people are adjusting their perceived fire risks after a major fire for example foothill fire had no statistically significant effects on housing values after semi-fire in the previous year this leads us to come hypothesize that after a big fire of semi which burned ten thousand um a hundred thousand acres a smaller fire like foothill which only burned six thousand acres has no effect on housing prices however the effects of the fire seemed to diminishing up two years after the fire but after several years of no fire another severe fire would lead to a bigger drop in price compared to the previous one yeah that's all i have to present and thank you so much for your attention good job jerry we have time for one quick question anyone in the audience brian you have a question not really a very nice presentation all right jerry if if anyone has questions please put them in the chat for jerry um very well done and um looking forward to seeing your next um in you know next steps on your project i do have one one question which is this seems to show that the effects of fires are fairly local right they don't they don't uh transcend uh local boundaries very much and you know make implications for other similar areas that maybe are not close yes this the from the case study of santa clarita fires senator rita fires that this seems like the case maybe one hypothesis is also not because of the fire risk maybe it's also because of the loss of environmental amenities for example if there's a huge burn scar on the mountain then the nearby city is not going to see it but the closest city is going to be constantly seeing it every time they go out of their homes so maybe that's also a huge com contribution to the reduction of housing values thank you and now last but not least janleen liu you have the floor and your advisors in the house and uh we are looking forward to listening to your thesis presentation yeah hello everyone could you guys see my screen cool um hello everyone today i'll be talking about my research around bioplastic which is petrochemical plastic substitutes and i will be talking about its price burden and its path to cost reduction um huge shout out to my faculty mentor professor brian ray thank you so much for all the guidance along the way yeah to begin i would like to give a couple definitions about the bioplastic and bioplastic products that we'll be talking about in this research so for bioplastic i'll be referring to biodegradable plastics that are mostly but not all made from renewable resources and for bioplastic products i'll be talking about are referring to products made primarily from bioplastic that are certified biodegradable or compostable so this research originated from an identified problem which is that one percent of 335 million tons of plastics produced annually are bioplastics after more than 30 years of development of bioplastic in an industry why is its market still so small um to answer to resolve this problem i focus on the price and cost size of bioplastic and i'll be answering three questions the first one is that is price a disadvantage to them and if so what price reducing technology or innovations is being adopted to reduce the cost of bioplastics in addition to that what other indirect methods could be could help to mitigate the cost reduction burden of bioplastics to begin with in order to identify the price version of bioplastic products i picked biobag as a representative bioback is a global company that produces compostable and biodegradable packaging products i picked their kitchen waste bag gallon zipper food storage bag plastic shopping bag and produce bag as example and compared their prices to its competitors that are conventional plastic products and i found that on average their price bio box prices are on average 2.9 times higher than its peers based off of this finding i reached out to bio bac's representative and another bioplastic product company i asked about their cause disadvantage in the market and biobank responded that their main component nature bite which is made primarily from starches cellulose vegetable oils and their combinations the main component just have a higher raw material cost than other petrochemical plastic even as the demand for bio bag increased price of makerbot has reduced however it may never be as inexpensive as polyethylene which is the main material found in other plastic bags in addition i reached out to a company based in hong kong called distinctive action they produce an uh product called invisible bag which is biodegradable compostable and water soluble the main component of invisible bag is poliwino alcohol starch glycerin water and they use eco-friendly inks their founder confirmed that two to three times price difference um would exist for their product as well in hong kong and it may be even worse in their case as economies of volume is hard for them to achieve they mainly sell to middle and small sizes businesses as larger size businesses don't tend to purchase these environmentally friendly products that are more pricey after i found after talking to the companies and founding the price difference in bioproducts i realized that the main price difference comes from their main their raw materials therefore i went on and researched on the raw material prices of bioplastic materials all the materials are listed on our left side and the biodegradability is labeled um as one if they're biodegradable it's zero if they're not we can see that the most expensive material is a biodegradable one called pha and bio main material may turn by is indeed more expensive than polyester another interesting point to look at is pla polylactic acid is actually um sorry pva polyvinyl alcohol which is adopted by distinctive action is actually slightly cheaper than polyethane however the price may be adjusted um based on if it's retail price or wholesale price and price may price defense may exist due to different regions as well but overall the biodegradable materials bioplastic materials are overall cheaper than pvc-ppp and pet after we've identified the price differences the next question to ask is what price reducing technologies cost reducing technologies exist for bioplastic materials i'll be taking two examples the first one is polylactic acid pla pla is mainly made from starch and starch goes through hydrolysis fermentation and eventually condensation in order to form pla in order to reduce the price of pla it's suggested to blend pla composite with pla with sizable fibers to form a cheaper composite since zelda fiber is a very abundant natural fiber resource blending it would not only reduce its price but would also improve its mechanical properties such as lower melting point making pla composite easier to be processed in addition to that high higher tensile strength and a higher biodegradation rate another example i'll talk about is polyhydroxyacronoid pha so phas price mainly come from its production cost um so during its production bacteria are used these bacteria used are called collagens and they mainly come from sugar or lipids these bacterias are first grown with nutrients such as carbon nitrogen sulfur and salt and after they're grown they undergo fermentation with unbalanced conditions which means not enough nutrients in order to produce ph weight within themselves for storage of carbon and energy and afterwards pha is being extracted and purified so in order to reduce price of pha two process within the production can be tackled the first one is we can choose cheaper carbon substrate to reduce the cost of biosynthesis in addition to sugar we can use plant oil instead such as soybean palm or corn oil in addition pha can also be produced using waste streams solid waste and sludge other than the carbon substrate used to produce pha we can also tackle the extraction process the extraction process contributes to 30 to 50 of total production cost of pha in order to increase the yield and potentially decrease the cost we can use non-ionic surfactants as pre-treatment to extraction of pha this would increase the recovery yield of pha and it will provide a comparable yield as using chlorinated solvents besides um cost reducing technology to produce biomim plastic material other innovations exist in the industry they're trying to produce cheaper plastic replacement um two case studies will be discussed here the first one is ubq and the second one is neolite technologies so ubq provide a biodegradable plastic replacement called uvq material and the way um they reduce cost is that the patented modular conversion system they invented can convert any residual municipal solid waste into ubq material as the solid waste is an ever-growing and cheaper source um the ubq company even promised that their client would not pay up any more than their existing resin if they convert to ubq material currently ub2 materials being used by mcdonald's as their trades and central virginia waste management authority in the u.s also purchased ubq made recycling beans in addition neolite technologies per develop a material called air carbon air carbon is a pha based thermoplastic so um there uh new life technologies developed a microorganism based bio catalyst that provide nine times higher polymer conversion yield than previous conversion technology from methane to pha so the way they reduce cost is by increasing yield of the conversion rate and currently air carbon is being used in footwear as well as fashion industry besides the direct cut the direct cost reducing solutions in order to have uh lower cost production and and also increasing yields i also suggest other indirect ways to mitigate the cost burden of biopolis companies the first one is companies could target customers higher willingness to pay for it more environmentally um and green products um and the customers high willingness to pay for these kind of products are being researched in many papers as listed in the presentation um in addition to that companies could also create market opportunities through educating its customers and collaborating with its customers for example one um clang in clay and others in germany researched on participants um preference for bio-based apparel and they found that out of the participants only 12 of them had experience with bioplastics while previous experience with bioplastics would improve increase their preference for bio-based apparel therefore we can see the importance of educating the customers and more exposure of bioplastic products to customers is needed here in addition isles and others was researching on sustainable business models for chemical companies they also argue that reducing costs and increasing yields are not enough to secure success of bioplastics um out of the case studies they conducted dupont from u.s um in order to identify potential applications and customer meets of the bioplastics they produce they communicated with their downstream manufacturers in order to do that in addition they created eco label as a device for downstream manufacturers to show their consumers the materials ecological values in order to boost cells um in order uh other than that i think ielts also suggested that companies could monitor bioplastic improvement and communicate the progress to societies so we can see the importance of educating customers and collaborating in order to achieve more market opportunities and largest market and eventually reach economies of scale and indirectly reduce costs yeah so that's an overview of my research and here's the conclusion thank you so much for listening and i'm really and i'm open to any questions thank you please unmute if you have a question nice job youngling uh this is brian um what do you think is the prospects for ubq actually becoming an important competitor in the plastic market places like mcdonald's yeah absolutely um ubq is an israeli company and they're trying to enlarge your market in the u.s i think um they are developing many applications of their of the ubq material um in order to enlarge its market so i think application it's a really important um more application is the more market opportunities they would have i think currently the cost for ubq material is already because they have been achieving lower cost based off of cheaper raw material the only thing they need to achieve is economies of skill if they can produce ubq material in a larger bulk so if that's the case then they would really be able to reduce their price and appeal to more customers thanks thank you so we have a question from the audience from grace um whether your thesis will be available and the answer is yes anna has created a spectacular website in in the college website with all the thesis from previous years and we will proudly add the thesis from these eight amazing honor students this fall semester as well and so you can have an idea of what a deliverable looks like and also add some of the power point presentations with your permissions we'll ask that afterwards if that's okay with you all
