 From AI to blockchain..., technology is advancing rapidly and nurturing new businesses. The Korea International Trade Association released a report on five new sectors that will be a driving force this year and beyond. Kim Hyesung gets us better acquainted with the selected industries. Cyber security, smart healthcare, new industries in energy, eco-friendly new materials and connected cars. The Korea International Trade Association says these are the top five new industries to watch for 2019. According to the report released Wednesday, the market for global cyber security is expected to grow to 146 billion U.S. dollars by 2020 on the need for personal data protection and the wider use of biometric recognition systems and blockchain technology. This year, the smart healthcare and new energy industries are expected to grow to 172 billion and 143 billion dollars. "The smart healthcare industry has been growing annually by double digits on average since 2015 as smart wearable healthcare devices become more diverse and accurate. Of course, companies are also investing heavily in new technology like health-related AI... as the healthcare industry itself grows along with the aging population." KITA also said that as governments and consumers become more environmentally conscious, they're emphasizing new energy and eco-friendly new materials... and that companies are investing in efficient methods of energy storage and in developing biodegradable plastics. As the fifth key industry, KITA pointed to connected cars, which use sensors and 5G connectivity to optimize operation, maintenance and the convenience of passengers. The report says the connected car industry is expected to grow from 65 billion U.S. dollars last year to 100 billion dollars by 2020, and says Korean companies in particular can cash in on the industry through further development of the 5G network and driverless car technologies.
