 welcome to Mali people matter my name is Marie Jenson and I am the strategy manager at Imperial Tech 4sight I will be your host for this afternoon we have an exciting event ahead of us there and there are there are three academics waiting to share their research today if you're looking in from the UK the session will run till midday so this is the last of a series of three sessions for tech for say 2014 exploring the theme of intentional creations it is a virtual conference where we have looked at how we can reframe technology and scientific breakthroughs for good and create a course for positive technological futures as in parallel - London this is close to our hearts as we constantly work towards applying scientific discovery for the benefit of society in this session we have explored and will explore the future through the lens of cutting-edge research insights from world leading academics across the college the virtual conference started two weeks ago with meta motivations last week we covered moral machines and today we will look at malleable matter it has been a bold thing and we have covered areas such as self-governing AI building frugal sensing technologies to biodiversity resilience this is the last Thursday of the event and we have been excited to inspire you and others to think differently about the future the event has been brought to you by Imperial business partners a bespoke executive platform for global industry clients who want to have an accelerated access to Imperial College London and our visionary ecosystem of startups academic students and facilities as a platform it gives clients a unique approach to problem solving for research driven industries creating access to meeting expertise talents and facilities as well as insights like today but for today it's all about malleable matter and in this session we will explore how new materials can disrupt industries from energy to wearables to automotive to architecture what if our clothes could charge our phones what if batteries were safe and completely recyclable what if our materi became stronger to mitigate against impact what if we could actually program them to behave like biology advanced materials and new developments could be the answers to these questions malleable matter might be the future today we'll explore how material science could unleash a new wave of positive disruption creating the better tomorrow so enough of me I want to introduce you to the first speaker of the day dr. olla HEC Suleman is a faraday institution and venereal fellow in the Department of materials here at Imperial College London she's the co-founder a Solva tech a start-up leading the commercialization of green technology for LED recovery from used batteries her research goes beyond this and today she will share her future vision of the battery revolution where new material science can be combined with ethics and sustainability I would now like to pass you on to Ola excellent good morning again everyone Thank You Maria for your kind introduction it's a it's a real real pleasure to be here as you as you said already indeed I'm an entrepreneurial fellow I think your college on this and I'm also a co-founder and the CEO of solar tech an imperial spin-out company that is focused on battery recycling but first and foremost I am a battery scientist my journey started in the late 2000s just when the first Tesla Roadster and iPhone 3G were launched I was then completing my master's project on electrolyte materials for these human batteries these were very exciting times for battery researchers and I personally wanted to be part of this rapidly evolving field fast forward to 2020 yesterday's future is today's present Lisa my own batteries are part of our everyday life and today we have over 170 models of the electric vehicles available on the market at this point in time we anticipate that the next technological milestones will include charging batteries within seconds driving our electric vehicles forever thousand miles and flying electric cars and for myself I continued pursuing an academic career and worked with some truly visionary scientists at the forefront of battery technology however while conducting fundamental research it can be very exciting it is not uncommon to lose sight of the bigger picture the demands release you mind batteries is growing exponentially but where their raw materials coming from what is the product impact on the economy environment and on society is all of this sustainable mining processing and recycling of battery materials in a sustainable way is critical for our ability to scale with on our planet in society I felt it was time for me to broaden the scope of my research and I became increasingly interested in the entire ecosystem of these human batteries specifically I was curious to learn how spent batteries are being handled at their end-of-life until recently recycling of lithium-ion was virtually non-existent there were no major recycling plants and hardly any scientific research the R&D was purely about making the mattress cheaper lighter and more efficient considering how little oil has become so widespread and popular I was surprised to learn that very low effort has been directed toward solving least human end-of-life issues so about two years ago I started looking for comparable examples of battery recycling and I came across lead acid batteries these would be your typical 12-volt batteries which can be found in every internal combustion engine car interestingly enough not many people would know that lead acid batteries are also used in every state-of-the-art hybrid and electric vehicle unlike with lithium-ion batteries there is not much hype around lead-acid technology mainly because it's been on the market for about the century what is remarkable about this technology however is that 99% of these batteries are being collected and recycled at their end-of-life in addition all components of lead acid batteries can be recycled and reused in a new battery did you know that 80% of your new car battery is made of recycled materials this is outstanding not only when compared to other battery technologies but also in comparison to any other recyclable product their recycling rates exceed those of paper glass or aluminum cans making lead acid batteries the most recycled consumer product in the world this is thanks to various factors the infinite recycle bility of lead the cost of raw materials the simplicity of the product and the enforcement of environmental regulation this market is considered a perfect example for circular economy but it is not free from issues and challenges we all know that LED is highly toxic exposure to lead affects all organs in the body and often causes irreversible health issues long-term exposure to light can be associated with cognitive impairment behavioral problems lower IQ increased societal by violence and lower life expectancy today human exposure to light comes primarily from informal recycling of lead acid batteries in low and middle income countries and it is estimated that up to 30% of children around the world might be suffering from lead poisoning for that reason in formal light recycling is considered the most polluting industrial process in the world the existing method of recycling of lead acid batteries includes crushing separation of materials and snap a smelting is a high temperature combustion process than at 1100 centigrade and it is the most energy intensive and polluting stacking the whole recycling process it is also the most expensive step because if if it's done properly it may cost companies up to 40% of their annual expenditure just to comply with environmental regulations at present there is no industrial recycling process on the market that is both cheap and environmentally friendly with that in mind my colleagues and I have developed an alternative method to smelting we do not reinvent the wheel so to speak but rather take out the most expensive the most energy intensive and the most polluting part of the process and we replace it with our low-temperature solvent based technology this new method allows recyclers to avoid this melting step in its essence our patent-protected technology is using a special type of solvents called d protective solvents we use them to recovery let friedlin use lead acid batteries the protective solvents are composed of low costs easily available and benign chemicals such as ethylene glycol they have a low environmental impact and are easy and safe to handle most importantly they have the ability to dissolve a wide range of lead compounds including components of use led acid batteries which are otherwise difficult to dissolve or are even insoluble in other liquid media our process is solvent based so we produce significantly less hazardous air pollutants during the process we also significantly reduce co2 emissions which together makes led recycling more environmentally friendly we also move from snorting at 1,100 degrees to temperatures as low as room temperature which reduces energy consumption and makes the entire process much cheaper than smelting we also faster because we require fewer steps to produce LED products that can be used in Newland acid batteries as I said there is no LED recycling process in the market that is both cheap and environmentally friendly but our technology has potential to address this environmental societal and economic issue to fully maximize impact of our research at impure my colleagues and I decided to set up solar tech SP nota spin-out company dedicated to the commercialization of this technology we work very closely with established industrial partners recycling experts and our future customers to meet commercial requirements and this is very exciting part of the journey for our team because it gives us an opportunity to look at our process beyond the laboratory scale we analyze the economics of our process or we develop the solvent recovery system to minimize the production of chemical waste currently the technology is at the prototyping stage and once the model is proven at industrial scale the technology will be deployed worldwide and while this is already greatly exciting the future is even more interesting it is widely recognized that climate change is the most serious and threatening global environmental problem one of the ways this challenge can be addressed is by transition to a carbon neutral economy and an increasing number of countries and organizations are already targeting Net Zero emissions by 2050 or even earlier from a wider economy perspective this can be done for example by moving away from fossil fuels to electricity generated from renewable energy sources such as wind hydropower or biomass another option is reduction of greenhouse emissions generated by our transport system EVs are a great option for reducing our car footprint in comparison to standard petrol or diesel engines electric vehicles market grow steadily in the last few years reaching sales of 2.5 million years in 2019 which is slightly less than 3% of total vehicle sales however the real take off for EVs is expected to happen from the second half of the 2020s when electric cars are expected to become cheaper to earn the internal combustion engine models the electric vehicle revolution is responsible for surging battery demand today the size of this union market is driven by expansion of the plug-in hybrid and electric vehicle market the increasing demand for these human cells is met with an increasing number of Giga factories which are built around the world once the battery market moved to the economies of scale we started to observe the drop in battery prices this as the result makes the electric vehicles more affordable which then further increases demand for batteries this spectacular success of batteries and electric vehicles is expected to continue for the next two decades this unprecedented demand can be only compared with the demand for oil in the 1910s and 1920s one could ask them if batteries are the new oil however this success also puts an enormous strain on the entire supply chain to meet this demand we will need to produce more and more batteries but we only have a finite amount of resources if we continued expansion at this speed we will soon run out of raw materials such as lithium or Cobalt therefore the real question here should be our batteries the new oil or the new plastic the answer to this question is around sustainability we have to build the system our sustainability map felici mind batteries and we have to build it now and we all have a role to play here starting from us material scientists engineers car manufacturers regulators all the way to all of us consumers we can contribute to making batteries more sustainable for the last few minutes I will share with you how we material scientists address this problem first and foremost we shall make our battery safer more efficient and last longer for the first example I've chosen a material that is responsible for making battery headlines in the last few weeks it is a cattle material called NMC which stands for Lisa manganese cobalt oxide these materials have a layered crystal structure which allows a facile intercalation and the inter collection of lithium ions are in charge in this charge of the battery the original layered material here was leasing cobalt oxide and it was successfully used early on in small portable electronics however cobalt is more expensive and less abundant than other transition metals cobalt also presents political and ethical issues because of the way it is minding hunger as a result cheaper cuts have been developed to substitute some of the cobbled with nickel and manganese these are used in the majority of lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles and it's done due to their high specific capacity ease of production and moderate cost the material I want to mention to you is MMC 5 3 2 where 5 3 & 2 corresponds to atomic ratios between nickel manganese and cobalt it was produced as a single crystal unlike other cutted materials which are typically polycrystalline this made MMC 532 extremely resistant to oxygen loss from the crystal structure and as a result we see my himself with NMC 5 3 to have an exceptional performance in terms of cycle life this new batteries would last for over 16 years and over million miles this work was done by well Jeff Dunn and his group from Dalhousie University in Canada Jeff is also known for his close collaboration with Tesla which announced that they will be implementing a game-changing battery technology later this year another example of making batteries more sustainable would be solid-state batteries in that case an organic flammable electrolyte in graphite based Island would be replaced with a ceramic electrolyte analyse humanist metal on earth this would increase the range of the battery and address the safety concerns currently research efforts are focused on discovery of the most suitable electrolytes that will be mechanically and chemically stable with least metal and they will provide intimate contact with the active catted material upon charge in this charge but actually if it's changing okay great but actually there is a ready a battery technology on the market that works with metallic lithium this is Liam so for battery wear enamel is made of lithium and a cat it comprises elemental sulfur earthly steam and sulfur are extremely extremely light materials delivering high energy batteries this is suitable for applications where weight is critical for example aerospace moreover sulfur costs approximately $200 per ton which is much cheaper than cobalt for example it is also much safer to work with and there are no heavy elements involved which positions this technology strongly on the sustainability scale then we also have to look beyond least human lithium-ion and there is currently a lot of work done towards new chemistry's such as sodium ion or a magnesium iron where materials are cheaper and more abundant and of course the sustainable recycling of batteries at their end of life however this is extremely difficult to establish at this point in time we have a large number of different chemistries on the market and the mental composition of batteries varies greatly and there is no sufficient less legislation in place to determine manufacturing standards collection or recycling but for the time being the crews are in the cost of living cells what are the most valuable components from this breakdown one can see that over 50 percent of battery value is in its cathode materials Nikhil laid him cobalt and manganese not surprising to me the most advanced method of lithium-ion recycling today is pyrometallurgy where batteries are smelted and they produce others of copper cobalt iron and nickel the slag from this process typically contains aluminum manganese elysium which can be reclined by feather hydrometallurgical process but electrolyte plastic and lithium salts are usually lost in the process despite environmental drawbacks high energy costs and the limited number of matures reclaimed during pyrometallurgy this is a frequently used process to reclaim high-value transition metals such as cobalt or nickel hydrometallurgy involves the use of APIs solution to leach metals from carted materials typically sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide subsequently metals go through precipitation reactions to recover cobalt and lithium or transition metals or nmz the big issues to be addressed with all hydro metallurgical processes are the volumes of solvent required the speed of the nomination the cost of neutralization and the likelihood of cross contamination of materials and direct recycling involves removal of cathode or anode material from his battery followed by reconditioning and reuse in a remanufactured battery for example after dismounting use batteries cutter strips could be delaminating in a solvent powders could be recovered and regenerated and lesion content could be replenished and compensated for losses during batteries and finally biology it's a matter of English bacteria are harnessed to recover valuable metals such as cobalt and or nickel this is a relatively new method but has a successful but has been successfully used in the mining industry and it can be potentially complementary to pyro in highly mature metallurgical processes on this slide I just want to share with you work published recently in nature energy where deeper Technic solvents were used to successfully recover Leeson cobalt oxide from useless lithium-ion batteries with efficiencies as high as 99% similarly to our work with lead acid they also showed that it is possible to recover in the solvents so how will this sustainable back to market will look in 2014 EVs will make up the majority of new car sales worldwide but we shall be prepared to be using a taxes program for every tear factory there will be a terror recycling plant our batteries will be made from recycled materials and if it's not possible from materials that will be ethically sourced we will have a range of battery technologies with Deric chemistry's optimized for different applications whether it is transferred stationary energy storage or wearable electronics the battery cells PACs and modules will be designed to enable efficient disassembly separation of components and material recovery legislation wise there will be strict regulations about who is responsible for battery recycling new ownership models will be in place for example we may only lease that easy battery pack from a car manufacturer and they will determine whether the batteries will be repurposed at the end of life or recycled and finally coming back to lead recycling I hope our technology will become a global standard for lead recycling and we will eliminate less pollution because it doesn't matter whether it is 30% or 0.3 percent no children should be suffering from lead poisoning hopefully the stock highlighted for you how important sustainability in energy storages either these are LED acid or these human batteries and what are the risk for not preparing for it at the end of the day it is our responsibility either as academics or Imperial business partners to build a better world after the comet 19 crisis a world that is cleaner more sustainable more energy efficient and more respectful of deployment thank you very much thank you so much for your talk it was really insightful especially thought it was interesting to hear how we might in the future even share the way we see the ownership around batteries so putting more of a responsibility perhaps on the car manufacturers so I have a couple of questions that have come in from the audience ahead of this event so the first one is to me envisage to solvent-based recycling technology to be adopted to the point of use for example could we see battery or cycling or refurbishment being done in high street shops or maybe by consumers themselves oh I'm a chemist so my first answer will be don't try this at home but so actually the solvents that we are using they're really benign they're not dangerous some of the other components are used as food additives so I'm not concerned about this too much but batteries themselves either let us add batteries or lithium ion batteries they are made of toxic materials and definitely nobody who's not qualified shall not try to try to play with it they're also dangerous because especially with Lisa my own batteries what encapsulated inside are volatile organic son of all solvents so we really have to be careful however I do kind of get the point of trying to distribute points of recycling at the moment especially for I can speak about lettuces recycling it's dominated by communist kale so there are very few recycling plants so for example in the u.s. there are only so imagine about all this let us at Uslan acid batteries traveling by car - there is some good thing and there's a question that's come in from the audience today that's a little bit connected to this and so once you anticipate being the biggest challenge and getting battery recyclers to ditch smelting and move to solve the tech instead do you think there will be much inertia to overcome it's interesting I think it will be regulations so we have constantly tightening environmental regulations and that's for good reasons and if I have to say there are several companies that are interesting changing to green solutions if it's possible obviously we have to improve their economic economic oh but if companies have choice you have people behind companies and they do care about environment they do want to do the right thing and especially and disappointed with regulations I think where is a change coming so do you think then so what do you think is the biggest challenge at the moment for them moving to you to solve the tech instead is that changing the good I think we're just too small and we're not ready yet if we were ready tomorrow that would be great but we're a small start-up start trying to grow for me but actually for phylidia my own market its legislation and there is no clarity what happens with human batteries what happens with the batteries from our farms and then very shortly we'll have an issue with all the she's coming from vehicles so we have to address it and Nick reamer has asked the solver tech have a solution for lithium ion batteries today I know you shared a little bit of research at the end can you share a little bit more we are working on this and that's definitely the next thing that we're going to be involved and we're I'm finding institution intrapreneurial fellow and fire institution is the biggest funding body for for funding energy storage research in the UK and we are strong on this there is a strong recycling project going on so if you want to check it out just going fantastic and it's almost like watch this space with solve attack as well and so another question from James here is is there a standard or a potential basis for one which could be made law which should be used or met for batteries in the circular economy oh so there are so many it's difficult there is no one there are European Union regulations so its end-of-life directive new stuff is being revised now and European Union is trying to capture all different technologies in there so so hopefully there will be standards there will be also local Sanders standards in the UK and then the market itself I know about companies that are outside European Union but they their business partners are in here so they want to comply with these regulations even though they're not recorded do you think there is do you think there is room for better better laws and regulation than around circular economy especially in concerns to Batteries ops because there is no no regulations on this in my hands I think I think we are as consumers we really have to start thinking where is this battery coming from what happens with when I changed my friend I did something that we may not was so I didn't mention the supply chain but for example probably with cobalt is that it might having a fire we might have somehow indirectly contributed to child labor because the cobalt mostly comes from Democratic Republic of Congo and then at the end do we know what happens with our batteries are they they're probably our electronic waste is probably shipped somewhere in Asia and we're looking industry even though on daily basis this isn't something new but we might unknowingly contribute to the problem and I guess it's something that was made even more clear after the the kovat crisis as well around supply chains and making it all in countries therefore like trying to think about ways to decentralize both recycling but also access to batteries so I can also I didn't have time to speak about supply chain but at the moment he was coming for example from Chile nickel is coming from Australia and cold is coming from DRC and they all go to China where the EC maíam cells are produced and it goes to Korea where the car is produced and then it goes to Europe and just by the time you you receive the keys to your electric vehicles imagine the carbon footprint of this there are changes in the market all over the world and also in the European Union and especially there is more focus on this there are things happening and they're having a really fast and I'm really happy so I look forward to those changes in having more transparency and regulations and I think even at this point yogini is considering passports for the materials to actually know where they coming from and where they're going so that's something to to look out for that's really interesting with an increased transparency of materials as well so I think we'll do one more one more question which I'm actually quite keen on understanding a little bit more as well which is another from the Kramer who asks why haven't lithium sulfur batteries been more successful they sounded very promising from your talk ah yes I I was thinking about it again the other day I was like oh well actually they're the risk their life cycle is not as good as for a few million so their life cycle is much shorter maybe not thousand to two thousand charging to discharged our cycles are available so they're really good for shorter shorter use but for very specific applications but also in that's that space there is a lot of research going on and there are companies that are looking into it and it's a very battery sort of very dynamic for sure fantastic thank you so much for sharing your vision on battery battery technologies and the future of the work that you're doing with solve attack these were the customs we have time for now audience remember to continue to send in questions into the Q&A field we'll be able to answer some of them in the roundtable discussion at the end of the session another expert in advanced materials is dr. fleet CTC he's a lecturing TD materials and wearable bio electronics in the Department of Chemistry here at Imperial College London and leads the group wearable electronics with 2d materials for the particular focus on energy son saying wearable electronics and bio electronics today he will share his vision on the future of wearables and how a new humble material might get smart turn I now want to hand you over to dr. flooey Tracy who will share his vision for the next era of wearables Thank You Maria for the introduction I'm going to share my my presentation I hope you can see that yeah so indeed today I'm going to present a new idea to enable real step forward in the array of wearable electronics and the idea of course is to start from what we think of wearables nowadays so we always think of wearables as gimmicks for example that you know there are similar watches we can wear them around our wrist and they are good at measuring some of our body properties for example the heart rate of course you can get for example number of steps you've been running on a day however statistics shows that normally people get bored with these type of devices like Fitbit or watches after a couple of weeks actually there are statistics from gardeners showing that after six months people tend to actually stop using these devices simply because they are limited in what they can do and also they're not really reliable and eventually actually the key problem is that they're not truly wearable so if we look instead what indeed on what wearable devices are nowadays they are similar to watches most of them and we can define them really as essentially the standard rigid electronics miniaturized and combined into a mix of interconnections sensors light-emitting devices transistors but they keep probably limiting this technology from actually being really up scaled and also really hosted in several other wearable devices or wearable elements by clothes is the fact that they are definitely not breathable and needed stretchable so the key problem there to enable of course these devices to be more incorporated is to start tackling those those issues so what if we could actually make devices that are for example really conformable to our body so we can think for example at you know elements or a train components that really take the shape of our body for example you look at the English there you can see a truly wearable glove that for example could teach us how to play piano what if we could think of devices that actually are directly interconnected to our clothes and naked for example provide us information as we move around in an in city or even more importantly reliably monitoring our body parameters and giving us information on our health state very mind this becomes extremely important in a post fun dynamic setting by the one we are living now actually we are still living the pandava that will become even more important afterwards when you would really like to keep vulnerable patients outside hospitals while still keep monitoring their body parameters and this has to be done of course in a reliable way so the research in this field in my case really started by looking at the wearable computer concepts in the 50s so the left hand side shows what they meant by that essentially it was a miniaturized television that you know you can wear like pair of goggles with a couple of antennas and there was nothing but essentially showing TV channels but it could be worn on a sort of shape of glasses so of course if we move towards 2020 we have improved a little bit of Technology but still we have we call wearables or we think we are the forefront of wearables when we combine wearable garments or or light gloves together with rigid electronics or metallic wires or interconnections and these are connected to batteries so therefore of course I'm going to really call all these systems wearables and particularly it could be hard integral hardly integrated with our current codes so if we need to enable really wearable devices we need them to really look like something that we want cool on our body for a long time so definitely they need to be stretchable stretchability is a key element because of course you want your your garments or your wearable devices to conform to the stretch of our skin for example being really comfort comfortable over time of course if you want to wear them for a long time they need to be low power so far is really important so designing simple and low-power devices that could be integrated and stretchable it's it's it's key in this technology conformability links up to stretch ability but particularly the ability to really follow the shades and the changing shapes of the body breathability is very important particularly looking at devices that need to stay in contact with our skin for a longer time to avoid for example inflammation or developing of Chris skin diseases they need to be easy to integrate with clothes simply because clothes are DVD garments the element that we the item that we were regularly every day so of course if you want to make things wearable this the way forward is actually to improve weave ability so integration by weaving for example with clothes or somehow touching for example with the existing clothes and last but not least wash ability because of course this links up also to the funny you can reuse the devices many times so if you can enable these wearable systems to be washable or at least water resistance you can wash them together with your clothes and you can reuse them as a remote server several times to do that the current technology is not feasible so we need new materials and that's what I start looking in into more recently so of course I focus on textile because essentially we already know that textile for wearables is an ideal material it takes all the boxes of you know the requirements I've showed you before it is breathable it is highly stretchable its washable and also it conforms well to our skin indeed we we keep wearing and wear it regularly so of course textile is a great starting substrate and we know that textiles can be also modified for example using standard dyeing processes the fact is that of course these dyeing processes mostly rely with solution based approaches of course at least water and also we need to consider that this fabrics need to be washable as well so I start looking at new materials that can help me in actually tackling this point wild for example providing functional properties that go beyond for example pigment of color so of course I started investigating a material that I'm very familiar with I've been working 12 years on graphene and 2d materials so graphene we know it very well particularly since 2010 we won the Nobel Prize than the huge investments from the European Union on the graphene flagship projects trying to really move this technology from the lab into the market graphene by definition is a 2d material so it's an atomically thin material made of carbon and it's called a an arrangement that looks like a honeycomb shape on a comp like and essentially being very thin and also biocompatible it's actually very suitable as a material to enable smart and frank functions indeed is got many positive features for wearable electronics it is definitely very transparent being very thin it is conducting it's actually quite stretchable up to 25% stretch ability it is environmentally stable there's been a lot of results over the couple of years really showing biocompatibility of these devices and in this material so this becomes really extremely important element to enable truly wearable devices and the good thing of graphene is that it really leads a family of 2d materials it can be extracted for example from layered materials by various processes I've been leading leading for example research into solution based approach to do that and these materials offer different properties different electronic and optoelectronic properties that are mostly complementary to graphene so if you can consider graphene as for example your electrode these 2d materials could be semiconductors or insulators so essentially they are really a good platform for wearable electronics and this has already been demonstrated with devices going from touchpad for example to haptic interfaces to energy storage elements or super capacitors using graphene as electrodes even to for example light emitting devices or opto electronic devices and you can imagine that all these devices enabled already with these much on a non conformal inflexible substrates have been already the basis for for example new types of health trackers and also well-being devices there is a free really a key promise there however if we want to integrate these into texels we need to make inks and dispersions and that's where I really my research has been leading this field because I looked at exfoliating for example 2d material starting from there materials either in solution using for example for shear forces generated by various processes starting from the simple transonic processes to a very complex and high-yield market realization process that allows us to get up to ten liters per day so you have very large production of their fittings and these graph innings are highly loaded off to the materials for example and it could be of course used to make electronic devices for example through printing as I said this concept is is very general it could be extended to the family of layered materials and indeed you can come up with a large range of inks made with these 2d materials again bringing over the same properties that they had at the origin so semiconducting insulating an electric and electrically conducting properties so these then become a key platform for a new range of printed electronics that can enable truly wearable and electronic text cells this has already been demonstrated for example to enable flexible organic light-emitting devices or flexible printed transistors I leave it for example touch screen and even in smart windows so my idea is to see whether these things can actually be incorporated into textiles using already already industrial it scalable industrially relevant printing processes or fabric like for example screen printing or inkjet printing and this of course requires a technology that enables these devices to be deposited and adhesive to those substrate so essentially making washable so I focus my attention on designing adhesion processes of graphene and 2d material things and fabric in order to enable fully printed devices on various fabrics so for example you can look at these for example fully printed keyboards that actually resembles an integrated circuit so you have pads interconnections batteries locked we have speakers and then you have an interaction with a motherboard it actually control the entire device but at the same time you can actually consider to directly print for example external communication devices like antennas for example waveguides and this can be just enabled by graphing so of course I'm gonna show you step-by-step how you can improve Cris the functionality on fabric including also the other tuning materials so to improve the adhesion I started looking at standard fabric for example cotton fabric that is very well now of course in the wearable industry and I try to gently modify this fabric this is a very criminal process for example done for dyeing creating a thin layer of positive charges by a cationic modification and then I took my graphing and I again modified in order to show negative charges so as you can imagine here negative charges and positive charges strongly attached to each other strongly adhere to each other so actually we have an electrostatic interaction that improves strongly the adhesion of for example our graphing on a standard fabric then I took my negatively charged graphene ink and for example I formulated for being printed by inkjet printing so here you're looking at a single drop generated by an injured printer nozzle and this car is a very consistent and controllable amount of graphene that you can deposit regularly drop on demand on a substrate so for example this can enable graphene coated fabrics here you can see a comparison between a white cotton fabric in a graphene cotton fabric and then after a an ironing process that is commonly used for example in textile you can actually have a uniform and strongly a d-ring thin film on top of our fabric that looks at the cross-section of the fabric and here you can see actually the top view there is a thin coating on top of the fabric where you can actually see the continent fibers underneath so this is a key technology to improve of course the additional sub-tree and enabling of first wash ability indeed these devices result washable up to 20 times with standard washing procedures with ISO standards so this means that we can enable for example truly textile action these kids cotton textile wearable devices initially I started using this graphene cotton fabric as a motion sensor for example I start looking at the uniaxial and by actual monitoring of the wrist position using for example strain change and compression and this allows to have a constant and very robust way of monitoring the position of our wrist as a function of a change in resistance but of course this can be even further improved we have an IP on this for using it as a pressure sensor so that's a key point because for example it enables to make sleeves or parts of garments smart and actually interacting through for example any attachment but of course we want to move beyond simple touch devices so we start really looking at the opportunities for these new technology into ECG electronic healthcare application so we use for example these graphene textile electrodes and compare them with standard ECG electrodes you might know ECG electrodes there are rigid electrons that normally are placed on top of the skin they are made normally silver silver chloride and what we did we compared it with graphene textile electrodes and surprisingly but extremely importantly we can actually get extract exactly the same ECG signal you woulda struck with silver silver chloride electrodes with actually a resolution to spot all these pqrst Peaks typical obesity and very important for example to the medical staff with a big difference that these devices are the graphene electrodes are actually stretchable biocompatible and washable and they work a low resistance of low power consumption this is also very important because around 20% of the patients actually content that will standard ECG because their skin gets irritated after long time exposure to the to the electrodes so this really enables the extra percentage of patients to really get these treatments it wouldn't get otherwise we also want to go beyond standard electrodes we really want to enable truly electronics on Texas removing any rigid component and to do that of course we use scalable printing processes like in Jeff reading and we combine the three power of our platform of 2d materials in this case we printed polymer electrodes and then a layer of boron nitride which is an insulating to the metal is a solid dielectric another layer of graphene has an active channel and we fully print a transistor directly on a fabric and actually a combination of these transistors enables integrated circuits directly on a textile fully printed without rigid electronics in it here for example you can see a symbol combination single combination of two transistors to form an inverter which is actually a simple logic element of for example a microprocessor or a microcontroller so you can see a lot of one and zeros here and that really shows that these devices can be used actually to replace rigid electronics directly on textile so here essentially you can imagine a piece of fabric with a little bit of printing that actually acts as an electronic circuits and it does the job of it of course as I said biocompatibility is also very important because if these devices need to sit on our skin or even in the future being implanted into our body for a long time they need to avoid creating being toxic and creating first information so initially we start looking at the how neurons for exactly for example survive over a graphene surface so here you can see a graphene electrode and then a network actually of neurons that initially these were just single neural neuronal cells they actually create and replicate on top of the graphene substrate and create a network so this type network actually allows them to to come in to talk to each other and talk to the first creates enacting synapse in interaction for example activating in information transfer so this is a key result because it shows that graphene is not only a good sign inert substrate actually promotes of first growth of biomaterial biofilms in general and more recently similar results have been shown for example with myocardial cells and different terms of also skin cells so these definitely shows together with other 2d materials their potential also in by electronics and biocompatibility and particularly it opens up to devices actually entire laboratories they could be from town in your into a piece of textile and that's what we are working on at the moment we are trying to design a SmartWatch which is entirely made of textile and actually can incorporate on a cotton fabric an absorbing pad that for example take interstitial fluids ah sweat and it conveys towards an array of electrodes that perform multiple raising readings on different analytes trying to discriminate for example concentration or different targeted molecules this is extremely important because we can already print of course our transistor raise on cotton fabric and we can modulate and modify to be selective to specific for example analyze we have already done this for printed graphene field effect transistors for HIV and for HPV and talking about viruses you can understand how important this is as a wearable fire sensors for new virus for example in a pandemic period you can think of integrated the integrating is printer devices for example on a fabric of a face mask and being able to monitor actually the presence of viral agents directly on the face month this is important for example for contact tracing particularly on a post pandemic period when you really want to monitor the contagious an infection from the population more interesting we have worked we have worked more recently on a textile based display so this is a very recent work we try to combine the graphene electrons together with terminal chromic elements and actually by using printing technology and UV induction to actually cure our terminal chronic ink we're able actually to show specific images directly on a textile and at the same time we can use also a graphene electrons to enable light emission by for example a combination of several 2d materials the big advantage here is that we have a fast switching on a piece of textile so this piece of textile can really work as a display with no rigid components with a very fast switching so this please really because this is going to become a very important technology in the future indeed in a short term what I feel what I foresee could happen is definitely enabling light emitting fabric without standard rigid for example light emitting devices enabling entirely textile based displays or even textile based sensor for example Google project record is already thoroughly working into integrated sensors touch pads but I think that the incorporation of different technologies together can be enabled through for example 2d materials this can bring for example two less screens and more integrated surfaces of you know large panels made of fabric also more intuitive interaction improving our into interface with the outer world as well as for example extending the gaming experience party beautiful smart blobs or also smart vision this becomes on a short-term also important to create a so-called concept of body area network more looking at for example healthcare applications integrating power generators with sensors different type of sensors to that for example interconnected via wireless type of devices this can definitely improve for example the invisible monetary highly needed as I said to keep patients away from the hospital well keep monitoring them thoroughly when they are really vulnerable and also for example tracking specific invisibly specific body parameters that are indicators for example for infections for specific diseases being developed and of course in the midterm range are looking at more integrated and responsive devices that for example could also being more stretchable and integrated with with our body so for example the idea of smart contact lenses of bio patches they could be also implanted for example with the skin contact lenses have a advantage of being directly in contact with body fluids so you can use them not only for example for drug delivery also to improve our vision capabilities for example you can improve the night vision you can extend the the visible range of humans by improving the IR range and getting into for example night vision just by a contact lens at the same time you can also think of adjusting at the site and over a longer range I see more and more becoming important the concept of bio electronics so the electronics which is really interacting with our living electrodes which for example our neurons like for example integration of nano materials or nano machines or or for example 2d materials directly into our body not only for drug delivery but also as a sensing elements using for example wireless interconnection because of their for example resonation with light or internationally specific terms for example wavelengths as well as direct interaction of biocompatible electrons and our tissues for example here you can see a project we are working on at the moment where we're actually using biocompatible fibers that are in contact directly within the brain surface this is the dura mater so the dura mater is the inner part of our skull and underneath that you have the the crust of the of the brain and if you can actually improve this interaction that really needs to intimate very intimate contact of biocompatible elements made of 2d materials with for example our body so my vision is not only to improve the quality of wearable technology actually to look at a new way of improving our interaction with the external world for example enhancing it thanks to these devices and this doesn't need to be thought out for example creating ethical issues because of course that can be designed around a framework of ethics to work with this however it's a possibility it's a new technology that is well exploited can really really gives a lot of advantage and leverage for example towards the next challenges without coming and we can already see that coming forward to us thank you very much for your time thank you very much and Feliz it's been it's been great to hear it hear your presentation I would definitely love to have a haptic screen in some way printed on my clothes especially now when we're all getting a little bit fatigued of our our displays so there's comment there's coming quite a few questions from the audience I think we should have a loving question so we see how many we can get through now so the first one is do you think that electronic wearables will end up like smart watches as the statistic you showed at the start of the presentation the people simply stop using them after six months well I think that the problem with the what the technology the first generation is a technology that we have at the moment is really limited in what it can do maybe indeed it found a an area of commercial application in these gimmicks as we said at the beginning type of familiar devices well definitely you can get meaningful information and sometimes they're not useful information if you want to use that spectrum of devices for example in hospital setting or in care homes it's really doubtful that you can really rely constantly on the information those devices give you and this brings me back to the fact that because you can't reuse them and you can't rely on them for you know for very important processes like I would say societal key societal aspects that becomes a big limitation so I think in general the fact that people get bored is because there's a limited and doubtfully reliable expectance form those type of devices future wearables if one address actually can be a game-changer hmm and I guess it's a bit different putting on a t-shirt compared to putting on a a watch or a thing and it's quite cumbersome the form factor is very important indeed are you working with fashion designers as well to to make your clothes attractive to the consumer you don't want to look all your clothes because some of these things are not only clothes focus is actually you know if you're looking at healthcare fashion becomes less relevant however yes we do where we have interaction with the Royal College of Arts in London we're also working with clothing companies so we had another question coming in saying can you foresee covert sonic attacks being monitored via wearables biosensors with information sent to secret services I'm not sure really understanding the question so information being captured and shared to see the services yes exactly through biosensors through biosensors well I think this is the common issue where big data I think the way so this I think it doesn't really rely on how data collected because biosensors would enable you a new way of collecting data for example being able to reliably collect data from your body which at the moment maybe you can't wear wearable devices but then the way these this information is data are shared it really depends on how good is the framework shielding these data from actually being shared with you know unwanted entities I mean it could be secret services it could be anything so for example as I said at the end of my talk a good policy framework and also ethics framework is very important but this doesn't really need to stop us from developing a technology as you know as I was telling you they essentially you can make a good comparison with a knife you know every home has a knife and it's really an indispensable a key element in our in our houses so everybody uses to cut bread for example however knife can also be a powerful weapon it depends how you use your tool that defines you know how good and how indispensable they are so if you define a good framework how to use it I can say why not fantastic and we have a question here from Annika Pawnee could a similar sensor be used for glucose monitoring and diabetic patients where a quick and finely tuned response is key of course this is a great question and it all depends on the on the sensitivity of the devices you can develop and on the concentration of glucose in the different media that you are your problem so when skin based devices is very hard because you will rely only Muslims where to moisture from from the skin the concentration is very low this type of device is also very unfortunately at the moment their sensitivity according to the position no it's not really reliable however we are working on micro needle type of devices they can access interstitial fluids so in the underneath layer of the epidemic and in that layer in that region you actually get a much higher concentration of glucose and we think we really think that in the next years we could actually use a similar technology with improvement of micro needles to that so we're truly aware of this problem and we know the way forward fantastic so it's another one that we should watch the space for it or the new work coming out so Ben Lorentz from Kelty says do we also need better base fabrics and textiles to allow the integration of graphene inks or our existing textiles suitable so we're doing our best to make sure that we develop technology that manufacturing processes that of course can be as much as possible integrated not up taken by industry but the problem is that are definitely being a completely new technology you need definitely to think of a way to improve also your substrate or directly your concept of fabric indeed one of the last points that I made is that you can also develop devices on the fiber directly and with it directly in fabric so this will become less disruptive to your fabric but also it would enable to completely change your form factor or your material you wouldn't be using the textile as far as a substrate or you will actually integrate your fiber based electronic device within the wave of your of your fabric so becoming more into in intimate you know with with the fabric and this is very important I think as a future feature step however yes I think there should be an improvement also the substrate similarly to what happened with for example flexible electronics on plastics so with this kind of weaving of that accountings into the fabric we're creating a new type of fabric does that mean but the kind of question of washability where you can only wash it 20 times completely it disappears or what would be the kind of consequences of this so the 20 times is not a barrier I mean the dress keeps working after 20 times but whoever well you what you need to look at is the threshold there is always a threshold that you don't want to go beyond and what we saw in our devices so far is that after 20 washing cycles you go beyond 1% of change of your properties and this of course for electronic device becomes really a tragedy because because even it will change completely your sensitivity response so you don't want that whoever Isis standards are looking at 25 washing cycles at the moment so we're not far from the ISO standards so what I believe is that you know with a little bit of improvement and particularly in working together with industry you know the ISO standards can be easily matched particularly for simple devices like inverters or electrodes so we're not far from that the story might be different for fully integrated systems fantastic and I think we have we can answer one more question and then we need to move on so how feasible is the choice of graphene especially when speaking about mass production so we actually tackle this point already I've been working in 12 years in developing really scalable processes so initially you know it was ultrasonic Asian processes or sheer mixing where very low yield type of processes so they did the job but not feasible for industry and we developed a couple of exfoliation processes one based of the microphone is Asian that enables to produce as I said around 10 litres in a lab setting of course about 10 liters per hour so it's actually a very high concentration a very high yield process as well as electrochemical explanation that really allows in a very simple process to produce to mass produce graphene flakes and also graphene nano platelets so I think the production of graphene per se is not really a barrier at the moment it might be a barrier for other 2d materials particularly sourcing you know all these new 2d materials that now needs to create of course a supply chain and that's a totally different story for graphene per se actually we already have a lot of graphite in the world there is a lot of minds already they're providing very good quality graphite and we can already rely on that so graphing wise they're sorted I think we'll take one more question which hat Rayshawn is Austin I'm actually wondering about as well so can these be recycled easily or is that yet to be established because we talk a lot now about hybrid materials and the issue around recyclability and is this a challenge with these graphing ink textiles so looking just at the graphene ink as I said has been since 2015 there's been a lot of studies showing biocompatibility of the graphene and also when a chemical modification graphene can be easily dissolved so becoming really a biodegradable a lot of examples for this in the graphene flood indeed actually because it was really aware of this issue has set up a specific work package tackling this the problem becomes when you integrate the graphing with your textile in that case the entire system needs to be biocompatible we haven't tackled that side because of course we rely on what textiles are already available so ideally you want to choose actually biocompatible type of textile that's why we use cotton for example at the moment it's definitely much more biocompatible however their receptor there the wash ability tackle is a key part because if you can reuse it briefly definitely you can remove waste if you need to dispose of it every time you for example do your measurement like we do for example with face masks you know where there's non non woven type of face mask every time you use the spot loss because that creates a huge waste so I think if we can improve the wash ability definitely will work towards reduction of waste and so more environmental failures fantastic thank you so much and remember that will speak to Olaf little bit later as well for the final roundtable discussion but thank you so much it brings up really interesting considerations especially considering the next speaker which is a doctor - Tom Thumb he's a lecturer in and engineering alloys and the Department of materials at Imperial College London and he will share his research is creating a new class of artificial materials which can make structures responsive morphing and even sensing he leads a group focusing on programmable multifunctional materials 3d printing and a high-performance metallic alloys for application in aerospace cars power generation and medical devices I now want to invite some to share his vision on meta crystalline materials okay I might okay Mariano for the nice introduction and good afternoon ever saw a good morning everyone I hope you have enjoyed a fantastic course my previous speakers so if this talk I want to show you the new class of materials called meta crystalline materials not only have a very high strength to come in very demanding environment like metals or ceramics but I also have an ability to adapt and evolve like materials created by nature so subscribe to the top can we develop such amazing material as we wish sorry I'm trying to move the next slide here we go yes so the question is how can we develop such amazing materials that's web can learn from from from nature so nature's is fantastic in creating materials that can evolve and take all very nice offer resources to grow and adapt to the changes in environments however most of my logical materials they don't have a high strength like metals or ceramics as I mentioned before to work in very extreme conditions when slow in in in high temperature like in rocket engines so that could be amazing if every like new class of materials they have high strength to work in in very demanding environments but as I have a responsiveness like biological materials that's out friction but actually that makes a lot on on science and before I I said further I want to race that's five challenges we want to meet even went in air blow a material that high-performing but also behaved like nature so the first challenge is we need to be able to program the strength as we as we want we want to get you can mature to get specific strength and it matter when they transform when we want them to have a new strength again and meet the new demands and second challenge is the mature is able to store and communicate information within inside them and they if they want to interact with environment they need to be able to sense and take some action when they take some action then they need to be able to cap a complete computing information and text and some action including the transform motion love to different mythology and when they interact with environment they need to be able to take feedback and able to to sell optimize and learning from their action as well and that the fact challenges we want to set retinue weakening so how how can we do this how can we make it you with very high performance and ability to evolve and adapt to environments that's where we can leverage our expertise and knowledge in two very different approaches one is our dream in developing invisibility clocking materials like an object invisible to the light another is a secret also found in why we develop high strength alloys like in aero engines now look at our dream we want to wear a clock that can make us invisible to the light so now if you look the way why an object visible to the light if we share a light to an object the object can reflect the light and by doing that the object is visible to the light now if you carve an object like a clock and if assume we have ability to engineer the building block inside the clock after like at a length scale of nanometer with the same length as the wavelength of the light and that building block if you arrange them in clever way they will interact with the light and that the light cover out of the object and by doing that they will make object invisible to the light and that's the important thing you need to be able we need able to tailor the building block and if you can able to do that you can get the functionality we want including the programmability and the secret also shared in the way we develop high-performing metals and ceramics if you look at any piece metal friends will you take that from error engine and have a powerful microscope you could see inside metal a metal we have many cranes a priesthood but when you see in this micrograph here to show us different colors represents four different grains and the left of the size of the grain is of the same size at the diameter our humans restaurant and inside each grain that consists of millions of atoms and atoms arranged in very ordered ways that's called crystal lattice first we see here is one example of crystal lattice atoms located at corner and a sad face of a cube and the arrangement attorneys most in most times is still the same however the way the oriented in space is different when when we crossed from one grain to the other grain so that arrangement building block haven't the strength of the alloys and and ceramics and that's not the sacred now if you want to understand further now just take a piece of single crystal and he stretched them and you measure how much stress you need to to pull them apart and how much attention they can bear before they film so that is the station is represented by strength and the force how much force or stress is on the y axis here and it making you see the relationship between stress and strain is linear is similar like when you stretch a sprain we owned a certain point that's good Neil point we see the it'll affect inside the crystal start to move and that caused the loss in strength so we see this drop in strength and that happens repeatedly that lead to very unstable deformation behavior whereas a low strength as well however if ever same specimen but that made my my inaccurate aggregate of crystals you're not so much different you have a higher strength and much you become stronger and stronger in the deformation and the collection of grains that link to the higher strength that's one of the key principle strengthening mechanisms in developing high strength alloy that provides us ability to design any strength we want and that is what we are doing at Imperial College my research group guard guided by the science of metals and also other materials classes as well and we combined with advances in manufacturing Bachelor 3d printing and in other what commonly known as editing and fracturing as well and by my learning from from the way our dream to develop invisibility cloak materials we understand if we are able to design a building block and we arrange arranged to be written block in normal way we can get an artificial crystals that are lightweight because we extract modes which you awake and we can achieve the strength we want and also with the way we manipulate the building block we can make material smarter as well so here's um as I said in Vietnam we need to a chip or we need to meet the fact or address the first challenges the first challenge is ability to program the strength and that's why we learn from the strengthening mechanisms in developing high-performing alloys in here we we designed a building block and we mimic or regret official single crystal and the behavior of single crystal is very much similar to the area of the real natural single crystal and we also see a drop in strength and unstable deformation behavior when we created an artificial poly green crystals you see the meeting formation behavior now is much stable and we can get higher strength and that really depends on the way we arrange the milling block inside the artificial crystal we can get even higher strength everyone's so we can poke around the strength we want and that's the that's the way we can when you can meet the first challenge the second challenge as I mentioned is we but you'll need to be able to store information and communicate information inside them so that is that is the way we go back to the way we designed the hearing block and we arranged the building block in in 3d space first way is this video you see we created artificial pulley crane crystals and we arranged them to specific location and with that we can end that information we can pick that how the material under under the compression and they deform in in in specific way as we desired and the the important thing is with the way we arrange the muting block we can ask them to communicate in in given way and with that we can broaden the definition in visibility so first of all you have an impact force impact on this material and with the way we design the building block arrange of them we can write the force we can make the first chance for transferred and and directed inside module the allows specific way and we can avoid certain location to make know that location invisible to the force so that that can improve our our protection in case you want to protect any object inside the material and that's the way we can meet we can address a code the second challenge the third challenge as I say it went to magma to evolve they first they need to understand how the environment surrounding changes and that means what you can sense and then they take action certainly we can we can use the sensor we can embed sensor of or actuator inside material the more clever way is we can use the functional materials to fabricate our artificial crystals first of all in this video you see a material that can sense the changes in in in the external magnetic field the reason for that is because people need a light micro magnet inside this three I'm sick select material in specific way and when we manipulate the Icicle magnet magnetic field the legs can respond and even even work and with that which you can wrap around a medical pill and rolling and go to the site of delivery and then release the pill and without much you can behave like a robot so that that we fantastic because we do not need to use any and the activator or mortar or do not need to provide any like electricity to the material and the third I mean the fourth challenge is also that you're able to compute and sensing and take some some of our ocean like a transformational morphine stat as a way we can learn from from crystals as well from nature so one class of crystals is called the shape memory alloys they have a fantastic functionality they can have a two-way morphine when we call when we heat it up and when they cool down first of all in this video show us about the artificial metallic flower that can open when we heat it up and closes when we cool it down the reason for that is like deep loud inside the shape memory alloys the ship not accept chip memory alloy have two crystal structures one is called our Austinites that only present at high temperature and then now the crystal phase is called Mac inside present at room temperature so when we deform matter inside the home of Joe they changed the shape and now if you want to return the original shape in first which first need to heat it up and the deformed martensite we transformed to austenite and when cook it now it will just fall back to the original and we formed martensite and by doing that the ship my ship alloy able to recall the original shape that's fantastic phenomenal PC at my scale now how can we translate that knowledge and that phenomenon from at least scale to millimeter or the metre scale that's where where my research group and Imperial play a role here we used advanced computer software the design in this cell and that utilized a phenomenon in structure called McLain and we able to transform alpha between two stable configuration and with H configuration they have a specific strength and we arranged that really lock in 3d space to create an artificial crystals able to transform back and forth depends on the loading conditions and this material you can see we remove most of select material inside so that the artificial crystal is fairly light and with a specific strength as we design and you can see that can open variety of application principle in transportation now we are facing global challenge in reducing reducing the co2 emissions and with with that one one way to tackle that is to reduce the weight of vehicles and by doing that we can increase the fuel efficiency and reduce the co2 emissions now if you apply that kind of artificial crystals inside cars in Qatar in front of cars we have crumple zone and the impact energy can actually get the transformation on one configuration to the other configuration which you can least absorb energy protect the passenger and the driver inside while after the impact but you can recall the original shape and with that we can reduce the cost preparing for simple and the more thing also and evolving materials can open opportunities in improving the well-being of our society my small here's one application we are working with children is to develop adaptive attrition hip-hip can evolve and behave like natural bones so one problem with attrition hip is they cause is construct shearing and that means that that inhibit the regrowth of our own natural bones and that means it will be great I mean out of the board of the patient will be great over time if want to promote the regeneration of the bone we really need to design artificial hip become less stiff or in other words more compliance and with with the way we can tell the stiffness by this by arranging the building block and I think sure he can evolve thanks to morphing in paddler with the evolutionary growth of our nature bone and after hopefully after over few years the natural bone will regrow and at which rib disappears and patient can can can have their own unborn back so that is that is could be open a promising future and the ability to develop more fame and sensing and responsive material could open also opportunities in other applications as well so one of that is to develop more jelly resilient infrastructure so we can design shelters that can transform changing different morphology in response to the natural disasters transport in flood separation for support the shelter can self elevating to protect the people inside the shelter but also when we downscale that or even upscale we can design robotic flying vehicles like drones they can fly and behave like a bird for simple and as I shortly before ability to absorb energy and redistribute energy as we want that will help us to improve the production of our personal protection device first off the helmet that is in five years and if we think a little bit further in in 10 or 15 years compared to our green tea they have low invisibility clock materials now as I mentioned before we can pretend the definition of invisibility we can make an object invisible to different signals that could be acoustic wave or seismic or elastic mechanical wave we can use material in in our city to to minimize the noise pollution we can make city more quiet that will improve the well-being of people in the city but also when we can make a madam materials that become invisible to - I mean more more emerging ways like a seismic wave we can protect an important area we can deflect the seismic waves away from important areas of cities or important buildings from small lucky and nuclear power plants in case of earthquake for example and with advances in nano fabrication we can go back our agreement then law invisibility cloak and materials that invisible to the light and that really where we meet to engineer and and tell her the building block at nano scale and that is the life the roadmap for the future imagine with the with the foundation ID presents in the previous slides so we see we develop artificial crystals with high strength and lightweight and ability to adapt so we see that white variety of the application in transportation and increase the resilience of our infrastructure to national disasters as well so in 15 and 40 15 and years by 2040 we can integrate all functionality and I will show you that very possible to use what we have learned so far is by by nature we can develop intelligence materials that can learn and respond better to to the surroundings and that could help us to improve the health of our society well-being our society and the future would you become more autonomous that help us to explore a different world different areas where human could not easy access or very well made very dangerous and and and unhealthy to the human we can send material behave like robot happens to be a satellite or habits to explore different locations different worlds and that is my vision in 2040 my learning from nature we can recite material that can but after the environment can compute and sense and learn and by doing that they become smarter and more intelligence happens to better to adapt with the with the change in in in the future and with that I want to thank you for your attention and we'll be happy to answer any questions thank you so much son it was extremely interesting to hear how you're creating a new class of materials that almost become become like living and can help us address things like climate change and health care I think we can see that there are loads applications really interesting future applications and so I had a couple of questions so first shape-memory materials have been around for a long time so what has really enabled the step change to happen yeah thank you Maria that's very nice question I do agree that should marry a largely present for long term but that as we based on the intrinsic phenomenon at nano scale ethics and the novelty of our approach is we can enable the transformation at millimetre and centimeter scale and it doesn't need to have an intrinsic shape shape memory alloys we can apply this approach to any kind of other materials and actually we use just normal polymers it's normal metals and enabled the transformation so we can upscale to larger infrastructure buildings for example and we can enable the transformation with with I mean available resources do not need to use fancy shimmery alloys tastic and i think this follows on and one of the questions for the audience that came in during your talk which is how applicable is it as a construction material can you use it today as a construction material yeah yeah so that's very much B we just use the normal materials just normal metals and and also I mean like a stuff floating structures more in stick model and we can enable the transformation we sell a we need to do a more clever way because we need to give the right building block and then arrange them in in specific way and and with the normal I mean existing construction materials we might need to embed some kind of activator because they they don't have like a magnetism or ship memory functionality of the intrinsic materials so what is the largest structure that you have an angle of this material to work in so far oh that's a very good question that very much is limited by our capacity in application so because we use 3d printing to fabricate our design so basically that's the real volume of the princess I'll limit but with advances in manufacturing where people can use robotic arms they can increase that that's the scale of the the build problem that we can we can up stay larger but also you can see people apply like artificial crystals already even they they are not aware of like a scaffolding structures for sample this is a very simple form of crystal single crystal fantastic and a question here from Emily will there there are so many exciting applications for this what do you think might be the most promising opportunity for this technology early on yeah that's also a very good question as well the the futures is quite quite promising and because we not rely on the properties of the intrinsic materials we can apply the approach to any kind of materials and and utterly in structure applications so in in the near future I think the most promising could be in transportation because we have strong demand in reducing the weight and when we reduce the weight we need to think about it still need to have a strength as we use heavier materials and also ability to absorb more energy to make angels and the gradual safer so that is in near near-term future I think in transportation but also it further would be in in the in the healthcare application because we can make artificial like a hip or some other device can able to transform so actually that's we are working with a group of surgeons in Hammer Hammersmith to design transforming catheter happens to manipulate the catheter tip to perform some surgery surgery inside patient body fantastic so Ben Lawrence has a quite good question here in so two years ago at the tech force icon friends we had dr. cranum I am speaking about 4d printed polymer material how much of a crossover between these polymer ism is is there between these polymers and these meta crystalline materials yeah thanks best fantastic questions so like we have with some of la pbteen 40 3d printing and this approach but 40 3d printing more focus on manufacturing and we for designed material and we use 3d printing to realize our design so that that's the common is we use 3d printing realized our design but actually if you have a now the manufacturing route we can fabricate the design P once we do not need to use 3d printing so actually we have divided a lot of look at rocks and we arranged them we want them together either with welding or just use them not to mount them together and with that we as okay able to to realize our our design and with phony phony phony printing it still need to use functional materials but you need to evolve because 3d printing cannot make material evolve waste and this one I mean our approach is different we most of guys we do not need to use fancy materials you can use normal materials and make them evolve and I guess the cost is down as well yeah yeah I mean if you think about the cost or for shape memory alloys it's very expensive compared to other alloys are the measures now if you do not need to use shimmery alloys use this normal metals which is much cheaper and fabrication are so easier because to fabricate shape-memory alloys you need to control chemical composition very carefully because of the range they have a shipment memory functionalities is very narrow anything out of that range the material lost its functionality I think it's quite interesting because I remember in that talk we were talking about the two-way morphing and that that was more of a dream of being able to do something like to way more thing which you can already do with your class of materials that you've developed your great yeah yeah yeah yeah that's absolutely just we we need to combine our expertise in different disciplines from structures from mechanics materials and also art as well so actually we learned a lot from art like kinetic and Scripture that email order the sculpture behaves like an living anymore so that's a bit that's weak we load from fantastic I think we'll do one question and then we'll move on to a very very short roundtable conversation as we we don't have we're running a little bit behind so the last question is from Nick runner where he asked are there other manufacturing techniques that could be used rather than 3d printing and I think you're actually sort of as I have answered this already yeah yeah we we now we buy a lot of kind of wires meadows and then we just we the the way we can mount them together so no need to be kind of Frisco bond like a well being to join up together but also we can use not for example or just the way we they spot the other and they can from a building block in regular way silly there's a limitation with that because with 3d printing we can make much more complex but depends on application and as it begins on the constraints in finance we can can you just normal I mean it's just [Music] fantastic thank you so much some it's really interesting to hear about your work in the potential application so it's not time for the roundtable discussion and I want to welcome back the two other speakers so Ola and please and we'll we'll have time for two very short questions I lost the first one and then if anyone from the audience has a question that they really want to have answered this is the time so welcome back and so we've received a lot of questions to the session but to begin with we've talked about different materials and the changes of the structure to these and the development process so what might be some of the changes to the design or engineering courses that emerge from the new materials that you're proposing so what could this mean in terms of the process of development essentially Felisa would you would you like to start yes the process in our case specifically being new materials the synthesis process is totally new so essentially we really - of course you rely on the existing techniques but you really need to reshape them in order to to achieve what you really want to have and specifically for 2d materials it's critical to achieve that aspect ratio of having them essentially confined or atomically thin on one one direction while keeping you know the macroscopic x and y direction so this kind of planner so this has been really challenging of course over you know over the last decades since graphene started whoever you want them to align this processing with existing industrial processes make sure that somehow the technology transfer is really facilitated so in any case is really a game of essentially developing the best technique that is whoever transferrable and and somehow assume it doesn't require a huge investment from industry that's what we've been doing really over the last decade trying to understand and facilitate the technology transfer so what concerns I think in in the broader view of of stretchable and malleable materials I think in general what I can I can see in the textile air and the stretch of electronics er I think particularly for stretchable electronics there isn't really a lot of I would say standard procedures it's a very open field to essentially adopt the technique that are already there or somehow are still lab based to a new technology or new material like 2d materials for more concerns in stealth textiles is a very solid technology there are already very you know solid standards it also has has not dramatically evolved actually over the last hundred years I mean textiles more or less are manufacture in the same way they were manufactured in 100 years ago so from this point of view introducing new materials might be a more disruptive input therefore I think we need to be a bit more cautious there when we introduce that that's pretty interesting so quite disrupt for the current industry of textiles essentially I think although you already mentioned some of the kind of learnings to keep in mind as you're processing as developing new batteries is there anything else that you think would be interesting to share with the audience today so who are we so for our technology that we we're trying to commercialize at the moment the idea is that we are not replacing the entire system but it seems that we are introducing some improvements to the system and actually the industrial partners are willing to meet us halfway and improve other other stages of the process and they see the benefit of it so in a way we do we do influence the rest of the process so that's really really interesting so that's earlier stages of the material that we're getting for recycling but then I mean at the end of the process we also create new new materials that typically battery manufacturers are doing themselves and again the similarity textile industry legacy the recycling industry is pretty established and they've been there used to do things for for many years in the same way so so it's also interesting how this develops and talking to people and listening their opinions and learning from them and sharing information that's quite exciting and for you sonnet because does this I mean you're you're proposing and material that can do things that other materials comes so there needs to almost be a different approach to the kind of engineering almost process behind putting this business into things yeah yeah yeah absolutely right mariya however I thought about me utilize existing materials assisting process processes the only thing we asked engineers or users to think their imagination become creative and Mg ingenuity and that's the key thing because I mean if you see that is we just design building block and we arrange them in normal way the in neighborhood functionality we want and we can apply it really try it I mean with some design we test with the metals I mean we fabricate my metals polymers and until you haven't tried the ceramics so but I could expect we have same functionalities sorry I mean there's limitation if we use certain kind of materials there they behave differently so a lot elite very interesting phenomena mener finds more even use metals inside metal they have crystals itself and larger scale we have artificial crystals they mimic the other little can affect all theoretical structures and the phenomena is scientifically it's very interesting so it's not only about the application positive but absolutely I open a new area of research Sonia for my interest Corrections is the main thing we we ask engineers and users we think the way they design and be creative and other based on science and nature fantastic I think that that sort of goes along all the speaker's today around using the imagination and being really creative about where these new processes and new materials could be placed so we have one last question for the audience which will be the last question for today so it is what do you think would be the single biggest boosts that could help you as a researcher and startup companies to reach your 2040 goals other than financial is a technological social political I'll add creative or something else anyone would like to start although would you like to start I'm happy today I would love it to be a social awakening when we all start thinking and we actually learn something from the crisis we going through and we rethink how we approach the climate change and how that there will be some good lessons coming from it so definitely if it could be social it will be good good directions what about you son yeah I do agree with Ola we need to think about our impact on social environments as well so we need to have a goal I mean say in in 40 which challenges we want to solve let's say in in in environmental he fights and and we need to to understand I mean to learn from nature but also we need to have a good fundamental knowledge because our lives are just based on what we learn from sense metal and so like good actors of the time event of the manufacturing that's at right time for us as well but we can learn a lot form from existing knowledge and with the good might want to solve something in 20 years that and we put effort into that and we can achieve some meaningful impact let's say get to get lost no I I definitely align with them I mean the social changes will provide also a meaning for more funding because if there is a social understanding of course it will follow even politically or strategically to an enhancer increase the number of the amount of funding in general for research and Technology I would say that normally say is a game of different parts I mean technology also plays a huge role there and for example if we didn't have these four in my case new materials or this novel - the material I wouldn't be here talking about this so I think it's it's also you know it's it's a place different roles social is strongly linked to funding and we need money and definitely you know cut to budgets in this case would be really disruptive negatively disruptive but technology plays a huge role as well to supporting us fantastic thank you thank you all speakers we've I think that's a really nice way to end the two hours and a little bit session today on malleable matter so we've had heard visionary express perspectives from material innovation experts and startups about the future of of their field and now it's really time for the thanks this is the loss of this three sessions encompassing TF 2040 for this year and I want to first thank our fantastic speakers thank you dr. Willa hexyl man dr. fleets tweetsie dr. min song thumb you have given us incredible insight about how we can approach the question of malleable matter and how they can actually create these innovations for good
