 So my group works at the interface between chemistry, biology, and materials. We're really interested in how those three things can combine together to solve problems of global importance in lots of different areas. And what I mean by that interface is, in particular, that we're interested in how we can grow polymers from the surface of biological molecules and kind of marry what we call the biotic and the abiotic world in these conjugates where these marriages allow us to tackle these really big problems. So about 10 or 15 years ago, together with my colleague Kris Matyjaszewski, we developed methods that would allow us to seed the growth of polymers on the surface of proteins in particular and then grow those polymers. So we think of it as a nano-armoring kind of process where we take a relatively weak protein that is unstable in its environment often and by putting it inside this sort of polymeric cage that we grow from its surface, we're able to very significantly stabilize it and allow these proteins to work in unusual places where you might not expect to find them. So the impact of what we call polymer-based protein engineering, this interfacial activity in chemistry engineering, biology, and materials is really broad. So it's a platform technology, a platform science that can be applied in many different ways. Some of the ways that we're actually developing the program is to take enzymes that catalyze reactions of importance to industry or to health and use them in their nano-armored form. So, for example, we're taking red blood cells, and we're taking antibodies, and we're forming complexes of the two, basically painting therapeutics around the surface of red blood cells. We do that outside the body and then the idea is that those things will be used inside the body as a new way to deliver immunology-based drugs, which are currently very, very popular. That's one way that you might see a big impact from this kind of technology. The enzyme industry is a huge industry. It's a multi-billion dollar industry. We wash our clothes with enzymes, we make beer, we make cheese, we make wine, pretty much every big industry you can think of. All of those enzymes have to be replaced because they get used up quite quickly in the processing, and this kind of nano-armoring can help. And then we also have a pretty broad portfolio of basic fundamental science where we're trying to understand how these kinds of molecules work, where they might work, and therefore how we can improve them through nano-armoring. So new things are coming along all the time, and we also are very keen and very interested in working with partners who are interested in using this technology. So it may be that we're producing knowledge that allows someone else to produce an important product and that's something we're certainly focused on. I think if you think about protein polymer conjugates and all the different things that they can do, really the issue is is what problems that are globally important to society can be addressed by using protein polymer conjugates as part of the solution. And some of the most exciting things that we're involved with with collaborations with other people around the country involve the results of having a population that's now, you know, on its way to 10 billion people on the planet. Agricultural security, aqua security, so the security of the water supply and pollution, figuring out how to dissolve plastics and recycle them, figuring out how to make plastics without toxic chemicals, developing sensors for all these kinds of things. So there's a plethora of opportunities to use this kind of technology. We're super excited about the idea of doing that on important global challenges.
