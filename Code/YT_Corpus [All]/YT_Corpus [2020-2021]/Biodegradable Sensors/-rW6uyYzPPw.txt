 [ inaudible, audience talking quietly ] Welcome to today's symposium and public lecture that is supported by the Franklin Institute John Rogers who is the Franklin medalist in materials science and engineering *clapping* It's a great chance to be here and I really look forward to this opportunity kind of interacting with you guys and sharing with you some of the things we have been working on i guess over the last 10 to 15 year by now just kind of highlight the most recent stuff but it's an area that we have been exploring for a long time of course the context here is in the Franklin Medal and you you heard Judy provide some perspective on that you saw the video i think she said something about Einstein and Tesla that is insane so that is completely in a different realm but it certainly is humbling and a great honor i mean i think these kind of awards tho' especially in my case anyway are really i think designed to acknowledge a set of accomplishments for me that means a lot of wonderful collaborators i want to acknowledge that we are one of the the most collaborative groups around, most of our most impactful papers will involve multiple senior P.I.'s in different fields of expertise this is a snapshot of the set of folks that we have worked pretty closely with over the past 10 year cumulatively probably 300 to 350 papers coauthored with with these guys all the way from theoretical mechanics to device physics, material science, surface chemistry interventional cardiology neuroscience on and on and so these are the guys who are really winning this award in a sense my name just happens to get attached to it I want to start by acknowledging those senior P.I.'s and maybe most importantly the students and the post docs who actually do the work so this is a snapshot of the group we took over the summer so it's a really incredibly talented collection of kids and they really drive the progress in the group primarily I get to talk about it and I get tasked with raising the financing to support the group but those are my two main roles but I've been fortunate over the years very talented people Shening is an example is someone who is on the faculty here now and Larry Cheng as well really spectacularly accomplished post docs and moving on into their own independent careers so I thought I would just start with that and give you an outline of some of the topics I hope to share with you in the next 45 minutes or so so the title is Bioresorbable Electronic Medicines that's only about half the talk that is kind of some over the horizons things that we thinking about and working on now for the past 5 or 6 years in this area of materials and devices development for platforms that can interface with the human body in novel ways with the potential to have positive impact and how we think about healthcare and wellness and well being so that's kind of the last half of the talk but I'm going to start with a broader picture of how how we view areas of opportunity in this space at the intersection between science, engineering, medicine where we think the frontiers exist and then I'll talk to you about some things that we feel like we have a handle on what we are doing what the key materials sets are how to actually build systems get them into a hospital environment onto actual patients and then on a trajectory toward broader deployment that will give you a sense of what are aspirations are long term I will conclude with this newer newer area which we're really just beginning to explore So, most of our work these days is focused on thinking about materials and new device concepts that allow electronics semi-conductor functionality to be integrated with the human body in ways that are currently impossible based on the kind of micro-systems technology that you would see in consumer electronics and maybe the most the easiest area of opportunity to think about in that space is devices that integrate with the brain the brain is biology's most sophisticated form of electronics and I think a grand challenge in scientific inquiry is to understand the underpinnings of how the brain operates not only from the stand point of academic intellectual pursuit but the idea that that understanding could lead to new therapies for treating brain disorders and because it is an electrical system if you want to study that kind of organ system maybe the thing that you would like to do is to bring to bear that problem man's most sophisticated forms of electronics silicon CMOS integrated circuit and if you think about trying to do that in a straight forward sort of obvious way you are confronted with the reality that there are profound mismatches in mechanics, geometry and materials properties between a wafer-based form of electronics and circuit technology and the soft time dynamic curvilinear textures of the brain and so the idea would be that if you can figure out material sets and fabrication approaches and device design that would allow you to reformulate silicon CMOS technology into thin bio-compatible soft membranes that could sort of softly and gently conform to the textures of the brain and remain there for long periods of time to do high resolution electrical mapping that might be a very powerful tool in neuroscience research it may also be a platform for delivering engineered forms of medicine to treat brain disorders through electrical stimulation or optical stimulation and so on So that would be one place where one might want to get started in this area of soft electronics with the human body it wouldn't be the only place like if you could crack that problem, than you could leverage that same technology for interfaces to other vital organs of the body the human heart for example is an electrical micro mechanical system, so if could develop circuits that could wrap the entire epicardial surface almost like an artificial instrumented pericardium you might be able to do high resolution spacial temporal electrical physiological mapping that would allow you to pick up an arrhythmia before it became problematic maybe deliver spacial temporally varying patterns of stimulation to eliminate that arrhythmia before it cause a health condition so augmenting an organ function in that way might be interesting as well So, we worked a lot on the brain, the heart the spinal cord, the peripheral nervous system the bladder, but most of our work has been on a skin interface type of technologies skin being the largest organ in the body and a noninvasive point of interfacing that would allow one to get your devices onto real human subjects sooner rather than later so I will focus on skin that is an interface and then in the context of bioresorbable electronics I'll talk about peripheral nervous system in the cardiac system as well so one thing that may be useful to consider is to think about design principles that are inherent to biological systems, not so much with an eye toward replicating those features in engineered systems but from the same point of abstracting the key concepts and sort of embodying those principles in man made devices to facilitate the kind of biointegration that we and others have in mind in this space these are sort of obvious things, but they are useful to keep in mind Silicon CMOS technology is primarily a planer technology biology is intrinsically three dimensional it combines hard and soft materials into dynamic reconfigurable responsive platforms that involve functional materials across a very broad range of length scales and these are the kinds of ideas that would be useful to consider in the context of micro systems technologies And so with that in mind we perceive sort of three separate frontier areas as kind of how we view things others have their own ideas this is how we view the world of possibilities in this area of biointegrated electronics one is in soft membranes that I referred to in context of the brain allowing integration on surfaces of soft, time-dynamic tissue systems and I will give you some specific examples of what we are doing to address currently unmet clinical needs with these kind of skin-like devices where the interface to the skin provides a window for measuring with clinical grade precision underlying physiological processes a very specific idea of how that plays out into devices that we deployed in the hospital environment the other one is something I'll touch on toward the end of the talk is the idea of bioresorbable electronics so think about a resorbable resorbable suture It's a simple mechanical device that serves an important function in the context of a timed dependent biological process where the device is only needed for a certain period of time correlated in that case to a wound healing process you can think about the same kind of system but in the context of full active electronic devices and not just a mechanical platform something that can provide wireless data communication capabilities diagnostics, therapeutics and so on so building a set of electronic materials that are bioresorbable, desolvable in water to bio-compatible in products we have been thinking about and in this last area, of the three that we see we perceive are important opportunities is going from 2D to 3D So, 3D and these kind of open network type architectures reminiscent of neural networks in the brain or vascular trees in the cardiac system or cytoskeletons at the cellular length scale So how you go from 2D to 3D is something that we think is worth thinking about For all three of those areas, the core question is from the standpoint of materials science is what are you going to use for the semiconductor you can think about metals and dielectrics a little bit less challenging but the active material becomes a central question in terms of how one wants to try to make progress along those three axis You can think about opportunities separated out in terms of organic based semi-conductors and inorganic ones, first pass in that consideration you might identify mobility, field effect mobility as a key metric for comparing different possibilities listed here in cm sq per volts second, this parameter is basically telling you how fast you can switch a transistor on and off for a given set of design rules and how much current you can produce from that device And we and others have spent a lot of time on polymer-based semiconductor materials in this context with kind of an intuitive sense that plastics would be more naturally compatible with soft biological systems than silicon would be for example So there's been a lot of progress in polymers people have been working on this topic for 35 to 40 years by now but still the performance characteristics order of magnitude away from what you can do today with silicon and even further away from some of the III-Vs that are available so if you think about carbon and carbon nanotubes the ideal bonding configuration of carbon from the standpoint of semiconductor charge transport properties and those classes of materials do, in fact, offer extremely high performance capabilities but how to organize and how to sort them how to build them into functional systems remains a big challenge so we, and obviously other have worked there extensively over the years, graphene 2D materials also may be some options but at the end of the day you have to acknowledge that if you figure out how to deploy silicon in these kind of bio-integrated systems that's probably what you want to do because there is a 50 year history around global research around the basic scientific and engineering principles of how to use silicon in very sophisticated ways manufacturing structure to add to that base of knowledge that would be wonderful to exploit if you could figure out how to use silicon in these kind of contexts and the primary challenge is one of geometry and mechanics, as I mentioned before the platform for all commercially available forms of silicon integrated circuits are these high performance ones These material structures here, the semiconductor silicon wafer in particular. It's a wonderful piece of materials technology it's commodity cost at this point it's almost perfectly planar or very well matched to the kind of photo lithographic processes that are used for manufacturing but if you think about brain integration you can immediately appreciate the difficulties there I mean, the wafer essentially has the properties of a plate of glass it's very flat, but also very rigid it doesn't bend, if you drop it it shatters into a million pieces So, at first wash it may look like a class of materials that's not going to be compatible with biology but that turned out not to be the case because you can bring to bear very simple concepts in mechanical engineering to sort of transform that materials structure into a system, a hard soft deterministic composite system where you can engineer essentially any set of mechanical properties, precisely matched to those of biology target biological tissue and I will just skip through this very quickly because the concepts are simple, and they are are somewhat historical at this point, it's basically, two ideas for how you can create stretchable forms of silicon where you maintain the electronic properties and the sophistication in device engineering and manufacturing associated with silicon, but you transform it into a platform that is compatible with biology The first idea is to just make the silicon super thin so a wafer is not a very bendable class of materials partly because of the intrinsic part of the silicon partly because the wafer is thick, it's a mm in thickness you don't need that thickness in order to capture the kind of charge transport characteristics you need for a high performance integrated circuits and so you can create ways to to anisotropically etch very thin ribbons membranes and wires often near surface membrane of the region thick enough to support the kinds of device technologies that you are interested in but thin enough to be mechanically flexible by virtue of the fact that the bending stiffness scales like the cube of the thickness so you go from a mm to 10 nanometers it's many orders of magnitude reduction and bending stiffness again so it's very flexible and floppy as illustrated with this scanning electron microscope And so you think about that class of materials then and as a building block semiconductor that you can integrate with a flexible sheet of plastic to build high performance flexible electronics but if you think about what you need for bio integration it goes beyond flexibility so if you have a sheet of plastic and wrap a cylinder and a cone but you can't do a sphere, much less a brain or a heart you need something not not only adopts flexibility but the intrinsic stretch-ability of the biologic tissue such as the skin or the brain tissue or heart tissue You add another simple idea on top of this observation that thin materials can be very flexible even if they are high in modulus and relatively brittle by taking those strips and then bonding them with an underlying elastomer substrate but not bonding them in a flat geometry in sort of a wavy buckled shape So in this way you create a hard soft composite material that offers the stretch-ability defined by the substrate but with the electronic properties defined by a hard material component where you can think about this combined hard soft material structure as having the physics of having an accordion bellows so you get the effect of end-to-end stretch-ability bend-ability and so on that is not limited by the fracture limits of the hard material here but instead can far exceed that limit by changes in the geometry associated with these wave structures just like an accordion bellow so that's the basic concept it turns out that there are lots of engineering elaborations that you can add on top of that, so you can exploit not only out of plane buckling, but in-plane buckling as well So you can begin to build circuit systems that rely on sort of interconnected filamentary serpentine structures in sort of these mesh-type geometries which when bonded to a soft elastomer substrate with quantitative attention to the mechanics of that system you can tailor the stress strain properties to match a targeted point of interface with the body These are some calculations and some experimental observations of stress-strain behavior of this kind of system where we've really dialed the geometries and the thicknesses and the shapes of these filaments such that the effective stress-strain properties of that system are quantitatively matched to skin in spite of the fact that we can integrate silicon gallium arsenide, gallium nitride onto those filaments so the filaments become the support for the active materials the underlying elastomer combined with that mesh structure to find the mechanical properties so here, we sort of matched the linear response regime of skin, illustrated in the red curve there but all of these biological systems have this J shaped stress-strain curve so you can actually go to the next level and with more attention paid to the geometries here you can achieve that same type of J shaped stress-strained response in these artificial composite materials with tailor-able tangential modulus across a range of strains that are relevant for bio-integration So, for example here we dialed in the geometries and the material properties of these mesh structures to quantitatively match the full nonlinear response of skin from different regions of the human body two different regions on the back, one on the abdomen where we have inverse design algorithms developed in close collaboration with Yonggang Huang's group at Northwestern that allow us to define layouts to hit the kind of mechanical properties that we want, so you can quantitatively do do this matching and this becomes fairly agnostic to the materials properties of the mesh itself you can do this over a wide-range of material classes that are well established for use in electronics and optical electronics Those are some pretty simple serpentine just kind of these interconnected horseshoe shapes you can get a little bit more sophisticated by by adopting ideas from the fractal mathematics community It provide a set of systematic design rules for telling you how to spool out a thin film of material with an arbitrary areal coverage over a space with a set of mechanics that are appealing because of the intrinsic self similarity of the fractal geometry so it provides sort of access to a whole tool box of different geometries different kinds of design rules for tiling up areas with filaments to achieve active systems that also have unique mechanical characteristics So those are the basic ideas just kind of at a high level I'll sort of skip through a lot of the details and just make the comment that those foundational ideas allow you to pretty much do anything you want in terms of electronic functionality in platforms that are intrinsically bio-compatible from the standpoint of modulus matching characteristics so this is a first demonstration of Some of the ideas, it wasn't a functional system, but a platform with different kinds of active devices that let us to feel like we could begin to get a handle on the system That was 2011, we got a little bit better at it 2014 and then at that point we decided we should focus on real clinical needs to demonstrate how this technology could have translational impact and that is what I'm going to describe to you now but before I do that I'll just mention that that the mechanics and the geometrical matching is important, but for using those platforms for sensing underlying biological processes the areal coverage with the skin turns out to be critically important as well for minimizing thermal impedance mismatch and minimizing electrical impedance as well so these kind of mesh structures naturally can conform to very complex topographies that you encounter in biology This is a colorized SEM of a polymer replica of human skin where this mesh kind of architecture can really conform to those surface contours everywhere except for maybe the most challenging sort of crevasses that you see there Not only from a standpoint of measurement fidelity but robustness of adhesive in interfacing as well as enhanced by that kind of contact So, you put all that together and it turns out that you can begin to build platforms that measure clinically relevant bio signals with clinical grade precision, but without the bulky hardware that is currently sort of ubiquitous in a hospital environment in platforms that can potentially be used outside of hospitals as well for continuous monitoring So, one obvious thing is you can do electrocardiography so you can measure not only heart rate heart rate variability, but you can do pretty well with a Fitbit and Apple Watch but you can capture the full waveform continuously not just sporadically, like you do with an Apple watch four Other things that you can do that rely critically on contact interface with the skin would be to measure the hydration level of the skin, currently done in sort of an episodic point contact way using a device called a corneometer you can reproduce that functionality in that skin like function, as well arterial tonometry there, you're monitoring the pulsatile dynamics of blood flow through near surface arteries you can capture those kind of signatures by embedding piezoelectric sensing functionality into these same type of platforms So we and others by now publish many, many papers on all different kinds of sensors that fit into this overall design framework ranging from precise thermal characterization capabilities again, for the skin, electrical measurements for underlying organ function ECG, muscle activity brain activity, EEG, on and on, sweat we can capture that in microliter volumes and and do bio-chemical analysis of sweat composition mechanical measurement strain motion modules pressure optical as well you can also capture mechanical acoustic signatures of body processes using high bandwidth, very precise accelerometer type systems So what is all this good for? I'll show you one example, this is something that we really focused on sort of early on because we sort of felt like this would be a great match for the technology and also, a great solution to an existing challenge in clinical care and that is in the neonatal intensive care unit So if you have a premature baby they go immediately into the NICU Where their vital signs need to be monitored at clinical grade accuracy 24/7 because because these babies are in a very fragile health status and the way that that is done currently is shown here on the left, even at a Level 4 NICU, like we have, for a children's hospital in downtown Chicago so it's a collection of sensors that interface to the skin with adhesive tapes that have to offer a strong enough adhesion to the skin to keep the sensors in place in spite of forces that are inevitably applied through the connecting wires that interface those sensors to external boxes of electronics The problem with that is the the skin of these neonates is highly underdeveloped it's very fragile So application and removal of these tapes which typically happens on a 24 hour cycle often leads to skin injuries you actually damage the skin when you remove the tape that's a problem The bulk and the weight and the mechanics of the wires also frustrates natural motions of the babies because their muscles aren't very well developed they are kind of tied down by all of these wires and one thing we didn't fully appreciate when we got into this, but turns out to be maybe the most important consideration is that all these wires really frustrate parent-child interaction that's skin-to-skin contact known to have very significant therapeutic value for the development of babies at this age for the parents to hold the babies you need to take the wires off, typically, where you're tethered via the wires and when you put the baby back in the isolate you have to rewire them So the vision and we wanted to do, illustrated on this slide this is maybe 4 or 5 years old at this point that was just Photoshop back in those days it was a useful slide to keep the students and post-docs focused on what we are hoping to do here which is to get rid of that rats nest of wires and replace it with 2 or 3 of these skin-like electronic systems with wireless functionality to provide a more humane way to do vital signs monitoring So, I won't go through the details, I really don't have time to do that here, but that idea that basic idea is in material science and mechanical engineering that I described to you previously combined with these sensor capabilities can be brought together into a pair of devices that reproduce all vital signs monitoring capabilities at clinical grade precision but without the wires without the tapes with a much less invasive interface to the skin So this is the chest unit it's a device that goes on the chest of the neonate It's a battery-free wireless device so the peanut shaped structure with the sort of serpentine filamentary geometry around the perimeter of the device serves dual function and it's receiving wirelessly transmitted power from an antenna that goes in the base of the isolate it's a couple of milliwatts or so and that same magnetic conductive link serves as a data communication channel for continuous streaming of ECG data, in this case, from this device and it also has an embedded temperature sensor clinical grade temperature sensor that measures surface temperature of the skin on the chest so for these kind of trials we have approval to get the devices into the actual NICU so this is measurements from an actual baby in an operating NICU, at Lurie Children's Hospital The ECG trace on the bottom is wireless using this kind of skin-like, or epidermal electronics ECG trace on the top is the data that is collected with a conventional taped on sensors and external boxes of electronics so we can do a quantitative comparison between the fidelity of the data that we are collecting to what is done currently in the hospital you can see a very good correspondence there so this patch gives you heart rate, heart rate variability respiration rate and temperature an approximation to core temperature but very similar to the kind of surface temperature sensors that are used clinically so that is not all you still need blood oxygenation, so we do that with a separate device mounted on the foot so this is an optoelectronic epidermal device it's a pair of LEDS run emitting in the red switching on and off out of sequence we have an integrated photo detector that is measuring back scattered light each one of those wave lengths that data is being streamed back to a external acquisition unit and from that kind of data you can determine blood oxygenation level through this kind of photoplethysmogram And those two devices furthermore are time locked So you actually get relative timing information so you can measure the time in which a pulse of blood is initiated to the heart and the time that it arrives at the foot that pulse wave velocity has clinical meaning as I'll describe...in a second So this is what it looks like deployed in the hospital we are probably 90 babies into these trials at this point Full approval at a regular basis, 2-3 babies per week typically, so it's a hardware software combination you have to put this together because the nurses won't use sort of an engineering type of interface they want the full graphical user interface that correlates to what they are used to using via their GE dash system so that is the way it's set-up there's ECG there, there's SCG there, as well and the red and the IR channel from the PPG monitoring unit on the foot so we have had these devices tested and validated on babies with a wide-range of gestational ages all within that neonate cohort in the NICU down to 26 week delivery that's a 26 week delivery there to just to orient you 24 week delivery is know as the edge of viability so about half the 24 week babies don't make it so this is about as fragile as a baby that you will see in a NICU, and this is actually one of a pair of twins that was delivered at 26 weeks so very very tiny very fragile babies but these devices work extremely well there also So this is kind of what it looks like this is a picture, you can see the hand Aaron Hamvas over there he is Head of Neonatology a Lurie, you can see our device is mounted on the chest here you can see the wired systems there So this has been a very successful effort the nurses are very enthusiastic about it so we have actually migrated the technology out of the NICU and into the PICU which is the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit these babies are a little bit older but they also require 24/7 monitoring this is a baby from the PICU again at Lurie with his mother they are engaging in what is know as kangaroo care again it's that skin to skin contact You can see the foot device the LEDs lit up there you can see the chest device there so the transmission and receiving antennas in the base of the chair in this case but all the wires go away so this is something that makes the babies happy the mothers are happy we're happy nurses are happy it's been a great project in that sense this is kind of an interesting image this is the same baby, rotating around to look at the the guy taking the picture in this case Here we have the chest unit mounted on the back because in certain instances it's more convenient to put it on the back, if the mother and baby are having sort of chest to chest contact putting it on the back is an equally valid place to measure ECG here you can see the skin is wrinkling in a natural way as the baby rotates around and the device because it has the skin-like characteristic it can just follow that wrinkling without any kind of mechanical constraint so that reduces or eliminates any kind of skin surface irritation or discomfort associated with the device it also turns out to decrease the propensity for delamination because the device is so thin and so soft the interface stresses are greatly minimized by that kind of construction so the degree of adhesive needed to keep these devices on the skin is more than a factor of 10 lower than the adhesive strengths of the tapes that are needed to keep the wired devices adhered So we are pretty deep into these studies this is the kind of data, big data by any definition this is just extracted heart rate from ECG wave form and SpO2 from the PPG wave form, so this is just a tiny fraction of the total amount of data that we have collected, these are 4 million data points both on the left and on the right and these are Bland Altman plots it provides a way to look at the degree of agreement between our measurements and clinical gold standard very tight so well within the kind of variants the FDA looks at for proving new device technology These are not FDA approved but we are moving in that direction The other thing we can do is we can actually go beyond clinical standards So one simple thing is we are measuring temperature not only on the chest but also the foot and so looking a differences in temperature can provide information information on the degree of circulation, cardiovascular health of the babies The other thing we can do as I mentioned before these are two time locked measurements so we are capturing pulse wave velocity and that pulse wave velocity is telling me something about arterial stiffness and blood pressure So it turns out it quantitatively correlates to systolic blood pressure This is in a subject in the PICU This is an arterial line so it's rare to find babies that require an arterial line, this particular baby did so we are measuring the arterial pressure using that invasive device and then we are overlaying the plot of this pulse arrival time on that data so it looks very promising as a non-invasive way to capture blood pressure which is something not currently done routinely because pressure cuffs tend to lead to skin damage and muscle damage as well So anyway this is quite a complex project We have done lots of big projects in the past this is probably a high water mark for us anyway 45 co-authors materials science, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, biomedical, computer science in sensor analytics that needs to be done in order to make the devices operate in a stable way dermatology, neonatology, and pediatrics it's not just graduate students, undergrads, post docs, nurses, doctors and faculty So this was just published on March 1st and so I'll show you we captured a lot of press, not that focused on press this is John LaPook chief medical correspondent from CBS and there was a lot of coverage here and I don't want to sort of focus on that but I will roll this video because it provides a good context of how the parents and the nurses and the neonatologists are viewing the technology so this is 4 minutes so I'm going to roll that and let this go because I think you will find this interesting. So anyway that is kind of a starting point for us, what we are aspiring to do We have substantial funding from the Gates Foundation and the Save the Children Foundation for taking these devices and deploying them in the developing world So the schedule is to do 20,000 units between now and the end of the year in India, Pakistan, Zambia and also Kenya We are right in the middle of trying to make that happen So the same technologies can go to the home that is pretty straight forward they can also be adapted and deployed on adults so we have 23, 24 active IRB approved studies human clinical trials and pilot studies on different devices in the operating room, on Parkinson's patients stroke patients, expecting mothers, maternal fetal as well as, neonatal health It's been a very productive area for us and we are looking forward to moving this forward and I think there is a community of researchers across the country and the globe that are working on similar things seems like a very exciting time for digital information enabled medicine beyond what is done today So for the last 20 minutes or so I'll kind of shift gears and talk about something that is a little bit more over the horizon than some of these skin interface devices and thinking about implants some of the same concepts that I mentioned a few times that allow you to get on the skin, allow deployment on the brain, heart other soft tissue systems of the body we've done a lot of the brain, a lot of the cardiac space You can think about these implants in kind of two regimes of use one would require a relatively short time of integration with the body where the value might be in a diagnostic surgical context and we are working in that space with Brian Litt at University of Pennsylvania for mapping out electrical activity associated with patients who suffer from acute forms of epilepsy not responsive to drugs, there is a resection procedure that's used to treat those kind of patients the first step involves mapping electrical activity finding the region in the brain that is responsible for the seizures and then resecting it out So having high resolution, high fidelity mapping capability is very important in that context the resonance time in the brain could be a few hours a few days that's it At the other end of the spectrum you might think about devices that go into the body and last the life of the patient so a sophisticated pacemaker that wraps the entire outside surface of the heart might be something to think about in that regime where the challenges really are in bio fluid barriers how do you keep fluids away from the devices for 50 years when your in a warm salt water type environment So those are two areas where we and other are active What we didn't realize when we started exploring this space there are opportunities for time scales in between those to a few days, to a few decades, a few weeks where you might want to put a device into the body have it last for a finite time correlated to an intrinsic biological process such as wound healing for example where the device is providing a diagnostic or therapeutic function in the context of that healing process but then it's no longer needed once the patient emerges from that period and you would like the device to just simply naturally disappear at that point to avoid what would otherwise be a secondary surgical extraction procedure to remove at that point a device that is just risk and unnecessary device load to the patient and so that started us thinking about bioresorbable electronics maybe it's a subset of a broader class of technology that we refer to as transient electronics like any kind of electronics systems that that fully or partly dissolve, or resorb or otherwise physically disappear at programmed rates or at triggered times And the applications there are not only in biomedical devices sort of these temporary therapeutic diagnostic implants but also maybe as way to reduce hazardous waste streams associated with discarded consumer electronics, environmental monitors that you might need for a finite time period after which resorption into the environment might be an interesting mode of operation DARPA-like things, D.O.D. concerns around hardware level security and unrecoverable or reconfigurable electronics so let me just say a few words about how we are thinking about bioresorbable electronics for biomedical applications and as a material scientist you come back to that question what are you going to use for the semiconductor for a water soluble class of electronics and again you might be drawn to polymers because the intuition could be that there is a lot of chemical flexibility and diversity and the types of polymers that you could consider maybe you could define chemistries that allow for effective charge transport and also and those that would undergo hydrolysis and depolymerization when exposed to water and you could think along those lines but again you have to confront the reality that if if silicon could work in this context that would be the way to go for the same reasons I mentioned before And once again I think the intuition would be that silicon platform is not going to be suitable for for a water soluble kind of electronics because most people think about silicon in the form of a silicon wafer at least for electronics application and if you take a wafer and put it into a beaker of water not much is going to happen And to zeroth order that is a correct assessment of this situation, but if you look very closely it turns out that silicon does in fact react with water it undergoes hydrolysis to form silicic acid and a little bit of hydrogen but it undergoes that kind of hydrolysis reaction and exceptionally low rates rates that would prevent observation of that kind of phenomena in a bulk piece of silicon but if you are interested as we were in these very thin nano ribbons of silicon in your patient You can take a piece of silicon with those kind of geometries to place it in a a phosphate buffered saline solution at physiological PH and temperature and you can just watch it disappear at a rate of 1 to 5 nanometers per day and it's happening via surface erosion and you can just track it, just track the thickness of of these pieces of silicon as a function of time of immersion in an environment like that and it will dissolve completely for 100 nanometer thickness it's completely gone in about 3 weeks so you have to be watching for it but it definitely occurs And that was an observation that allowed us to really move very rapidly into this area of bioresorbable electronics with silicon as the foundational semiconductor material, silicic acid is naturally occurring in biofluid it's biocompatible So we spent a few years just looking at all the different materials combinations, not just the semiconductor obviously what are you going to use for the dioelectric how about the interconnect metalization what are you going to use for the substrate and the encapsulation layer wrote a lot of papers of papers 2013 2014 to basically put together a toolbox of materials that could be combined to yield high performance electronics built around silicon So you can do all that this is an array of silicon MOSFETS with mobility characteristics similar to what you would see in a wafer based device with similar design rules high on off ratios you can build logic gates you can construct analog circuits as well this is a colpitts oscillator where we're using magnesium as the interconnect metalization and SiO2 as an interlayer dielectric Magnesium Oxide as a gate dielectric in this case Silicon nano ribbons as the semiconductor and here we are using silk fiber as a substrate and an encapsulation layer Because it's already FDA approved for sutures and other kinds of biomedical devices so this performs as you would expect based on the circuit design and sort of the wafer scale performance characteristic of the transistor and the high speed diode but it's unique defining characteristic is it's entirely water soluble to biocompatible in points at a molecular level and this is sort of what it looks like DARPA was funding us back in those days they wanted a movie showing it this is silk in more or less in an amorphous state so it's almost dissolving immediately upon contact with water And the whole thing will disappear over time in this case silicon...silica in just a few seconds magnesium in a few hours and silicon in a few weeks so let me describe a couple of applications that we think are interesting these are examples that where brought to us by our clinical collaberators so they are addressing real clinical needs These are not things that we are making up or identifying responding to inbound interests The first is in a diagnostic sensing modality So here, Neurosurgeons from Washington University's Medical School approached us and identified this challenge Unmet clinical need in the care of patients who suffer from severe TBI event So if you have suffered that kind of injury where you come to the Emergency Room the first thing that they will do is open up the skull perform the necessary surgery and then when they seal up the surgical site they will leave in the intracranial space sensors of pressure and temperature because those two perimeters are critical in monitor so that the pressures don't reach excessive levels that could lead to adverse health consequences So the problem is you only need it temporarily but they use a non resorbable device with a wired based connection and so the concept was if you could get rid of that make a wireless resorbable device you put it in you don't have to worry about extracting it back out you can completely suture the surgical site and eliminate a lot of the risk for infection So this is more of a microelectrical mechanical device but it's purely bioresorbable So it's basically a drum head membrane with a piezoresistive sensor so we get electrical measurement of deflection of that drum head and that can be connected to pressure of the surrounding cerebrospinal fluid and you can achieve range of operation dynamic range and accuracy that correlates very nicely to clinical grade pressure monitors but with this unique feature that this whole thing kind of dissolves away so that kind of what it looks like we have done a lot of testing in animal models this is a rat model for TBI we have a radio unit that mounts subdermally it's about 95% resorbable, not 100% it could be but it's not currently but that is just subdermal the device component that goes into the intracranial space is completely bioresorbable and you can see very good correlation between this kind of measurement and that which is performed with a wired non-resorbable device both at the level of the pressure and the temperature so that is an example in the diagnostics maybe more interestingly would be opportunities in therapeutic function almost like an electronic medicine back to the title of the talk and so this was a separate group of neurosurgeons at Washington University that highlighted this different opportunity so I'll block this so you don't have to look at that while I'm talking So this is in the context of severe injuries to peripheral nerve so if you suffer a transection injury or a crush injury you will go into the hospital or emergency room they will open you up, they will typically suture the damaged nerve endings together and that is what is kind of illustrated here and then during the operating in the operating room context they will for about 30 minutes or an hour they will apply an electrical stimulation to a distal site on the nerve and that electrical stimulation is know for reasons that aren't completely clear to lead to accelerated rates of neuroregeneration so you do that stimulation for a certain period in that interoperative setting then you close the patient up they go home and then they recover they stay in the hospital and then they recover and so the concept was that if you could deliver this kind of stimulation in a dosed regimen throughout the healing process beyond the interoperative period maybe you could enhance the benefit of this kind of accelerated neuroregeneration induced by stimulation so the vision was you do the interoperative stimulation as usual but leave in the body a piece of resorbable electronics that would allow you to wirelessly, in a triggered way stimulate the nerve at different time points during the course of a few weeks as the patient is healing Then, at that point when the device is no longer needed it would simply be programmed to to bioresorb and disappear thereby eliminating the need to try to extract that that device back out of the body and disentangle it from the very fragile peripheral nerve that it's interfaced to and so we are able to put together we have all these materials already in hand and it just became electrical engineering project to put it together and these are wirelessly powered and wirelessly triggered electrical nerve stimulators consisting of a cuff interface to the nerve and then a wireless receiver unit here with silicon electronics to do the rectification and the smoothing and so it's all bioresorbable as well it's thin and flexible so it doesn't impose a lot of forces on the nerve there's no consequence of the presence of the device we've done many many animal studies by now a rat models damage to the sciatic nerve in this case we implant the device in you can see it here and then we have a coil to deliver the electric stimulation at different dosing levels and so you have to explore what is the optimal dose nobody knows but this is kind of what you do Three groups, one was just the interoperative stimulation that is the black curve here this is the EMG Amplitude so it's the measure of the degree of healing of the damage nerve and this is time in weeks the red data points corespondent to 3 days of electrical stimulation and then the blue is 6 days and so what you see is that as you increase the duration of stimulation and you push it out over time you increase the rate of neuroregeneration as identified by the slope here but then you also improve the end outcome as well the saturation point at 10 weeks leads to higher levels of recovery with electrical stimulation than without So we think of this as an engineered sort of electronic type of medicine it operates like a pharmaceutical in the sense it's not present in the body forever unlike a drug-based or chemistry-based approach to therapy this is determined entirely by engineering principles and electrical stimulation in this case so we are very proud of the fact that we were able to publish it in Nature Medicine so we convinced the editors that it is, in fact, a medicine and so that was kind of interesting So we have done all the histology you can kind of look at this and i think this is just a starting point for a number of different sort of temporary electrical stimulation devices that you can think of outside of the context of just damaged peripheral nerves it turns out the temporary cardiac pacemakers are important to provide a pacing functionality as a patient recovers from an open heart surgery so we are working with cardiologists at Northwestern to develop this type of technology so again it provides that temporary stimulation function, and you might ask why not use a nonresorbable one you go in it's a secondary surgery sure but you can still pull it out the problem is especially in this cardiac space is that the stimulators themselves become coated in tissue and so it becomes very invasive to try to rip them back out on the other hand if they are built out of resorbable materials you don't need to worry about it it would just naturally disappear so this is an area of current work unpublished results we have done demonstrations now in rats, in rabbits and in humans not actual human patients these are organ donors so these are explanted hearts we can deliver the kind of electrical stimulation that you need for pacing even sort of a human scale this is another area that we are pretty excited about So there are other things as well bioresorbable electronic medicines bone stimulators thermal therapy pacemakers as i mentioned programmable drug release that also look promising to us So with that I will just go ahead and conclude I think I'm more or less on time here As I mentioned on the outset everything we do is very highly collaborative Our expertise in sort of electronic materials science gets leveraged very strongly you know against mechanical engineering neuroscience dermatology neonatology physical rehabilitation I want to acknowledge some of the key Senior P.I.s in engineering science that we worked with over the years fantastic collaborators and then many many people throughout sort of a clinical medical community and rehabilitation as well but I'll kind of end where I started which an acknowledgement of the people who actually do the work I said that I only talk about it and that is more or less true these days so they're doing it all coming up with a lot of the best ideas so I want to acknowledge all their hard work thank you for your time here and your interest [ audience clapping ] [ silence ] That is the real sort of design challenge right? it's sort of a materials challenge more than anything you have to build your devices out of materials that will ultimately disappear completely right? but they have to be present in a way that allow stable operation over a timeframe of interest Right? Locked to the biology that you are trying to track or stimulate so There are two ways to do it one conceptually one would be to say I'm going to understand how fast my materials are dissolving and I'll engineer my system with thicknesses that are such that the materials won't completely dissolve during the time frame of interest the problem with that is it's hard to predict you know the chemistries are not well defined in the body the PH could be up and down and the ionic concentration could vary and all those parameters have a very strong affect on dissolution rate that's one challenge the other challenge is as the active materials begin to dissolve the resistances change the function starts to drift becomes a really difficult way to do things the other way is to define the lifetime with a non-functional capping layer encapsulation layer that is pretty much what we do in all these systems in almost all cases So naturally occurring wax materials turn out to be pretty good water barriers they will ultimately dissolve in the body very hydrophobic so they serve as a way to keep water and biofluids away from the active materials during the time frame of interest so you choose the chemistry and thickness of these non-functional materials to hold off the water during the time that the devices need to operate polyanhydrides certain ones are pretty good in that sense spin-on glasses as well organically modified ceramics are good you can change the chemistry there to change the dissolution rate applies thin films so they can serve in that role as well but that is kind of the design approach that we've taken as those encapsulating materials are dissolving they are having no impact on the underlying function of the devices they are just thinning and at some point they will be thin enough that water will penetrate through and then everything will dissolve on a relatively fast time scale after that [ silence ] It's a big challenge actually, it's a great question a lot of people don't think about it you want to do things on human subjects you want to have statistical relevance you have to have the means to build 200 devices maybe your yields aren't perfect so you get on 100 patients right? and how do you do that with the kind of process repeat-ability that allows you to get valid statistics out So we sort of take a hybrid approach a lot of the sort of most advanced engineering concepts we embed at a level of devices that are proccessed in our academic clean room Those typically don't scale well for for pilot studies on humans those type of approaches so they are good for testing out concepts and defining what a future road map might be but once we demonstrated that those devices worked to a certain level that's what we've done with the NICU to go into the developing world as a specific example how do you do 20,000? You are not going to do it that way So then you have to start adapting your designs working with contract manufacturers who are leaders in the flexible printed circuit board industry modify their process and you try to meet at some point in the middle and so once you've done that you can put together supply chain you have outsource manufacturing partners and then you can make a few thousand devices tens of thousands is ultimately what we are aiming for going towards the end of this year So it's kind of a hybrid approach so some of the early stuff we'll do manufactured in our labs it doesn't scale it's totally impossible I think if you are looking at new concepts It's typically the case that they are not aligned with current manufacturing process otherwise it wouldn't be new right? [ chuckling ] So it's kind of an iterative process in trying to get it scaled up and that is the approach that we've used [ Silence ] That's is a great question, there are FDA IEEE FCC guidelines on exposure levels to RF radiation so we are just going by those established guidelines so everything we do, we do full modeling full testing to make sure that we are nowhere near those limits If your question is whether those limits are valid or not it's probably a reasonable question that hasn't been a focus of our research we are assuming that they are but maybe there is probably some uncertainty in that so some degree so I think they are pretty conservative estimates to begin with and then we try to stay a factor of 5 to 10 lower than those limits so there's no we are not pushing the boundries but i would say you know more generally your comment around whether technology is moving as quickly as medicine I mean I think it's moving much much more quickly there is no doubt about that and then you might ask why well there is all kinds of risks you have to be super careful with all this new stuff and you ask why are they still using wires in the NICU, right? Part of it is that it's not a very inviting environment for new technology because those babies are are pretty much the most precious commodity in the whole hospital, right? So you are not just going to be able to throw a few devices and see what happens right? and so it's slow, it took us almost 18 months just to go through the approval process look at every single aspect of the materials the RF exposure where there is going to be interference with other equipment in the NICU are the nurses comfortable with it? on and on and on ... so so I think that there are a lot of hurdles and a lot of challenges to doing new technology development in this kind of context and I think probably a lot of it is warranted that scrutiny is probably warranted right? It's probably good that you have to go through that it does slow things down but I think for us it's worth it to kind of spend the time and try to kind of have an impact there [ Silence ] Yeah, so if we think about bioresorbable over the horizon like 3D is like lunatic fringe in terms of biodegradation but probably a direction you would want to go ultimately, so we have ways now to a so you might ask the question why don't I just take my 3D printer and then print out a structure you can't print monocrystalline silicon that's a problem right? you can't print transistors you can do plastics, metals to some extent some ceramics, there's a lot of great work there but if you want really high performance electronics in that kind of 3D geometry I think 3D printing maybe in the future not now so we have been working on approaches that allow us to take planer microsystems technologies sort of etch them into different kind of planer shapes then we lift those structures from the source wafer and bond them to a pre-stretched elastomer substrate bonded at specific lithographically defined sites by tailoring the surface chemistry and then we relax the prestrain it imposes compressive forces on that framework that leads to a non-linear buckling instability that pushes the structures up into the third dimension in ways it can be deterministic-ally controlled so it's a process for geometrically transforming 2D into 3D and I think it's kind of a work in progress for us question would be why can't I design an arbitrary 3D structure maybe, maybe not I mean there is a lot of design parameters it's hard to answer that question but even if you can't you can get things into these open kind of 3D networks and we are using them as scaffold to grow cells around them or we build 3D structures that go up around organoids for example these mini brains and so on we can get electrodes all the way around the outside surface of that type of system the nice thing about it is fully compatible with any kind of planer technology optoelectronics electronics you can immediately throw things into the third dimension with a lot of design versatility not completely open in terms of the topology and the layouts but you can access a lot of the different shapes that I think are going to be relevant So the longer term question is how do you integrate them with the human body? that's a bit hard i could smush them into a brain or something like that but as a way to grow cells in ways that allow you to create a skeletal framework for their growth but also an active one that you can sort of monitor the proliferation and the differentiation maybe even guide that electrically optically thermally that kind of thing even local drug release so this is something the we and kind of others are thinking about the human clinical relevance is a little harder to find on that [ Silence ] That's been a challenge I mean if you think about these soft flexible devices the first thing you worry about is mechanical failure fracture not just fatigue associated with cycling if you hand to somebody one of these devices the first thing they want to do is stretch it like that  [ chucking ] so thinking about ways to embed strain limiting you know components to these systems is important so sometimes we will use fabrics like soft stretchable fabrics that will have very non-linear stress strain response so it gets stiffer as you stretch them out so that is one kind of practical consideration around hard failure due to the mechanics but you know in terms of more subtle sort of drift or slight plastic deformation these systems can exhibit characteristics that look like it's linear elastic but where you've had plastic deformation in small corner parts of these shaped filaments so the underlying elastomer will return the entire system back to it's original geometry more or less but you can get this plastic deformation a very tiny region so you have to do a lot of cyclical testing so we have all kinds of apparatus to bend over and over again and stretch and twist and things like that so we sort of study things at an experimental level using those kind of approaches but then we are also very closely coupled into Young Onwan's group We know from a theoretical mechanics engineering standpoint that we are developing a device that will offer this range of stretch-ability this degree of bend-ability this degree of ability to twist before we reach strain levels in the constituent materials that would lead to fractural or plastic deformation so they are designed to be reliable up front over a certain range of strains for example system level strains and we sort of try to validate that experimentally so those are some mechanics issues that you have to grapple with as a result of the uniqueness in the mechanical properties of these systems for the implants the biggest thing is keeping biofluids out It turns out to be really, really challenging you think about like a pacemaker cochlear implant that exists today all the electronics is encapsulated in a can typically ceramics or titanium can with wall thickness a couple of mm keep the biofluids out here we are talking about active electronics that has to flex I mean that is the key feature conform to the contours of the tissues that we are interested in so we can't use a titanium can but at the same time even if you have a one pinhole defect biofluids will come in it will move laterally you'll get electrical leakage current back out damaging the tissue the ingress of the biofluids will begin to dissolve the silicon for example it's a disaster...so you have to have a way to do thin film encapsulation over macroscopic areas and your defect tolerance is almost zero because you can't handle even one pinhole so we worked on that problem probably for six or seven years trying to figure it out ALD *inaudable* all these different things and part of it is you are in an academic clean room so some of the extrinsic effects that lead to defects that prevent you from encapsulating in a practical sense maybe that can be solved you know in a more controlled industrial setting but it's difficult but it's difficult because typically those encapsulation layers are laid down after after the active components are already defined so it's chemically heterogeneous across the area and it has topology so even if you don't have pinhole defects the way that the nucleation happens in the ALE they differ across the area so it's very very challenging what we ended up doing is using thermally grown dense layers of silicon formed on a separate wafer and then like mechanically transferred so you have a pristine sort of fully-optimized thin impermeable layer of silicon and you can cap these type of devices with that type of material and it turns out to work really well I mean you can get 70, 80 year life times limited only by the rate of hydrolysis of the thermal oxide itself which is very slow maybe one hundredth of a nanometer per day in physiologic conditions so you have a micron worth of material you get decades out of that so that's kind of i don't know if that's the final answer whatever but that is the one approach that's worked for us so those are the kind of reliability sort of mechanical and then sort of encapsulation biofluid barrier type issues are the ones that tend to be the biggest challenges [ Silence ] So he's referring to a graduate student team that put together a business plan and they were at the Rice competition just earlier was is it? earlier this Monday? *inaudible* that's right yea it ended on Saturday yea So they did really well they made a device that allows one to measure flow through cerebral spinal shunts using a skin mounted platform so it's a non-invasive way to determine shunt function an so uh I guess that platform is not too different in terms of the overall design principles to the ones that we are going to be deploying into the developing world for neonatal health monitoring so the timescales there at this point I think there's no risk around the engineering designs, the functionality the manufacturability all of that has been settled it's a matter of going through the very rigorous process that the FDA puts in place for devices that are used to to affect clinical decisions so we have not had to go through that yet because we are running our devices in parallel with the wired systems for maternal fetal and neonatal and that's what we are going to be doing with the Gate's as well so we don't have to do that so we're just collecting data and we're validating precision but that data is not being used to inform clinical decisions around care So to do that and ultimately commercialize and deploy it a higher scale requires FDA so for neonatal monitoring systems you already have an FDA approved predicate it's in the form of these wired devices you only have to show accuracy compared to that FDA approved predicate so it's a pretty straightforward path to go through FDA we are sort of mapping that out now it's probably a year and a half to do it and it's probably cost a million bucks or something like that just in terms of staffing costs cost to support that and the same would go for rayos there is a predicate there that is FDA approved but nobody uses it because it's really clumsy it uses a different approach but it provides a point of comparison if you don't have the predicate, it's taking a lot longer you know maybe another 2, 3 years so um So I think for us these are good starting points right? to get things moving and then we can think about measurement modalities that aren't currently part of of clinical care and get things sort of going in that area I think that probably an answer to your question [ Silence ] Yea I think that is a great type of concept to think about and there are a number of groups kind of going down that direction I think this sensor dust idea is kind of been around I think some of the things you've done maybe kind of move things in that direction a little bit micro machines and so on um I think it's interesting If you talk to clinicians they will the first question they will ask any type of implantable device is how do I get it back out? if I need to get it out right? so having something that is all interconnected together so a single operation to pull it out if something goes wrong is something they think about alot so something that is distributed that tends to be scary to most people to most positions that I've talked about *inaudible* yea that is kind of where I was going next so the second part of my answer is what you suggested so you make things that aren't permanent in the body and you don't have to extract them you let them dissolve away the challenge is though with anything that is free floating if there is any change that it gets into the bloodstream it's a disaster because it can lead to clogging and stroke and things like that if you are in the brain right? um So it's for that reason that we haven't done anything in transient electronics that involves insertion into into the vasculatures when separated out but if you kind of thought that through then I think it's a great concept those are the two concerns that one would have is where they are going free floating you can control where they're at and then, getting them back out [ Silence ] Uh that's a great question we tend to I guess I could answer it in a few ways The students are driving everything at the end of the day like I could have my own ideas like I want to go in this direction but if I don't have enthusiastic students kind of doing it then not a lot happens so I think you know the students are defining kind of a prioritization in a sense the most talented students working on problems that their most passionate about almost by definition to find where we end up going So, I would say that is one thing, is that the students help with that prioritization in that selection I mean I do my part but you know, not rigidly tasking I'm not a task master, in that sense so the students are offered flexibility it kind of self-assembles in that sense I would say along a similar line our collaborators the collaborations that are working really well often times define directions that are the most productive because I think a lot of these things make sense and have a chance for impact and of those that do, I think that the directions that we go are defined to an extent by the collaborators that we put together and that may no only include sort of the clinical folks but also the industrial collaborators will come in and approach us and let's go do this kind of product and we will team with them so I think it's less a grand plan and more a portfolio of opportunities and then self-assembly takes over and we go after these different things it's kind of a fuzzy answer to that question but I think that is how it works in practice [ Applause ]
