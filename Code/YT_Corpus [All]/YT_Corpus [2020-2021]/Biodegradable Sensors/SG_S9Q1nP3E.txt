 so yeah I'm here to tell you you'll hear from Bill Nicks about our great past and the story of the history of the department and I'm here to tell you a little bit what's been going on in the department of the last few years of our the great things that we're doing and hopefully give you a sense for our future I'll start with you know some kind of a state of the department type numbers as dean Witham said we're a small department but we actually rank very high for those of you who like these rankings this year were ranked the third graduate program in US News and World Report the interesting thing is that number one and number two were MIT and northwestern and if you look at their size you realize that we punch way way above our weight so we're doing really well from the perspective of these rankings which are really sort of how do your peers perceive you so we're perceived very favorably by our peers and you see we actually have 21 faculty but in reality with joint appointments where we get around 17.5 interestingly six faculty have a PhD in material science so you can see it's a minority you would think that's a negative but in fact what it says is that we don't judge you don't have a PhD in material science but you're a world-class researcher you can join our department we really are from that perspective very inclusive or like people with different points of view and this is what makes our department interdisciplinary and really enriches our department so we are extremely interdisciplinary many of you remember when we were still in Peterson when I started we were in Peterson were sad to have lost Peterson but now we're in Duran and McCulloch and in some sense this puts us closer to this puts us closer to many of the other activities and engineering so we're closer to the engineering quad and that really helps us interact with all the other engineering departments and also were closer to the School of Medicine and as Dean Witham said we have a lot of Pro our collaborative with other schools so we are a really interdisciplinary Department more stats this is a history of the average age in our department I'm sitting right at the average age that's probably why I was picked as chair interestingly and you'll see towards the end of the talk we're very excited to say that actually the average age oh sorry what I wants to say also if you take a slope of one you can see that in the old days we increase our age with slope of one that says something about hiring but recently the slope is smaller than one so you can see we've become younger and younger and I can tell you that we're about to become even younger unfortunately that's not true for me I will be increasing with a slope of one for the next foreseeable future so I think this already tells it tells you we're on a very exciting trajectory with keeping our department young and constantly tackling new research topics as a discipline evolves we have 16 undergraduate students currently in our program 55 masters 136 PhDs and 65 postdocs maybe the larger number of postdocs is more of a recent trend it's really helped us jump on to new research topics quickly and develop them and turn them into huge programs that attract attention nationwide so I'm really a firm believer that you don't really know where you're going if you don't know where you come from and you'll hear a lot about where we come from from Bill Nicks in some sense at Stanford actually we come from all the way from Herbert Hoover who translated this classical metallurgy book with his wife as a discipline when I started my PhD in material science and engineering you were essentially asked whether you belong to one of the three following categories metals ceramics or semiconductors in fact in Berkeley they didn't really have polymers they were not considered materials when I was doing my PhD in Berkeley and few people maybe people who do contact metal two semiconductors would bridge two of these disciplines or if you were doing ceramic joining with metals you'd bridge two of these disciplines but you are really defined by what material you were working on and that's really changed with the advent of nanotechnology the very technology that allowed us to make faster and more powerful micro processors so shrinking things down actually does something to the properties of materials so if you take a metal for example and this is a slide and optical properties courtesy of Mark Brahe's MA you think of a metal as being shiny but if you make it in very small particles it actually scatters all cause of light depending on the size of the particle same thing for a semiconductor semiconductor has a well-defined bandgap so you think of it having some sort of an intrinsic color due to the bandgap you make it into tiny structures and you can actually change its color it's not by absorptions by scattering this I'm showing you this principle for optical properties but it's true for a lot of other properties if you think of mechanical properties you can take something that's intrinsically brittle like a ceramic aluminum oxide you structure it in small dimensions and now you get something I can deform plastically right ceramics are not known to deform plastically but if you nano structure they're more microstructure them they actually become plastic materials so this has really been a paradigm shift you don't have a material you don't have sort of the properties of a material defined by nature you can engineer them and turn every material into a new building block of something else this was really the last maybe 20 25 years in the last 10 years something more radical has happened as now we engineer things not only at the nano scale but at the atomic scale so if you take a polymer that does a pretty boring thing it's transparent it contains water you change a few atoms here and there all of a sudden you can turn it into it's all of a sudden you can turn it into either a solar cell or a solid-state lighting fixture that can be painted on a wall you've all heard about graphene unless you've been living under a rock for the last 10 years but essential property there is you take something as boring as graphite you can use it to write or you can use as a lubricant once you make it one atom thick it becomes an incredible photonic and electronic material I also like the example of diamond diamond is the hardest substance on earth it has a very high thermal conductivity those are all sort of properties that come from nature but it turns out if you remove a carbon atom and put a nitrogen atom next to that vacancy you get a color Center that can be used for quantum computing right so you have diamond as a gem but now once you in generated that at the atomic level it turns into something completely different so what this means is that our discipline has changed in my opinion fundamentally you can't just go to the structural engineer and ask them ok what young's modulus what yield strength you need and once you have those number you can tell them ok what you need is 4140 steel or something like that because in some sense the material per se doesn't exist anymore you have to tell me how thick you want you want it you have to tell me the surface termination because that will completely change the properties of the material we can turn as I showed you a shiny metal into something colored by changing the surface termination and the size of it right so here's a couple examples of what I mean by that if you take a molybdenum sulfide again a lubricant and now you make it extremely thin this has work by Tony Heinz who's now at Stanford and you take a flake and you see where it's dark here is multi layer and when as lighter is a single layer and you can see that only a single layer luminescence luminescence this is a photo luminescence map and so essentially molybdenum sulfide which doesn't Luminess because it's an indirect bandgap semiconductor once you make it one atom thick changes completely its properties and becomes direct bandgap semiconductors so again the natural property gets tuned by us as engineered and turned into something different you also notice here that where the holes and the substrates are you get more luminescence and that tells you something about the interaction of the material so the importance of interfaces and this is a great example of the important of interfaces here this is susannah stammers work at UCSB showing that if you have a single unit cell of strontium titanate depending on what the neighbors are so really depending on the interface you get something that's a decent conductor or an insulator right so you completely change the nature of the strontium titanate based not on the material itself but based on its neighbors so this is sort of the new aspect of material science and engineering we don't really talk about working on metals or semiconductors or ceramics because the properties can be tuned in the same material depending on how you structure it right so the metal can turn into a semiconductor and so on so what we like to do nowadays and our department has really embodied that is rather than dividing our discipline into materials we divide it into sort of fields of application in an art strategic plan we've identified three major fields that we think materials will have a great impact in the future the first one is materials for sustainability then of course we're in the Silicon Valley so you always want to improve the ability of materials to be used in computer chips or materials for novel types of computation and now we're going sort of beyond digital computing with new materials and in the third area that's in reading expansion is materials for human health and essentially combining everything that we learn in materials for essentially the semiconductor industry and then apply that to human health and then also our department sorry and then we have of course cross-cutting classical materials research areas and one of them is characterization it's always important in some sense now harp on this later what makes us special in material science is materials characterization we really want to know the details of the materials that we work with and the reason I just showed you is because depending on where single atoms are you might get completely different properties so if you want to understand that you need to characterize materials at the atomic level and then more and more the imports of theory and computation to predict materials properties interpret results and understand where your experiments are leading you and in the end where material science and engineering department so we also care about the application about the engineering side and in fact the first example I want to give you a sort of will give you an example of research from pretty much every single one of our faculty so bill fast but I want to give you a sense for all the great things that the department is doing so I'm the engineering side for example we have here work by Reiner dowse card who's been able to essentially spray-paint solar cells using a very exciting new absorber material that's a hybrid organic inorganic semiconductor that can be plasma processed and spray-paint printed sorry over large areas to make solar cells and the engineering side of that is if you want to have an impact on solar cells you better be scalable you have to be able to make a lot of solar cells so they can be deployed a different way of being scalable is what Bruce Clements has been doing for the past few years which is if you want to be scalable you want to be cheap some solar cells are expensive to make because the substrate is expensive especially if you're trying to grow epitaxial e35 type materials that have very high crystalline quality and very high efficiency but then your substrate cost will eventually kill you and so Bruce has been working on ways to essentially embed a low bandgap material and still grow up it actually over the substrate so that then when you irradiate at the right wavelength this low bandgap material dissolves or heats up so much that the top layer gets ejected and you can reuse your substrate without actually damaging the efficiency of the solar cell so again this the idea here is to make something scalable well anyone working in solar cells knows that it's extremely challenging to have an impact on solar cells converting light into electricity so because there's a lot of really good solar cells out there so another tack is the one that Paul McIntyre has been taking which is why don't we use a solar cell for something different and something different would be rather than making electricity why don't we make fuels and that also is a much easier way to store the energy and he's been leveraging Alden knowledge in really high-efficiency silicon cells that become Cheaper by the day and also his knowledge on coatings of semiconductors that he's developed to make transistors but essentially the same atomic layer deposition technology can be used to coat the silicon so that when you emerge immerse it in water rather than oxidizing and dying completely it keeps producing hydrogen and so you can use a sunlight to Electra - high drogyn conversion which in his lab reaches 13 percent efficiency which is quite impressive so the light motif here is it's one thing to produce energy also have to be able to store it especially when you use solar cells because of intermittency and the fact that often you'll need the energy when the Sun is not shining storage is of course a huge topic and we heard that there is a new battery hub that started at Stanford with co-directors each way and will chew and so work on batteries at Stanford is very sort of very preeminent you'll hear more from me yi works on batteries sort of at all length scales he's been able to take advantage of a very simple thermodynamic concept the entropy of mixing right if you have different concentrations of salt and means that your electrolyte has different chemical potentials just because of the entropy of mixing if you have different chemical potentials you can extract that energy in a battery and so in you know makes it looking at the different in salinity difference in salinity because between freshwater and the sea water when River actually comes out to sea you can actually use that to generate electricity he's also working on very large systems for a grid scale but he is a nanotechnologist at heart and so he also looks at the nanotechnology of battery electrodes for lithium ion batteries whether it's cathode or anodes and you've all heard about batteries catching on fire so he's also working on making batteries more and more safe but you'll hear more on batteries from his talk later this afternoon now one of the challenges and in batteries is that it's a field that's very old it's been around for a long time in fact I always joked that when I was in grad school no one wanted to work on batteries was considered really boring and now it's actually one of the hardest research fields so that means that there's sort of a lot of embedded knowledge and a lot of experience but sometimes the general understanding is lacking it and one of the problems that people have found out is that there is not enough that is known about electrolytes if you want to make a solid-state electrolyte for a lithium ion battery that is actually not it's it's tough to study and hasn't been studied enough now it turns out there's about twelve thousand compounds that could serve as an electrolyte in a lithium ion battery and of course it makes no sense to explore them all but we don't have enough of a fundamental understanding to be able to pick out which one of these compounds will make for a good electrolyte and this is where machine learning and what Evan Reed comes into play there's two challenges here there's other compounds and there's not enough data to actually train a really good model in fact there's about maybe 40 data sets so that's nothing so what evan does is he figures out what is the fundamental physics and extracts a few physical parameters in his case if he figured out there's 20 important physical parameters and then he coral correlates the experimental data to his physical parameters and he figures out that really only five of them matter and with those he can actually predict which ones are the new electrolytes are most likely to be successful and he predicted about 20 of them and out of those once you have the prediction of the electrolyte you can run at the really expensive calculation to figure out is it really going to be a good electrolyte and of those about 40 percent turned out to be very very promising the really exciting thing here is this graph where you can see this this is a Fitness core so how good the electrolyte is and this is how long it takes to figure out how good that electrolyte is so if you had random guesses you'd be here a good PhD student doesn't does better than random guesses but not so much because we don't really understand the physics Evans model does much better than the PG student and more importantly is much much faster right if you want a hundred percent accuracy it's you have to wait for hundreds of years right so this is the exciting aspect of using machine learning in materials discovery in an environment that's data poor how do you bake in the physics so that you can take advantage of whatever experimental data is out there to discover new materials this has this will have a huge impact I believe now why are we so interested in power part of it is because our computers use more and more power and so people are now interested in new computing paradigms that use low power and the brain is a typical example that does a lot of really complicated computation but a very low power so people are interested in finding ways to sort of emulate the way the brain works with neural nets and this has worked from my group where we've been able to make a device that's an electrochemical device so it works at both electrons and protons and it can be tuned in an analogue fashion the same way synapse Tunes when you learn the synapse strengthens when you forget that synapse weakens and that's how the networks in your brain form and eventually you end up learning something with persistency and so we were excited about using these devices to form neural nets in hardware rather than software so this is one of the new ideas and computation is this neuromorphic computing emulating the brain and other ideas is to use completely new materials that can work at low power and this is work by Fritz Prince who's working on a new category of materials that are called topological insulators where you can see from the band structure here on the surface the band bands are linear which means that particles can essentially travel as if they were massless just like photons right the dispersion relation of photons is linear so it's the same principle which means that these materials will oppose very little resistance to electricity and that will really drive the power consumption down now these new paradigms for computation sort of come from the realization that the classical silicon transistor is reaching the end of the line I think that's actually a controversial state a lot of people don't believe it's true but from the materials perspective silicon is a well mined and well understood material but there's still enough surprises that come out of silicon and this is work by mark Brahe's ma who uses silicon as a photonic material for all of us trained in material science you as soon as you hear silicon as photonic materials they say that's not right silicon is an indirect band gap semiconductor it doesn't luminous why would you use it as a photonic material well that's because you're thinking of absorption and emission while mark thinks of scattering as I showed you earlier once you nanostructure silicon it becomes a wonderfully tunable scattering material so you can use it to make anti-reflective coatings for for solar cells you can also use it to mak to make ultra flat lenses this is an example I really like whereby nano structuring silicon and these funny shapes that are not random they're obtained by a computer algorithm you can make lenses are about a hundred nanometer thick that will replace the multi element lenses that you have on your phone so you'll have ultra flat optics just based on silicon and because you can do this with very thin silicon you can make it sort of it's transparent so you can have optics that are active in the infrared and transparent to the visible so you can use them to track your eyeball in AR or VR goggles right and the great thing here that you're leveraging everything that is known about processing silicon making it in mass quantities and structuring it by photolithography in small features which is a really that well-established technology so along the same vein of really leveraging everything that is known in in microelectronics in a different direction new exciting direction is to leverage that for healthcare and one of the faculty that's doing this in our department is Shawn Wong who was making essentially microchip that rather than doing computation they detect cancer with incredible sensitivity down to femtomolar sensitivity and he takes advantage of all the microfabrication tricks that we know and magnetic fields where magnetic particles are functionalized whoops are functionalized to stick to cancer cells and then a magnetic field sweeps them out and then you can detect whether whether there were cancerous cells by using microchips and magnetic fields and his vision is that eventually this is something you can attach to a cell phone and you can do really sophisticated by analysis with a cell phone which is a really sophisticated computer so you were taking advantage also of the computational power of the cell phone I think this integration of microelectronics and healthcare is very powerful I really believe that this is one of big areas of growth for our department and now we're getting into the part that Jennifer Widom says is maybe a little bit scary but this is work by Nick Milosh who is essentially making nanoprobes by the thousands bundling them and attaching them to CMOS pixel array now what's really interesting here is that you can buy a CMOS pixel array for 50 bucks and that's like a million pixels you have a million sensors that all work there are given to you for a very low cost and you leverage that by using a certain fraction of these as sensors and you can put that in mouse brain and you can sense the activity of single neurons so now you can really do massive detection of neural signals which is one of the big challenges that actually DARPA put out and and the only way to do that if you think about it is to leverage everything that we know about micro fabrication and CMOS computing interestingly going back to fundamental material science it turns out the mechanical properties of the brain are not very well understood it's a heterogeneous material and so Nick is working with our own bill Nick's to figure out how these probes penetrate the brain and how to get deflected in the brain tissue now these probes are used for brain machine interfaces but another way to think about them is they can be used to diagnose neurodegenerative diseases so you can see when new don't fire at the right rate or they don't they don't do the right thing and once you diagnose you know degenerative diseases the next step is how can you fix them and so we have Sarah Heil Swan who works on regenerative medicine and she's using printing technology to essentially print new organs and what you try to do there is you try to print a material that is a good host for cells and that's her specialty she designs hydrogel so that cells are pretty happily embedded in them they don't there is no phase separation sedimentation at the bottom and once everything is said and done the viability of the cells in her printing medium is much higher than in standard stuff and so you can use this these type of materials to help organs heal or even regrow new organs that's one of the big directions that the field is going towards now we're material scientists this is my favorite quote I use it in many of my classes materials are like people it's a defects in them that makes them interesting which means that now we have to characterize what these defects are so a characterization is really central to our discipline and of course when you think of characterization in space at the atomic level Bob Sinclair's name comes to mind this is some work that he did where he actually tracked the motion of single cerium atoms on a serious surface so this is a catalyst and he tracked it in time because as a catalyst is in its environment so when it's in situ and in Opa Rondo for a catalyst atoms move around and maybe they lose their ability to catalyze reactions depending on where the atoms are so it's really important to be able to track atoms down to the single level and of course the TM is the instrument that does that and I have to say Bob of course is a pioneer and these atomic resolution TM images but also as great as building a community so he's been really building a TM community there were people doing TM before you see here Craig Barrett on a hundred K v TM enjoying his time apparently but TM is having a great resurgence nowadays and in particular thanks to the advent of cryo-em and very sensitive detectors that allow you to look at beam sensitive materials going back to batteries lithium is of course very very beam sensitive light atom very delicate but thanks to these new techniques of cryo and high sensitivity detectors he has been able to image in a battery electrode actually lithium atoms an atomic resolution and when my group were working on very soft materials like polymers and we use new techniques where we take a lot of diffraction patterns to reconstruct the microstructure of these polymers and we work with and these pockets was a theorist in our department to reconstruct actually wear every single polymer chain is so there is a lot of interest into these new atomic resolution TM techniques and I think these are also a big area of growth for our department it's great to monitor things you know statically but of course you as material scientists we want to see how things work and you'll hear more I'm sure from gendai on about some of this work but she's been a pioneer in in-situ TM microscopy in this case she's literally been able to image the hydrogenation of a metal particle where you could imagine this metal particle could be used to store hydrogen and she's been able for example to see how hydrogenation starts at corners which is what you would imagine because these are high-energy sites and so that's where the hydrogen will work its way in and she's being able to show the depending on the shape and microstructure of the particle you get different hydrogen pressures where the hydrogenation occurs different plateaus and so on and so forth and I should stress this is really single particle measurements so it's literally seeing how hydrogen enters single nanoparticles of a metal here you look I don't remember what the timescale of this video is but I imagine it's seconds to minutes but of course a lot of materials operate on much shorter time scales and this is where our connection to slack comes into play this is work by Erin Lindenberg in collaboration with Tom Deveraux they're both joined faculty with slack and in this particular work they use the ultra-fast electron diffraction be line at slack to show them when you hit this material whoops sorry when you hit this Telluride with a laser it you can see it starts shearing and you can monitor that by electron diffraction and Tom Devereaux did the calculation to show that whether it's sheared or not you get an insulator or a semiconductor and so you can really monitor how fast this material switches and this is sub picosecond measurements so you can imagine these being used as new memory elements because they switch from an insulating state to a conducting state now everything that I showed you is very broad and you start wondering where is our discipline going where is the material science and here aren't you just kind of you know what one makes material science different so I've been thinking about this for a while and I want to give you an example that I think exemplifies it pretty well this has worked from will Chu in batteries so it takes a battery and he looks at it as a macroscopic element and one of the challenges here in lithium-ion battery even though they've been on the market for a long time is really figuring out how the charging and discharging is affected by the microstructure of what's in there so what will does he opens it up and then he looks in and here's the electrodes and a separator and then when he looks at the separator there's aggregates of in this case it's lithium cobalt oxide and these are about 20 micron wide and then within the aggregates there's particles and it turns out to understand sort of the power or the energy contained in a battery and how it charges in this charge at the macroscopic level of the what our level you really need to understand what happens at the Pico watt power level you need to understand what's happening inside this electrode at the microscopic scale and he uses advanced characterization techniques in this case it's x-ray microscopy at synchrotron beamlines in this case and the aggregates what you're seeing is a torch oddity of the path in the aggregate so this is x-ray tomography the color here actually represents location so you're doing a chemical analysis at the same time as a structural analysis and then when you look at a single particles on the other hand so this is static you charge the battery and you look at it there is actually dynamic as the battery charges and discharges where does the lithium go in the particle the color when you locate the particle there's a phase separation between two lithium cobalt oxide phases and the color reflects the amount of each phase now what first of all you know batteries have been known for a long time the realm of electro chemists what do we bring as material scientists that's different this is what we bring we're really looking at the real material that's used in a battery characterizing the real material and figuring out the chemistry the microstructure the physical structure of these expand and so on and so forth and then relate that to the operation of the battery and it turns out that of course you need to know the fusion and so on and you need to know thermodynamics you can model this phase change with the can Hillyard equations that we all know and it works perfectly well so you see this is sort of very modern research with very modern tools on an old problem lithium batteries using all our classical tools so I think this is really some of what defines our discipline as we have these classical models but we have new characterization techniques and we use them on real materials as they operate thanks to these new characterization techniques so what makes us different well we know that microstructure dictates properties this is one of the fundamental tenets of material science heterogeneity defects and their evolution and time are important we embrace that we don't try to use model materials we actually use real materials as they operate in their real conditions we use advanced characterization to figure out what happens and then we use the fundamental principles of kinetics and thermodynamics that are very well established to model and understand what what is happening in our materials so I think we are the community that really looks at this problem holistically across length scales if I have to look at different communities a lot of them focus on a small part of the problem really focus on everything together from nano all the way to macroscopic because we understand that all these length scales are connected to make a device work here's another example I showed you a lot of soft matter and a lot of you if you're classically trained as AI showed you earlier when I was PhD student in Berkeley soft matter was not considered materials all it turns are we think it is an even biological matter we think of it as materials this is work by Andy's packets and it's fascinating that when you have certain DNA what gets expressed also depends on how the DNA is packed the denia can be packed tightly or loosely so even without any genetic change what gets packed densely or loosely can completely change what gets expressed and can turn into disease so that's not something you'd figure out by sequencing you have to figure it out by figuring out the micro structure of the pack DNA Andy's a theorist and he's working on a theory that models this different packing essentially as an amorphous amorphous phase separation so in some sense very classical thermodynamics but applied to a field where you never think that you apply classical thermodynamics so when I showed you earlier we have six PhDs in material science like I said this is not a - it's a plus because now all of a sudden all our faculty who don't have a classical material science background find new ways to apply our material science principles two completely different problems and for us who are classically trained all of a sudden we see a lot of other problems out there that can be addressed with our material science fundamental principles so what defines us is that we apply all these classical principles to new advanced materials so for us defects and heterogeneity are not a bug they're a feature we like defects the materials are interesting because they have defects defects allow us to tune materials physical and chemical characterization is really important for us it's preeminent without that we will never know what a material does and by controlling processing we can get different properties I always joke that I say how you can tell who's the material scientists in the room that if you ask a physicist what is platinum they'll tell you oh it's a metal has this conductivity if you ask a chemist they'll tell you it's an element and this is where it sits in a periodic table if you ask a material scientist they'll ask you how did you process it is a porous how many dislocations that have because for us that's really what defines the material and then we use all our fundamental principles of thermodynamics and kinetics design and understand materials and that's why the history of our department is important because all these fundamental old principles actually still work nowadays and we use them everyday now like I said our faculty address three Grand Challenges and this is our grand plan or strategic plan well actually the elephant in the room is that our real strategic plan are really how do we keep being where we are in the rankings is to hire great people so our real strategic plan is to when we have faculty searchers really go out and really hire the best people we can hire and it turns out they often will fit within our strategic plan but our goal is really to hire the best people we can and we're very fortunate we currently have four assistant professors two are already on campus Eric and guseong Philippe de Ranade and Kunal Mukherjee will be joining us next year so I wanted to spend a few minutes talking about what they're doing Eric has been very successful working in soft matter and again he uses fundamental material science principles to design hydrogels that can deliver vaccines that are challenging to deliver because often vaccines have different components that have different sizes and they all have to be delivered at the same time over a long time or a long period of time and so it designs hydrogels that allow the diffusion of all these different molecules of different sizes to occur at the same rate so if the vaccine can be delivered over months for years what's fascinating is that the same design principle can be used to design a fire retardant which has loops what sorry which was what was meant to be shown here you can see it here this is a treated piece of dry grass this sari on this is treated this is untreated this paper came out serendipitously the week that PG&E cut power to 800,000 people because of fear of fires so Eric was all over the news showing how he can use his hydrogel to deliver a fire retardant that he's making now I think in 3,000 gallon batches and it's being sprayed over the edges of freeways in LA as a because the challenges fire-retardant gets washed out by rain while with this hydrogel it actually sticks and so I will last for months for a whole fire season and it's completely biodegradable made with natural natural essentially starting from cellulose so it's not toxic at all so this is one example again of using fundamental materials design principles in soft matter cool song does something even more futuristic in my opinion he makes electronic devices that get implanted in animals and can be controlled from the outside in this case it's a IR photo sensor that when it turns on you can see the mouse starts moving around a little bit more hectically because in the in this mouse's brain there's a sensor in IR solar cell that when it gets illuminated by IR radiation through the skull stimulates the brain of the mouse and when the laser is off the mouse stands still and he's making all sorts of materials that our brain like that can be implanted in animals brains to study how their neuronal circuits work we're very happy to welcome Felipe de Charny to our faculty in January he's a theorist and his specialty is actually calculating materials properties not just statically but in their excited state which is very challenging to do but of course it goes with our theme of materials as they're being used and most materials when they're being used there in some form of an excited state and so this is really a level of theory that is needed to understand these new advanced materials and finally Kunal Mukerji who's joining us in the summer grows new electronic materials so these this is not silicon but it's these type of alloys and it grows on epitaxially defect-free across interfaces to make new opped electronic devices but Kunal is actually classically trained so he's interested in dislocations and images by SEM segregation of atoms and dislocations and how dislocations move so he can literally have movies of these dislocations moving through his electronic materials and where they go and what they do so in keeping with the theme of is this really material science I want to convince you since you're all here that this really is material science even this newest things and so I wanted to take the example of Eric's work so he makes these vaccines and he's the challenge of the vaccine is that a vaccine has to often as made of two molecules one as a vaccine itself and one as an adjuvant and they have to be delivered at the same time if you think of third-world countries it's hard to get compliance it's hard to get people come back and get vaccinated so you'd like to have a vaccine that lasts four years and so you want to have the vaccine encapsulated in something that releases the adjuvant and the vaccine itself slowly over months and so it has to have a certain yield strength but at the same time you're delivering it through a syringe so it has to flow so on one hand it has to have yield strength so that's the materials property at the same time it has to shear thin so it has to be able to flow so that's not a material property and the way Eric does that is he makes centuries hydrogel with linkages that can open and close relatively easily so that's where the thermodynamics comes into play he really has to figure out the energy of these bonds so that at room temperature they're soft enough to open when you flow but then they're hard enough that when you don't flow the clothes and your material stays put under your skin and releases the vaccine little by little and how do you deliver by diffusion two things are very different in size Stokes equation would tell you that they'd be orders of magnitude difference in diffusion but you don't want that you wanted to diffuse at the same time and so the clever trick here is to have diffusion limited actually by the opening and closing of the hydrogel and so they both diffuse at the same rate because it's the hydrogel that makes them diffuse so how is this classical material science well he's designed the mechanical properties the yield strength and the shear thinning he's characterized the material by rheology and also structurally he's doing x-ray scattering at the synchrotron and then finally he uses principles of kinetics diffusion and thermodynamics bond strength to design his material to have the exact properties that he requires so again he looks at the problem holistically across length scales and I think this is what really makes him a material scientist and that's what makes this project a material science project so just some final thoughts I think our department is well-positioned to have impact in key areas we've made fantastic hires we've identified areas of impact we continue to be able to recruit world-class faculty and fantastic students and postdocs and part of it is actually our interdisciplinarity when we have students or faculty come they really like the fact that they can work with faculty and students across the school and actually even with other schools like the school of medicine or science more and more faculty are therefore engaged in interdisciplinary research this happens almost naturally when faculty join our department the presence of slack is a unique asset I haven't talked a whole lot about it I just showed some results but a lot of us actually use slack and that's unique within five minute drive we have a synchrotron facility we have a free electron laser we have an ultra-fast electron diffraction beam line so we as long as we write competitive proposals for beam time we have access to these facilities and we get turnaround of our research that's much faster actually want to take a minute to acknowledge and thank our staff so first of our department staff that does a fantastic job supporting us supporting our research and ever getting rid of all the little problems so that we can really focus on what's important to us which is research we have really phenomenal staff and department supporting us but also all the staff that's in the shared facility that helps our students and our researchers progress with their research and they're all very generous with their time so thank you very much for all this support and finally [Applause] finally as parting words you'll see we have an illustrious past behind us but I think we have a really bright future in front of us so thank you all for coming I'm looking forward to meeting as many of you as possible I think we'll really enjoy a day of finding old friends and conversations and thank you again for coming [Applause]
