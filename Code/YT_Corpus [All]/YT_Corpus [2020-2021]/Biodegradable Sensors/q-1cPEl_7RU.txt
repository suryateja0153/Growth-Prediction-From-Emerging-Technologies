 nanomedicine is the medical application of nanotechnology nano medicine ranges from the medical applications of nanomaterials and biological devices to nano electronic biosensors and even possible future applications of molecular nanotechnology such as biological machines current problems for nano medicine involve understanding the issues related to toxicity and environmental impact of nano scale materials materials whose structure is on the scale of nanometers ie billionths of a meter functionalities can be added to nanomaterials by interfacing them with biological molecules or structures the size of nanomaterials is similar to that of most biological molecules and structures therefore nanomaterials can be useful for both in vivo and in vitro biomedical research and applications thus far the integration of nanomaterials with biology has led to the development of diagnostic devices contrast agents analytical tools physical therapy applications and drug delivery vehicles nano medicine seeks to deliver a valuable set of research tools and clinically useful devices in the near future the National nanotechnology initiative expects new commercial applications in the pharmaceutical industry that may include advanced drug delivery systems new therapies and in vivo imaging nano medicine research is receiving funding from the US National Institutes of Health Common Fund program supporting for nano medicine development centers nano medicine sales reached 16 billion dollars in 2015 with a minimum of 3.8 billion dollars in nanotechnology R&D being invested every year global funding for emerging nanotechnology increased by 45% per year in recent years with product sales exceeding 1 trillion dollars in 2013 as the nanomedicine industry continues to grow it is expected to have a significant impact on the economy topic drug delivery nanotechnology has provided the possibility of delivering drugs to specific cells using nanoparticles the overall drug consumption and side effects may be lowered significantly by depositing the active agent in the morbid region only and in no higher dose than needed targeted drug delivery is intended to reduce the side effects of drugs with concomitant decreases in consumption and treatment expenses drug delivery focuses on maximizing bioavailability both at specific places in the body and over a period of time this can potentially be achieved by molecular targeting by nano-engineered devices a benefit of using nano scale for medical technologies is that smaller devices are less invasive and can possibly be implanted inside the body plus biochemical reaction times are much shorter these devices are faster and more sensitive than typical drug delivery the efficacy of drug delivery through nano medicine is largely based upon our efficient encapsulation of the drugs be successful delivery of drug to the targeted region of the body and see successful release of the drug drug delivery systems liepard or polymer based nanoparticles can be designed to improve the pharmacokinetics and by a distribution of the drugged however the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nanomedicine is highly variable among different patients when designed to avoid the body's defense mechanisms nanoparticles have beneficial properties that can be used to improve drug delivery complex drug delivery mechanisms are being developed including the ability to get drugs through cell membranes and into cell cytoplasm triggered response is one way for drug molecules to be used more efficiently drugs are placed in the body and only activate on encountering a particular signal for example a drug with poor solubility will be replaced by a drug delivery system where both hydrophilic and hydrophobic environments exist improving the solubility drug delivery systems may also be able to prevent tissue damage through regulated drug release reduce drug clearance rates or lower the volume of distribution and reduce the effect on non target tissue however the bio distribution of these nanoparticles is still imperfect due to the complex hosts reactions to Nano and micro sized materials and the difficulty in targeting specific organs in the body nevertheless a lot of work is still ongoing to optimize and better understand the potential and limitations of nano particulate systems while advancement of research proves that targeting and distribution can be augmented by nanoparticles the dangers of nano toxicity become an important next step in further understanding of their medical uses nanoparticles are under research for their potential to decrease antibiotic resistance or for various antimicrobial uses nanoparticles might also be used to circumvent multidrug-resistant MDR mechanisms topic systems under research advances in liepard nanotechnology were instrumental in engineering medical nano devices and novel drug delivery systems as well as in developing sensing applications another system for micro no delivery under preliminary research is nanoparticles formed by the self-assembly of two different micro nur's deregulated in cancer one potential application is based on small electromechanical systems such as nano electromechanical systems being investigated for the active release of drugs and sensors for possible cancer treatment with iron nanoparticles or gold shells topic applications some nanotechnology based drugs that are commercially available or in human clinical trials include Abraxane approved by the US Food and Drug Administration FDA to treat breast cancer non-small-cell lung cancer in SCLC and pancreatic cancer is the nanoparticle albumin bound paclitaxel Doxil was originally approved by the fda for the use on HIV related Kaposi's sarcoma it is now being used to also treat ovarian cancer and multiple myeloma the drug is encased in lipice ohms which helps to extend the life of the drug that is being distributed lipice ohms are self-assembling spherical closed colloidal structures that are composed of lipid bilayers that surround the aqueous space the Leppa somes also helped to increase the functionality and it helps to decrease the damage that the drug does to the heart muscles specifically on ovide lipice ohm encapsulated irinotecan to treat metastatic pancreatic cancer was approved by FDA in October 2015 rapper mone is a nano crystal based drug that was approved by the FDA in 2000 to prevent organ rejection after transplantation the nano crystal components allow for increased drug solubility and dissolution rate leading to improved absorption and high bioavailability topic cancer topic preclinical research existing and potential drug nano carriers have been reviewed nanoparticles have high surface area to volume ratio this allows for many functional groups to be attached to a nanoparticle which can seek out and bind to certain tumor cells additionally the small size of nanoparticles 5 to 100 nanometers allows them to preferentially accumulate a tumor sites because tumors lack an effective lymphatic drainage system limitations to conventional cancer chemotherapy include drug resistance lack of selectivity and lack of solubility topic imaging in vivo imaging is another area where tools and devices are being developed using nanoparticle contrast agents images such as ultrasound and MRI have a favorable distribution and improved contrast in cardiovascular imaging nanoparticles have potential to aid visualization of blood pooling ischemia angiogenesis atherosclerosis and focal areas where inflammation is present the small size of nanoparticles endowed them with properties that can be very useful in oncology particularly in imaging quantum dots nanoparticles with quantum confinement properties such as size tunable light emission when used in conjunction with MRI magnetic resonance imaging can produce exceptional images of tumor sites nanoparticles of cadmium selenide quantum dots glow when exposed to ultraviolet light when injected they seep - cancer tumors the surgeon can see the glowing tumor and use it as a guide for more accurate tumor removal these nanoparticles are much brighter than organic dyes and only need one light source for excitation this means that the use of fluorescent quantum dots could produce a higher contrast image and at a lower cost than today's organic dyes used as contrast media the downside however is that quantum dots are usually made of quite toxic elements but this concern may be addressed by use of fluorescent dopants tracking movement can help determine how well drugs are being distributed or how substances are metabolized it is difficult to track a small group of cells throughout the body so scientists used to dye the cells these dyes needed to be excited by light of a certain wavelength in order for them to light up while different color dyes absorb different frequencies of light there was a need for as many light sources as cells a way around this problem is with luminescent tags these tags are quantum dots attached to proteins that penetrate cell membranes the dots can be random in size can be made of bio inert material and they demonstrate the nanoscale property that color is size dependent as a result sizes are selected so that the frequency of light used to make a group of quantum dots fluoresce is an even multiple of the frequency required to make another group in Candyce then both groups can be lit with a single light source they have also found a way to insert nanoparticles into the affected parts of the body so that those parts of the body will glow showing the tumor growth or shrinkage or also organ trouble topic sensing nanotechnology honor chip is one more dimension of lab-on-a-chip technology magnetic nanoparticles bound to a suitable antibody are used to label specific molecules structures or microorganisms in particular silica nanoparticles are inert from the photo physical point of view and might accumulate a large number of dyes within the nanoparticle shell gold nanoparticles tagged with short segments of DNA can be used for detection of genetic sequence in a sample multicolor optical coding for biological assays has been achieved by embedding different sized quantum dots into polymeric microbeads nanopore technology for analysis of nucleic acids converts strings of nucleotides directly into electronic signatures sensor test chips containing thousands of nano wires able to detect proteins and other biomarkers left behind by cancer cells could enable the detection and diagnosis of cancer in the early stages from a few drops of a patient's blood nanotechnology is helping to advance the use of arthroscope s' which are pencil sized devices that are used in surgeries with lights and cameras so surgeons can do the surgeries with smaller incisions the smaller the incisions the faster the healing time which is better for the patients it is also helping to find a way to make an arthroscope smaller than a strand of hair research on nano electronics based cancer diagnostics could lead to tests that can be done in pharmacies the results promised to be highly accurate and the product promises to be inexpensive could take a very small amount of blood and detect cancer anywhere in the body in about five minutes with a sensitivity that is a thousand times better a conventional laboratory test these devices that are built with nano wires to detect cancer proteins each nano wire detector is primed to be sensitive to a different cancer marker the biggest advantage of the nanowire detectors is that they could test for anywhere from 10 to 100 similar medical conditions without adding cost to the testing device nanotechnology has also helped to personalize oncology for the detection diagnosis and treatment of cancer it is now able to be tailored to each individual's two mer for better performance they have found ways that they will be able to target a specific part of the body that is being affected by cancer topic blood purification magnetic micro particles are proven research instruments for the separation of cells and proteins from complex media the technology is available under the name magnetic activated cell sorting or dynabeads among others more recently it was shown in animal models that magnetic nanoparticles can be used for the removal of various noxious compounds including toxins pathogens and proteins from whole blood in an extracorporeal circuit similar to dialysis in contrast to dialysis which works on the principle of the size related diffusion of solutes and ultrafiltration of fluid across a semipermeable membrane the purification with nanoparticles allows specific targeting of substances additionally larger compounds which are commonly not died eliza Balcon be removed the purification process is based on functionalized iron oxide or carbon coated metal nanoparticles with ferromagnetic or superparamagnetic properties binding agents such as proteins antibodies antibiotics or synthetic ligands are covalently linked to the particle surface these binding agents are able to interact with target species forming an agglomerate applying an external magnetic field gradient allows exerting a force on the nanoparticles hence the particles can be separated from the bulk fluid there by cleaning it from the contaminants the small size topic tissue engineering nanotechnology may be used as part of tissue engineering to help reproduce or repair or reshape damaged tissue using suitable nano material based scaffolds and growth factors tissue engineering if successful may replace conventional treatments like organ transplants or artificial implants nano particles such as graphene carbon nanotubes molybdenum disulfide and tungsten disulfide are being used as reinforcing agents to fabricate mechanically strong biodegradable polymer ik nano composites for bone tissue engineering applications the addition of these nanoparticles in the polymer matrix at low concentrations approximately 0.2 weight percent leads to significant improvements in the compressive and flexural mechanical properties of polymeric nano composites potentially these nano composites may be used as a novel mechanically strong lightweight composite as bone implants for example a flesh welder was demonstrate to fuse two pieces of chicken meat into a single piece using a suspension of gold coated nano shells activated by an infrared laser this could be used to weld arteries during surgery another example is nano nephrology the use of nano medicine on the kidney topic medical devices neuro electronic interfacing is a visionary goal dealing with the construction of nano devices that will permit computers to be joined and linked to the nervous system this idea requires the building of a molecular structure that will permit control and detection of nerve impulses by an external computer a refillable strategy implies energy is refilled continuously or periodically with external sonic chemical tethered magnetic or biological electrical sources while a non referable strategy implies that all power is drawn from internal energy storage which would stop when all energy is drained a nanoscale enzymatic bio fuel cell for self powered nano devices have been developed that uses glucose from bio fluids including human blood and water melons one limitation to this innovation is the fact that electrical interference or leakage or overheating from power consumption is possible the wiring of the structure is extremely difficult because they must be positioned precisely in the nervous system the structures that will provide the interface must also be compatible with the body's immune system molecular nanotechnology is a speculative subfield of nanotechnology regarding the possibility of engineering molecular assemblers machines which could reorder matter at a molecular or atomic scale nano medicine would make use of these nano robots introduced into the body to repair or detect damages and infections molecular nanotechnology is highly theoretical seeking to anticipate what inventions nanotechnology might yield and to propose an agenda for future inquiry the proposed elements of molecular nanotechnology such as molecular assembly and nano robots are far beyond current capabilities future advances in nano medicine could give rise to life extension through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging que Eric Drexler one of the founders of nano technology postulated cell repair machines including ones operating within cells and utilizing as yet hypothetical molecular machines in his 1986 book engines of creation with the first technical discussion of medical nano robots by Robert Freitas appearing in 1999 Raymond Kurtz viol a futurist and transhumanist stated in his book The Singularity is near that he believes that advanced medical nano robotics could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030 according to richard fineman it was his former graduate student and collaborator Albert Hibbs who originally suggested to him circa 1959 the idea of a medical use for fineman's theoretical Micro Machines see nanotechnology Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would in theory be possible to as Fineman put it swallow the doctor the idea was incorporated into fineman's 1959 sa there's plenty of room at the bottom equals equals see also
