 [Music] many of us are familiar with lego bricks that children play with to construct buildings and figures thanks to recent scientific developments scientists have developed something similar an atomic scale lego set made of 2d materials a 2d material consists of a single layer of atoms or molecules since the discovery of graphene a single layer of carbon atoms scientists have made many other two-dimensional materials with a broad spectrum of physical properties from insulators to semiconductors to superconductors with a library of 2d materials at their disposal scientists can assemble them like legos creating an atomic scale lego set the 2d materials link through weak electrostatic attractions known as van der waals forces by combining 2d materials scientists can build structures to improve the performance of electronic devices create materials with novel physical properties and discover quantum phenomena transistors are a fundamental component of electronic devices that control electrical signals nanoscale transistors can be manufactured using 2d materials which require a flat surface to achieve optimal performance scientists demonstrated that an atomic flat surface can be made by layering 2d material transistors on sheets of hexagonal boron nitrate and insulating 2d material these 2d material transistors built to extreme thinness offer a promising platform to build computers with enhanced power such as quantum computers resulting from the restricted range of motion and electron experiences 2d materials exhibit unique physical properties this can be understood by thinking of electrons as cars in 3d objects electrons are like flying cars that can avoid each other by moving through vertical space electrons in two-dimensional materials however are in constant gridlock because one electron's movement directly influences another's as a result the physical properties of 2d material are dominated by the nature of electron interactions the atomic scale lego set allows scientists to take advantage of these strong interactions to assemble structures that exhibit novel quantum phenomena for example by coupling two graphene layers in close proximity scientists have observed for the first time in 2d materials a phenomenon of super fluidity in which fluids flow without friction by stacking and twisting 2d materials not only are different materials interacting in new ways structures made of the same material are being arranged in patterns not possible in nature this is uncovering physical properties that the periodic table doesn't predict for example scientists recently showed that a new type of solid structure called amoria super lattice can be formed by rotating two monolayers relative to each other when the rotational angle is small between two 2d layers a fractal structure known as hofstadter's butterfly emerges at several special angles this fractal structure strongly modifies electronic behaviors unlocking new material properties one of these angles the so-called magic angle reveals a superconducting phase at low temperature superconductors can reduce the amount of energy converted into heat in electronic devices and create powerful electromagnets which have potential applications in transportation medical devices and telecommunication by choosing building blocks from a large family of 2d materials scientists now have endless opportunities to create future materials with novel physical properties which promise to transform everyday life you
