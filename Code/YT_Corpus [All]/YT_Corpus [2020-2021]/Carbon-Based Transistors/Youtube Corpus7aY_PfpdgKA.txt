 Dear Dino friends and electrical engineering Enthusiasts! Today we are evaluating the electric fence scene from jurassic park with "Scientific Aprovals". Okay, Sam Neill has already tested the voltage level of the dinosaur protection fence highly professional. Based on: First; visual inspection status led lamp is off OK melanie please measure me an acrobat button so thanks if status leds on that’s a good one indication that there is tension somewhere is pending when status leds are off this is not a clear indication for that actually no tension is coming in now tyrannosaurus enclosure and in this you can see the exciting scene tooth status shine in action and listen I have a couple of crown discharges sound effects well done respect only those Cars drive me to it it would be better to limit yourself there Passengers leave the cars at any time can and are not buckled up see I'm right again nobody could have predicted that third grand suddenly from one I often drive vehicle jumps already said that we are electric closes mechanisms for the vehicle doors carefully there comes mine by the way, girlfriend also died its the pendant thing for the wires the in operation or the voltage arc light signals give here shortly before of course ok the second tension test an obviously dry night so throw an isolator in safe insulation height by the way, here is the original script in english hypoxi basic cooking as logistics know sparks fly that means the current is probably switched off nada checks no that is not the power is switched off but there is no tension in the original by the way, grant says westminster is so bad german translation is yes a case of lost in translation if the voltage is then switched on may result from this electricity if you give the charge carriers one path you offer the mesh completed now everything is clear to me I think I should go on So start at the beginning of the explanation gives very good leaders extremely bad conductors and there are semiconductors semiconductors silicon would be such a material she already loves electricity can the conductivity of silicon too target it by doing this The drawing with a crisis one other elements spices disclaimer semiconductors not relevant for Electric fence problem is dead dryer is a very bad one conductor but a good insulator explanation is the same as with famous stunt as team ii with one amount of pyrotechnics backwards from electric fence flew when turned on became totally unrealistic he was namely just like the thrown branch float on the fence without contact with the earth he would just be on the 10 kv potential against earth birds also sit on the high voltage power line without a weight it 's only going to get dangerous for birds with large wings when fly or bird in a row isolation stretch sit there the birds but don't touch the earth it can so no closed circuit the current is created in the lines just flows under your feet without electrocuting them miss most of the time, however, the birds rather on the rope over the power lines down because there is no electricity at all the current is usually through the consumer set respectively it comes empirically according to the ocean law conditions there he is mario he is german he promised is resistant is electricity logically short repetition from the first video about electric fences in and pasture fence there is the pulse generator as energy source of a safe short that generates voltage impulses uncomfortable but not fatal pluspol is connected to the fence and the minus pole will go to earth plowed in the pasture fence using the the wire is part of the fence hot wire that is where the tension and the greater the current feedback earth can also along the pasture fence by several honors flake and underground cables are reinforced the body a living being's resistance then the circuit ultimately closed the higher the body's resistance the more lower the resulting body current according to the law above it also means that less bulky love knowledge with a smaller body resistance to getting higher currents and in most cases, such tolerate smaller lives have been the other way round even less electricity the threshold from the body currents viewed as critical in humans will be 30 milliamps again trust that is also one of the discussion points of the electrical systems at the old jurassic park the nut is available in a very wide range scatter of body resistances debate and that is right here noticed and are for a tyrannosaurus 10,000 volt shock still mild but something is with the smaller dinosaurs with the triceratops or the stegosaurus it can do not accept that the little dinos then be killed and the big one anyway it comes out there they have think about something better for example muzzles or high walls should be made of reinforced concrete and that enclosure is adequately secured have the best civil engineers in the world or futuristic high security balls made of transparent material with which you can roll through the whole park can and can look at everything closely without being eaten amazing machine really science progress always wins maybe progress should to lose but what does science say to you? pretend we're all scientists they would have gone mad security protection google this protects additionally store drinking glass so hard that his 50 caliber bullet if the cinemas had come technology cell phones would be fresh at any time are diverse don't have to worry help is coming there are not many visitors 22 1216 what incidents yes six children in the missing place 28 person with heat stroke when you are at we will only be eaten at nobody will have an incident here eaten why is the western plain closed order implants with electroshock functions like invisible are today but it's supposed to be fail-safe for the second time this month longer to put the lot your implants if you do the damage on it the implant generates one electric shock if you are too close to a fence comes that is the local implant you has left out how does she know how to do that she knew where you used it here is key to a happy life to accept that you actually have none control relax double secured lock a gate instead of simply fence through that even if cheaper there just can break through yes or These electric shock rifles are something sometimes with an arc effect no movement but maybe you get one of then of course I would have to have them first I learn the one with it now so see me know protection against electric shock base isolation and additional connection of all metal housing with the protective conductor and automatic shutdown in the event of a fault you get at dino protection electric bins in the conflict of course I mean what is the error case so as not to to interpret a lot in that is a film that any have thought up screenwriters I of course did my homework and you can see that clearly in the film this fence doesn't help - at least get out of it either way t-rex the tyrannosaurus persists somehow then the rule is still certain to the schedule of the park oh man like me it's always right this warns of us and if we don't be careful they still have tighten the t rex will also pay sheep called you are cute I would like to ask everyone to keep calm and what about pterodactyls? focus on an emergency the deliverers I fly into the light what the hell is maybe you are looking for another one places and what about swimming dinosaurs I know to get to know very calmly they can handle dinosaurs well yes, like all animals, they are respected you respect them though nevertheless, depending on the animal species choose the right amperage German electrical engineering had one din norm with relevant safety regulations published and it says barbed wire is prohibited because of the risk of injury for humans and animals we come to the last tried sam neill the voltage freedom of the electro to test stuff third, self-sacrificing touch Check small tip on the edge I've been to a switchgear slash substation and you can based on his body hair the presence of electrical fields large separate loads are the same tensions practically fill the hair adjust to that is almost like that bonus sensory organ if you have the right one It doesn't have dipole-containing hair either too long and not too short and back too 30 park 10 the dino fence the one at the same time chain link fence is also something depending on the species, the number of animals is taken wires and optimal height for poultry chickens are the descendants of the dinosaur i read your book did they really mean in dinosaurs wings that they were a few may have developed like this they have already developed in this direction to have I find it at all and at poultry does not rotate but a net So you have a chain link fence done right in the film mesh well anyway the dino fence has one rated voltage of 10,000 volts so 10 kv casey dc cleaned or permanently none but it would be important to know it is also the right frequency set price question what is the most dangerous current in ampere or voltage in volt exactly the one imprinted in the body amount of energy in joules or wat seconds in slowly endless hands without cable including the finger r rated limit bodychecks history great also whoever that made up awesome you can also see that the fence almost up almost down to the floor so far that the protagonists don't go through below you can clearly see the head here is too thick for the knitting hand tennis but still possible nice to see we have to find a passage here furthermore, the fence insists on one concrete base probably less good directs the whole must be so designed that there is no flashover of 10 kv at the bottom of the taunus with the surroundings unfortunately sam neill doesn't come either pages the horizontal more quickly wires are very robust from that mesh wire mesh rather less a thin one there are also pillars of insulators the hot wire So I found it for a share to hold the electric fence wire moment somehow it looks like this as if very full of little innovation there is no distance to the floor unless this thin wires are not at all field of tension but they look like why not around metal wires at least the tension of the film too they decide to get over climb good decision so again to repeat the five safety rules being the order the main thing is to activate it made it was rather accidental though for the tension of the film pun and the plot is irreplaceable You can go all day for three days from this room with very little control personnel do you believe that an automatic one children's game is very strange what that security system which then turns on however, that a couple of systems was temporarily switched off there are you want what i going on in whole teeth are teeth again please god damn it i hate this one would have been worse can be much worse There is enough electricity around the barrier fending off the streets dear dinosaurs as long as this light is green up there nothing happens, there are several deal with installation of all times now has no this is sure here then secure it against being switched on again The point here runs essentially in the film wrong because they try all the time to switch the thing on again maybe then we'll switch off fuse crazy we have to just a shadow where are they backups in wörther at the other end of the area in three minutes i got in whole park again electricity don't wait any longer it went wrong i go over and put the electricity that is not Understand the walk on Sunday afternoons so now she just us nothing rush what about the accessibility here in this film the electrical equipment must do so be arranged so far as it is the following may be necessary check accessibility for operation visit and service repair I think that's the one again tension to the victim so please the film tension that's a little bit complicated that to turn on church law but i think i can read the plan and give you instructions by radio given we have to go get it about the situation we are discussing when I am back give me everything okay I'm in there right in front of you is one metal stairs they go down after about eight to ten meters composition of the t-junction there gisela look i know how to make a plan reads expect a moment wait at the moment you have it probably have to turn right and then they come with follow then and children this is not a competition then we want to and over what the two know him hold on to what I adhere to also a film fathers or at least one mistake in the erection the facility in jurassic park the emergency control because if there is one the danger is immediately necessary interrupt the power supply an interruption facility like this that they are built quickly recognized and simple and fast can be operated quickly and easily she could no longer handle the switch flip the lever several times move it up and down it works big and flat order could position is below green button that says pusch douglas press the red buttons the individual systems of the park was dirty goes too you are right that can chemistry as brisk we already had potential but let's look at frame for again frame exactly on the pyrotechnics for happiness is the spark in one a certain distance next to teenagers ducks is really pyrotechnics just like that yes and just to clarify that an arc actually looks like this and arises especially at switch off large electrical stream and the filmmakers even have a fence hanging palm leaves with pyrotechnics provide what is actually senseless that is despite with so much love and made true to detail that is that I could never get protection against thermal effects the electrical system must be set up in such a way that from her no risk of inflammation flammable materials due to high temperature or an electric light arches but then only goes out itself half as spectacular from additional may during normal operation of the electrical equipment persons and I use the dinos there is also no danger of using animals to be exposed to burns abbot 230 milliamp internal burns cell destruction and packaging hofer cooking is a term from chemistry now it gets a bit chemical thermal when taking place decomposition of breathing difficulties and unconsciousness from 30 milliamps let go of the border from 10 milliampere so what was going on in that film this is a clear film mistake first, he wouldn't have let go can let go here threshold of 10 milliamps is used for males adult accepted adoption 5 billion per applies to the whole population interesting interesting the is posted under a bow had been passed out and could not breathe more but before that would not have let go to fly that far but no matter he gave to everyone case survived it's what happened to him probably a cardiovascular system stopped because passed out and respiratory arrest ok emergency plan hlw also CPR 30 times chest compressions and ventilate twice script is grant is performance ipa com pressing team is just 15 times quickly and thriving in this ID most likely there are still 15 and not 30 times that was still a child Children's hearts still beat something faster than adults is probably because of that otherwise the site reviews medical electrical was successfully carried out by sam neill it goes on nothing will happen Here the children could do it better bring the jurassic park as one dinosaur expert i am magician that's my job now that was no magic magic is really that was just a feat that agree to the hair after mountains appointment would have to be grounded again the hair falling back means as finished human act checked briefly but the hairstyle looks okay again out a wonderful story to end this madness I have to be crazy by then I thought about it a lot get through I don't fear this power join them so i would set up this dinosaur parks as grossly negligent classify me this park here I wanted people and staff bring that no illusion is something the reality is you will see them and can touch that is a noble motive and such you can't understand something with that approach you are right you are right absolutely right life finds a way the dino here belongs to my little one brother had europe in 1993 in cologne I actually bought that too a thing such a long neck but that somehow my mother expires got enough replacement so I don't I'm sad when I'm scared have he has been here for so long nothing 11 what else did I want to tell you were some electrical engineering film error yes i know if you im I have a lot of movies now I use feature film scenes to link aldi is available on youtube see for a small fee and me claim it's fair use because of public education and international production is the name of enjoyed I also agree directly I already have times films made on the subject of film just look at the scientific exam theme star trek and pregnancy and Emma on the topic of Star Trek Birth Contractions scientifically analyzed so completely another topic but that is now also in the space that stayed from above that should tell and in here this book is also one scientifically proven film scene and from the movie star wars episode 8 the past year the recession has rather gone vacuum of space was blown and survived anyway and all things there is reference in the book too he sees a bit like an operator therefore like him secretly too lovingly call it strangely bony and moves slightly curved and after leaning forward like that were operators maybe really love the nut as well as lots of advertising done everything possible I also have references to them bought everything myself or me I got a gift - that's it Then now I think this is a interesting format film scenes scientifically review and therefore if anyone soon film sees where any electrotechnical facts was presented a bit strange then think of me and share it with me somehow then I can do that look at that's a quick snapper who can even open your mouth Katharina mostly works now close
