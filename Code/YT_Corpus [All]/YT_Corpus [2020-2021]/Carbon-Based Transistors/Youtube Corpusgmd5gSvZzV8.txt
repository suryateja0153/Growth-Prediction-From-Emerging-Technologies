 one of the problems we face is the lack of a rapid test to detect SARS curve to the virus that causes curve in nineteen the nations that have instituted widespread testing have fared better in the current pandemic they've been able to identify those individuals who have been infected with the virus and tracked down their close contacts for quarantine we require an inexpensive mass-produced test for rapid screening the conventional test for the virus is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or rt-pcr this involves prep work in the lab to isolate the viral RNA make a DNA copy from the RNA template and then make multiple copies of DNA using polymerase chain reaction from sample collection to result that tests usually takes a few hours to a couple of days this new discovery is very exciting a group of scientists in the Republic of Korea have created a bio sensor for SARS co2 they designed a device that would detect the spike protein which is displayed on the outside of the virus particle the graphene field effect transistor or G Fett was derivatized with antibodies for the spike protein this discovery is a marriage of several disciplines including electronics nano fabrication chemistry and biology to address a pressing medical need let's take a closer look at how they did this the team took advantage of the remarkable electronic properties of graphene graphene is a sheet of carbon a single atom of thick its structure is like an extended network of benzene rings the freely mobile electrons and the conjugated PI bonds create a highly conductive material to construct a graphene based transistor the team used established nano fabrication techniques they used a wet transfer method to deposit graphene onto a silicon dioxide substrate channels were formed in the graphene layer using photolithography and reactive ion etching forming orderly patterns of graphene on the substrate then the metal electrodes were added using a thin film deposition and liftoff method in this way graphene bridges the source and drain electrodes each transistor measured 100 by 100 microns at this point the graphene was ready to be derivatives to make a kovat 19 sensor let's zoom in to see what's going on at the molecular level the graphene was soaked with a pea base solution p-bass is a linker that contains a pyrene group that non-covalently attaches to graphene through pi PI stacking at the other end is an activated ester which reacts with the means then they added the SARS Cove to spike protein antibody which reacted with the linker to form a chemical bond after the graphene was derivatized with antibody they could test their devices sensitivity their design used a buffered water droplet with an electrode as the transistors gate a so called aqueous solution gated FET now if a voltage is applied across the source and drain electrodes a current flow through the graphene layer can be measured as a function of the gate voltage next they tested whether their transistor would respond to the spiked protein the spike protein bound to the antibodies of high affinity this event changes the charge distribution in the immediate vicinity of the graphene layer thus changing its electrical conductivity the change in conductivity alters the amount of current that can flow between the source and drain electrodes they established a third advice could detect the spike protein down to one femto gram per milliliter a very high sensitivity next they tested the response to related but distinct spike protein from the MERS virus they found that their sensor had no response to this spike protein establishing that their G FET sensor was specific for kovat 19 then they established that the sensor could detect the whole virus there G fed sensor detected concentrations as low as 16 pfu per milliliter a PF View is a unit defining the number of virus particles they also showed that addition of higher concentrations of virus gave a linear increase in response to top it all off they took an actual swab sample from makovan 19 patient and demonstrated that their device could detect the virus even if diluted down 100,000 fold the higher the concentration of virus in the sample the greater signal they saw in their bio sensor they carried out the negative control experiment also a swab sample from a healthy uninfected person showed no response this critical experiment demonstrated proof of concept that the device could be used to distinguish between healthy and infected people this research team has designed and constructed the first kovat 19 bow sensor based on G FET technology they have demonstrated that their device is fast selective and highly sensitive what's more they can detect virus directly from patients Wahb samples without lengthy sample prep in the lab the device has not been approved by regulatory agencies for diagnostic use in people yet a number of validation studies establishing the stability of the test will need to be carried out first congratulations to the research team for making a timely and impactful contribution and thank you for watching [Music]
