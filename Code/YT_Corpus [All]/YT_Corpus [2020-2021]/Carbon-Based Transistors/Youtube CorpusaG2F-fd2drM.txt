 Welcome everyone to the 2DCC webinar here on March 24th today we have dr. Deep Jariwala from University of Pennsylvania he is a system professor of electrical and systems engineering and also materials science and engineering today he'll give a talk on photovoltaics with Van der Waals semiconductors: promising or pipe dream handing it over to you Dr. Jariwala Alright well thank you Eric, Kevin and Joan and everyone for inviting me and giving me this opportunity and thanks to everyone for attending I hope all of you are keeping safe and healthy outside your shelters so let me get started with this this talk or webinar and what I would like to focus today is on a photovoltaic van der Waals semiconductors and I've been sort of working in this area for some time and you know this is probably the first time that I'm giving this kind of a long talk on just for the voltaics to make it more like a tutorial type talk so what I want to get across in this talk is not just my own results but also sort of how do we look at this field of this very novel semiconductor materials and how does it fit with the photovoltaic application and what are sort of the prospects both in terms of practical applications as well as basic science for these materials in in this application domain which is photovoltaics or light harvesting moving forward so i'm going to be a little bit shameless and do a little bit of self-promotion of my own lab at the beginning and that you know my lab is sort of divided into broadly four areas and one of these areas is sort of nanoelectronic or purely electronic devices that we don't shine any light we work on memory devices tunneling sets triode devices you know of course that euler field effect transistors in this part of the troop and of course most of our devices include some kind of 2D semiconductor and we've recently started having some work published out at this especially just yesterday we had our first paper at this area sort of come out and now letters feel free to take a look at it the of course the other area that we work on is a nanophotonics which is the fundamental photonics phenomena as well as applied to phenomena such as photovoltaics and this is what I'll be focusing most of my talk on today I will mention a little bit about how fundamental nanophotonics can feed into some of the interesting perspectives on photovoltaic state 2D semiconductors and we also look a little bit into near-field scanning probe microscopy coupled with optical spectroscopy such as it had been a strong one and typical photo luminescence as well as we have some presence in the area of in-situ electron beam micro spectroscopy this is mainly in collaboration with Eric Stack here at Penn and we also have some efforts and growth in synthesis of course it is very small effort compared to what 2DCC has and you know they're not even close over there but hopefully we'll be having some interesting results to share on that front in the coming years so as I said I'll be focusing most of my talk on the photovoltaic devices out of two dimensional semiconductors maybe another day or next year or something like that I would I'll be happy to give a separate webinar on nano electronics and future prospects of 2D semiconductors at that domain so what I would like to get started which is assuming that you know most of the people attending they know very well about 2D materials and 2D semiconductors but maybe not everyone is familiar with the application of photovoltaics and of course and that field is and it I think it is very easy to see that you know photovoltaics or solar energy sort of the dominant source of energy available which is not very well harvested and I think this one sentence just makes the case for me which is ninety minutes of sunshine is roughly equal to annual global energy consumption of all of humankind right so all you need is a very small fraction of the of the incident solar power every day to be harvested to basically fulfill our energy needs for time for indefinitely rustling so with that said I believe everyone could also know that modern photovoltaic technology is dominated by silicon just like modern micro electronics is 99% silicon modern photovoltaics is also I would say definitely more than 95% silicon right and the reason silicon is dominant is because we have figured out how to produce large area and very high quality of single crystal silicon and you know we have learned our lessons very well from micro electronics and all the know-how that we had in micro electronics we have transferred it to making a very high quality and cheap silicon for photovoltaics and this has resulted in tremendous gains in terms of improving efficiency and also sort of lowering down the cost which is the most critical component and I will touch upon a little bit on to why cost is very important is because if you want to sort of have a mass market technology this is what really matters for photovoltaics right if you in fact believe any of the data coming out of US Energy Information Administration as well as what DOE he has been saying for a while is that if you look at solar PV just the economies of scale as it kicks in the price is going to keep falling such that it is going to pick up cost compared to with natural gas as well as coal which are non-renewable energy sources and this loss prediction made in 2015 for 2020 and if you look at the more recent one I was presenting this data a few months ago and somebody said that this data is old so I looked up new data on the right-hand side now I have newer data again from USEIA there in terms of 2019 dollars per megawatt hour once again you know for different regions natural gas versus onshore wind versus solar photovoltaics have been compared and these predictions are for 2020 to 2025 2040 and you can clearly see that you know solar photovoltaic sort of becoming competitive these other technologies especially natural gas which is non-renewable you know this is the fossil fuel so it's sort of important over there and so you know all this is mainly because the price of silicon photovoltaics has fallen tremendously while the efficiencies have also remained consistently high even while scaling up and so this begs the question right that why would any of the researchers doing research in novel materials for solar energy should be doing research right from a sheer economic perspective the problem is solved you just keep scaling silica up further and further and you would be able to address everything but you know I'm going to pull up this ugly looking chart of NREL that everyone gives us photovoltaic presentation gives you there are many many new materials and technologies where people have been doing photovoltaic research and there must be some reason behind it and you know we'll get to some of those reasons soon but beyond silicon of course there are three five semiconductors and they've also been known for a long time and of course there are many thin film and an emerging PV technologies and the sort of key metric to understand over here is that for a large-scale commercial application this unit matters dollars per megawatt hour in other words you want your technology to be as cheap as possible or your cells to be as cheap as possible and there should be as efficient as possible only then you can minimize this metric right and so if you look at this chart yes there are a lot of very very promising technologies many of them are much more efficient than silica especially the double junction and the three five semiconductors are they cheaper than silicon? No, so therefore it doesn't quite fly then the question comes up more of emerging technology and some of them have been there for a very long time such as organic photovoltaics one of the main reasons why perovskite photovoltaics is becoming so popular and they are being considered serious candidates is because not only they are cheap but they they can reach efficiencies comparable to that of silica and therefore they you can now start making the case for them. Dr. Jariwala we have a question that's pertinent right now the question is why photovoltaics? Well, I can't get the context of the question just from two words but I'm trying to get there. Hello? Go ahead. Okay all right yeah okay so the point that I was trying to make is that if you want to then look at two-dimensional semiconductors there is sort of an interesting comparison to make over here in terms of both efficiencies as well as pricing right I mean with the chalcogenide semiconductors that everybody would be familiar with they would be as expensive to make or grow or scale up over large areas as say the three five or compound semiconductors that is on the other hand their efficiencies are nowhere close as you will see in this talk and so they don't really lie in this picture of being cost competitive or efficiency competitive with with any of the known technologies let alone silicon and so it's really hard to make a case for them in terms of terrestrial commercial solar power but you could make a case for them for other types of photovoltaic applications photovoltaic applications or energy harvesting applications where you know silicon or all of the other known technologies have certain disadvantages such as they cannot be flexible silicon in particular cannot be very flexible it isn't it is and therefore it is it is more difficult to implant-- for example also in applications where your fate is very important silicon can be really happy and I'll get to that very soon that there will be to be a real challenge to employ silicon based cells of course then there are technologies such as organic BBs and polymer BBs which can be the more flexible but they have their own disadvantages in that they have lifetime and humidity and a degradation issue so okay so what I want to get to the point is that there are some applications where you could have you could do away with bulk silicon or three five semiconductors and here novel semiconductors could have a real advantage but then the argument could be made is that you know they are it's a very small and niche market do you get anything valuable out of them and so towards that line we have been looking at a more sort of out there technology which is a space-based solar power and when I talk about space-based solar power I'm not talking about powering the International Space Station or satellite but actually looking at putting square kilometer rays of solar cells in space or harvesting or harnessing the solar energy and then beaming it out back to earth in the millimeter wave radiation atmospheric transparency window such that it can be received by a return on the ground and can be then can be stored in say batteries or directly transmitted and then there are several advantages of solar technology of course this is not a new concept this is known for many many years in fact there were Russians who had predicted this back in the 70s you could do something like this and the there are the main advantages over here is of course you have higher solar flux outlet upper space there is of course no night time if you put in the right orbit and believe it or not if you use the atmospheric transparency window to transmit T electromagnetic energy down back to earth it's actually way more efficient than putting transmission lines so for example if you wanted to transfer your energy into a remote location say for example a hurricane hit one of the islands like it happened in Puerto Rico and the entire grid sort of dies down and if you just have to attend has to sort of receive this power you can beam the power remotely to any location likewise for say military applications where in remote locations you don't have a grid and you want to directly beam power to them for something like that space-based technology which can by use of phased arrays you can direct the power where you want can be quite beneficial so this is what we have been primarily looking at from this particular application and of course there are companies as well as people in the defense agencies there are quite interested in something like this and so if you want to consider anything which is you know up in space the critical thing or even for aerospace applications or airplane applications debate becomes certainly very important because one of the most expensive components of shipping something up in space is actually the shipping cost right and so forth for such an application you can do away with a very low efficiency solar cell but what you do not want is actually a heavy source so the key metric over here is power per weight and if you want to compare the power per weight for all your favorite technologies of solar cells you can you can plot them the way I have shown on this plot and you'll quickly see that you know all you have to do is take the word ultra-thin and keep inserting it in front of your favorite technology and you can go up by orders of magnitude of this logarithmic scale over here and so if you want to think or have some sense of comparison over here you'll notice that even for these some of the thinnest organics are kirovsk our technology is the active layer thickness isn't there are still pretty large it's a few hundred nanometers so to speak so they're still pretty thick cells and so the you know we wanted to think about as well as I think the community wants to think about are there materials that can push these limits even further can you do it and I'm going to make some arguments where I you see that you know some of the 2D’s semiconductors are pretty much the only known candidates that have all these properties together okay and so a good part of my talk would be also be taking cues from this perspective that we published two, three years ago now where we have this is sort of different than most review articles it's sort of a more forward-looking perspective where we have done a bunch of calculations and sort of protected what are the things that you would really need to do in order to make van der Waal semiconductors to be viable photovoltaics feel free to look it up and you'll find that many of the figures are used are taken from this article and so the real challenge for us when we started thinking about this was that can you take the bulb solar cells that you would normally put in space and turn them down to automatically thin solar cell while maintaining some kind of efficiency you don't want the efficiency to be completely close to zero it has to have a decent efficiency and then it has to be very 10 in order for the ratio of power per weight ratio to go up and so the question that we had was can you efficiently trap and harvest light anatomically it's in semi, so again this is a community that would know very well about atomically thin semiconductor so I don't want to go into too much detail about introducing the materials themselves but I'm talking about transition metal dichalcogenides of Mali and tungsten that is what I'm going to focus most of the talk on of course I'll give out some hints about what other materials might also come into play or picture function as very good 2D semiconductors photovoltaics moving forward and so what I want to do is sort of go back into the past and sort of see when did people actually started or start thinking about MOS 2 WS 2 and the like as photovoltaic materials and this was way before I was born in 1981 there were people in the University of Ottawa Fortin and Sears for trying to use MOS2 for photovoltaic and they reported photovoltaic effect an optical absorption in it and they were able to see some very nice photo response and what they had essentially made was some kind of Schottky Junction solar cells of various metal contacts made on top of bulk and wash to crystals and then they did some temperature dependent measurements where they measured the open circuit voltage and short circuit current of the photovoltaic and and then they were able to see some values well what their best selves were basically copper poly disulfide Schottky Junction cells that they had about one percent efficiency at once on each other they were not very good cells of obviously but what caught my eye was this very last sentence in the paper is that MOS 2 is expected to be a suitable material for photovoltaic solar cells because of its direct bandgap well situated at one point ATV it's void spectral range of photo response made possible by a favorable distribution of absorption coefficient value and it's easy availability you know they were obviously from Canada and Canada has the giant deposits of MOS2 in the ground so maybe it was easily available at the time I guess most of our bulk crystals early on in the community also came from mined which were directly mined from the ground so it's certainly possible and what does the last sentence it says over here that is quite possible that higher efficiency that more convenient temperatures will be obtained following a more determined effort to produce a (inaudible) it's quite a nice outlook over here and you know back in 1980s itself - somebody had thought about this and what they had identified nominally was that the absorption was in the right range and the bandgap was in the right range which is sort of important for this I'll fast forward about thirty years or so and then when the field of two dimensional semiconductors errupted people started making all kinds of photo detector and photovoltaic devices out of them from exfoliated or scotch tape exfoliated flakes again and these are some of the earliest reports over here where Paula Barbara back in 2013 demonstrated again with a very similar concept just Schottky Junction but now we have asymmetric Schottky junctions or in other words one Omega and one Schottky contact and so you can use these asymmetric metals which is both and palladium shine light on it and you end up seeing some photovoltaic like effect so that there you go you know they can be used as photovoltaic semiconductors we went on right after that in the same year this was that I was doing my PhD we prove that this you know effect is mainly localized at the contact because of the Schottky Junction and that it does indeed photovoltaic in nature because as you apply the bias you can kill the photovoltaic at the contact so certainly it was true after that of course there was an explosion in the amount of research on opto electronic devices broadly speaking from 2D semiconductors and you know be if you look at the photo detector plus photovoltaic research in this this community it can be sort of divided into you know a few sections I'm highlighting a couple over here which are basically in-plane junctions and out-of-plane junctions as we'll get to very quickly in the structure of a solar cell you need some kind of a PN Junction to basically get for the voltage out and you can make these PN junctions in plane or you can make them out of plane of course the 2DCC Center and the community knows the knows about making these junctions are very very well and of course then you can have homo Junction versus hetero Junction that people have looked at a few ways of making hetero junctions and a few ways of making homo junctions because they are atomic in nature you can use electrostatic doping to also make homojunctions or you can actually use substitutional doping for hetero junctions again people have tried different techniques growing one on top of the other or stacking one on top of the other which is what we do as well as sort of making heterojunctions with other 3D semiconductors just silicon or gallium arsenide or indium phosphide and some people have also tried to do selective doping of the few top layers into P type of naturally and type occurring crystals to make these vertical homo Junction so again I don't want to offend anyone over here there's a large amount of research that has been done in this area I cannot possibly cover every each and every piece of literature that people have sort of put out there but I'm going to highlight some to sort of show you sort of the spread of what kind of researchers people have done and showing early research on photovoltaics from 2D semiconductors because there was this early work again in 2013 about sandwiching TMDs AWS - or WIC - between two sandwiches of graphene and the one graphene was more highly doped than the other so this was okayed in some sense an asymmetric PN Junction which was showing for the voltaic effect as I mentioned on the previous slide people have also used split gates and by using the split gate on a intrinsic semiconductor you can induce one side to be P and other side to be N depending on the gate bias you apply or neither of the split gate and then you can generate a photovoltaic effect likewise people have found that you know you can have type two junctions from between MOS 2 and WSE2 two of the most popular combinations and when you start the vertical you can get a photovoltaic effect likewise people have tried to grow them laterally or stitch them and plane people have also observed photovoltaic effect of that so that is also there has also been a lot of work in that area and finally there a lot of work has been also focused on integrating MOS2 or other chalcogenides not directly with silicon or gallium arsenide or indium phosphide what has been unclear and even organic semiconductors and quantum dots but what has been unclear over here is is in most cases it is unknown how much of the efficiency actually comes from the silicon or 3 5 of the organic component at the post well stew overall broadly speaking I would say that most of these devices are sort of you know proof of concept demonstration it is like no there's like no useful efficiency over there most of them have efficiencies in the one percent or support percent range and many of these devices are just proof of concept that you can see a photovoltaic effect this includes all the way from the Schottky junctions to these sophisticated split gate and PN Junction right so the real question you want to ask is that if you look from the photovoltaic community's perspective what are the things did you want to do to actually make these semiconductors into useful photovoltaics right and again it feeds back into the application that I was telling you earlier and how does all of this sort of tie together and so what I want to get to is again give a very brief primer on what are the materials in device design criteria one should consider if you want to really design a high performance so there are sort of three major criteria that I'll go over and then I will explain why some of the 2D semiconductor is sort of satisfy a lot of these things, first is the first light absorption you want your material to absorb as much light as possible right so if you want to absorb or maximize that absorption of course you want your material to have a certain amount of thickness so you have maximum interaction of the light with the material right minimize absorption losses at the same time you want your once the light is absorbed it generates electron hole pairs and these electron hole pairs have to get collected and to get collected they have to pass through this to have to pass through the semiconductors into the contacts and if you want to sort of minimize the losses over there you want to have your material as pure as possible but we all know that no material is ever fully pure there are always defects which can lead to recombination and therefore loss of light and loss of electrical power to sort of avoid something like this you want to minimize the amount of distance that your carriers need to travel and otherwise you or in other words you want to sort of reduce this dimension over here and this has been sort of a challenge and you know this is something that is known in Silicon as well as 3 5 semiconductor community and the people have tried to do this by so-called optical or photonic design where we are they have tried to minimize the thickness of the semiconductor and then incorporated optical elements such as resonators or mirrors to have the incoming light bounced around inside multiple times and get fully absorbed many of this these techniques have not paid the rich dividends because most of the semiconductors this has been tried on are this 3D semiconductors where or such as silicon or gallium arsenide whereas if you start reducing the thickness of course you are going to increase surface to volume ratio and all surfaces are basically unmacerated for 3D semiconductors there are dangling bonds always and they lead to massive recombination and reduction in efficiencies if you don't believe me just go ahead and try to google up and see if you find efficient 200 nanometer take silicon or gallium arsenide or any of these solar cells you will see that you know efficiencies are below 0.1% for many so so but there is a clear to challenge over there and so if you just compare these two criteria over here in one case you want to maximize that absorption in other case you want to minimize the current degradation right and to do both of this is sort of challenging and I will try to address how how that may be possible with some of these atomic to thick materials the final criteria that comes in is of course the potential that we generate across yourself and this depends on the open circuit voltage and this open circuit voltage is dependent on the band alignment in the PN Junction or band alignment of the contact along with the metal contact along with the semiconductor and so there are a few things to look over there what I will say is that these two sort of the first two criteria sort of go together and to realize that you basically want semi conductors that can maintain an extremely high electronic and optical quality while being extremely thin okay so you even if even if you reduce the thickness you don't want the electronic quality to degrade or in other words they should maintain passivated surfaces and we know this is possible because we know you can make a very nice transistor as well as get very nice PL another optical property is from even more layers of transition metal types of columns so you do maintain very high electronic optical quality down to monolayers in 2D materials so this this criteria is fulfilled by them and therefore they become sort of an interesting case study over here the third one is a more difficult criteria and this is something that I will touch upon as you get towards the end of the presentation that why most of the research would be needed in this direction if you want to make something practical out of them in fact to give you a sense for most practical photovoltaic technologies such as silicon or gallium arsenide or any of the other ones the voltage engineering has been the most daunting challenge and most of the research in so the more mature photovoltaic technologies is focused around optimizing small voltage rather than light trapping for current collection okay so going back to the first property which is absorption how does transition metal hydroxides compared to other photovoltaic technologies well the good news is that they really have very high absorption coefficient semiconductors known, more than organics all that six ten times more than gallium arsenide more than 400 times more than silicon right but this is quite good that we naturally have very highly absorbing materials and so certainly they should they should at least be investigated for photovoltaic applications the other thing is of course the parent gap of Bogg TM pcs wise in this 1.34 around 1.3 4 TB which is the shockley-queisser limit or detailed balance model given number which tells you at what bandgap you will have the maximum in sort of power conversion efficiencies of the solar spectrum right the other important aspect about the optical constants is that not not just they have very high absorption coefficient which is nothing but the extinction coefficient of K in the the optical constants but they also have extremely high refractivity so the N is also the only high you look at the N over here the N value is even sub gap on more than 4 and N is the real part of refractive index for attractive in Texas we just call it so the opticals are also ordinarily high how do these optical constants compare to solve the other materials where here they are compared to silicon you can see that where you are WS2 or subsidize sulphide starts absorbing at the exciton over here K is already 1 whereas where silicon should ideally start absorbing which is close to 1.1 EV you sit and see that the K is almost seen very close to zero you can't even see it on this linear scale and of course there is a this is one of the main difference why you know tungsten disulfide some 500 times more absorbent than silica even in terms of refractive index tungsten disulfide has much higher refractive index then I'm showing you just one example of roughness of fat over here it's sort of sort of similar ballpark for all the major semiconducting TM PCs likewise if you consider for say gallium arsenide which as a moor which is a bandgap range which is sort of more comparable to the bandgap values of sulfide once again you see that the K values of tungsten disulfide of quite as much higher and N values are also higher and so not only it can absorb more but N is sort of a measure of how easily you can trap light into it and so there is a definite of advantage over there as well here is some comparison of optical constants and here first I would like to compare absorption coefficient of the four major semiconducting TMD’s is that most people focus on for our electronic applications and I would like to compare these optical constants to say gallium arsenide or Roth's cards which are again very popular at promising and then silicon and you can clearly see that the absorption coefficient across the spectrum in the visible part where we really care about are higher than all of these and so this really matters the other important metric to sort of compare is known as loss tangent and loss tangent is nothing but the ratio of imaginary part of epsilon or permittivity to the real part of permittivity and it's a measure of how effectively one can disapprove trap electromagnetic energy in a medium or in other words how well can you sort of make a light absorb into this material via any kind of a nanophotonic design so this is sort of the function of loss tangent and you again see that you know compared to silicon which is near the close to x axis over here the TMD’s are much much higher so really they are promising if you want to trap light at them okay so this is what we started out to sort of investigate that would it be easy to trap light into two-dimensional semiconductors and then think about making a photovoltaic out of them now this idea that the N is high is actually a pain sometimes in terms of light trappings because if the refractive index is really high then if you have a bog crystal such as WRC2 as many of you may know the crystal is really shiny it's like graphite it reflects back most of the light so even though we hear about this all the time that a monolayer can absorb 10 to 12 percent of the light it's not like 10 layers are going to absorb the light in fact it's just saturates out at 40 percent and because they mismatch in refractive index between air and the tmd the refractive index of TMD is so high that by the time you reach to ten or fifteen layers it is reflecting back back it is reflecting back most of the light not absorbing as much and this is why you see your wall crystals to be shiny like graphite right and so for over a few nanometers thick TMDC’s you are going to limit your absorption to ten to fifteen percent if you are very thin or if you are very thick you are going to limit it to about 40 percent and most of the light will get reflected or transmitted right and this is what you are stuck with and so for if you really want to trap light and do it you have to start thinking about more creative ways and I'll talk about it a little bit later of how people have tried with various different ways to trap light in TMDC’s but what you want to do is to find a way which is easy to do if it requires a large amount of micro and nanofabrication then it's probably going to add to the cost card to the weight maybe lead to more defects or residue on top of the material that could kill photovoltaic efficiencies and therefore you want to stick to a simple offer technique as possible fortunately because index is high absorption coefficient is also high you can take advantage of just fabry-perot one I would say lossy fabry-perot light trapping mechanism where you can take a mirror like material say gold or silver and we have generalized this more unpublished results to even like drag metal pipe structures and if you just put a TMD layer two nanometers thick on top of this kind of reflecting substrate as the light comes in it already starts undergoing absorption and as it starts going absorption that is of call a phase shift as well and then it gets reflected and then it tries to come back up and it comes back up it is undergone a certain amount of phase shift and so with the incoming wave it can undergo destructive interference and actually get resolutely absorbed into the structure again and even if it does not absorb because this mismatch in refractive index is so high it can again be bounced back inside it you can have an almost hundred-percent trapping without the need of any nano fabrication this is sort of important a lot of people have figured out a ways to trap light and all kinds of materials it most of these things require some kind of edging the patterning putting on plus one resonators what-have-you dielectric resonator you don't need any of this over here just have your stone sitting on the substrate it'll to the chop this was so simple we almost didn't believe it go ahead and try it in the lab you see that if you exfoliate, this is an example of WSE 2 on top of a reflecting so or our gold substrate you will see that for even very small thickness is like 30 nanometer you'll see that it is looking a nearly black, spectroscopy should tell you that whatever appears black should be absorbing a lot of light if you don't believe it go ahead and do some basic transfer mental calculation physical basic solutions to Maxwell's equations in one dimension and you'll see that if you take the optical constants which have been measured before by spectroscopic ellipsometry and calculate how much light is absorbed by thickness varying tungsten disulfide or tungsten diselenide on top of a silver substrate you'll notice that for something as small or as 10 as 13 nanometers you can get nearly 100% absorption okay and this matches really well both qualitatively and quantitatively with experiments now the quick question that you always get is that how much of the slide you are dumping into the metal because metals have nonzero absorption versus how much of it is going into the semiconductor again if you're doing the calculation this is easy to identify how much electromagnetic energy is going in which layer and if you calculate that you very quickly find at about 10 percent of the electromagnetic energy which is the difference between dashed line and the solid line is going into the metal on other words the dashed line is the amount of electromagnetic energy that is going into the semiconductor which is about ninety percent of the total absorption which is pretty darn good okay it is also worth noting that with soda bottles for a very sweet spot and thickness as you start increasing thickness further this near unity absorption we start shifting more red right and there is sort of this sweet spot in between where you can get the maximum amount of coverage or area to the curves and this is around 13 to 15 nanometers so great you already have sort of half a solar cell you have your semiconductor you have one of your electrodes because your metal which is gold or silver can already be used as the electrons so then can you go on and make a Schottky Junction solar cell out of it sure you can we did it it works terribly right and you know certain solar cells are not meant to work great and definitely this one doesn't work great but another major reason it doesn't work great is because you are we made ourselves which was something like this where you had some kind of electrode on the top then there was another Schottky Junction electrode at the bottom and you are citing all these carriers over here and they had to travel all this lateral distance to get collected over here and so the ideal way to do it is actually not have a Schottky Junction but have some kind of a PN Junction and fortunately we have 2D semiconductors that have some different kind of doping I think it wouldn't be wrong at this point to say that up WSE2 is p-type I think it is more intrinsic in nature but the good news is that between MOS 2 and WSE 2 you have a type 2 Junction if you have a type 2 Junction you have this inbuilt potential which can separate out the carriers and so if you can do that and then have a transparent top contact such as graphene or maybe it's some other transparent contact you can have this vertical carrier collection and really a very thin solar cell and so this is what we went about and made it and you know I'm sure some of you may have seen this result so I won't be diving too deep into it and could get two perspectives soon so that so that we can have a discussion on where this is really going but you can be you can make this very 10 PN junction which is about 9 to 13 nanometers in thickness there transparent top electrode and a back reflector as well as electrode that helps you trap all the light you can then do what we call is a scanning photocurrent microscopy of this device is again just scotch tape exfoliated and stacked slice one on top of the other you can point your laser to any spot over here and sort of take a full spectra you see that if you take a line cut what you had is it just just a Schottky Junction like before where you did not have a top electrode of graphene or or a PN Junction the amount of photo current coming out is really small whereas if you make a PN Junction versus graphene this photo current intensity sort of jumps by several fold and you can go into a more quantitative measurement over here where you see that the absorption again is really really high more than 90 percent and external quantum efficiency is also sort of exceeding 50 percent in certain parts of the spectrum and all of this is for 9 nanometer thick active layers so I think this is sort of the important thing to remember over here for these small thicknesses try and make cells out of most other known materials you will basically get noise okay try it with organics try it with silicon gallium arsenide what have you basically just get noise the fact that we are able to get several tens of a percent in EQ is is actually a very significant number for these small thicknesses with vertical sort of carrier transport which tells you that they're already pretty darn good but there's a lot more work to be done of course you can go ahead and measure even more details through it such as if you if you can do the calculations you can find out how much of light is going to the semiconductor versus how much of light is being lost in the middle as well as the top graphene content you see that gold actually has a lot more loss and it has compared to silver but if you know how much of it is useful absorption in your in your active layer you can go ahead and estimate what is known as an internal quantum efficiency or IQE and you'll find that you can have an upper bound of IQE of about sixty to seventy percent which is not bad at all but it also shows you that there is a large gap to cover over here that is about 30% of electrons being lost somewhere even when you have this thickness to be really really thick we've also observed some more exotic things going on over here that when you are in the very small thickness regime such as 9 to 13 nanometers in thickness your internal quantum efficiency of course you measure your external quantum efficiency which looks like very different spectra but when you normalize them and get the internal quantum efficiency you see that the internal quantum efficiency is not very sensitive to a function of thickness and we don't know what is actually happening over here but we think some kind of ballistic carrier conduction or scattering free carrier conduction is happening which may be a new transport regime for you know excited chatter collection and I'll talk a little bit about it towards the end I will I would also say that this is still very preliminary and I think more experiments and there is room for more exciting experiments in this area going forward I'll also say that since you know 2DCC has made so much progress exciting work in this area that you can actually scale some right and this was done in our lab and at Cal Tech where we're using MOCVD you can now grow films over large areas not only you can grow films over large areas you can also control the thicknesses and then even you transfer these films of MOS to WS to WSE2, what have you, onto goals and silver substrates you are no longer limited to the scotch tape like tiny 10 micron devices but these are centimeter scale films and this black or dark blue looking film over here is actually 13 to 15 nanometers in thickness drawn VI MOCVD at transferred on to the go check or gold silicon chip evaporated with goals are coated with gold so certainly there is room for scaling this off the question as where do we go with this so the dirty secret is out here, the power conversion efficiency is still not very large it's about three to four percent okay and this is not great but for the for the thickness that we have for a lot of these the face based application this may be enough if you just normalize it to the weight now the real question is where do we stand in terms of power conversion efficiency and how far can you go right and if you stand right here somewhere below five percent but if you look at the detail balance model and try to do a calculation of where both TMDC's should lie and I'm saying both TMDC’s because all of our cells are few layers in thickness which is essentially electronic bulk right and so if you can look at the apparent gaps and compare them they should be very close to silicon right but they are not there they are you know somewhere below 5% over here and so where is where is all these lost is going in and the real place it is being stuck at is actually the open circuit voltage so in terms of absorption you already have a lot of absorption carrier collection should not be bad as I told you internal quantum efficiency is approaching 70% then you should be being limited by voltage and of course you are being limited by voltage but if you look at our open circuit voltage open circuit board out very low it's a power point three five ready and if you look at the band gaps it's about 1.2 to 1.3 V's open circuit voltage should be on a very good cell should be at least 70 to 80% of the band gap maybe even more if you are like say gallium arsenide but it's clearly far from there and so a lot more work to be done in some open circuit voltage we have attempted a little bit to this end and the obvious thing to do would be if you have a PN Junction with some band alignment either you sort of maximize that band alignment or maximize the built-in potential if you start doping p-type more and outside more and therefore the built in voltage within your diode keeps increasing and there should not also lead to an increase in your open circuit voltage turns out that is very difficult to do for very thin materials and also if you're going to dope your absorbers heavily you're also going to create more sort of recombination losses because dopants are going to create defects right and so the real way to go about this is use of carrier selective contacts and this is something that the silicon people have done really well where you use nearly intrinsic absorbing layer and then you have wider bandgap materials which are heavily doped such as sort of conducting oxides for example where one edge of an n-type for conducting oxide is sort of aligned with the conduction band of silica and the other edge or valence band of a p-type conducting oxide or any other fiber of a larger gap conducting material where the valence band is sort of aligned to the folds and in that case basically the if your material is thin enough your excitons or carriers are always gonna reach a contact get separated over there at the you know the other that other carrier won't be able to recompile wire and instead would get pushed back to the other contact where it will get collected and so this is something where that the silicon community has done very well and some of the most effective silicon solar cells have been made this way so you know we did a lot of work on this area again I don't want to go through all of it as most of these is also on open circuit voltage also unpublished but we have found some evidence that TIO2 and NIO may be reasonable contacts there is more room for improvement over here but we have seen that to some degree TIO2 as a NIO is somewhat P contact are useful with WSE2 - if you go and make a structure or device like this BSC in preliminary data that open circuit voltage can go up with 700 millivolts now this is of course close to open circuit voltage of silicon solar cells so this is very promising this is also I know if the band gap is 1,300 millivolts 100 millivolts is you know more than 50% of the way there also we feel very good about it but then if you look at the currents over here the currents are terrible this is because the you know the these contacts or these transparent conducting contacts are are quite resistive and again the interface is not perfect over here so they are leading to a lot of recombination further the fact that if you look at this curve is an s-shaped curve over here there is a clear sign that there is some kind of Fermi level pinning going on at one of the contacts we haven't still figured out where but there is a lot of room for improvement in terms of contact engineering as well as the interface engineering of the contact okay so I would like to speed up a little bit because I'm running short of time but we have done similar work with another type of contact this time a smaller gap semiconductors in collaboration with Vader who where we have used arsenic phosphide alloy as a small gap contact immerse too and there you can get nearly a unilateral depletion region because arsenic phosphide is a much higher carrier density much more heavily doped most of the depletion region is formed in the MOS 2 and then I'm gonna skip over this real quick but you can actually get photovoltaic performance where you can get a fill factor of about 50 or 0.5 and power conversion efficiencies approaching 9 percent at least under 10 shots right and still it is concentrated power but it's it's you are able to see both open circuit voltages reach about 0.6 volts and power conversion efficiency to reach close to about 9 percent and so this is again more promising and we think that there is room by contact engineering to sort of push this event forward so I'll say that the voltage is sort of approaching that of silicon solar cells but concurrently I think we have to balance this current and fill factors as well as some optical design is needed because none of these devices that I showed you in the past couple of fights of optical design into it that so there is room for improvement for doing all of these things together and I'll say from my personal experience of all the unpublished data it is difficult to engineer all these three aspects which is light trapping current collection as well as contact engineering or voltage engineering all into a single device a really hard challenge okay so with that I would say that you know if you have made major advances towards all these three major aspect that I've told you about though combining all of these three into a single device is quite challenging and there is a lot of room for I think improvement over here from the community and I hope to see more exciting results sort of come out moving forward so moving forward I think there are a few sort of important question to answer one of question would be what about monolayers right everybody's excited about TMD monolayers why are you talking about all these few layer few layer cells the answer is that it's easier to play with few layers and I'll tell you what are some of the problems with monolayers, monolayers have an obvious advantage that their direct bandgap of course gallium arsenide solar cells are more efficient than silicon while the main reason is that they have a direct bandgap right you can definitely make them more efficient because they have a direct bandgap you have less non radiative losses because of the indirect bandgap the problem with monolayers is that trapping light becomes much more harder when you have just less than one nanometer thick active layer and you don't be of proposed some strategies of how to trap light in monolayers of course multi layers I already showed you we've also done some more cool work on multi layers and light trapping in different ways that I'll briefly talk about but then in monolayers you can there are also start that you can start trapping light and the good news is in the last couple of years people have already published in these areas that people have shown very high light trapping in mono layers and even we are working on some of these is also over here that you publish in the coming year and so I don't think light trapping in monolayers should be a problem moving forward the advantage that you get from monolayers is clear this is because they are direct band gap and they have higher external radiative efficiency they can be much closer to the ideal limit okay and therefore they can they can occupy this space over here the problem though is monolayers have larger band gaps because they are of course more quantum-confined so they are at a different part of the energy spectrum right so it would be the it is clear that you know the range of efficiencies that they're both bulk and monolayers occupy on the spot are sort of similar but monolayers have another very big challenge that people don't often talk about okay and this big challenge is that the exciton binding energies are really large and therefore you will have to spend a lot of energy to actually separate get set on out and this would be a huge penalty to be paid in terms of voltage that most people are still ignoring and a lot more work needs to be done there in fact people who have worked in the field of organic photovoltaics they'll know how hard this is so one way to go about terrestrial applications for of 2D semiconductors is actually see how you can pair it off with silicon again just like micro electronics silicon is here to stay even for photovoltaic the question is what can you put on top of silicon to sort of make it better or improve the efficiency and so if you look at the record single Junction silicon cell of course there is a huge push to integrate 3 5 semiconductor such as gallium arsenide or gallium indium phosphide on top of silicon because they are very well matched in terms of bandgap to give you the maximum efficiency of this tandem cell both the MDC's are not very well bandgap okay plus they are indirect so it doesn't help much so they are they're only going to give you modest improvement if you combine them on top of silicon but monolayer TMDC’s they are actually very well matched in terms of bandgap and the fact that 2D materials can be layered on top of anything as opposed to 3 5 which are difficult to grow up it actually and high quality of our arbitrary substrates you may have some opportunity over here in terms of integrating TMDC’s in tandem cells on top of silicon this is also one of the main reason why a solution processed perovskites have had a huge advantage in terms of integrating on top of silicon they don't need to be a bit actually grown in high quality like say gallium arsenide or gallium indium phosphide that's a big advantage so if you look at the current perspective of where sort of the devices are lying and where the community is so the mono layer devices are still pretty bad they are in the you know 5% regime even the external corner efficiency is not very good just because they are not absorbing as much light and not much light design aspects have got into it multi layers can absorb a lot more light so they can have a higher estimates agency but then again open circuit voltage engineering has not been done for them and therefore they're sitting over here my sense is that in the coming years these two will be dead and get off very well in fact I can tell you there are unpublished reports that people have been seeing very high external quantum efficiency so this is not that hard to take care of the harder thing to take care of is materials and interface control and this is where even if you are able to get very high quantum efficiency devices the power conversion efficiencies are going to stay low unless we work hard on say on the open circuit voltage I have seen some unpublished reports where people have been able to engineer this and push this over here we'll see when that comes out and what the community thinks about it but the key research areas to sort of emphasize over here or again contact engineering larger area high quality growth with the 2DCC is doing an excellent job on and then of course this big challenge over here is all coming get strong binding energy monolayers that very few people have thought about and what consequence is it to have if you reduce gifts from binding energy on the absorption of optical constants and finally of course the room is open for discovery of new other two-dimensional materials with right bandgap values an optical constant there may be others out there that we don't know that are better than these for semiconducting TMDC's we talked about finally there is also some room for new fundamental investigations I said that you know a lot of people talk about sub 10 nanometer transistors we're building something nanometer thick solar cells and of course you would have some interesting new transport over there new physics of exciton transport new physics of carrier collection maybe hot carrier collection and things like that are worth investigating I'll also say that we are now working on looking at hybrid light matter state such as exciton polaritons and I did not talk about this further but in our structures or WS2 and WSE2 on coals itself you already see external power transform at thicknesses even below 15 nanometers which is where this optimal absorption was and so now we are trying to see if you do a photovoltaic measurement now what are the kind of efficiencies or efficiencies you can get from an exciton polariton on P versus just an exciton peak and does it have any fundamental consequences in terms of light harvesting so you know there are a lot of interesting things to do over there in the in the in the coming years so with that I would like to end then I would like to acknowledge a bunch of people a bunch of my group members who work very hard on some of these topics or some of my former colleagues and current collaborators including Harry Atwater, Artur Davoyan Weida Hu and a bunch of other colleagues and collaborators at 2DCC, Penn and various other places and of course the funding agency Northrop Grumman is the company would be who has been interested in looking at weight in photovoltaics and you know there is also some interest from the Defense agencies on that so with that I would like to thank you all for attention sorry I'm a little bit over time I'm happy to take any questions. Thank you Dr. Jariwala, so cue up your questions in the chat box we will not use voice because we don't want to accidentally interrupt the feed so I will take them up to Dr. Jariwala ok we have a question already have you measured power efficiency as a function of time how are you trying to prevent the oxidation of TMDs over time and then encapsulation with other 2D materials is the question. Ok, great question, we have measured ourselves (inaudible) three to four percent over the course of six to eight months we have seen less than you know 5 percent variation 5% from the day one variation so they are they're relatively quite stable how do you make them stable well we have mostly used sulfides and selenides from scotch tape crystals which are naturally quite stable materials further if it you know we have also tried to put a layer of BN a thin layer of BN on top and that seems to encapsulate things pretty well for a very long time so yeah this is certainly the way to go I think to prevent oxidation you would have to cap it with something you know and there is also a thicker design to be done and capping layers like if you have a higher index sort of capping layer you will end up trapping even more light and yeah you know you can also use other 2D materials to do the same. Okay, what happens in space the spectrum changes does this change your ideal choice of TMD and what do we know about UV tolerance? Great question once again yes we have thought about it the good news is that some preliminary measurements done right before we left I left Caltech at JPL to look at radiation hardness actually the biggest advantage that you get because of the very small thicknesses actually these cells are much more radiation hard and so the space radiation right and how high-energy radiation and that is actually that are actually beneficial in terms of putting measurements up in space in terms of spectrum not much changes actually the intensity changes more the spectrum changes more on the IR side because the atmosphere mainly absorbs the the molecules in the atmosphere they mainly absorb in the IR side so in terms of the visible intensity you know the overall intensity goes up but the actual spectrum does not ship our sun's temperature you know the black body temperature it's contour that means it's the same whether you are on earth or you're up in space so it won't change as much of the band gap of the material but there could be some other interesting things you could look at over there such as if one material is more radiation hard than the other, maybe that would help certainly having mali, tungsten all these things are heavy elements you know maybe over time they are more sensitive to say heavier radiation such as alpha particles and some of the lighter element 2D semiconductors may be better over there I don't know it's something to be explored. Is arsenide phosphorus a layered material, how was it synthesized? Okay okay great I I skipped over it very quickly it's basically black phosphorus alloyed with arsenic so yes the layered material it was a synthesized using the same ampule technique where you put in some powder of phosphorous and arsenic together seal it up in a torch tube and you know you're covered high temperatures and therefore because you are sealed up in ampule it also becomes high pressure and ultimately grows into an arsenic phosphide crystal this was actually grown by our collaborators in China and we just exfoliated it and you know it works out fine I think the arsenic and phosphorous content was 50/50 so it actual formula is KSP. In the slide showing the paper from 1981 the text says molybdenum disulphide is direct band gap isn't molybdenum disulphide indirect band gap? Yeah it's a very good catch the paper I saw it too- and probably in 1981 people did not know whether it's direct or indirect bandgap they you know the funny thing about MOS2 or any of these GMT's is that if you look at the absorption spectrum even for indirect materials right so you know this is this is for example yeah let me pull up my WSE2 slide, if you look at this absorption edge of 13 nanometer Ws2 - which is basically interact we know it would select fragment that the the edge is so sharp that most people think it is direct alright and I'm back in 1981 people were not thinking about we should do oh you know some kind of photo luminescence measurements of this and that to determine direct was direct so obviously they were they did they did not you know did not think about it that far that's that's my guess. Hello hello? How would turbo stratic two layer TMDs behave as photovoltaic would they behave as a stack of monolayers? So this is an excellent question and I have given some thought to this I haven't actually had my hands on a turbo static sample to sort of measure this but it may be worth thinking about I mean with this whole idea on the condensed matter side of 2D materials of you know trying to twist the layers you know if I take a few layer TMDC and twist all these layers how does the you know band structure change and I think the the big question I'm trying to get to is the same as what the user viewer has asked but you know trying to engineer a structure that will give me bulk like absorption and performance but having you know equivalent to stack of monolayers and they're working on it I'm not showing it because it's all unpublished data now hopefully you see something along these lines in the coming year from our group. Ok and recognizing the value of your time, we have one last question, can you project how fabrication costs will compare for these multi-layer and mono layer TMDC photovoltaics compared to silicon? And so again, this is an interesting question and I think you have to talk more at an economic level over here the sense that what is the application right if the application is going to be spaced then the cost of the cell does not come into picture at all and it's the cost of shipping it up there that matters if you are going to put it on the ground yeah then you have to think about it and I guess the experts at 2DCC would know better how much more expensive it is to grow a monolayer film versus the multi-layer film I think the the challenges in terms of fabrication aside from synthesis would be you know for trapping light in a mono layer there will be more sort of the photograph you like things they did because we'll need some kind of you know resonant absorber or resonator to trap light and that would significantly escalate the cost I think this cost benefit versus efficiency analysis that you have to do and see what makes the most economic sense for the application you're looking at. Actually we have one more question I think we'll take one because I think it's got pretty high value but for those of you we're gonna shut this down after this question if you enjoy the talk go ahead and type the word clap in the chat box just for our sense of humor but the question is: thanks for the talk I assume all the WSE2 WS 2 are from exfoliation wow, my chat box is blowing up, from exfoliation and stacked have you tried to use CBD grown multi-layer TMDs to make the same structure and how's the performance compared to device from exfoliated crystal? Very good question, as you can see over here, we’ve made these films, they are already half your cells, so definitely optically they are they're electronically they they don't work very well this is because you know the real challenge with multi-layer films I would say especially or large areas is if you're going to make a vertical device any short through a 10 nanometer or 12 meter thick structure and you're going to get your full cell shorten so we're working on it I don't I can't I can't give you a timeline like when we will have like results from say multi-layered large area cells that you can directly compare it to exfoliated ones, my hope would be that someone in the 2DCC or one of the one of the other experts gets me really high quality multi-layer films which have very low sort of pinhole like type defects I think atomic defense such as makeup these are okay but very low pinhole light defects and we can make a cell and see how it looks like so it's it's I think we are limited to a high quality hole free material over a large enough area we have AI CVD to make a test out of this. Thank you for your talk today Dr. Jariwala, I'll let you know that in the chat box just about everyone clapped so they enjoyed your talk immensely some people used emoticons so that was pretty cool but anyway stay tuned for next time we don't have a next date yet but we will use the same format for future webinars for the foreseeable future so thank you again Dr. Jariwala. All right thanks everyone.
