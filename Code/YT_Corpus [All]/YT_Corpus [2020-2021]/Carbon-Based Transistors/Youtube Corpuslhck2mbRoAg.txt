 all right good morning golden bears my name is ricky videz i'm your equity and department advisor in mechanical engineering in the student service office welcome to the number one public university in the entire universe i'm excited to start this chapter in our university's history in the upcoming days please take time to reflect and embrace what it means to enter our institution at this particular stage in your life as the years pass the gift of time will remain relevant as you all notably observe your individual and your collective growth when i entered berkeley i believe the myth that the next couple years would be the last two years that i would spend in the classroom however i firmly believe that by the time you graduate what remain what remains permanent is your pursuit of lifelong learning what i enjoy most about working with everybody is our global presence and our global reach berkeley really is a global platform in our department you're part of a community that represents 80 cities and towns across california six states across the union and 36 countries from around the world and just to name a few there's folks in the audience that are from australia brazil colombia canada china egypt germany france nepal taiwan thailand and vietnam and much much more wherever you are in the world i know that you will contrib continue to contribute your time and energy and as a department we're grateful for the many contributions that you will make yes all the legends are true we're an incredible university we train the best students in the world and in our department that training starts today on day one we're here to train engineers to rise up to facilitate measurable growth in our society and respond to the needs of the future however we're only great because of the students that are in our audience while our department facilitates instruction and provides guidance throughout it is everyone in this room who challenges us to perform at the best possible level on a daily basis and beyond the contributions that you will make in our department you will engage with the community and share your expertise beyond our boundaries which is something that i'm really proud of before all that you'll spend many many hours in this hallway which is hesi hall which will become your second home and you might start to feel like you're a squirrel that's hanging for your dear life at some point with success just towering over you wishing you can go back to the days where life was a little bit more simple you got to play with these in all the complexities that you'll be engaging with you'll be able to play with these and in between of course you'll get to have some fun it's all part of the transformation you might be shy now you might feel a little out of place but discovery and exploration and pledge transcendence it's exciting to go beyond what you know it's nice to travel into new dimensions to build your skill set your confidence this is all really exciting here's an opportunity for you to learn something every single day either about yourself or about the world and soon you'll have you'll be able to activate some support from the community get some backup goodbye with a little help from your friends form your inner beast sharpen your claws and stand tall when this is all over here's where it all will go down long nights bright days and shining your light on all of us so let there be light and go bears if you need to get a hold of us we're at me.berkeley.edu where you'll have access to all our contact information i want to introduce the dream team we have an exciting program for everyone and it's an honor for me to be able to share this great lineup of speakers and presenters with you all we have the director student services player carolyn clark our chair dr roberto horowitz our vice chair of equity grace o'connell our vice chair of instruction dr van cary and dr hayden taylor will be delivering a course demo we also have folks from the machine shop who will be sharing their expertise and offering a virtual tour so without further ado i will introduce carolyn clark who will uh take the stage hi everyone good morning good afternoon good evening whatever time it is wherever you might be welcome to the department of mechanical engineering despite what's happening around us in the world and in our state we are still so excited that you have decided to join us this fall congratulations on all your hard work and effort to get here and we are so happy to have you here and your families in some cases i have to say i witness the university and our entire mechanical engineering community putting in heroic efforts to maintain the quality of the student educational experience last spring and we know that our plans for the fall will help make this coming semester a memorable quality experience as well i also know that you're in very good hands with your undergraduate and staff equity advisor wikividis please don't hesitate to call on us or your ess advisor with any questions that you have and i look forward to meeting you all on campus as soon as possible hopefully in person soon and now i have the honor of introducing our illustrious department chair a triple bear himself professor roberto horlitz thank you caroling hello everybody my name is roberto horowitz and i am a professor in the areas of control in autonomous systems and robotics and the chair of the department normally i would spend my five minutes of fame telling you about my own 45 plus year uninterrupted experience at berkeley starting as an entering sophomore some more or less the same as just some of you in mechanical engineering and culminating so far as the department chair however we are currently living in extraordinary circumstances you're the first in which most of you have not only graduated through a virtual online commencement but you will be entering and attending your first semester at berkeley also in a mostly virtual online manner because of the terrible pandemic that has engulfed the world in general in our country in particular as if this was not enough the state of california and particularly our bay area community is also currently confronting unprecedented challenges because of the horrific wildfires that are currently accosting us thus the current challenges of having to simultaneously confront both the invisible threat of the coronavirus while living working and studying under the very real safety threats posed by the wildfires should be a strong reminder that now more than ever our society depends on a new generation of highly trained and thoroughly educated engineers that will lead us with clear and imaginative ideas and innovations into a more sustainable robust inclusive equitable and yes prosperous future we believe that you will be you will find berkeley in general in our department in particular to be an absolutely invigorating and stimulating environment in which to carry out the next phases of your education and to prepare you to confront these challenges and many other challenges that lie ahead one thing that i can assure you about berkeley is that you will never be bored and you will always have many avenues to explore and challenge yourself so please choose wisely and conservatively on what you to get involved in particularly during your first semester so that you have an uh the opportunity to explore our wonderfully diverse fast-paced and stimulating environment we are always here to help you thank you and now i'm going to introduce our very capable and my good friend van carrie who is the vice chair of instruction i think you're you're muted software i'm still getting used to the controller here so um okay uh well let me just say hello to everyone and welcome you all our new students into the me program uh i am the vice chair of instruction for the mechanical engineering department and i work with the staff in our student affairs office to help coordinate the instructional programs in the emmy department as i think ricky was mentioning you probably know that you're entering one of the top mechanical engineering programs in the country our undergraduate program is currently ranked number two in the nation just behind mit and that may seem a little daunting but i want to assure you all that if you are here it's because we believe you have what it takes to be successful in our program we're committed as a staff and a faculty to creating an environment that helps all our students be successful here so please try to take full advantage of the resources as you navigate your way through the program i'm going to actually take a counter position to what professor horowitz said i see berkeley as a very stimulating place and i'm going to enthusiastically recommend that you take full advantage of that [Music] the the fact is that there's a lot of opportunities here on campus both within the mechanical engineering department and the campus as a whole to explore a wide variety of different areas and issues and challenges ricky already mentioned that there's a number of student groups that do things working on special projects like the solar car team and the super mileage team there's also groups that get involved in a variety of different activities connected to engineering the student section of the american society of mechanical engineers and the society of women engineers there's also the berkeley nanotechnology club so there's lots of things outside of the classroom that you can engage in and these are opportunities to explore new areas and give your chance to experience some of what's going on at the cutting edges of these technologies i also want to mention that one of the great things at least in my opinion about being at berkeley is that just about every department on campus is among the best in their field and you have the opportunity to take classes with top instructors and students in those fields when you take electives in in all these different areas uh this gives berkeley a tremendous level of intellectual energy and makes berkeley a place that offers special opportunities for personal and professional growth so i'd encourage you to take advantage of some of those opportunities and if you have questions or concerns please do reach out to faculty and staff particularly in our student affairs office where we're eager to to try to help students if they're encountering difficulties or just have questions about how to proceed and i'll close then by wishing you all the best in your academic work here at berkeley and i'll cheer you on as we commonly do for all our students by saying go bears and i guess i'm handing off the microphone here to our vice chair for equity and inclusion grace o'connell hi welcome everybody it's really exciting to see a new cohort of students even though it is virtual i hope we'll be able to meet in person one day soon so i'm the vice chair of equity and inclusion and my research area is actually more in medicine biomechanics so i look at why and how the soft tissues in our body fail with age and with disease um and it's also a personal interest of mine as i'm also an athlete and experience a lot of soft tissue injuries um at berkeley here we want to really see you succeed and all students to succeed and i work very closely with ricky we're here to provide those sources of information that professor kerry mentioned earlier and to encourage all students to become involved in outreach activities berkeley is well known for its community engagement and community involvement both at the undergraduate and graduate level students get involved at teaching at local schools when we used to have in-person classes so hopefully by next semester next year we'll be able to do that again but we're also here as a resource for you in case you're experiencing any type of additional stresses that keep you from being able to succeed in your classes and this year is a particularly unique year in california as mentioned earlier with the kobit 19 pandemic and being in california with the wildfires it it seems like everything is coming all at once and we need to be dynamic and flexible um we will provide resources uh for example the berkeley basic needs living document what that means is it will be updated whenever there's additional resources whether it's technology food so on and so forth but if there's something that's not on that resource document feel free to reach out to myself or to the student services staff ricky um i just wanted to highlight some of those student groups that were already mentioned and where you can find some of these student groups so uh in a given year we have tabling where student organizations can actually meet with you but most of you are probably virtual uh this semester so if you go to the me website you can see a long list of any related student groups some of these are engineering based technical student groups others are affinity groups for example the society of women engineers tess is for latinx students el stem is for lgbt and bessa is for black engineering scientists and then asme is just the general overall student organization these are great organizations to join for peer mentorship and just a sense of community and that the peer mentorship and study group aspect of things will be particularly important as you're starting your uh college career for those of you in your first year online because study groups are a great way to quickly learn because the material tends to be very fast here um at berkeley and then as you start to go through uh your college experience here looking at what are your next steps how do i apply my mechanical engineering degree out in the real world to get a job we have community spotlight articles on the me website so feel free to cruise through there and look at what various alumni have done with their mechanical engineering degree what type of jobs exist there's also faculty spotlight articles for example professor goldner started last year and he moved here last year and he does a lot of fire research which is very applicable for california so welcome and go bears and i think at this time we're going to pause for a few questions if there are any questions from the the previous uh presentations if not i can present or introduce professor hayden taylor how do they ask questions can they just uh step in and talk or they can put it in the chat i believe they can put it in the chat so no we have a lot of uh we have 87 participants you can also navigate to the top right and ask to ask your question by asking to present so you want to share your screen you can ask your question and everybody in the audience can use that function we were very clear so there's no way of zoom has a way of doing hands and things like that no no way of doing pulse unless well there's no questions i can introduce professor taylor does that sound good richard yeah that's great uh actually there was one question you want to take that dr connell sure what are some ways to go more in depth on specific pathways within mechanical engineering um one of the ways to do that is through the technical elective courses that you'll take your junior and senior year i believe it's 15 credits worth of courses that are required for the degree program so that's a good way things like ocean engineering take a class in ocean engineering aerospace engineering biomechanics um and we have a long list of options there another way is to get involved in academic research and the most common way of doing that is to reach out to various faculty that are doing research in an area that you think you might be interested in that way you can get more hands-on experience or the last one i would say is student group student organizations a lot of students will join student groups like cal sol and they they actually get hands-on experience through that so there are multiple different pathways that you could go through there's another one here when is the airspace major coming to berkeley we're not sure yet uh we're working on it uh and by we i mean the college of engineering but i'm happy to report that we our department has just started a minor in aerospace engineering and starting this year so we're going to have a series of courses that you can take three courses one in in aerodynamics another one in in composite material and one in another one is in ua control that will allow you to get a certificate certified minor in aerospace engineering we've been working very hard and diligently on setting up a a major mechanical engineering department but it's now going to be taken to the college of engineering and i think this during the next semester we will have a a a plan to when we exped within one or two years we will have a major in aerospace yeah maybe that that if you're entering as a freshman there's a high probability that the major will be in place in time for you to participate in that later in your program right if you're entering as a jc transfer um it's not clear whether that'll be the case but um the miner is in in place now and and students can begin participating in that even at this point in time okay so there's another question here says how do you know which prof is doing research uh i would say most of the professors in the department are doing research so the way to find out is look at the website and look throughout what areas and uh i have to confess my my website is not the best one in the world so you won't get that much of an idea what my current research is but some people do have a very good website also you can also visit us cybernetically you know set up an appointment and and chat with us but i would say the department has areas of expertise and at least the professors that are working in those areas and i would look and explore their website also their publication list there's more questions to the individual websites you can go through the me.berkeley.edu website i included a link in the description that shows by area so there's another question well a lot of questions now let's see what activity was what skills are do faculty look for in uh research labs to hire for research lives and i would say that varies very much from one professor to another and so in when you're looking for research opportunities uh don't be afraid of rejection or not getting a response if you don't get a response that has nothing to do with your application it just means that our emails are a mess and we have a hard time finding emails um so just keep at it just keep emailing and trying to do it but you know the skills you know it depends on the era as grace said but i would say uh most important skill is enthusiasm and willingness to work hard and of course we will also be looking for make sure that you can embark on the research so sometimes you need to have taken some courses like programming some math courses etc but uh we're always looking for young talented minds to [Music] shape and to work with so it's a favorite job of all of us i think is to do research with our students i'd also like to i think well dr kayla go ahead uh yes i'd also like to add that uh we you know our curriculum is structured in a way that you start to develop skills pretty early on so for example a lot of our students will take e7 during their first year they'll take a data science course by the time they're done with their fourth semester and although the combination of those skills of being able to program uh being able to have some some exposure to data science and also engaging with computer aided design uh tends to open up opportunities for students to be uh strong researchers so just keep in mind that our curriculum does support uh being able to gain those research opportunities if not in our department in other departments as well so i i definitely encourage everyone to set up meetings with faculty look out for weekly emails that i send out that have announcements around different research opportunities uh faculty will send me different announcements to share out with the community and also there's different opportunities i heard somebody mention uh your app which is that stands for undergraduate uh research apprentice program and we often combine forces with europe which is an l s program uh to allow students to do research through them while being supported by one of our labs so there's a short question here can students who are not in mechanical engineering do the arrow minor and the answer is yes you can and as long as you have they can be prerequisites or equivalent so yeah we're not restricting the minor just to mechanical engineering students in fact we would want to have as many outside students as we can alexander and dylan ask questions that are related to internships and getting closer to industry one thing that i'll comment on in addition to career fairs student organizations will have info sessions by various um industry members so keep an eye out for that because that would be advertised through the newsletter sent out by ricky as well right so there's one here it says i don't know as a mechanical engineer would you would you all advise to take the fundamentals of engineering exam eit what kind of foods does it gives you what industry requires it if yes when would you recommend taking it uh i don't know the answer of that uh does anyone comment on that a little bit um i actually have taken the eit and and the approach in my case was simply that it was easy to take immediately after i had finished my bachelor's degree because you had already mastered all the fundamentals and it was an easy exam to take and pass it is a pathway to a professional engineering license and there are certain areas of engineering practice where that is valuable if you work um you know we're for a consulting firm or you work on government projects where having a professional license is is an important credential uh that can be beneficial civil engineers often get this type of credential because it uh it supports you know construction type projects mechanical engineers i don't think it's as much uh is as of much importance because most most companies um don't really see that as being a tremendous advantage if you leave berkeley with the bs and mechanical engineering you know most of the companies in california and across the u.s will recognize you know your level of technical expertise as high and i don't think you would gain a lot by doing the eit can't hurt it's easy to do right after you graduate if you want to do it but it probably isn't really horribly necessary for most applications okay there's another question that says how often should mechanical engineering students undertake internships uh i'd say the frequency that i see it is uh every summer usually students will engage in an internship uh however it does vary some students will do a mixture of like one summer they'll do research the next summer they'll do internships um quite often um students will do this they'll engage with internships over the summer like i mentioned however there are co-op opportunities so certain industries will recruit you to actually leave school for a semester and be part of their industry full-time and that's called a co-op so if you hear that term that's what it means but i think uh in terms of getting an internship having like two or three under your belt by the time you hit the market is usually a good way to go yeah i i strongly recommend that i i took one when i was a berkeley student uh i i ended up going all the way to my home country in venezuela and working on oil refinery and what's really really interesting so i would say particularly if it's a good company and it's a good opportunity i i think and in the summer is a very valuable experience let's see there's more questions i saw on facebook that eecs has an internship they're coming up on handshake will there be one soon for mechanical engineering as well ricky you know where we're setting something up like that so right now we're working on a career fair which has a lot of that same flavor uh it's not specifically an internship fair however a lot of the industry that we do invite are either looking to hire students full time once they graduate or recruit them for summer internships so it's in the works and we're hoping that we can have one uh planned out by the end of september stay tuned okay here's the one that i think is going to elicit several responses it says here how many clubs or research opportunities do you think is manageable to deal with as a junior transfer so i already told you what i thought van says i don't know it i think it's uh i think my feeling is i i i i i advise students to be conservative first make sure that you're handling your courses correct well so and don't get don't get too much over your head on the other hand i think it's a very good you know they're wonderful we have some wonderful groups like the mileage the uh the mileage the the the racing team so it's you got to play it by you a little bit particularly the one thing that you're going to find is that berkeley is more challenging than your typical junior college so if you were doing grading your junior college and you know you had ample time to spare and i by all means otherwise be a little bit conservative at the beginning but then plunge in i think it's one of the great experiences of berkeley i don't know if uh van you want to add something yeah i i think i would just add one comment and that is that um you know these activities kind of you know break down into two groups you know the the the clubs that work on high mileage vehicle and solar car and human-powered vehicle you know those give you a little bit more of an engineering experience you know the the focus is on designing and building and and performance testing um if if you really see yourself pursuing an engineering career and that's the type of activity you like then certainly i would encourage you to go for something like that if you think you want to go on to graduate school and do more high-tech related stuff that might make more sense to to focus on some sort of a undergraduate research activity because that would give you an opportunity to see what research at the graduate level is like and get a sense you know if you like it and what areas of activity you're most interested in and that will help prepare you for some decisions about whether you want to go to graduate school so i guess i'll add my comment and address the question about the minor what i would suggest is just keep in mind that time is a non-renewable resource right you have a limited amount of time and depending on what your own personal goals are may decide how many clubs you're interested in and what type of clubs you're interested in being in because your gpa doesn't define you so if you participate in more hands-on activity clubs and you get really involved in that that may impact your performance in your classes but you also pick up skills so these are all personal decisions that you'll have to be have to make and and weigh the balance on all of those uh lucero asked a question about when should we start looking for internships and what is the process like for it i'd say that probably hiring cycles for companies tend to be in mid to late september for hiring folks that are going to be graduating uh that may uh however for internships i'd say there's a there's a window for summer internships generally between january and the end of february that are the most um highly recruited that's the most highly recruited season however i would say keep looking at beyond february there's different things happen at different companies uh there might be a gap that might need to be filled and you might be able to fill that gap so definitely stay engaged with with companies that you've had contacts with at career affairs and just check in with them because the internship cycle is sometimes relative so i was pointed out that i skipped one question from lucero so let me let me mention let me let me write uh read the question miner we just took care of it dr roberto oh you just took care of it yeah oh okay there we go okay sorry so what's the next oh does coe have the faculty mentoring program the answer is yes somebody here is looking way ahead but anyway so we do mentor our faculty uh each when we when we have uh our junior faculty assistant professors they all get assigned to one or two mentors from who normally are more senior faculty to advise them on the do's and don'ts and also the college both the campus and the college actually offer quite a bit of of advice and courses much much more than they used to offer when i i came in i don't know if anybody uh grace you have any comments on that on the faculty mentoring that it's helpful you you got some good mentors i know that yeah anyway okay official mentors and non-official mentors yeah that's right officially not official question was about faculty mentoring students is know i can answer that question so there are we do assign every incoming student with a faculty advisor and uh we do update that list around uh registration time uh really uh a lot of our faculty will be aware of the different requirements however i advise you to really reach out to myself and the ess advisors for different uh curriculum matters but what we do is we do set it up around that time period in case that's intersecting with your goals so once you have an assigned faculty member definitely touch base with them send them an email and try to find a time to connect with them so that you could have some connection to our department and they might not be the the best person for you initially but they'll be able to connect you with the next person so the whole goal is just for you to have some exposure to faculty by assigning our students to faculty mentors yeah and it would be good to talk to about specific questions like minors and minors for you and what your goals are or what other classes you should take for example maybe you want to teach taking classes in education or in business that's what your faculty mentor or your ess mentors are there for so i just want to make a comment that we need to move the program along a little bit more so that we can um you know cover some of the other elements that we want to present during the program however uh we will i can answer uh two more questions and then move on to dr taylor's uh presentation uh so i'm gonna answer um let's see i'll answer the i'll ask the last i'll check the last two that were asked um so as someone who's potentially looking to pursue an mba maybe in the future would you think that taking those technical electives would be better than pursuing a full mba degree and i could just i was just going to respond to jesse's question about uh internships and international students uh my observation has been that that many of the companies at least in the bay area in silicon valley tend to be fairly open-minded about attracting international students into internships so i would say that the chances of an opportunity there are are reasonably good you know if you make the right connection so it may not necessarily be a barrier and i would also say our berkeley international office is a good resource and i'll add that in the chat as well so in terms of the the question about uh business administration and economics uh we do offer some technical electives that can be taken in that area however we are pretty restricted in terms of our technical electives so nine out of the 15 units have to be emmy sponsored which really does limit your choices to be able to extend beyond that uh you could take some courses in economics um for fun on top of our pretty heavy curriculum however if you're interested in pursuing an mba uh one way that i think that you can consider that is uh taking a decal through ugba which is our undergraduate business administration program there's a lot of opportunities there there's also opportunities for you to collaborate and do either different design projects or offer some of your engineering skills to the projects that they're working on so there's a lot of cross-disciplinary opportunities that i think could um feed your entrepreneurial spirit uh so just keep that in mind it's not entirely um convenient to intersecting it with our curriculum however there are extracurricular opportunities so we'll transition now to dr taylor who's going to offer us a course demo and i'd like to ask the other presenters to um you can either leave which i think would be better because dr taylor would have the floor to himself uh now that your presentations are over or you at minimum i think you should uh minus your speech bye okay welcome bye everyone bye right um great well uh so would you still like me to finish by 12 or um you can go on a little further if you need to dr taylor okay cool i'll i'll try to not take too long so um yeah i'm gonna talk to you today about a couple of things one is to share with you some of my uh how i got to berkeley how i ended up here and i think that's relevant because it's definitely informed some of the things that i work on now in my research um and i'll show you some of the the work that we've been doing with a new form of 3d printing that can create three-dimensional objects very rapidly and generates all points in the object simultaneously um so uh i'm from the uk originally as you may possibly be able to tell and i was an undergraduate in cambridge and when i was a a junior i had the opportunity to actually come to the us and do a year long exchange at mit which was actually the first time i've been to the states the first time i'd actually been on an airplane uh so it was a big adventure and uh really reshaped my life in a couple of ways because while i was there i did do undergraduate research um in a lab that looked at semiconductor manufacturing processes and some of the the sources of variation that cause uh semiconductors not to yield perfectly when they're manufactured so i worked on that and in fact loved it so much that uh once i got back to the uk i decided i would apply to come back to the states and do my phd here which i really did in fact in the same research group uh so so uh i then spent five years uh in boston working on my phd and in the course of that actually i uh made quite a few trips to singapore we had a sponsored research project uh with with a couple of universities in singapore all about manufacturing uh microfluidic devices in other words labs on chip that can that can do diagnostic tests in seconds and we were trying to look at how you would manufacture these in in their millions uh what once they they really came on stream so i went there and then at the end of my phd became very interested in um how i could uh use actually optics inside microfluidic devices so i then moved to singapore and i did a postdoctoral uh stint a couple of years there uh working on this new idea um it was a big big departure leaving boston uh you know something that i uh sometimes wondered whether i'd made made the right decision to move into it into a radically different research topic um and actually while i was there i was i was on the faculty at the technological university there ntu and uh there actually met a faculty member from berkeley who then introduced me to the department and i ended up getting hired here been here since 2014. um and uh love uh love teaching and research and all the other things that happen here so um the the reason i told you all that is that um the path has definitely seemed quite circuitous at times um one thing has seemed to lead naturally to another but there have definitely been times when i've wondered whether um i was making the uh the optimal decision but all of the things that i've done semiconductor manufacturing uh microfluidics optics they've all played into the research that i do now and i think it's because i've had a range of experiences that um that my research is what it is so um i i i would say you know if things don't seem linear or logical uh at any given moment that's not necessarily a a problem um so actually my uh my degrees or my majors were electro electrical and electronic engineering um but my undergraduate degree was very broad so we did do mechanics and materials and thermo fluids and so forth so i had um quite quite a range of uh course experiences and that was also useful because uh during my phd i got into a research problem called uh nano imprint lithography so as you were probably well aware uh semiconductors are getting transistors are getting smaller faster cheaper all the time and actually probably one of the two biggest challenges that the semiconductor industry faces today uh is is physically creating such small sub 10 nanometer features usually it's done with projected patterns of lights diffraction is now really the the limiter on that and so there is a school of thought that you should move to a mechanical way of doing it where you create a stamp that has these 10 nanometer features on it and you use it to physically deform a layer of polymer material to create those shapes which can then be transferred to the silicon underneath and uh it's a radical departure for it to work it really relies on a lot of mechanical engineering theory contact mechanics elasticity and so forth and so um that problem became interesting to me because i i had the w coursework i had worked for a semiconductor manufacturer designing memories um and i also had had some of the some of the mechanical coursework and so the the intersection was what was interesting to me um so uh and and similarly some of the signal processing courses that i had taken actually became really important when we started working on uh the tomographic printing process i describe in a moment so um ricky wanted me to say a few words about uh some of the courses that um that i teach here and um so i teach predominantly manufacturing and what i've done for quite a few years here is teach a class called intro to manufacturing or engineering 27. um we're actually going to segue into a new class in the spring which i will be teaching the first iteration of called e29 and we're actually integrating our our intro to manufacturing class more with the graphical communication we're going to call it manufacturing and design communication um but a lot of the the principles will remain the same and i think um one thing that distinguishes berkeley's curriculum from some others is that we are not just trying to uh inform you about what is out there in the world of engineering today we certainly do that we study how various manufacturing processes work and the physical principles behind them and so forth we're not just trying to do that we are also trying to encourage you to develop ways of analyzing critically appraising and possibly also inventing new ways of of doing things in in my field processing material creating new manufacturing processes that may be more energy efficient use less raw material use raw materials that are more available and so forth and uh so i think it's that sort of uh framework for analyzing things that that we really try to emphasize so for example in engineering 27 soon to be 29 when we look at 3d printing or additive manufacturing processes um rather than just go through a list of different different processes powder fusion fuse deposition modeling stereo lithography we kind of break it apart into the functions that have to be performed so we we say okay well any additive process has to somehow supply material in a way that can be reformed or reshaped in other words it might come in a powder it might come in filaments it might come in sheets it might come as a liquid and various different materials could come in those forms we have to supply energy to the material to transform it into the final object you might do that with light you might do it with heat you might do it with some other um form of energy like a electromagnetic uh radiation in in non-visible ranges so there are all sorts of ways we could we could deliver the energy to transform the material and then you've got to have a way of controlling the shape do you do that with a scanning mirror that deflects a laser beam across a powder bed do you do it with um lead screws linear actuators do you do it with some other form of actuation and the reason we break apart we try to break apart these different functions and then reconstitute them in in the class is that there may well be combinations of solutions for these functions that no one has thought of before that could be combined in new ways to make for uh more effective manufacturing processes um and actually that is one of the things that we try to do in my research group we try to invent manufacturing processes that use less material or energy and and help uh help with both the economy and and the climate in various ways um so i'm just going to share with you in for a few minutes um a piece of work that we have been doing over the last few years and this is uh now okay it should work right okay so this is a new way of 3d printing now pretty much any 3d printing process that you will come across today isn't really 3d and what i mean by that is that you build up the object through a long sequence of lower dimensional unit processes for example if you are doing fused deposition modeling you are extruding molten polymer out to a tiny nozzle you have to draw out a bead of polymer to create one layer at a time or if it's laser sintering of metal powders very often you're scanning a point of light across the surface to locally melt and so it's slow you have to worry about the thermal characteristics of that process what thermal gradients and therefore stress gradients will be built up in the manufactured parts there are some processes that have a one-dimensional unit process where for example you are squirting a row of droplets of liquid onto the part at any given moment the hewlett packard multi-jet fusion printers are an example of that object printers these are printing resins that will solidify once they've been jetted onto the surface so uh the ability to produce multi-material parts but also rather slower um than than it could be and then you've got 2d unit processes where you create one layer of an object at a time and this is very often referred to as stereolithography or digital light printing and if you've come across the company carbon or carbon 3d they make very fast stereo lithography systems um what they're doing is they're shining up a pattern of light from a video projector up through a tray of resin and solidifying um a microscopically thin layer of material one at a time so you that's faster than 0d or 1d but it's still slow and you still get directionality in the mechanical properties of the objects that are produced to some degree so for a while people have been thinking well could you actually do a truly 3d process where you create the whole 3d object at once and one approach to that is to do what's called holography where you create a three-dimensional field of light by interfering many beams coming in from different angles and the uh because light has a specific wavelength and you can control the relative phase of many different uh rays of light you can get them to interfere and create a 3d pattern of light and if you're you're printing into a photosensitive material where that light is brighter you're going to get solidification so this seems uh like a thing that's worth pursuing a lot of people are pursuing it we looked at it for a while the trouble with this is that um it's much easier to get high spatial resolution within the plane of the projector in other words from left to right in this sketch than it is in the direction the light is propagating it's hard to get high resolution in all dimensions the second problem with it is that because you're relying on phase and interference between uh different beams uh it's very very sensitive to tiny aberrations in the refractive index of that material one of the problems is as you solidify a photopolymer it's refractive then it actually goes up slightly so you're actually introducing scattering and errors as you print so what if you could do it without relying on phase just relying on intensity and um one thing that you could do is beam in different patterns of light from three orthogonal angles x y and z and where those those patterns of light intersected they would be brighter uh just by adding together the intensities of the light and you'd be able to solidify material so that's a great idea it could be very quick but it's quite geometrically limiting because you can only solidify where those beams actually intersect you're limited to basically quite symmetrical objects so we then thought well can we make a more general approach that is all about superimposing intensity and uh we looked at uh computed tomography which is an imaging technique that's used very very widely in engineering inspection in medicine you know you go to the hospital and get a ct scan they beam x-rays through the body from many many different angles capture an image of what is it and use software to reconstruct um with an algorithm what actually lies inside the body um so we thought let's flip that principle on its head and create objects tomographically rather than imaging them so we have now a rotating container of a light sensitive liquid like a photopolymer and we have a light projector just a normal video projector that is shining in a constantly evolving pattern of light from the side so as the object rotates the pattern is changing and over time the total dose of light the total number of photons that any given point in that volume receives can be controlled independently in x y and z where that dose exceeds the threshold you can get solidification so we call this process computed axial lithography or cow for sure here's a short video that explains how it works so let's say you want to print this at this thinker statue uh you take your cad model your stl file you would look at it from many many different angles in software and create what are called projections through that you then have to do some some manipulation of those some optimization but after that you string them together into a video you play it back into this rotating vat of light sensitive material it's important to note that this has the rays have to go through it getting very gently absorbed as they do so and so over time you're synthesizing this dose of photons but every point in the object is receiving uh light at any given moment which is crucial for being able to form the part um simultaneously once it's formed you can drain off the drain off the resin and post-process it so here are some very early videos that we made of the process working um and the light is coming in from the side and the the yellow container is the photosensitive material it's sped up a little bit and you'll see that um over time actually you're not seeing much but right at the end of the process you start to see the image changing and that's because the refractive index is going up as i mentioned it's starting to scatter light back into the camera so that you can see it so uh this is probably the biggest object that we've printed so far it's a dental model and here are some examples of components that we can print we can bring complex geometries that are not in any way symmetrical we can print uh lattices that have internal voids so even though the light is beaming through the volume you're not actually having to solidify everything inside you can print objects within objects you can print uh support suspended structures without actually having to have removable support material and as anyone who has worked with with other 3d printing processes may may know very often you you have to put in temporary support and break it away later well with us the liquid is the support we can use really high viscosity resins that provide that support during printing you can print into really soft materials like hydrogels which can potentially be really valuable for uh tissue engineering applications in the future and really the apparatus that we use for this is pretty simple um it's one axis of rotation it's an off-the-shelf video projector maybe an extra lens uh but it's not difficult to make the apparatus the materials are mixed from off-the-shelf components where the sophistication really lies is in the computation so we are trying to take a cad model of a part slice it and then figure out what should the projected video pattern be and i don't really have time to go into this much but we're using um something called the radon transform which is is widely used in computed tomography imaging but we have to add some sophistication on top of that for the following reason um in computed tomography it's fine if you um there's no restriction on whether the signal that you're capturing needs to be positive or negative but in projecting light you can't have a negative intensity so whatever pattern we design in our video that gets projected in it has to be has to be either zero intensity or finite positive intensity and actually a lot of the work that we do now is trying to come up with better algorithms that will take the raw output of the radon transform find it so that when you project back the light with this constraint that it has to be positive intensity you can actually get close to the desired geometry um so this is an example of what you have just immediately after the radon is applied and this is after some optimization things have sharpened up you get a much sharper transition of dose we're working a lot right now on printing very soft materials printing these hydrogels we care about that because creating artificial vasculature systems networks of blood vessels with a wide range of length scales is really important and they have to be very very soft so young's modularly down to maybe a hundred pascals in some types of tissue so this is something where our process um potentially comes comes into its own uh because of the constant support that the resin gives you okay i'm going to actually just uh stop sharing my screen and just make a few uh more remarks um before i finish um i realize i'm gonna ten after so i'll try and wrap up fairly fairly rapidly um so i saw there are a lot of great questions about you know how to find good research opportunities and uh and how many different research and extracurricular things to do and i i think you know most most students grapple with this and that i certainly did as a student i did a lot of theater actually designing theater and doing production of theater and that uh is is almost an unbounded time sink if you let it be so um i'm well acquainted with the challenges of managing time um i would say um obviously i'm just one of about 40 or more faculty in our department um almost all of us are doing research most of the time so uh i i would really encourage you to just go and connect with either people you're taking classes with or people who's whose research papers or websites look interesting to you um i would second the comment about persevering i'm afraid my email inbox is always overflowing so even though i would love to be really prompt and and allow you wanted to be in the lab sometimes it's uh things through the crack so definitely persevere and um as to sort of how to balance whether to do lots of different things or whether to sort of focus focus on on on a limited number i think that there are arguments both ways and honestly i would say one of the nicest things about doing undergraduate research is that it really it helps you to gauge um whether graduate school is something you would enjoy and um so there's a world of difference of course between you know doing doing well in coursework where the the objectives are well defined and the knowledge is defined um versus research where the whole point is we we don't know what the outcome is going to be we are trying to be the first people in the world to figure something out so um that sort of uh uncertainty or the the need to be charting a path with colleagues is something that can be really unsettling at first and it takes a little while to get used to it and embrace it so um i would say give yourself the opportunity to embrace it and that may mean doing doing multiple stints in different labs um you probably want to see do you want to do more computational work um as with as with cal you know we do a lot of algorithm development but we also do a lot of experimentation in the lab so different people like like doing different things that will ultimately inform which which labs you may want to do graduate work in if that's what you do end up doing or what what in this industrial position you you seek so um i would say enough to get a cross-section but also it is worth um it is worth sticking with something i would say to the point where you can prove a contribution and you know what's really nice is if you if you can somehow get get your get your name onto a conference paper or a journal paper that the lab you're in is producing and you know if you if you go and work work there work with a grad student contribute show up um that's totally doable i think um so i i would say having that having that marker there that you know i was in a lab i contributed and here's what here's what i have got to show for it that is really potentially quite quite valuable when it comes to graduate school applications and so on so um i hope that that is helpful to people um oh and and you know some people may not be aware that you know research doesn't have to be on a volunteer basis a lot of it is but a lot of it is also uh paid um of grants that people have um and and also you can get credit there are various course numbers for for independent studies centered around research so i hope that has been somewhat helpful ricky is is there anything else you'd like me to say thank you dr taylor for giving us a great presentation uh right now we're going to be transitioning into a virtual tour of the machine shop and uh but i think we have time for one or two questions so if anybody has one or two questions feel free to ask them in the chat someone wrote isn't this basically still 2d where you're just rotating instead of translating um no because you are you are constantly able to expose every point in the volume even though the intensity that is being seen at any given point may be fluctuating over time every point can be getting exposed over time and that's important because actually one of the main things that limits the throughput of a 2d photopolymer process where you're lifting the object out of a tray is the the hydrodynamic effect so i think you you're actually printing um printing a fine layer of material and you've got to lift it up and actually in doing that you've got to you've got to draw in liquids to replace the fill the gap that's being created and the resin has a finite viscosity if you're printing a wide thin component that will take time so no it's it's you know that's the big departure the the object you're printing every point is getting exposed simultaneously and you don't have relative motion of the object relative to the liquid while you're printing so you can actually use a wider range of materials much more viscous materials or even things that are gels at the time they're being printed does the process necessarily rely on using visibly transparent materials ah good good question that was one of the questions that the reviewers asked us as you might imagine so it has to be uh it has to be reasonably transparent to the light that you are using to initiate the solidification reaction and that wavelength we work with a lot of different wavelengths everything from um long long wavelength uv so three six five three seven five nanometers to blue to even green and um you want it to be absorbent enough that the process takes place at a reasonable rate you've got to get the photons absorbed to trigger the the chemical reaction but not so absorbent that it all gets absorbed near the edge and and actually we think that the process is at its fastest when um the uh when about um uh one over e of the intensity is absorbed by the time you get to the middle of the vat so if you wanted to make things that were um visibly opaque you could you could do that with some with some constraints if you if you put a dye in that is not going to absorb at the illuminating wavelength and we did that actually with a dye called crystal violet which looks purple um so it transmits really well at uv and blue that absorbs at longer wavelengths and so you can you can sort of play off the the the illumination and then the the appearance of it all right well thank you dr taylor i really appreciate uh your willingness to join us during uh gbo and i'm sure all the students look forward to meeting with you in the spring yeah i look forward to it too all right okay okay oh one more question sorry they keep coming count the dive you put in later um not not that easily because once you've solidified it the diffusivity of materials goes goes right down you could certainly put coatings on um one thing we thought about is could you kind of precipitate little nanocrystals after you've printed to turn it from transparent to opaque but we haven't been able to do that yet okay okay i don't want to take up the entire afternoon um yeah okay okay this last one and if um you can email me actually hkt at berkeley if you have other questions but um do you have an indication as to whether photoactive materials are suitable for human tissue um i mean you know photopolymers and um their biocompatibility has been a huge field of study for a long time there are plenty of photo initiators that have been proven biocompatible um we actually when we started doing this work we actually focused on um something called camphor quinone which is used in in the dental space it's sensitive to blue light which is preferred because you don't have to shine uv into people's mouths so that that's definitely a huge um a huge area of research and we're taking advantage of what has been done all right thank you so much and we'll be transitioning to a virtual tour of the machine shop uh followed by uh an introduction from our machine shop specialist thank you dr taylor hello and welcome to the mechanical engineering student access machine shop my name is jacob and i'm one of five technical staff members that work here in the student shop today i'm going to take you on a tour of this shop and show you some of the equipment that students have access to but first i'd like to describe what it is that we do here the student access machine shop provides students with a unique hands-on learning experience that helps bridge the gap between the theoretical and practical worlds of engineering here students learn about machinery that's commonly used in present-day manufacturing this experience helps students better understand the abilities and limitations of various manufacturing techniques and ultimately makes them better designers and engineers students can get access to the student machine shop by belonging to one of the three following university-based organizations class research and pre-approved extracurricular team-based projects students belonging to any one of these three organizations can receive full access to the shop after completing our comprehensive shock training course the hands-on portion of the training covers the basic fundamentals for operation of most machines in the shop including belt sanders band saws drill presses engine lanes and milling machines at the end of the training students are asked to reproduce this part the 3d printers the machine begins printing the 3d model at the very bottom and works its way up one layer at a time until the entire print is completed the process for 3d printing begins with the development of a cad file or computer aided design file from there the cad file is imported into 3d printing software where it is graphically sliced horizontally and a tool path is generated for each layer the tool path specifies the motion of the printer and instructs the machine where to displace material once the cad file has been sliced any tool path has been generated for each layer the code is then loaded onto the 3d printers and the machines can begin printing the object 3d printing is an excellent resource for rapid prototyping students are able to design a component and then produce a three-dimensional object in a matter of a few hours this allows them to test the form and fit of a component and really get a sense of how it interacts with other components oftentimes a design will have pitfalls that the designer could not have anticipated until having the physical part in front of them however because of the relative speed and ease of 3d printing students can make design changes to their cad files and reprint the component within only a matter of a few hours and can continue this process until they are fully satisfied with the object's functionality once they have finalized a design for a component they can then proceed with manufacturing that component out of a more durable material on another machine [Music] a cnc machine or computer numerical control is a machine whose movements and commands are executed by a central computer control this is a cnc milling machine milling machines are equipped with a rotating spindle where a cutting tool is stationed the work pieces fed into that rotating header it removes material the movements of the workpiece along the x and the y-axis as well as the movement of the spindle along the z-axis are controlled by this central controller additionally the rotational speed of the spindle how quickly the workpiece is fed into the cutter tool changes and much more are also controlled by this controller the control and in turn the movements of the machine is driven by a conversational programming language called g-code g-code is an alphabetical and numerical-based programming language that tells the machine to execute a command where to execute it and how quickly to execute it it can repeat these commands efficiently repeatedly and accurately this makes the machine highly useful in large scale manufacturing applications where thousands of parts need to be made daily and each of those parts needs to be identical here is a sample part that we'll be cutting in our demonstration i'd like to point out that once i start the program at no point in time during the cutting process will i have to intervene or interact with the machine cnc machines are meant to automate many of the manually based manufacturing processes previously used ultimately increasing efficiency quality control and productivity i'd also like to point out the tool changing system on this machine this machine is equipped with a 20 station tool changing carousel this means that up to 20 different tools can be loaded into the machine and used to cut a wide variety of features on a part the machine will swap out the current tool in this spindle for a different one at a specified point in the program hello [Music] uh [Music] um hello all right [Music] okay all right um i want to bring scott to the stage uh who are our machine shop specialists who will be able to answer any questions that you might have so for those that missed it earlier um i provided a link to the page where you can actually see the video um you shouldn't have the like lag and like sort of audio that we were experiencing here i'll just go ahead and post that up in the chat again if you missed it um and um yeah scott do you want to introduce yourself and uh let all the folks know uh how much experience you have sure uh pardon my getup but i'm actually uh i'm on campus so trying to follow all proper safety protocols uh my name's scott mccormick i'm the manager that for the technical staff for the department of mechanical engineering so that includes the student access machine shop which jacob is one of my colleagues there's also two other technical staff that work in the student shop full time under normal circumstances you would be signing up with us for a safety orientation for the student shop which takes approximately about five hours and which time you get a lot of hands-on experience it's the student shop is about 5600 square feet we have a wide array of of both traditional machine tools as far as kind of unconventional machining processes um i would say that uh modestly we are one of the premier student shops in the world um you you won't find anything that's probably better equipped than what we've currently got unfortunately right now we're not getting in here but i'm hoping that in the near future or this pandemic gets resolved and we can welcome people back into the shop the other side of the technical staff is we do support all the instructional laboratories for mechanical engineering so there's a lot of upper class what we call hands-on laboratories either a mechatronics or various different engineering uh based laboratories where you get to actually get involved with either testing equipment or testing materials or building a project of your own design so i think that's with that i'm gonna i'm gonna pass this on to jacob and uh thank you very much and looking forward to seeing everybody here soon um so there's a couple of questions that came up in the chat um william asks do we have to have training on every machine to use any of them so basically the way that our shop training works and this is also highlighted in the video so i'd recommend you go and check this out just for your own sort of future reference but the way that our shop training works is it's a comprehensive shop training course it's not sort of like cherry pick which machines you want to end up using um so our shop training course as scott had mentioned it's five hours and it's sort of a comprehensive every single machine in the shop we'll show you the basics on how to use a belt sander drill press band saw engine lathe and then a milling machine um and there's of course some accessory machines that go along with it but basically in order to use the facilities in order to come into the facilities you need to have that shop training done and um you'll make a widget like this little sort of like part i wish i had one in front of me right now um but um you could check check out that video and like i said it kind of explains the whole process on that so to answer your question it's not sort of piece mealy we don't just train you on one machine in particular um it'll be all the machines and then you have full access to the facilities and you know if i can kind of add in on that to kind of elaborate on on jacob's um the the staff are here you know full time so uh and probably one of the well i will say the absolute best aspect of this shop besides having all the cool tools and machine tools is the technical staff they're very much mentor-minded a lot of years of experience we have very diverse backgrounds and and we work off each other's kind of strengths so you get this five hours of safety orientation and as i kidding to say use your project when you come back in to do a project it doesn't ever look like the widget so there's always a lot of questions and this is one of the things that i'm very proud of our technical staff is they're very welcoming and have the time to you know kind of walk you through the project and answer your questions um so we've had many many students say that this has been one of the highlights of their experiences the time they spend in our student shop anything else you'd like to add scott if there's something i would just i'm just reading through the reading through jackson was asking how often do classes have projects that we can use the shop for um i would probably say unless you know somebody's going to correct me on this one that classes class projects are going to be primarily for your um upper division coursework so junior and senior year is when you're going to start getting into some of those courses um just to name a few off the top of my head that'd be me 102 b a mechatronics course any 135 um it's another uh course um mu-103 me 107. scott you could probably chime in and name more than twice as much as i can yeah but kind of yeah i think everybody gets the idea that it's it's primarily junior and senior uh the one thing that is coming down the pipe and that's uh professor taylor mentioned this transition from e27 to e29 we're in the pro and this is going to probably be second semester sophomore in the in the curriculum and we are working towards making that kind of our uh threshold class to where you can actually get in um and and and get the training and have access to the shop on the next question is this is the shop reserved for classes only the answer is no primarily our class projects are our first priority however we do support some research and we also support a lot of this the student club activities so like formal sae super mileage vehicle solar car uh rocket team hyperloop i mean it goes on and on the uh those typically are a good gateways for our freshmen is to join one of those teams and get invested with them and then and then they submit lists of students every semester for us to be candidates to get to get uh trained and have shop access and i gotta say that uh i personally think that that's a stellar threshold or you know way to get into the shop early you'll get a lot of experience a lot of mentoring from upperclassmen while you're working on these various student projects and i see a big difference in in kind of the development of our students that go through one of these student courses that's given you get the time and kind of the perseverance to stay with it i will add to that because aiden was asking about how can freshmen get access to the machines machinery so we've mentioned basically two organizations that you can belong to that'll get you shop access and that would be class projects and that would also be these uh extracurricular team-based organizations um the third avenue that you can get into is by joining a research lab that you would need to fabricate components for and so if you belong to any one of the three if you were a freshman and you were really kind of wanting to get in there and get access to the shop and manufacture components for a laboratory that's another way that you can get in is by joining a research group i also do want to mention that on the curriculum flow chart it shows e29 as a fall course for your third semester which is your sophomore year as scott was mentioning however folks that have e26 under their belt we'll also be prepared to take e29 uh in the spring semester as well too so uh there we definitely anticipate that there will be a lot of first-year students that will be in e29 this upcoming spring so william asks about how much does it cost to use the machines the question is more are you asking about who does it who to pay for who pays for the taxpayer or you as a student well the students it's actually free so the access to our facilities um scott has really tried to drive that students don't pay for access here what we require students pay for is their materials themselves so if they're going to be doing a student project they need to be able to provide their own materials but when it comes to actually using equipment and the you know machinery that you see here the tooling and everything else that's all provided to you um so i guess the answer is free of charge for the most part with the exception of of course your materials i have a question uh this is a question that comes up often but what about personal projects are you allowed to uh engage in a startup and run it through the shop oh good job ricky all right there's always that question unfortunately you know being that we are supported by mechanical engineering and they do pay the bill um you know our our mission is pretty clear that it's it's it has to be academia so unfortunately we we we really dissuade people from you know uh personal projects and and and doing startups uh there are other resources on and off campus that we can point you to for that type of situation what about making a keychain for your mom that's uh listening at home right now um yeah it's it's ideally we you know sometimes you gotta catch us at the right time um you know and how how good of an art how how well can you convince us but typically we really try to avoid it because we if we focus on that one kind of freebie that's not academically related that means that there might be two or three other people on the shop that need our help that we're not focusing on so it's it's it's really kind of a courtesy to everybody else in the shop that we avoid that um i will kind of add to that um so um while while echeveria is the you know home of mechanical engineering this is a couple of other departments um one of our neighbors jacobs hall actually has a whole a place a maker space where you can go and make things especially personal projects theirs is set up a little bit differently um you have to buy materials and you also have to buy basically a maker pass um so i forget who asked this question william asks about you know how much does it cost to use a machine so i think that you pay a flat fee and for that flat fee you get access to all of the equipment for the semester and their training is set up a little bit differently um it is much more piecemealy like i think william was asking about earlier so you get trained on individual machines and then you can use those machines so i'll link to that below if you're interested and again this place jacobs hall allows personal project class personal projects class projects and pretty much everything under the sun so i'll include that link in the description and um yeah you guys can refer to that aiden was asking about is there an avenue to purchase materials through the shop so we don't actually really have a whole lot of space to be holding on to all the different sort of materials that you'd want to have you know we have a selection of it but we really don't sell the students we can give you a smaller piece of material you know if it's for a small little project but you know if it's beyond a certain threshold we're going to have to you know basically have you go and get it so we have a list of preferred online and local vendors as well that we can provide to you um but you know if it's for a big project you're probably gonna have to make a run out you know locally or just order it online again one last thing you can order materials through jacob's hall they have a materials store where you can purchase things like commonly used materials like acrylic plywood aluminum steel plate and things like that and have it shipped to jacob's hall and pay for it through them and i believe that the building is very similar to um i think it's just a credit card um but i could be mistaken so check that out if you're interested and aiden if you're interested i can get that link for you the jacobs hall material store as well you know that kind of if i can just add upon that just slightly uh another reason that we typically don't sell materials like jacob touched upon is that there's you know there's a wide array but also you know we recognize that that that you are going to be engineers and so developing bills of material specking materials instead of us just going you know here here's a piece of material that's good enough you're relying on us where really is engineers that's some of the critical decisions you should make and it's good practice to you know kind of go out and and do that so just kind of one of my own personal things scott and jacob i wanted to ask about uh we we threw out a lot of different courses earlier and for new students that might sound a little bit like a foreign language in terms of let's just naming off a few courses uh can you just uh one of the big one of the big ones though is 102 b which really is like a culmination of the student experience uh where they're combining multiple skill sets into one uh in order to present at an inventor space the invention lab which we call hestia hall can you describe what that experience is like and some of the most unique and fun projects that you've come across throughout your time jacob you want to take a seven i was gonna have you kind of kind of scope yourself out okay all right so me 102 is is actually been around in their department for many many many many years um it's it's really a capstone project class but unlike a lot of universities that will give you a prescribed you need to make this part and then you know they really kind of lock into a a particular uh theme uh here at berkeley we take much more of an approach of you know to stimulate your your curiosity and your creativity that we don't put that type of uh threshold on you we basically it's a mechatronics course so it has to have an embedded you know microprocessor um and from there it's pretty much uh ideally you want to keep it to a meter cubed in size and other than those two parameters you're pretty much off to whatever you want we've had the startup for like the mars rover they did they started their first couple iterations so their project through 102 b um a few years ago i'll make this a real quick story but when uh the news star wars movies came out and one of the characters was that uh character bb-8 uh one of those groups came to us and said oh we want to build a bb-8 and it was quite challenging but they they actually pulled it off it was just absolutely impressed us that the elegance of the uh to the point where they wanted to when they got their degree and walked on stage they were trying to figure out how they could get bba to go on stage for them to ex help them accept their degree unfortunately administration wasn't real fond of that idea but i i was all for it i thought it was going to be too cool but just the the beauty of one of 2b is is again is it's it's pretty wide open so if you have a particular passion it's you know it's it's music it's electronics it's science fiction it's you know whatever it it really you can play to it one of my favorite projects was the liquid cooled helmet uh that i saw and also last year what was really amazing was the the record player that was built from driftwood that was found on the side of the road a real ecological project brought to life which was really nice to see all right well looks like we're going to be transitioning into our student panel which a lot of the folks have been waiting for i'm really grateful for scott's uh expertise for coming in and sharing for jacob for really just putting together the video i know we had a bit of issues with it but we do have an uninterrupted version on our website that's now up that you'll be able to watch ultimately extremely grateful for you too for all the work that you do for all the guidance that you provide for our students on a consistent basis when i'm in session with students uh they'll still just be raving about how great these two individuals are so i'm so thankful that i get to work alongside them and thank you for sharing your time with us today yeah thank you and and ricky can i do the the traditional thing yeah go bears yes of course everybody's gonna get tired of that by the time by the time we get through with this i think it keeps all our spirits up you know one thing that i love about being a berkeley alum is that wherever i am in the world if someone's wearing a cow shirt or a cow hat if you go bear them they usually go bear you back and if they don't then you know they're just it's like their cousin's t-shirt or something you know yeah i was actually in in france a couple years ago and i got a couple of those it was pretty awesome i was just waiting to hear it in french you know so all right well uh we're gonna be transitioning to our student panel uh our student panel right now is currently sitting in the audience and we'll take a bit of a break i'd like to ask our audience to just uh close your eyes for 10 seconds uh as i want to help out a little bit with just a little bit of screen fatigue so let's just do this 10 second exercise of just closing our eyes real quickly and take a deep breath everyone all right um so right now i'm uh i'll say goodbye to scott and jacob and thank you so much for joining us thank you ricky thank you jacob all right so we're approaching the uh one o'clock mark which is when our student panel is scheduled to join us um right now they haven't requested to join the screen so they're not quite here yet uh please use this time of course to take a bio break if you need one and uh just relax for a little bit since being on in session for three hours can be a little tiring so oh we got granny in the house all right brandon just joined us we'll start in five minutes you can't see me though can you not at the moment okay let me get on that all right we also have michael nashon and while we're waiting i'm going to uh put up our our flow chart just in case anybody has any questions that i can answer uh before we get started at 1pm yes i can thank you for joining us can you see me now right yes i can see you sweet and for those of you who might have left and are just joining us we'll be starting at 1pm we have a group of some exceptionally great panelists that are here to give you some uh insight from ground level experiential wisdom of what it was like to be an mn student at the number one public university in the universe michael how are you doing do you need your uh how's your video going i'm doing good can you hear me okay yeah sounds good yeah all right so in about a minute i'm gonna be introducing everybody everybody just hang tight all right let's get this show on the road um all right so uh first i'd like to introduce frannie uh granny barthel has graduated berkeley with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in the spring of 2020 she's now becoming a fifth year master's student and is focused in control uh her experiences mostly in the aerospace sector but she hopes to in the future that we can apply her engineering education to environmental engineering to help fight climate change franny loves ocean uh swimming cooking with all her friends she loves to run pretty much anything that happens outside she's super excited to jump in and start working on her masters but above all she's excited to be a mom one day her best piece of advice to incoming students is to not is to not make engineering your whole entire life while you're here at cal get out there have some fun and love all your friends next we have michael nash michael nash isn't it is a senior expected to graduate in the spring he's from auburn who transferred from sierra college in his free time he rides mountain bikes and he just he doesn't just ride he's actually a professional mountain biker from what i remember reading he's currently a student assistant at the lawrence berkeley national lab he helps design uh radiation shielding for the advanced light source and he plans to get his master's degree after graduation and then go into industry lastly we have alex zapata alex graduated last may with a degree in mechanical engineering he's originally from southern california and he transferred from mount san antonio college in 2017. during his time at berkeley alex was a member of the space technologies at cal the helms research group at the lawrence berkeley national lab and the combustion fire processing lab with dr fernandez bayo he and he interned at spacex at jpl during his time at school and he's currently working full-time at jpl for those that don't know what jpl is that's the jet propulsion laboratory and there he's working on their environments and mechanical reliability group he's planning to pursue a master's degree in astronautical engineering at usc next next year so we got a lot of talent in the house and it is my absolute joy and honor this is the best part of my job is interacting with students and uh we'll start with the lead question and then hopefully folks will start asking questions in the audience now that everybody's shaking off their nerves a little bit uh please come on camera please request the speak we're more than happy to to see you and and hear you ask your question live so please just ask your question uh live if you can and if you're willing but we'll also be taking questions from the chat so we'll start with a team question um you know berkeley has a bit of a competitive edge uh sometimes there's this folklore that exists about berkeley before you even arrive on campus is that uh berkeley's this uh this quote-unquote cutthroat institution and uh for me it's always important for me to talk to our students about this because these are just mythologies that keep recreating ourselves here to the next and i think it's important for us to talk about how we collaborate and work with one another so for our panelists uh what are ways that you've worked in teams to accomplish common goals in the classroom and how has that been beneficial to your overall success but first go ahead okay um i think this is kind of a short answer but one of the most helpful things um for me when i was studying or um yeah just learning the new material with people was understanding that the best way i learned it was to teach my friends and to even teach people that weren't my friends like anyone that um asked for help don't be afraid to give help because a you're you know you're helping your students learn that's what we're all here to do and second of all like yourself is by explaining it to someone else like it's actually an opportunity for you to a be a team with this person and one day they're most definitely going to help you because you know we all need help but it's actually one of the best ways i've found to engage with the material you learn in the courses and kind of like be a teammate to your friend is there anything any of the other panelists would like to add all right we'll take a question from martin who's in the audience so martin let's come let's bring you on screen uh i just added you i'm not sure where you went i'm here all right i don't know why you can't come on screen where you are all right yes martin hello so i'm very excited about my journey and thank you everyone for being here so um so from my beginning so me i'm interested in um in going to graduate school for phd so from what i hear from everyone that i should be focusing more on research labs getting these type of opportunities and trying to get some like papers and publications however i feel honestly kind of lost how to begin i feel there are too many ways and too many directions to go and i'm not really sure what is the optimal direction to take especially as a transfer student i don't have that much time to explore so i can't mess up my chances do you have kind of any guidance how should i begin or what what is the direction i should take at the beginning at least i don't think we can hear you alex yeah i was able to hear him were other people not able to hear him his question oh i wasn't we're able to hear martin yeah but not alex oh okay okay okay um i'll i i have an answer um you know i when i started here last year i was a transfer student as well um what i chose to do was uh take an internship instead of doing research um because you know i'm a little bit more focused on going into industry but i would say wait until you actually have classes and get to know your professors because your professors uh will be the ones who can get you into one of these undergraduate research groups um and keep in mind that some of them might not include pay um you might have to give up a lot of time during the semester and possibly your summer um but you know if if you want to go into the phd route uh i definitely suggest you do that and um get signed up with somebody in the fall i also want to comment that there are different programs that exist that help students acquire research positions by equipping them with the tools so for example there's the mcnair scholars program that give students uh you know the training that they need in order to develop a research proposal uh in order to be able to you know get their their hands dirty and their feet wet on you know the ins and outs and the nuances of conducting research i think that once you get that training it allows you to be a little bit more marketable as well while you're communicating with faculty so i definitely recommend different programs like the mcnair scholars program i also recogn recommend going on research.berkeley.edu which will provide you with a lot of different resources on how to develop proposals uh how to work with like human subjects just the different ins and outs there's also good tips at research.berkeley.edu around um you know how to communicate with faculty and how to be persistent and give you know put your best foot forward in terms of building the communication that you need in order to gain uh you know that this the valuable communication skills that you need in order for you to to land a different research opportunity i would start by going and observing our major field areas on our website at me.berkeley.edu click on people click on faculty click on their major field areas and just start exploring the different possibilities now there's different faculty that are doing things like for example in um you know they're doing things in fluids like through the flow lab but they still need somebody who can do programming and you might have that skill set and you might think like well i'm not really interested in fluids but you know i have this skill set in programming you might not necessarily know by reading that so you know it's really important for you to ask there's also graduate students who teach courses uh that you could also have set up informational meetings with and i think that that's also an important um you know social capital that you can build by communicating and accessing them as well so there's like you said there's multiple ways uh but just chip out one one by one just do something that you know first spend some time reflecting and figuring out like what type of research you actually want to do and then start narrowing in on like the different people who are experts in that area and try to get as much guidance as you can from them sometimes just like learning from different people's labs you start to ask the relevant and curious driven questions that allow you to open up more opportunities for yourself we have another question in the chat martin i'm gonna i'm gonna take you off but if you have another question feel free to come back on okay thank you so much no problem uh there's a question as to why did you choose to attend berkeley since uc d doesn't have arrow and what led you to go into arrow i think this question's for frannie oh um yes so i have experience in aerospace i specifically mean that's i've been able to do two internships during my time um at cal they were both just summer long and they were both um in aerospace the one with with us the one was with a small startup called astra space in alameda and then the second one was with virgin orbit um and in the meantime i actually got involved with a fellowship called the brook owens fellowship which if you're a non-male identifying one person interested in aerospace you should definitely check that out it's a really awesome fellowship um so aerospace just kind of happened to be the internships that i got accepted to and then i got that fellowship so it kind of kept going in that direction and i was like exploring aerospace but it kind of just like happened that way um i think especially at the beginning i was just eager to get an internship like a lot of people are and then i think having those two experiences in aerospace um even though they're both really wonderful has made me want to try something else so i didn't even come to berkeley uh knowing i wanted to do anything with aerospace so it wasn't like it didn't put me off that it didn't have aerospace because i i didn't even know that i would want to do something with that coming in um i hope that answers the question but the fellowship is called the brook owens fellowship if you have any interest in space i really encourage you to check it out yeah i think programs like that are are really valuable in terms of creating access points for different people um especially non-identifying males who are very much needed in this field i must say that mechanical engineering is uh by all means like the territory of like the aerospace industry uh most a good amount of our students like have gone on to be to work for nasa or even become uh you know astronauts and lock in tons of space hours so uh you do get the training that is definitely valuable and that will prepare you to succeed in aerospace uh to add to that we also have an aerospace miner as we mentioned earlier um so uh we're gonna take a a question from somebody who wants to come on screen and then we'll transition over to the other chat questions i think it takes a little bit of time but uh they're on their way you probably have to like fly through yeah it's a pretty dramatic entrance how's it going good good good good afternoon yeah good afternoon uh my name is jonathan i'm a freshman so this is my first year and i was just wondering about like internships and stuff when do you start like what year should that or should i be like already searching because i don't feel like i have the skill sets really to work for any internships or anything yet so i was wondering when you should do that um you know so i started pretty early from junior college i think typically at junior colleges we have more of an emphasis on getting an internship because sometimes you know you don't know which school you're going to go to it might be harder to get a job the way i did it was i applied for a government internship called sui it's through the department of energy where you can basically uh go and work for a summer it's a paid internship and uh you can pick basically any field and work at any of the department of energy national labs i chose the berkeley lab because you know i was going to uc berkeley and everything and that's what led to my current internship that i do through the school year and throughout the summer now um but yeah i mean in my opinion uh you should start now you know start looking for next summer um the only limiting thing is if you have to take summer classes to catch up or something like that you know always put school first um but you know it's never too early to start okay cool thank you i would just add to that i did not do an internship my the summer after my freshman year i was like a lifeguard and i took summer classes um so i i totally think that like it's especially in your it is great to have internships but i think especially what i think is like in your first summer if you find something that really excites you and is awesome totally go for it but don't kill yourself and feeling like you need to have an internship every single summer um especially you know like maybe it's something that if if you go into it knowing that it's not gonna bring you anything you're not going to enjoy it i personally think that might not be like the most worthwhile thing to do especially because like you're saying like right now you don't have as many skill sets or you haven't learned as much that you can kind of advertise to people hiring and so really the more juicy internships that you could get will probably come like next year or the year after that so if there was ever a summer where you wouldn't take an internship where you might just want to like earn more money or or just like be with your family then i would say that that should be your first summer um so i think like if you find something that's really cool you should do that but i think there's a lot of pressure on new freshmen coming in to get an internship right away um and you know it doesn't always work out that way so i wouldn't i wouldn't worry too much as long as you like hopefully get one or two in there along your four years at some point is what i would say okay cool yeah thank you um and i also had one more question which was uh do like joining clubs and stuff help you get these internships and things like if they see that you're like part of different clubs and different like things like that then will that will they like take that into consideration and stuff absolutely i i mean 100 i think there's probably no better way to get an internship at a really good company um you know for example my buddy who joined the formula sae team uh before he even got to the next connections at spacex and went and did an internship there this summer which was actually interesting because they were one of the only companies actually doing in-person internships so um yeah if if you want to join a team definitely go for it that's a really good way to get your foot in the door in some of these industries yeah i think that one thing that's really awesome about our our department and our student organizations is that it there there's so much more to them than just being clubs you know they're they really are build teams they're they in many ways they're uh compatible with industry standards in terms of the type of machines that they're building and i think that you know like mike said earlier like you know having that proximity to industry by being part of a student organization is really important you get that because indus our students are so uh talented that industries are consistently looking uh you know at our department at our student organizations and seeing what they're doing because that many times they're they're really pushing the edge of innovation and uh industries want to be part of that and they want to be a part of it uh while you're actually in school so one thing that i love about you know our department is that you are gaining a really strong and practical skill set from day one all right cool thank you guys that helped a lot that was all my questions thank you jonathan i appreciate you coming on uh mcdolly had a question i think for franny they were just asking if i have confessed i just put my berkeley email in there i hope that's okay yeah um i think there was a question up at the top about the best way to get internships but maybe we kind of addressed that just like all right we have a another uh brave soul that wants to come on which is sebastian and they'll be on soon oh he's running a lot quicker hi my name's uh sebastian i'm a freshman or incoming freshman freshman i guess now um and i had two questions one was um is it helpful to build almost like a portfolio that would demonstrate either your like cad design skills or like programming skills as far as like um like applying for internships or is it more that like they just want to see maybe like the actual class that you've taken on your resume or that you're proficient in you know uh some program or some language on your resume that's my first question um and also my second one's a little bit um kind of for michael but i'm also a mountain biker my bike's for the moment because the bike storage only opened today um and i was wondering if there were any like student-run clubs on um at berkeley that like pertain to bike design or something like that because that's something i'm also interested in maybe for after college um yeah so you had two questions the first question was about a portfolio and um you know coming again coming from a junior college uh we're super heavy on um you know getting a job at the end of this um and in my opinion uh when you graduate you know everyone has to do everyone has a bachelor's degree so you have to have something that's going to set yourself apart from other candidates um it's a good bachelor's degree you know this is one of the best schools and and people take that into consideration um when thinking about what kind of skills you already have and stuff like that but um you know for example you know i definitely have a portfolio i have uh you know reports that i've written um i have things that i've designed cad work that i've done and i don't necessarily give it on every application but it's good once you find a point of contact just to kind of dump a lot of your qualifications onto them uh send them an email uh with just your whole portfolio and that way they kind of get to know what you're about um what they can expect from you if they do choose to hire you um i hope that answers that question the second question um you know i recognize that bike it's a it's a one ghost my brother actually has that same bike um and yeah cal has a cycling team and um you can actually join and compete in collegiate mountain bike racing they have cross country they have enduro i believe i believe you can race downhill i'm not sure but yeah i was going to join the team this fall unfortunately covet happened so i probably won't be able to join the team um but yeah check out cal cycling and they also do group rides and stuff so you know if you're bored and you just want to get out and exercise uh you can go ride with them thanks guys all right thank you sebastian all right we got alex back yeah sorry about that has some technical difficulties but i'm back on it's all good maybe you could take the next question it was for frannie but she's been answering a lot of them uh it had to do with uh you know how do you secure an aerospace internship specifically um you know i kind of alluded earlier that you know mechanical engineering does equip you with a really strong foundational skill set uh to be marketable in the aerospace engineering uh but maybe you can maybe you could take that question yeah so um yeah so that was a major concern in mind because i knew when i transferred i wanted to focus on aerospace in in particular uh but but as this person probably already knows there's no aerospace um uh major here uh although i when i was graduating i did hear that there is now an aerospace focus i'm not really too aware of that but at least in my time i didn't know about it uh so i would say definitely get involved in in extracurriculars that are aerospace focused um you know there's a lot of clubs on campus that um have different uh uh focuses and interests um i was part of cal star when i first came it was a rocketry club and then i was part of stack space technologies at cal where i was working on cubesats um if you want to get more into like you know airplanes and aeronautics you can do aero sae so there's a bunch of different paths that you can go depending on the focus you want so you'll have to just reach out in my opinion further in the classroom um and and that's that's definitely a good way to to get that specific kind of experience to kind of get your foot in the door um uh for for an internship in that field you know so when you have a recruiter talking to you about you know what it is that that you do that or um how how your experience could be related to this internship you're applying for whether it's like boeing or northrup or lockheed spacex you know somewhere like that uh you definitely want to show them something beyond just like your your emmy workload you want to show them like hey you know i have these interests and i do aerosc and i help design you know the fuselage and these wings and the landing gear whatever it is so definitely having that extra little bit would help you a lot all right i'm gonna i'm gonna lighten it up a little bit and ask a question myself and then we'll go back to the other questions that students have but let's talk about housing a little bit uh what's it like uh on campus uh what was your experience like with housing how does housing and the social the social and psychological choices you make around housing uh impact your academics i i could i could start that one and then we could all talk about it um yeah so for me uh mine was a bit of a risk when i when i transferred um it for transfer students is different uh you know we don't really have priority in getting housing uh from the school uh you have to uh pretty much go by your own means whether it's you know facebook marketplace there's a housing group on facebook i highly recommend utilizing that um or craigslist you know whatever it is uh to find an apartment but i actually ended up uh moving in with some random people that i had met on facebook and it was a super super big gamble but they ended up being some of my best friends that i still hang out with now and talk to now um and so you definitely want to surround yourself with people that will provide you a good amount of support um you know i i also i don't know if i would recommend you know living with a bunch of people who are only engineers um i did do that my my last two years which is completely fine we're all best friends but you know it's kind of hard to escape you know the work that you do in school when you come home and it's just everything's engineering focused um but but definitely you know moving with people that can provide you emotional support give you space when you need space um you know and don't be afraid to explore outside of uh just what the school provides you know dorms and i think they have like uh some transfer dorms or like some dorms like for like you know upperclassmen uh you know definitely go through facebook you know talk to friends see see what's out there um and and i know there's a there's a housing shortage um although right now with coke but i don't know how much of a problem that is i think a lot of people are going to be staying home um but but yeah definitely i try to try to surround yourself with good people and and uh and yeah branch out in different different avenues facebook craigslist you know student housing whatever i would definitely echo what alex said about um don't feel like you have to live with a bunch of engineers i never lived with engineers actually oh i am now as a master student but um it was really nice to actually get to like you know kind of leave school at school a little bit um i mean you stuff like study at home and stuff but hey you're like learning about what your peers are doing your roommates are doing and if they're taking like some cool class that maybe you can take on the side or something um yeah there's going to be a lot of like engineering talk in your day just like all your classes and the engineering kids you're learning with um i personally really enjoyed not having that follow me home so much um yeah just hopefully find people that can like make your home feel like a home and that you can feel like you relax when you come home i think it's hugely important to have a home that feels comfortable and a big piece of advice i would give is if it doesn't feel that way if you find yourself in a situation where you don't get to relax when you come home you feel like you actually have to escape your house um try to look for new housing like don't feel like you have to be stuck in that um for for four years try to figure out a way for someone to for some to somehow get out of that situation because i think that's huge and if you have that burden for that long that your home doesn't feel comfortable it's going to really take a toll on your social life on your school on everything all right just like to add one thing um if the logistics go if you're looking for a place off campus be very cognizant that you know a mile in berkeley is a lot farther than probably a mile where you're from i live about a mile from campus and i still actually drive a few blocks and depending on where you are you might have to walk up or down a big hill so if you're looking on campus definitely try to get as close as possible i i definitely agree with that i think i i lived in a lot of different type of places when i was on campus i lived in co-ops i lived in dorms i lived in apartments i definitely recommend uh living in rochdale village if folks have uh ever heard of that that's in that's one of the co-ops it's one of the apartments where you get your own room it's nice because you still have a community of uh like that you get to engage with in the living room you do a few hours to kind of engage with the with the setting you know maybe some gardening to do some hours to reduce your rent um maybe some recycling uh but at the same time you also get your own room and um but also i just want to say that like being part of uh you know your living space is absolutely important uh in terms of like just setting healthy boundaries so i think one thing that i appreciated about the people that i lived with was that you know if i wanted to go study there wasn't like this like kind of like this temptation to like bring you in and kind of get you to like socialize with them um because you know you do find that type of pressure when you're in college right uh so folks uh you know the more you can set uh set up healthy boundaries the better it can be for folks so we'll we'll move on to one of the questions that somebody asked in the chat uh you know we obviously have two students that are that are going to be starting their master's program michael's thinking about it somebody mentioned that they're just they're not really necessarily interested in pursuing a master's degree right after school but we're wondering whether pursuing research or an internship really matters in terms of getting that job once you graduate and i'll start off just by mentioning that um you know if you have a research opportunity and you want to engage with it it still will be valuable to an employer i think that the skills that you gain as a researcher um are skills that that are transferable and compatible and sometimes they'll be they'll be directly with what they're looking for um but i think that both experiences are comparable to preparing you for the next step yeah i agree with you ricky uh definitely you know both are really anything beyond just your regular classes is going to help you and i think to add on not just research and internship experience but also like club experience anything that shows that you have some initiative in you know pursuing uh some kind of field or some kind of area of focus that that you're interested in is definitely good to an employer um so in my you know i had for my own personal experience i had a combination um you know i did some research and i did uh some internships but the research i did wasn't really focused or related to what i'm doing now the research i did was i did it for a number of reasons one to diversify my portfolio and my resume uh because i think at the early point in time when i first transferred to birthday i wasn't exactly sure uh what it is i was gonna be doing so i was working in a bunch of different labs and doing a bunch of different things um but i started really honing in on what i wanted to do when i joined calstar and stack and you know those were in my first few interviews those were the main talking points what did you do in this club uh you know what have you learned here's a technical question related to you know rocketry um so i would say if you know where you want to be and you know what kind of work you want to be doing after you graduate find something on campus that is slightly related to it and start pursuing it that way and that way when career fairs come up and talk to employers and recruiters you show them you say hey you know i'm super interested in this and i started you know working on this subset in this club and you know i think i could bring this to the table and you know i definitely uh definitely show that you have some initiative that'll be a good way to give yourself a better chance in employment after graduation um yeah i would add on to what alex is saying um in that a lot of times it's not even so much the actual work that you did in the research um or i'm sorry i just got a notification okay um not so much that the actual work a lot of times because a lot of times people who are hiring they know they're gonna have to train you they know you're just a college grad you probably don't know that much you probably don't have that much experience and you know you could only do so many things there's no way that you did exactly what they're gonna need um in the job or the internship but highlight like how you're a leader highlight how you managed a lot of different things like alex said how you showed initiative how you had your own ideas um how you were invested things like that a lot of times um are really meaningful to people who are hiring you know how you were creative in solving a problem they know that your research isn't going to be exactly what you're going to be doing there they just want to know how you think they want to know that you're trainable that you can work in a team is hugely important that you can manage responsibility so i think highlighting a lot of those things is equally if not maybe more important i would say than the actual like engineering um things that you've mastered but probably like about the same i i also want to uh maybe use this opportunity to share uh someone's portfolio uh this is a student who said she was fine with me sharing her portfolio specifically for these types of purposes so i just want to share it really quickly and do a quick screen share there's also another student who has a website so i'll show you uh two different portfolios just so that you all have a sense of what they look like does that look small for everyone does that look too small if you double click it you can maximize it i think i'll have to zoom in too because i've already maximized it but let me do a zoom in there you go better so this is this was a bit her intro she describes just like a quick version of what she's about herself she's interested in improving the quality of life very mission driven and then gives like some projects that she's worked on and some major highlights hey ricky could i answer a quick question in the chat that alan had posted yeah it's related to this uh yeah so yeah a portfolio definitely is a could be a combination of your own personal projects too um anything anything that you've worked on that you're proud of definitely including your portfolio not just something that's like main brand from a company club or research definitely anything you've done on your own you can include even sketches are included look at that i i just want to mention you know um when you do send someone your portfolio like you know we talked about a sense of you know who you are as a person what they're gonna get if they hire you um and oftentimes um people are most interested in the things that make you different from other people you know um like for me i have a background in mountain bike racing and stuff and that often comes up and uh even though it doesn't have anything directly to do with mechanical engineering it's often the thing that people are most interested in so you definitely want to include that that outside stuff and what makes you an individual definitely agree with that all right i'll i'll stop with this one and then give you another perspective which is andy myers is this big enough he actually has a website which would link in his signature um and it would take you straight here that's also a good thing too if you're talking to faculty and you know they just get curious and click on your link really quickly they're able to see the different projects that you've worked on pizza slicer i need one of those also something i encourage you to do um i wish i had the uh prowess to be able to do this but um i've been seeing a lot more frequently uh youtube channels for people in mechanical engineering and they basically just use it as a project log um and that way you know you get extremely detailed report of your project and kind of your methodology uh when creating stuff so yeah yeah i would add to what michael said um it's not my youtube channel but my 102b product is some of it is documented on youtube like the the demo of it uh and so it's always i've used it so much just to send to random people and show them what it is that we worked on they asked if you all have linkedins it's a question from alan yes uh here yes i think i think we could i think i linked it in my profile um but i guess we could just link it in here as well um yeah definitely do not but if someone wants to contact me they can just email me directly i feel that you know person-to-person contact is uh more beneficial for me yeah i i would try to get yourself on any kind of platform to communicate with you know people in industry or even just you know colleagues linkedin is pretty good um you know it's it's it's kind of hit or miss like i do have a lot of co-workers who don't use linkedin my boss doesn't use linkedin but you know there's there's a huge network out there and you know any way you can tap into that network i say do it yeah i would say also too if you if you have it definitely maintain it you know it's something that is accessible to people so if you don't maintain it it also shows that you're not paying careful attention to details so once you put it out there just make sure you're updating it i know that for me personally that i i definitely intersected with that uh transitioning into me like you know i i was starting to have a lot more industry contact so starting to develop an industry alliance program and i just wanted to make sure that you know my linkedin was up to date so i had to go in there and just you know not completely rebrand myself or anything like that but really give myself a uh you know a refresh and a nice polish uh so from time to time you probably will have to do that and just uh stay up to date with that all right any other uh brave souls out there who want to ask uh we probably have time for you know three or four more questions anybody want to come on screen that's a good question right here that just came through the chat preferred campus spot to study or do homework this is super subjective um yeah i so there's a lot of places to study on campus uh some really popular ones are like dill library or moffett um i personally never really enjoyed those all that much uh one they can get either super loud or too they're super quiet and you actually can't collaborate with others the way that i found success at berkeley um was definitely in my study groups and people that i was working with uh i mean not to like burn my spot or anything but we used to study a lot in um in hesse hall it's uh you know really does not look like much on the outside but on the inside super nice high rise uh a roof lots of tables and comfy chairs and couches to sit on a little can get a little cramped uh if it does get packed up but i find for the most part is a good balance between you know collaboration but also like it's not insane noise levels um that's a pretty good place uh anywhere on campus that you feel comfortable you know explore around and develop study groups and you know uh go around and explore the campus see what fits for you you know we moved around all the time for the three years i was there franny what's your favorite study spot um by the end it kind of changed like every four years i think my freshman year i was in uh dough library a lot um because my classes were more just like cram the material into your brain by the end it was more like i need my friend's help so we need to be somewhere where you can like talk about it um so i would go actually a lot to hessie also hesi is always empty when everything else is full i feel like i shouldn't put that out there but it's true um jesse is good i also studied in like yali's cafe like sometimes you kind of want that like chatty atmosphere you're not like super locked in um i would also try to study outside i wish berkeley had more like tables and picnic tables and stuff but sometimes when it's not windy it's really nice to study outside i personally don't like moffitt there's like a lot of a lot of people always there um so this there it does have study rooms though which are always booked but if you can book some it can be really fun if you like invite all your friends and you have like kind of a little study party for an hour or two yeah jake jacobs hall also has uh study rooms that you could book as well they're a little more limited but i also like jacobs when there's not a class in session it's just a super nice modern building and you could definitely get lost in there when you're when you're working which is nice i'd say one thing that is more of like a more of a gorilla method is just like you know random empty classrooms on campus uh you know most folks like you know don't don't really like pop their head in there what's nice about it is if you keep it tidy and you're kind to the custodial staff like you can eat there um and without being bothered and that's something that i always appreciated about being in school is just like some place where like i don't have to like worry about like somebody tapping me on the shoulder and being like hey you can't eat here but it does require like some relationship building with the custodial staff who like may want to kick you out like at one in the morning um but you know people are kind they know that you're studying sometimes they leave you alone sometimes they'll go to another classroom and you know let you be for a little bit uh i must say i went to a presentation that was given by a neurologist and she really you know told said something that really hit home i think that this is really appropriate um to just say out loud is that you know our mind makes you know neurological connections with different places that we associate with obviously like if we're in a location that we associate with leisure it's really hard for us to engage with like the concentration that we need so you know if being outside is a place that you associate with relaxing you know taking time off from school you know hiking or whatever like really just consider that it might not be the best place for you to be studying uh same thing with dough too like dough is an incredibly beautiful library it has the greatest collection west of the mississippi along with main stacks it is such an awesome place to stare at like it's like a museum but for me it was never the best place to study because i was always just like you know kind of like pumping my chest and feeling so happy and proud that i was at berkeley rather than actually like putting my head like on the sheet you know so that's just something to think about uh another thing too is like just with studying in general uh just be conscious of taking breaks drinking lots of water um you know take care of yourself um you know physically and mentally so that you can exercise your greatest muscle which is your brain so do all those things think about those things don't just lock yourself in a room and try to like memorize as much as possible until you're tired because you think that that's what everybody else is doing uh like putting themselves through misery like we set up learning as a way that you can actually like appreciate it uh you know take the healthy breaks that you want so that you could really develop that flow where learning feels timeless right you really want to be you know put yourself in the zone and you know everyone that's on this panel i'm sure has experienced that where you know you can spend hours doing you know a project or working with classmates or doing homework where it feels really timeless because you're just absolutely in the zone and you're really enjoying it and there's times where you're doing something where like you're like staring at the clock and you can't believe like only three or four minutes have passed um but you know it does require like the the psychological preparation uh we had a question about how difficult do you think classes are than cc classes at berkeley um you know we got we got we have a good panelist to be able to answer that question so i'll hand it over to them um so yeah in my experience uh they were they were more difficult definitely uh difficult is i feel like difficult just sounds like other harder classes it's there's a lot more work required um you'll you'll do fine if you got in you know you'll you'll do great here um but there's more work required you know they there's higher expectations in my experience um and i used to be a very much like a lone wolf when i was in community college i had two jobs and i would just kind of study alone and i was able to get by and when i came to berkeley it was a huge shock because i wasn't working anymore and i was being a student full-time and i needed help like i it was it was a lot of work um so i definitely relied on a study group and developing a good network of people um to work with uh but yeah the time commitment is going to be going to be there you know you're definitely going to load up and you know um not in a bad way i i i didn't hate my time or anything you know but it was definitely you know every week it was a whole bunch of work to do it was like a full-time job you know and even then some you know uh so there's definitely a big time commitment and um but but i wouldn't say necessarily like harder it's not like the material is you know insane and you won't be able to comprehend you will you just put in the work you put in the time you study and you'll be able to understand whatever it is that's thrown at you some concepts are harder for other people um heat transfer was well heat transfer wasn't too bad but controls is that you know notoriously is a pretty difficult class fluid dynamics pretty tough class so it just depends you know some people can breeze through them some people could need a little bit of work some people you struggle a little bit more and you know you just definitely uh have to take a class by class you know work with people that um you know that you trust and and that you're comfortable with and and you'll you'll do fine you'll do good uh yeah that was a long-winded answer but yeah um i just wanted to say that you know classes here are graded differently than they were for me at community college for example when i was at community college if we had a class of 30 students and every single student got 100 on all the tests we would all get 8 pluses that's just not how it works here at berkeley you know things are graded on statistics and usually half the class is in the bottom half of the class so i think it's really important to stay in contact with your classmates even if you are a lone wolf and you want to just read and study and do everything on your own um you absolutely have to keep in contact with people to know where the pace of the class is um you know and that's another reason why people say it's competitive here uh you know it's because you are graded against your peers um how your grade ends up is is stacked up with everyone else so you can end up with a d points wise and still get a b plus or an a in the class yeah and then a lot of the times uh information for the class will be posted on either a slack channel or piazza or these other sources that aren't necessarily in lecture or um on b courses and you absolutely have to be checking those uh for updates uh for corrections and assignments um and everything like that so um yeah even if you are a kind of study by yourself person um you still have to make sure you are aware of what everyone else in the class is doing one thing that's not totally answering the question but kind of on what we're talking about um of course so kind of based on what these guys were saying i was thinking another thing that can be really helpful um especially if you're coming i can imagine if you're coming from a um community college and you don't know anyone this is also a great way to get to know people but like office hours um and i saw alex a lot at office hours and stuff um they're so good you directly get to know from the professor what he's kind of expecting you just get like a better idea you know you might come with a question because you don't understand something he's like ah don't worry about that or you just get kind of the best explanation you can also it's hugely beneficial for the professor to know who you are in my experience um i don't really know why or if it should be that way but it's just awesome to have that relationship for them to know your name for them to know that you're putting in effort like don't forget that in the end they're the ones who are who are grading the papers and you know maybe when you're in like thousand person or 600 person classes it's not as important but especially when you get to the 100 person classes it's just like huge um to know your professor and i think office hours are like a double whammy way to do that you meet other people in the class you get the direct source i get the info from the direct like most direct source the professor knows who you are they know you're engaged and you're trying like it's really important to them actually as someone who's not i don't consider myself like a super quick learner or like a like a super smart person um i've always feel like i've had to work pretty hard a lot of times peers are maybe i just feel that way but i've always been someone who has to go to office hours and like extra help um it's actually it's hugely beneficial so it's just the big thing i would recommend one thing to to continue on what freddie was saying um you know if you want to get involved in research go into office hours all these professors or majority are doing research in some lab so um for the most part all the stories that i've heard of how people how my friends got research is they just go to office hours and aside from the questions they ask for latest of the course they start asking them about their research and show they're interested and say hey you have an open position for an undergrad um so having that relationship prior is awesome you know uh networking you know socially is super super good super beneficial yeah and i just wanted to say one more thing um you know this fall and most likely in the spring you're all going to be taking online classes and you know the way that that manifests itself as you know you're taking classes over zoom and you individually all need to be responsible for participating in the class um and you know you in my opinion uh you know if you want the professor to get to know you you have to have your video on um it's extremely crucial in my opinion um and uh you know don't be afraid to schedule a one-on-one zoom meeting with the professor at the beginning of class just to introduce yourself just so they know who you are um because especially i mean in berkeley in general it's easy to get left behind but with online classes if you're just another one of those squares on the zoom meeting and you're not saying anything and you're just randomly typing things into the chat um it's going to be a fundamentally different experience than video and actually talking with the professor and on that note does anybody want to come on and ask one or two final questions definitely shown some appreciation on the chat so we appreciate uh you all just joining us um i must say like to franny's point earlier about just getting to know our our faculty and really engaging in the human interaction you know i think it's important i think that uh like deep down inside like our professors our educators they want to be able to monitor your progress and check in on whether or not they're being effective and you know they've come across so many different types of learning styles and personalities but if you give them uh you know if you prepare and you go to office hours and you show them that you're learning and that you're trying to intersect uh you know concepts that are that are coming at you in class um that show some consistency and some compatibility in your learning uh they know that it's not a perfect system especially with when it comes to grading so your effort is extremely important in terms of showcasing like what you can like the different ways that you can succeed and you you facilitate your success and uh your what you've been learning by being able to present yourself at office hours and it's an incredibly valuable skill because when you're sitting in uh you know a board meeting or a project room when you're in industry you're gonna have to say out loud like what it is that you're working on how those ideas are connecting with the other ideas that are in the room and there's no better way to practice and to engage with that than doing it with professors doing it with your classmates and building one another up so i think i'll probably leave on that note uh i'm i'm super thankful for the folks that decided to join us i mean we have people that are in high profile industry positions we have folks that are in graduate school we have mike who's an emergent senior and who's going to be there quite soon and i'm just so lucky to be able to work with these students on a day-to-day basis i just want you all to know that you know i'm an active listener i'm somebody who will give you your time who will give you time uh please reach out to me send me an email i want to get to know everybody as much as possible and my my joy my sense of fulfillment comes from watching you all grow and develop so um be persistent with me as well uh you know really set up a time to meet with me uh so that i can get to know you and you'll be on my radar you know i think that that's another part of the human interaction is that you know for example you know i think i did this with mike too mike was telling me different things that he was interested in i heard a presentation that dr makiharaju was doing uh you know i sent it over his way and you know that was kind of compatible with his interest so you know we help one another connect the dots and the more i get to know you uh the more i can connect you with our faculty so use me as your home base and i look forward to working with everyone thank you so much uh mike franny and alex i really appreciate everything hey ricky can we just say one one last thing if there's anybody who has a question that wasn't answered here or anything you know feel free to message me uh on linkedin or i can drop my email in here um don't don't be over stressed you guys are super smart with people for sure so you'll do great and uh as alumni as current students we're all here to help you guys out so uh don't ever hesitate to reach out to the staff or to your to your colleagues i'll put my email here yeah um and this huge place and sometimes it's hard to contact people but every single time i've needed help with something and i can't get anyone ricky's always been there so go to ricky he will respond to you he will help you out and if you can't contact me just ask ricky he'll give you my contact information and all that stuff thanks thank you all i appreciate all all your support all the love and uh let's all get through this i look forward to having a great uh year with you all thanks ricky thanks ricky take care everyone bye guys
