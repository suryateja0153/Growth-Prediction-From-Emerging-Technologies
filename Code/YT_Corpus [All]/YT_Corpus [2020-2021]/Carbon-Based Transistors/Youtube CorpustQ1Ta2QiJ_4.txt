 it is apart from my master work master this is  work it is called the microbiological studies   on some carbon vitamins producing  gram negative bacteria pathogens content it will be introduction and objectives   material and methods and result  results and in the final conclusion speech is antibiotic consists of several  groups now premiere simple spoons carbohydrates all of these compounds or all of these classes  share their damn ring but differ in sulfur   group ceiling and receptors foreign contain  sulfur groups whereas carbo venom don't contain   sulfur group instead they contain carbon group can  production of this group of antibiotics they cause   silver lysis or break down the physiological  layer in the cell wall causing this observer why we choose carbon monoxide   productivity and disagree with the dance again  unpositive and the ground negative factory   the 10th last or antibiotic for love  resource members include vietnam now we know the classes of antibiotic but we need  have the emergence of carbohydrate resistance   in ground negative factory here there are  several mechanisms of resistance for example   enzymatic inactivation carbon  immediately by clear happiness or decreased outer membrane permeability   they don't allow these carbapenems to enter  into the bacterial cell then the final flux   of the antibiotic when antibiotics enter the  cell wall they go away again bit there is our   certain types of enzymes produced by bacteria  cause breakdown of the vital of turmeric they are there are several types of vital  optimises like penicillinases they inactive   fetal penicillin so ciceline was developed to  combat this type of enzymes see cephalosporinases   cause an activation of cyclosporine and  aminogenicity and extended spectrum petroctemesis   causing activation of all italic time accepted  kerbaben they inhibited by claviolonic acid   and in the last vietnam or carbohydrates  they are certain types immune virule venom   resistant carbon venoms all of these  carbaminomas have the ability to hydrolyze   all beta-electrons even carbamine so they called  carb enemies a different type of carbohydrates and certain type of bacteria it's a question now why carbohydrates is  producing bacteria is a public health emergency   first of all significant significantly limits  the treatment options for life-sending infection   the resistant mechanism is now on a transable  zone and resistance is highly transmissible   rabbit detection and effective infection control  measures are essential to control the street   cause infections associated with high mortality  rates in most areas this organism appears to be   infrequently identified so our aim and  objectives were was isolation of gram   negative victory from different clinical samples  and the screening of carbon enemies is resistant   among them after that we make identification  we made identification of the recovery in   vienna resistant israelite and twisting deserves  susceptibility to different antimicrobial agents   and the detection of carbohydrates production  among immune resistance and in the final   we make microbiological and biochemical  characterization of the detected carbohydrates how work would stop first of all we make a meat  isolation of gram negative bacteria from different   clinical samples from urine from blood  samples from sputum and other assembles   after that we make identification and the culture  on macon corporate where it is selective media for   gram negative victory and after that we made  preliminary screening of immune resistance   using agar dilution method containing the breakpoint of  carbapenem four microgram dermal and identification of the  recovered immune resistant isolate   by standard biochemical testes and  make confirmation of the identity   by multi-tough mass doctor school in matters of  mass spectroscopy we make culture of bacteria   and both in the buddhism and the  instrument and a leader of pim was   run detecting the bacteria and the chemical  structure was identified by mass spectrophotometer and after that would make susceptibility this  is using about 18 uh antibiotic discs by disk   diffusion method and after that we made the  termination of mic values of immune using agar   dilution method mic mean minimum inhibitory  concentration it is the lowest concentration   which inhibits bacteria so if we can  compare between different antibiotics we use   in ic the lower the mic the best antibiotic  or the potent antibiotic and after that   we make we made detection of carbonyl's  production among immuno-resistant isolate   by modified hodge test all of the tests will be  explained later in the result okay a modified hog   test and this vector photometric detection  of carbon enemies for further information and our result is weird about else about about one thousand uh about one  thousand samples were isolated from sputum from   stool from broad frontier and we captured them on mcconkey  agar where about 500 and 80 80   of gram-negative bacteria were isolated among  them there was it was found that about 104   of these isolates were immune  resistance including california monroy and after we made susceptibility it was a result   where all most of the isolates showed resistant  to cephalosporins and ambisellin antibiotic   whereas least resistant where again is  digicycline antibiotic and chloramphinico this image you show with the  results of the substance like this   where red color indicate resistant strain green  color indicate sensitive strain and yellow color   indicate intermediate stirring as shown in this  figure this antibiogram typing official colloid i this cluster typing show with a relationship  between the resistant stirring and their source   of isolation and this is antibiogram of proteus  variables all of these bacteria are resistant to   bacteria gram negative and highly highly resistant  bacterial they called multi-resistant bacteria and finally the antibiogram  of pseudomonas philosophers determination of the minimum minimum  inhibitor concentration or in my   ic of immediate among the suggested  medium-resistant isolate showed that only about nine isolates where uh where uh where  lower should lower resistance uh to uh immediately   with concentration two and four  and eight micrograms per milligram   but the rest of isolate were highly resistance   even reached two two hundred fifty  micrograms per milli of moving concentration it is a really mineral screening test for  carbohydrates section it is called the modified   hodge test the idea of this test was uh or the  test was performed by the following method we make   culture of uh which was which was a wild type of  shirisha kolai it was sensitive to individual and   as shown in the middle we put a disc of immune  antibiotic and after that the tested isolates where we want to see their sensitivity  and the resistance were restricted from   the disc to the edge of the plate as we shown  in this figure as soon as this figure there are   about four i tested isolates the uh positive  carbon images strains show it a hatch hatch or   the circle uh or the inhibition zone is is turn it  out or hatch it as shown in this figure the strain   now included uh 580 and 104 they are sensitive  or they are carbon vinemeses producer whereas the   other two strains are not carbohydrates  producer using this test we detected about about resistance the percentage was about 50 percent and those conformation of this test we made   what is so-called spectrophotometric  analysis for the carbonyl activity   we make in curation we make extraction of  this enzyme and incubate it with bacteria   and uh we include it with the immediate  antibiotic and show the effect the steroids that   not produce carbohydrates there is no decrease  in the spectrophotometer spectrophotometric mass   of the imipenem there is no decrease because the  imipenem not was not breaked by the bacteria or by   the enzyme whereas as whereas positive isolates  that produce carbohydrates uh break down the   carbohydrate uh antibiotic and show decrease in  the activity by this test we found that about uh   out of the fifth uh 52 isolates their way  there were about 35 were positive for carbon   venomous activity by uv spectrophotometry  and the results was was spot in this table as shown at time zero the absorbance of  the impenetrables high and after about 60   600 seconds it was lowered finally we made what  is so called a editor double disc division test   this test is was specific for certain  type of carbapene images called   metallo beta-lactamases metallo because  they contain contain in their structure zinc   component we in the middle we bought a disk  of erita and the tested isolate were cultured   and we bought immune disks where positive isolates  that produce metallometer lactamises show it at in   the right image they will hatch towards the editor  because it make complexation with zinc enzyme   zinc metal that present in the metallo   whereas negative negative isolates as shown  in the lift there is there were no hatches what was our conclusion our conclusions was  the incidence of carbopenum resistance among   gram-negative bacteria is which is alarming  problem among hospital sitting especially because   of their high rate of resistance to  syphilis warren and the old penicillins   and quinolo the use of the cyclone should be the  last result for treatment of infections caused by   highly resistant gram negative bacteria also  this study displayed a good sensitivity of   immuno-resistant isolate to chloramphenicol  this should shift our focus to re-examine our   and examine re-examine all the antibiotics  that had largely been banished because of   their toxic side effects or developing newer  derivatives to abolish their side effects also our result is confirming that  the previous studies that modified   select high sensitivity and specificity  specificity compared to spectrophotometric   method for detection of carbohydrates and it  is necessary to depend on spectrophotometric   detection of carbohydrates and our  final conclusion is thinking about   nanoparticles to abolish the resistance  of this isolates it toward this carbon and thank you for your attention especially   so mostly respectful professor and dear colleague  i'm i mean i'm a rat phd student in genetics   i will go for oncogenes in breast cancer  and possible treatment options with my   colleague surgeon dr michael first of all  our agenda is as you see i will take about   i will talk about the first five points and  my colleague will continue the remaining part so at first we talk about introduction so breast  cancer is a heterogeneous diseases which required   update on scientific research to offer patients  the best possible and personalized treatment   modern surgical treatment of breast cancer is  recently been reviewed and it's clearly a field   of continuous change and improvement the change  in treatment strategy is a challenge given that   prognosis is already acceptable the collaboration  between specialties accross different countries   and different knowledge background is needed to  exchange experience and improve international   guidelines that's why surgeon and genetic  specialist work together for this article after that we'll talk about epidemiology so  breast cancer is the first cancer to affect   women in most countries of the world  followed by lung cancer and colorectal cancer the statistics showed that the incidence of breast  cancer is higher in developed countries like usa   europe and australia than the less developed  countries like african and asian countries   however the mortality rate is much higher in  underdeveloped countries due to the lake of   diagnosis and treatment means  breast cancer can be divided into   two type two type sporadic breast cancer which  is the most common breast cancer resulting from   accumulation of a cured and uncorrected mutation  in somatic cell genes and heritary breast cancer   which results from the loss of heterozygosity  at the level of tumor suppressor genes such as   brca1 and 2 in classic hereditary breast  cancer or p53 in lithomine syndrome   the alteration of genes is due to the action  of risk factors that are subdivided into two   categories non-genetics factors such as aging  late menopause and pregnancy hormone therapy   as well as the modern lifestyle including smoking  alcohol usage and fast food the genetics factors   are due to the mendelian transmission of cancer  predisposition genes such as brca1 and 2 and p53 breast cancer is caused by the alteration of  different type of genes the the the ma the   main genes are the proto-oncogenes which after  transformation become oncogenes and confirm   the concerns phenotype these oncogenes encode for  the growth factor egf growth factor receptor like   er pb2 or transcription factors such  as mic gene tumor suppressor genes   like uh brca1 and 2 which are the most implicated  in hereditary breast cancer p53 which is always   mutated in all cancer and can be associated  to hereditary breast cancer in the the case of   liver mini syndrome we found also that  uh air b protein is involved in uh   registered breast cancer because it's a regulated  brca1 and 2. uh the steroid receptors such as   air alpha are also involved in addition several  other genes are involved in breast cancer   as apoptosis genes invasion and cell addiction  genes and ongoing genesis genes but with a lower   penetrance now i let dr mikhail continue  the rest thanks a million doctor armenian   because we are all are working in the behalf of  the human being and the behalf of our patient so   we must go secondly to know what are the clinical  features of breast cancer we must remind that   the breast cancer develop clinical symptoms rather  late at advanced tumor stages so typical science   may include changes in breast size and or shape  symmetry or asymmetry palpable mass typical or   atypical skin changes whatever they are redness  edema and bitting of the hair follicles nipple   changes uh inversion of naval chains or blood uh  changes discharge auxiliary lymphadenopathy and   also in advanced stages ulceration here you  can see how we can manage in the patient the   palpable mass how it looks like also enlarged  auxiliary lymph nodes and skin retraction   either nipple retraction or nipple discharge the  eugerange inflammation or carcinoma in kurwase   all the times we are looking for diagnostic  uh scheme or algorithm in order to manage   our patients without um for getting the triple  assessment for this patient but we must take in   account the age of the patient as my colleague  mentioned before so if the patient age world   lower than 30 years old we must go for clinical  assessment probability of the malignancy if low so   we examine within three to two days and after that  reassure and follow up and if it's high suspicious   mass so we must go for ultrasound and fine needle  aspiration what we must see there if we will see   cystic lesion so just with clear fluid to assure  and follow up and if we will found residual mass   with blood fluid take core needed biopsy and if we  will take this cornea biopsy it might be benign or   malignant and i'll talk after that about it and if  it will be solid lesion suspicious mass so we must   go for corneal peroxide and like lipil mass we  must treat as needed and observe if there's gross   so we must go for coordinated biopsy and sometimes  if difficult to reach the lesion we must excise it   and if the patient is higher than 30 years old  we must firstly do scanning with mammography   and all the world now are going for the scanning  program with uh magmography to all the woman uh   above 30 years old if they're suspicious of mass  we must go for cornidae biopsy and if difficult   to reach excise it if it's benign follow up  if it's malignant just amazing uh with mri   and do lab diagnostic with receptors testing  tumor markers and also staging with lymph node   biopsy possible treatment options not just  surgery possible treatment options can pay   also radio and chemotherapy and also other  targeted therapy we mustn't forget the rule of   multidisciplinary team so the surgeon the  oncologist the pathologist and all other   colleagues which are going with us to choose  the needed choice for every special patient   in early stages of the disease we can say breast  conserving therapy so lumpectomy followed by   radiation therapy if in intraoperative lymph node  uh is saying so we must do evaluation by central   infinite biopsy and also auxiliary dissection  also the age of systemic therapy hormones and   targeted biologic therapy in all of this here  you can see the press conservative therapy   and also locally advanced disease we can go  for uh some choices of non-adjuvant systemic   therapy unfold agile therapy and um if advanced  metastatic disease systemic treatment followed   by variative surgery if gestational breast cancer  remembers that it's not the type of surgery stop   it but you can go for anything after the  second or third trimester if not invasive   carcinoma you can see it in this slide uh either  doctor carcinoma in situ or lipolyer carcinoma   you will go for press conservative therapy or  lifelong surveillance and chemo radiation i will   very happy to be with you with my colleague thanks  a million if there are any questions remaining   to genetics or remaining into surgery we will be  very happy to answer it if not right now we will university good afternoon my dear  professors my dear colleagues   my topic for today is about modern biomedical  applications of graphene and this topic will be   will include the following points  first of all into production uh   and is the second point will be drug gene delivery  and cancer therapy uh biosensing and bio imaging   depending on graphene graphene-based  antibacterial materials graphene-based is scaffold   for cell culture next point recent products on  the market and the conclusion in the last step graphene is a normal two-dimensional  nano-material it possesses several   exceptional physical and chemical properties  that lead to many potential applications   these properties include electronic  optical thermal and mechanical properties   graphene was produced by two scientists  andre game and constantine novoselo   in 2004 who were awarded for this discovery a  nobel prize in physics using graphene graphite   that is a special highly ordered pyrolytic  style graphite with flake sizes ranging uh   over a centimeter it's arranged in a hexagonal  lattice the resulting graphene has earned   the title of a wonder material being both  the thinnest and the strongest material moon with a rabbit development of synthesis  and the functionalization approaches   graphene and its related derivatives have shown  have shown outstanding potentials in many fields   such as nano electronics uh energy  technology uh sensors uh and catalyst uh   the structure of graphene gives it outstanding  electrical and the thermal conductivity properties   making it ideal for use in electronics  solar cells batteries and the high speed   transistors equally it has great potential  as a component in composite materials and   the protective coatings used in many industrial  applications including aircraft buildings and   even spacecraft the intensive research on the  bioapplications of graphene and its derivatives   is due to many fascinating properties such as a  high specific surface area exceptional electronic   conductivity thermal conductivity mechanical  strength of graphene and intrinsic bio   compatibility low cost scalable production and  facile biological chemical functionalization there are many trials that had been already proved  uh the valid of using graphene oxide which is one   of graphene derivatives as a drug delivery system  in a study water soluble chitosan derivative   was used as reducing and stabilizing agents to  perform the green reduction of graphene oxide   which then were blended with alginate hydrogel  beads and this formula showed a great drug loading   efficacy for a small molecule fluorescein  sodium a sustainable drug release of 71.6   in 100 sorry 150 hours at physiological ph  a while quick release in an acidic medium progressive steps in genomics and the gene  therapy introduced novel solutions in too many   incurable however that difficulty in designing  effective and the safe delivery system   or vectors for the appropriate genetic  cargo keeps these advanced in applicable   so graphene oxide and the other nanoparticles  family showed a good absorption ability towards   double-stranded dna which make them excellent  vectors for genetic carbon one of graphene family   members is graphene nanowish that was used for the  purpose of gene delivery graphene nanomesh has a   great adsorption affinity because of its enlarged  surface area and therefore more active sites   uh the structural features uh and simple chemical  preparing and alternation of graphene oxide give   a captivating opportunities for loading  and delivery of an assortment of molecules   from chemical drugs genes and photosensitizers  and beyond for cancer and other disease treatments   and in one study a doctor you will see in  loaded vigilated nanography oxide was developed   for the anti-tumor effect in vitro and in vivo by  blending of photo thermal and the kinema service   the experiment resulted in the  combined chemophotothermal therapy   exhibited synergetic effect that  leads to better anti-cancer effect   than chemotherapy or photothermal therapy  alone resulting in higher therabiotic efficacy   another bioapplication of graphene is because of  the fabulous electrochemical behavior of it it's   a promising electrode material in electro analysis  many electrochemical sensors based on graphene and   its composites for bioanalysis and environmental  investigation have been developed graphene-based   enzyme biosensors graphene-based  electrochemical dna by sensors and the   graphene-based electrochemical sensors for heavy  metal ions are examples of biosensing applications and the size of graphene sheet or graphene oxide  sheets in particular was reported to have an   important influence on the antibacterial activity  of graphene oxide an effect that was relay on   the type of stay used for toxicity measurement  graphene oxide based surface coatings revealed a   higher antimicrobial activity for smaller graphene  oxide sheet size for cell suspensions a graphene   oxide sheet area affected bacterial development  by a cell entrapment mechanism under these   circumstances the antimicrobial activity of  graphene oxide increased with increasing sheath   area in any case the cell entrapment was found  to be reversible uh showing that the clear impact   of graphene oxide doesn't include bacterial  inactivation and maybe it can be described as a bacteriostatic graphene based scaffolds are utilizing for  tissue engineering of heart bone cartilage   nerve skin and liver due to their beneficial  properties especially their anti-bacterial action as we mentioned before uh  graphene membranes and may be   promising candidates for their application  in visual regenerative medication here in this slide we can see that several  companies have launched graphene enhanced textiles   inks and coatings incorporated into personal  protective gear such like face masks gloves etc   and applications like air  filters and the room cleansers   have been developed and graphene mask is one of  the available graphene products on the market   it's composed of three layers two layers  of cotton uh sandwiching a prepared   pro battery graphene textile blend which  is the middle layer and that may increase   protection against the copper 19 even this virus  and other dangerous airborne viruses um biomedical   applications of graphene and its derivatives  especially graphene oxide are numerous and very   promising solutions for many incurable elements  in the future there will be more attention to   these nanoscale materials in order to get novel  compositions having higher bio availability with   lesser toxicity and more selectivity yet there are  challenges uh such like thorough and the profound   understanding of graphene cell interactions  especially the cellular uptake mechanism   and this challenge and many others are the matter  of researchers uh to find out solutions for   smarter nano materials uh thank you for attentions  and any questions please i'm carefully listening   good afternoon dear professors dear colleagues  permit me to introduce you to our today's talk   about using antibiotics on various surgeries  with my dear colleague dr mikhail shahada we'll be following this agenda i will  be doing the first half presentation and   dr mikhail will do the remaining a major health problem in hospitals nowhere  is the increasing of antibiotic resistance in   patients in general surgical field the main or the   major factors are prescription of  antibiotics for viral infections   the frequent use of broad spectrum antibiotics and  is irrespective of duration and the cause of usage the selection of antibiotics for usage in  preoperative period depends on multiple factors   which are the type of infection the patient  allergies the type of applied surgery the most commonly used antibiotic in surgery  is the first generation cephalosporins and   gantamisin in the case of an aerobic infection  commonly used metro vitronidazole or tinidazole   and the case of staphylococcal substability  commonly used antibiotic is the flu coxaline or vancomycin we found a very interesting  clinical trial of thermozugulu and all which   issue our principles the study was based  on 867 patients with various surgical   and fixtures and the results were as follow the  study applied that the pro-spectrum antibiotics   are the most commonly used in surgical practice  and now is the turn of my colleague dr mikhail   thanks dr ibrahim it's my pleasure to be with you  the second time today in this great conference so   i talked just about the types of surgery according  to microorganisms we are classifying the types of   surgery according to microorganisms clean surgery  clean contaminated and contaminated surgery   if we will go for health can incise for clean  surgery we will not recommend antibiotics   either not the clinicians or the guidelines if  processes we can recommend antibiotics if clean   contaminated either respiratory elementary you  need to urinary tract infections we can recommend   antibiotic contaminated surgery as microscopic  soiling of operative field also as example   imperitonites strongly recommended antibiotics in  all types of surgery just to measure now um the   microorganisms and some selective antibiotics for  each type of plastic surgery for example we can   found uh in swaps saphillococcus aureus or cogels  negative staphylococci so we can use cephazoline   silveroxime sodium and cell uh gastrointestinal  surgery and also in gynecological surgery   we can found uh entire gram negative bacteria  anaerobes enter kukai also group b streptococci um   and other anaerobes we can also use uh civoxetine  uh silvatoxin civazoline ambiselin and sul bacter   orthopedic surgery mainly we can find  uh staphylococcus aureus and congolese   stabilicokai so we can use zivazoline and  sulfuroxime sodium and vancomycin also in   vascular surgery we can find staphylococcus aureus  calculus negative staphylococci and enteric gram   negative muscle lies so we can use silvazoline  and vancomycin so civazoline is remaining one   from the most important antibiotics in surgeries  impacts of antibiotic misusage we have two major   factors it's the high treatment cost  sometimes and the increasing of mortality rate   so i was uh very happy to be you with you  and in conclusion the optimization and   respect of guidelines internationally and the  usage of antibiotic needed to be by priority   on every health care center every specialized  hospital the classification as we mentioned   clean surgery clean contaminated and contaminated  uh respectfully provided uh the improvement of   usage of antibiotics and the development of many  initiative the replacement of an antibiotics   by another ones can lead to favorable results  thanks a million and those are our references   if you have any question you can ask us now or you  can just send to us via mail thanks a million dear   professor it's my pleasure to be with you today  uh with the third step so the third talk to me   today will be just in the topic of my research it  will be about antibiotics in inguinal hernioplasty   so uh my name is mikhail hathawaki i'm assistant  lecturer of operative surgeon clinical anatomy   and bhd student also on general laparoscopic  surgeon there will be introduction some   necessary question about this topic and after  that we'll go for conclusion you may hear those   words one day they will schedule the operation  as soon as operating room is available so what   is surgical operation for those who don't uh what  is charge collaboration it's a medical procedure   involving incision with instrument performance to  repair damage or arrest damage in the living body   and what are the types of surgical operations  there are a lot of classifications for the   types of surgical operation now i'll go for the  type according to the urgency of the operation   we will go for urgent operation which be a must  or life threatening operation emergent operation   which must be within six to 12 hours and elective  or scheduled operation when we give the patient   time to come with his investigations for us in  the inpatient clinic for any operation we must   consider pre-operative management operative  management and post-operative management   pre-operative management for sure is before the  operation including all the investigations we   will order from the patient and also the clinical  assessment of the patient operative management   will be just the set in the operation theater  and also the anesthesiologist uh recommendation   and the anesthesia set and post  operative management including   follow-up for the patient specifically uh we  will talk about those points in quick what is   inguinal hernioplasty herniotomy herniate what  are the options of operation all over the world   what are the complications of this operation  and when we must use antibiotics pre-operatively   during the operation or post-operatively is  there any difference in using antibiotics   during this operation according to the urgency  of the operation also is there any difference   between using antibiotics according to the  international guidelines the clinical process okay please colleague who mute yourself also  what about the randomized clinton trials   done in answering about this question so first of  all inguinal rhinoplasty we must know that about   20 million patients and more all over the world  every year are going for inguinal hernia repair   the many different approaches and treatment  indications also with a significant array of   techniques for inguinal hernia repair warrant to  standardize care minimize complication and improve   the results so what is the difference between  here your fee her new tummy and her neoplasty   herniate is the classic one the oldest type  of the operation of hernia repair it involves   a surgeon making a long incision directly over the  hernia then using surgical tools to open the cut   enough to access it an hernia to me an operation  for the relief of a reduceable hernia by cutting   through the neck of the sac while hernioplasty  with the usage of mesh repair and hernia plasti   instead of stitching the muscle opening  shot we cover it with a flat sterile mesh   usually made of flexible plastics  such as polyproline or animal testing this operation had a lot of options all over  the world um classical option it's open repair   traditional one laparoscopic repair modern  technique and in some countries robotic hernia   repair there is no single standard for inguinal  hernioplasty and the choice of this method   is based on the experience of the surgeon  technical capabilities and the desires of   salvation sometimes the most commonly used  methods for autoplasty partial dies repair   and among aloe journey plaster  liechtenstein repair its traditional and the   golden standard all over the world in open hernia  repair also laparoscopic methods the most commonly   tab and tip so transabdominal peritoneal hernia  plasti and total extroverted real hernia plastic   and this is what we have this long uh  introduction what are the complication of   inguinal hernia repair complications after wider  hernia repair are relatively common the incidence   is higher after emergency repair and recurrent  hernia repairs compared with elective surgery   with the transition to tension-free  repair hernia recurrence is less frequent   while other complications such as posterior  neuropha neuralgia have become more prominent   nowadays complication that occur in the  perioperative period include one's aroma   hematoma urinary tension bladder injury  and surgical incisional site infection   why complications that occur later on  so post operatively following hernia   repair include resistant growing pain and post  herniography neuralgia testicular complication   deep incisional and mesh infection  recurrent hernia also and mis-migration   with erosion so the possibility of infection  preoperatively and post-operatively still   very high urgent and emergency procedures  are associated with higher complication rates   compared with elective repairs as a surgical  site infection and mesh infection are from   the complication of hernia repair so we need to  use antibiotics but when we must use antibiotics   shall we use them preoperatively shall we use  them during the operation or post operatively   and if we would like to use them shall we use just  a single dose and when and or treatment course   when we must use antibiotics there are a lot of  clinical trials all over the world which assure   the prophylactic antibiotics in open mesh repair  like the in laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair when we will talk about the prophylactic  antibiotics in open mesh repair of inguinal hernia   we will see that all over the world they are  not using in clean surgery any antibiotic but   the recommendation and guidelines go through  that we must use in mesh repair according to   note num mesh repair or tension free repair even  though the reported incidence of warned eviction   fires to various to uh nine percent and sometimes  till 15 as more and more surgeries are done   as day case surgeries many of these  infections are often recognized first   in the outpatient setup or outpatient clinic  after discharging the patient from the hospital   the most common organism isolated was  staphylococcus aureus which forms a part   of normal skin flora it is a well-known fact that  increased pre-operative hospital stay increased   the risk of colonization with resistant bacteria  civazoline in a lot of literature is antibiotic of   choice and also in a lot of hospitals all over the  world how we can use them one gram of civazoline   must be given intravenously at the time of  induction of anesthesia so in the operative period also uh prophylaxis uh prescribing patterns  and laparoscopic and wider hernia repair   um give us the ability that where evidence  suggests antibiotic prophylaxis not necessary may   and many surgeons still use them routinely single  dose of antibiotics during the operation induction   the use of antibiotic reflexes during hernia  repairs with mesh may be more important than   in non-mesh repairs because of the consequences of  graft infection surveys conducted among surgeons   have reported that about half of them use  antimicrobial reflexes for hernia repair whatever   the operation is clean or clean contaminated or  contaminated so is there any difference in using   antibiotics during this operation according to  the urgency of the operation for sure yes if   prophylaxis antibiotics has not agreed role in  some literature in low risk rate patient but it   has agreed role in emergency complicated inquiry  repair so in case of amions hernia for example   the hernia in which appendix or inflamed  appendix a part of it is in essentially   used pre-operatively during operation and  postoperatively also as course of treatment   reducible hernia as a cause of unsignal  obstruction needs also to have follow up and   give the patient a course of treatment which  will include also antibiotics complicated hernias   which need urgent repair without mesh also are  in need so is there any difference between using   antibiotics according to international  guidelines and the clinical practice   the association of surgeons of grip retain  also the european hearing society guidelines   with the national and isochronic infection  surveillance assuring a lot of things from them   the system index which identifies the following  risk factors for surgical site infection   surgical site with a wand classification  of either contaminated or dirty infected   must take antibiotic also an operation lasting  more than two hours or more than 75 percent   of the time allocated for the operation must go  for antibiotics the patients um american society   for anesthesiologists score of more than three  must also go for antibiotics a long duration of   the operation and drainage are listed as procedure  related factors and also comorbidities such as   diabetes medicines rheumatoid arthritis obesity  are also included among the risk factors surgeons   still using prophylaxis antibiotics as a single  dose during the induction for elective surgery   also they still use treatment course of antibiotic  for seven days during the emergency complicated   earnings and also when will will we go uh for  reviews of studies uh according to literature we   will find a lot of them i choose just one from  the study um respective and randomized trial   preferably double blind one uh which are  of the greatest value and 12 such studies   have been conducted over the past 15 years three  of them demonstrated the efficacy of prophylaxis   in the prevention of surgical site infection while  nine of them recommended against its routine use   this is a trial study in which you will see the  sample size and the antibiotic we are using or   those people who used in spain turkey netherlands  also philippine greek india and egypt japan and   the percentage of infection uh which were related  uh postoperatively this is the explanation for   what i just said in conclusion using antibiotics  and the practice of inguinal hernia repair still   essential to predict the surgical site infection  the single dose of antibiotics as induction is   preferable in practice despite some literature  studies using antibiotics in complicated inguinal   hernia or in those patients with high risk for  mesh infection and surgical site infection as a   treatment course of seven days reduces the post  operative complication thanks a million don't   hesitate to ask me any further question if you  would like to ask by mail i will be very ready
