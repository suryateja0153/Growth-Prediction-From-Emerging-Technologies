 from the cube Studios in Palo Alto in Boston connecting with thought leaders all around the world this is a cute conversation I welcome back I'm stoom in a man and this is a cube conversation digging in with an Sandow I'm talking about what they're doing to help people really put bringing some of the networking ideals at a cloud native environments both you know in the clouds in the data centers I bet it welcome to the program Krishna dota penny he is the vice president of software within Sandow thanks so much for joining and gusto dokdo all right so Krishna the pensando team you know very well known in the industry you know innovation startup especially in the networking world gives a little bit about your background specifically how long you've been part of this team and you know what helped you know you and the team you know start and Sandow so I'm VP of software in pensando before pensando before forming pensando i world in few startups in say my networks Nemo systems and Greenfield networks all those three startups have been at word by Cisco my recent role before this this this company was I was VP of engineering in Cisco I was responsible for a product called ACI which is Cisco's flagship Sdn rotting so I mean when why did we find found pensando so when we were looking at the industry the last few years like the few trends that are becoming clear so obviously we have a lot of enterprise background we were watching you know is he a big deployed in the enterprise data centers one sore point for customers from operational point of view was installing service devices network appliances or storage appliances so not only the operational complexity that this device is bring in it's also they don't give you the performance and bandwidth and PPS that you expect but traffic especially from east-west so that was one that was one major issue and also if you look at where the intelligence is going has been that this been the trend it's been going to the edge the reason for that is the routers or switches or in the devices in the middle they cannot handle the scale as I mean the bandwidths are growing the scale is growing the stateful stuff is going in the network and the switches and the appliances are not able to handle it so you need something at the edge close to the application that can handle this kind of services and bandwidth and the third thing is obviously you know x86 you know a few years back you know every two years you know you're getting more transistors I mean obviously the most line ended and we know we know how that that part is going so the excitation cycles are more valuable and we don't want to use them for all this network services including Sdn or you know firewalls or load balancers or nvme virtualization so it's looking at all these trends in the industry you know we thought there is a good good opportunity to do a domain-specific processor for i/o and build products around it and that's how we started pensando yeah so so Krishna it's always fascinating to watch if you look at startups they are often product of the time that they're in and the technologies that are available you know sometimes they're ideas that you know it takes a few times and you know maturation the technology and other times you know I'll hear tea and they're like oh well we did this and then oh wow there was this next new innovation that came out that I wish I had that when I did this last time so we do a duo or IDO generation we've been talking about you know distributed architectures for you know well over a decade it's been a long time now in many ways I feel edge computing is best you know the latest discussion of this but when it comes to you know you've got software under under your purview what are some of the things that are available for pensando that might not have been you know in your toolkit you know five years ago yes so the growth of open-source software has been very helpful for us because you know we build a scale out microservices list controller in the last time around when we were building that you know we had to build our own consensus algorithm we have to build our own tissue a database for metrics and human cell logs so right now we I mean we have because of opens was thinking we leverage you know at CD elastic influx in all this open source technologies that you hear since we want to leverage the Kuban it is this ecosystem now that helped us a lot at the same time if you think about it right the the even the software which is not open source closed source thing are maturing I mean if you talk about Sdn you know seven eight years back it was like you know there n versions of doing of Sdn but now the industry standard is an e VPN which is one of the core pieces of what we do we do Sdn solution with evpn so you know it's more of you know the industry is coming to a place where you know these are the standards and this is open source software that you could leverage and quickly innovate compared to building all of this from scratch which will be a big effort for start-up to succeed and build it in time for your customer success you know and Krishna you know you talk about open force not only in the software it's and the hardware standpoint I think about things like open compute or the proliferation of you know GPUs and CPUs and everything along that how is that impacted you know what what you've built so I mean it's a good thing you don't for example you look we are looking in the future and OCP card right you know it's a good thing that OCB card goes into HP server at Dell server so pretty much you know we we want to I mean see our goal is to enable this platform that what we build in you know all the use cases that customer could think of right so in that way hardware standardization is a good thing for the industry and then same thing if you go in how we program the ASIC right you know we are about standards of this p4 programming this is an industry consortium you know led by a few people we want to make sure that you know we follow the standards for the customer was coming in who wants to program it it's it's good to have standards-based thing rather than doing something completely proprietary at the same time your enable innovations and then those innovations here to push it back to the open source that's what we are trying to do with p4 yeah excellent I've had some some real good conversations about before and in the way and pensando is is leveraging that maybe a little bit differently and that you know you talk about standards and open source oftentimes it's like well is there differentiate there there's certain parts of the ecosystem that you say well it kind of been commodified you you know obviously you're taking a lot of different technologies putting them together help help share the uniqueness of pensando what differentiates what you're doing from what was available in the marketplace or that I couldn't just you know cobble together you know a bunch of open-source hardware and software together I mean if you look at technologies like the I think the networking that both of us are very familiar with it if you want to build an SDN solution or you can take OVS or you can use x86 and you know or take some much in silicon and cobble it together but the problem is you will not get the performance and bandwidth that you're looking so let's say you know if you want a high PPS solution or you want a high cps solution because the number of connections are growing for your iot use case or 5g use case right if you cobble together with an open source thing without any assist from a domain-specific processor your performance will be low so that is the I mean that's once of enterprise that in the cloud use case light as you know you're trying to pack as many BMS as containers in one server because you know you get charged I mean the customer the our customers make money based on that right so you want to offload all of those things into a domain-specific processor that what we paid which we call the TAC which will which will you know do all these services at pretty much no cost to exceed six I mean x86 you will be using zero cycles for were doing you know features like security groups or VP C's or VPN or encryption or storage virtualization right that's where our value comes in I mean if you count the TCO model using bunch of x86 cores or in a bunch of an ARM cores or AMD course compared to what we do our TCO model works out great for our customers I mean that's why you know there's so much interest in excellent I'm Brad your God you brought up customers uh you know Krishna one of the challenges I definitely have seen over the years with networking is it tends to be you know a completely separate language that we speak there it's you know a lot of acronyms and protocols and you know not necessarily accessible to people outside of the silo of networking night I think back to you know Sdn you know people on the outside we would be like that stands for still does nothing right but is it's like networking you know mumbo jumbo there for people outside of networking you know when I think about you know if I was going for the c-suite of an enterprise customer um they don't necessarily care about those networking protocols they care about the you know the business results in the productivity so how do you help explain what pensando does to those that aren't you know steeped in the network the way I look at it right what is customer looking but yeah you're right that's what does it new what in kappa yus customer is looking for is operational simplicity and then he wants looking for security I didn't know and if you look at it sometimes you know both are like in orthogonal if you make it very highly secure but you make it like ten and thousand operational procedure before you deploy a workload that doesn't work for the customer because in operational complexity increases tremendously right so where we are coming in is that we want to simplify this for the customer you know there's a very simple way to deploy policies there is a simple way to deploy your networking infrastructure and in the way we do it is we don't care what your physical network is in some sense right so because we are close to the server that's a very good advantage we have we applied the policies before even the packet leaves the sir right so in that way he knows his fully secure environment and we and you don't want to manage each one individually we have this rod called PSM which manages you know all this servers from a central place and it's easy to operationalize the fabric whether you talk about upgrades or you talk about you know deploying new services it's all driven with REST API and you have a GUI so you can do it a single place and that's where you know a customer's value is rather than talking about as you're talking about end caps or you know exactly the raw throughput that is not the main thing that I mean they wake up every day they wake up every day thinking about it we have a security risk and in how easy for me is to deploy new in your new services or bring up new data sets all right Krishna you're also spanning with your product a few different worlds out there you know traditionally if I about you know an enterprise data center versus a hyper scale public cloud and edge sites my site comes to mind very different skill sets for management you know different types of deployments there um if you know I understand right you were going to you know play in all of those environments so talk a little bit about how you do that and you know just you know where you sit in that overall discussion yes so I mean remember of a newly inserted companies we we had given back customers know obviously customer success success so but given said that right what we try to do is that we try to build a platform that is kind of you know programmable obviously starting from you know before that we talked about earlier but it's awesome software point of view it's kind of pluggable right so when we build a software for example our cloud customers in the use DSC they use the same set of API is orgy RPC arrest ApS that DSC provides the tier controller but when we shipped the same platform to our enterprise customers we built our one controller and we use the same DSC API so the way we are trying to do is think this fully leveraged in what we do for enterprise customers and cloud customers and we don't try to reinvent the wheel obviously at the same time if you look at the highest level constructs from a network perspective right or even storage perspective what are you trying to do you're trying to provide connectivity but you're trying forward isolation and you're trying to provide security so all this constructs we encapsulated in API which you know in some some some mostly like cloud like API sand those API is our sim are used but cloud customers and enterprise customers and the software is built in a way where any layer is can be removed on any way it can be add right because it's in our interest we don't want to build multiple difference office for different customers right then we will not scale so the idea when we started the software architecture is that how we make it pluggable and how we'll make a program will that customer says I don't want this piece of it he can put some third party piece on it and still integrate at a at a common layer with using rest APIs yeah well you know Krishna you know I have a little bit of appreciation where some of the hard work that goes through what your team's been doing you know a couple of years in stealth but you know really accelerating from you know the announcement coming out of stealth at the end of 2019 to just about half a year your GA with a major OEMs be e you know definitely a lot of work that needs to be done and bring us so you know what what are you most proud about from the work that your team's doing uh you know we don't need to hear any you know major horror stories but you know there always are some of those you know not holes or challenges that you know often get you know hidden behind the curtain personally I'm most proud of the team that we've made so you know obviously you know our executors have a good track record of you know disrupting the market multiple times but I'm most proud of the team because the team is not just worried about technology that I mean there are really senior technologists and they're great leaders but they also worried about a customer problem right so it's always about you know getting the right mix of you know execution combined with technology is when you succeed that is what I mean I mean most proud of you know we have a team with independent leaders running all these projects independently and then releasing almost we have a release every week if you look at all our customers right and then you know being a small company doing that is is pretty challenging in a way but we did myth B came up with methodologies where we fully believe in automation everything is automated and whenever we release software you run through the full set of automation so that we are confident that customer is getting good quality code it's not like you know we cooked up something and they should be worried when they need to upgrade to this software so that's I think that's the key part if you want to succeed in this day and age developing the features of the velocity that you will want to develop and still support all these customers at the same time well congratulations on that Christian all right final question I have for you gives us a little bit of guidance going forward you know often when we see a company out and we you know try to say oh well this is what that company does you've got a very flexible architecture a lot of different types of solutions what kind of markets or services you know might we be looking at from pensando you know downloads down the road a little bit ways so I think we have a long journey so we have a platform right now we already mean we have a very baby we're shipping the platform is already shipping in a storage provider we are integrating with premier clouds public clouds and you know enterprise market you know we already deployed distributed firewall and some of our customers they participate firework so you know so if you take this platform it can be extendable to add in all the services that you see in data centers or clubs right but primarily we are driven from a customer perspective or customer priority point of view so where we will go is we will try to add more edge services we will try to add more storage features and then we should beer also this initial interest in service provider market what we can do for Phi J and IOT because we have the flexible platform we have to see you know how to apply this platform to this new applications that's where probably will go in future all right well Krishna daughter penny vice president of software with pensando thank you so much for joining thank you student was great talking to you all right be sure to check out the cube net you can find lots of interviews from pensando I'm Stu minimun and thank you for watching
