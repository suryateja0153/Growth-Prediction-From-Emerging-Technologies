 Recently the Apple announced the iphone 12 In which they only gave their only iphone Not the charger or the air pods the reason is apple try to make all their products one hundred percent recyclable in fact the apple parts itself is one hundred percent renewable resources So they wanted to make each and everything eco friendly no carbon-emission coming out from it in fact all the parts from the apple can be used to the another product of the apple For the fact how can we charge it they gave the usb c cable with usb a port in which if you have a usb c adapter which Only reasonably buy at the apple market we can connect through that and charge it or the other way they introduced new mag wireless charging which is already introduced in apple iphone 8 but this thing will charge the iphone in 15w charger eco friendly and powerful way of charging by magnetic resources at the back of the apple which contains the magnetic circle and at the mag safe it connects that and it will sense through the magnet it will charge Bascially iphone trying to built friendly nature mobile phones and coming to the iphone which as A14 bionic chip the first fastest and speedest chip compared to all other smartphones in the world in fact these are chips which are 5nm processor even even intel or the amd are trying to build 7nm processor but the apple did it and it also comes with 11.8 *billion (transistors) if you take a graphics card the processing speed will be like more than 20 billion like that apple trying to come out same as the graphics card but apple also has neural engine which has 16 core inbuilt in it this enable the machine learning,ai,AR,VR everything will come under this neural engine performs and outscales it And when it comes to encoding and decoding video or encrypting and decrypting anything comes under the privacy this neural engine takes care of it and it also comes with 6 core of cpu processor and a 4 core of gpu this cpu or the gpu performs the iphone way more faster with low power consumption So let's take a look at the outside parts of an apple when we come to the outside of an apple we can see 6.1 inch of display and 86% screen to body ratio which is not much But it is pretty much okay because iphone try to bring smallest phone ever and when it come to this phone iphone 12 can be used in one single not using two handed at the same time we can use in one single handed and it also comes with usb c port which i already pre-told which can be used in the adapters and it also comes with built-in microphone and speakers It also comes with 12MP at the front and dual 12MP at the back Apple 12 pro or 12 pro max it comes with triple camera but when it comes with 12 or 12 mini it comes with dual camera and also iphone has 5 stylish colours and when we come with the case it looks like same as the old iphone SE1 this square shape why apple need to produce again when you put on a case and drop the iphone it will not come out so that square shape will protect that and it also splash resistant water resistant drop recovery and everything the best advantage is you can keep mag safe case and a no mag safe case and anything you keep and charge it the phone will charge and let's check what's inside when we check the inside of the apple we can see a lot of built in apps same as previously used in apple 11 or 10 nothing much new same apps like that and when we comes to the design apple has the normal notch same as previous doesn't have any drop notch the real reason is the notification tab and wifi,bluetooth enabled at the same time and the notch is very helpful to do that again if there is a water drop notch again the older method comes out that again goes with the previous apple it always try to move forward pretty much it is again to the older version of the apple and also in this apple when it comes to games lots of games can be played at fastest a14 bionic chip it comes with 4gb of ram and 128 storage or 64 or 256 and this is 128 gb of storage apple also provide apple arcade with 3 months free subscription i don't know whether it is for apple 12 or apple 11 when i bought this phone they have the apple subscription for 3 months and it can be claimed only at 90 days after the purchase and it also has apple tv for free for one year not only for your phone even you have an apple tv in your room you use it for that so let's talk about the camera Coming to the apple camera we all know it has an oled display and it also has HDR and Dolby vision enabled we can even shoot movies with it and also when it comes with video hd or 4k at 30 to 60 fps and hdr only accepts at 30 fps when you have 12 or 12 pro max you can enable hdr upto 60 fps but when you have 12 or 12 mini hdr can only be enabled at 30 fps and when it comes to slo-mo mode fps changes from 120 fps to 240 fps and it also has time-lapse it can slao potrait mode for natural light studio light and contour light and apple always tend to be the biggest camera and it is named for the camera brand buying a phone which has worth camera quality and keeping a home studio it is very useful and i'm going to show a demo video and all videos picture captured from the apple and this picture also include some of own images captured in this phone and i will show it to you It's hard to believe that 5g is amazing as they say and this is the only smartphone which has 5g in it 5g means it has ultra reliable low latency and higher bandwidth which gives a huge number of data downloading within seconds and massive IOT of things can be used in 5G no only in that in future amazon uses droids such as coptors to deliver what product we needed not only in that it also have automobile it requires 5g for traffic detection or object detection and finally even siri can be used in 5g network based on connectivity on the area Only in iphone 12 siri has been changed to a button and when i try to call siri by saying hey siri or pressing this button for a long time You can see a small button which do not disturb a whole screen in it and we can take away siri just by sliding in it and i will show a demo video speaking to a siri "What's today weather" Thank you goodbye So this is the new iphone way by talking to a siri which is really efficient and it can be used only in the iphone 12 and iphone 12 pro the real question do you have to buy an iphone 12 now the answer is maybe because we have an iphone 7 which is right in my hand we try to buy an iphone 12 in fact if you needed a 5g network connectivity and OLED display you can go for the iphone 12 or else you want to stick with the size and screen and the performance scale you can go with iphone 10 X 10 XR iphone 11 and 11 pro because all other changes are same as that unless only 5g network connectivity and OLED display are going to be the change because you would have spended a lot of cash 600 or 700 or 800 or even 1000 dollars and if you want to buy an iphone 12 again you have to pay 700 dollars and it will be huge amount of loss maybe you can wait for an another product launch by the apple soon after that so my option is if you already had iphone 10 10xr or 11 you could wait or if you are only iphone 7 7s or 8 you can go for iphone12 since it has lot of 5g network connectivity and stunning design of the cameras and hdr and dolby vision it is really useful for film making and much more and so thank you watching if you really liked the video click the like button and if you wanna subscribe click the subscribe button see you all in the next week Thank you for watching with
