 good afternoon everybody thanks very much indeed uh for joining us for the weekly great manchester uh kovid briefing uh joined today by deputy mayor baroness beverly hughes i'll hand over to bev in a second after i've taken you through the latest the latest stats for greater bunch of the tables that you'll now be quite familiar uh with uh and once bev's um spoken i will um come back just to say uh a few brief words on the report that's out today from the northern uh health uh science alliance so on with the um the latest picture uh for greater manchester here's the um uh the the headline table for the rolling uh seven day case rate per hundred thousand population the good news uh to report today is that this uh from a greater manchester perspective is the first week on week reduction in cases since the 22nd of august so that is of course good news and if you look down the column uh the final column on the right hand side you will see that nine of our ten districts uh recording a reduction only trafford uh but that's a slight increase so pretty much where they were so an encouraging picture although we do have to point out of course that these are high case rates compared with the with the rest of the country but nevertheless uh clearly uh some signs of movement in a more positive direction if we go on to the um second slide this is the one you might be familiar with that interrupted strictly come dancing a couple of saturdays ago it's a difficult one uh to make sense of it at this uh sort of size but it's an important one and it's one we're looking at very closely um if you look at the um the greater manchester block at the top on the left um the two lines that are of very much uh uh close interest to us are the uh the the age the case rate in the over 65s and then just beneath them in the 45s uh to 64 age range for the over 65s the case rate the seven day case rate is now 429 per 100 000 that's down from 464 at the end of october and for the 45 to 64 age range uh it's 609 now down from 790. the color coding may not show that to you completely but but trust me these are important figures and they're ones the government look at very closely as well and what it shows is we're seeing uh falling infection rate in in the older age range which is encouraging and encouraging at sign this uh next slide might be of interest to you you've seen it a couple of times before but it begins to confirm a trend that we've seen uh developing in in the previous versions of this slide and it shows that the north west if you look across the country region by region uh the the north west is the only one to record negative growth uh in in infections um so clearly that's uh uh an interesting uh picture given where we've where we've been throughout the rest of this year and as you can see that's not just uh liverpool or other parts of the northwest accounting for that reduction uh greater manchester is seeing a fairly significant reduction as well so that's the uh the region by region comparison which hopefully is helpful to you if we might move on to the next slide um again you will be familiar with this one by now this is both the numbers of tests carried out and the positivity the positivity rate a slight reduction in the number of tests carried out in the last couple of weeks but that possibly reflects uh fewer people experiencing symptoms so again that may be a a good sign the reports are at the moment we don't have any problem with testing capacity so people are able to get a test if they are symptomatic so again possibly some encouraging signs in this uh this set of figures and then if we might move on uh to um two more quickly uh more calls for concern here this is the uh percentage of uh care home residents with a confirmed diagnosis or showing symptoms so that has now risen to 4.1 which again is uh too high and of course for concern the comparison though that we probably need to make is with um is with uh earlier in the year um the figure for early may was 6.7 so just so people have that comparison we weren't collecting this figure in april but of course it was likely to be much higher than that so this is not a return to where we were earlier in the year i think this would be more comparable with with the june uh period but still something that uh has been growing and something that we're watching very very closely indeed um and then if i might just come to the hospital uh data this um again has i guess you could say mixed mixed news in that um beginning to see a slowing in the number of admissions to hospital but also in inpatient uh diagnoses so on both fronts there that that is uh encouraging but then if you look at the second two lines so the the the the numbers of patients in icu and in uh non-icu beds what you will see a slight increase in the number of patients in in icu um but a fairly significant increase of patients in non-icu beds which suggests that hospitals therefore are experiencing quite a lot of pressure and obviously finding it harder to discharge patients which may explain some of the recent pressure on the ambulance service with regard to icu um capacity uh earlier this week stood at uh 78.9 but it's important to say that more icu bets have been opened recently so that probably explains the slight fall the figures are well that's stable uh for for this week um but clearly uh that that's um that that's something that we need to uh to continue to monitor and although there are the first signs perhaps that we may have uh seen the peak of the second wave with regard to the number of new infections in the community i think it's important for me to say that it it doesn't yet appear that we've reached the peak in terms of pressure on our hospitals and that is more likely to be felt uh towards the the late later part of this month that's certainly what colleagues in our hospitals are expecting to see so um we we haven't uh from an nhs point of view seen the the full impact yet of the second wave and um you can see how the picture is developing in our hospitals uh from from the figures that i've just presented so i'll leave it there for now i will now hand over to uh to the deputy mayor paris beverly hughes bev thank you andy well we thought as last weekend was the the first weekend since the new restrictions and national lockdown came into uh interviewing that we say something about uh what what's happened since then um i think there's a general feel isn't there um i don't know if you share it that this lockdown isn't doesn't feel like the first one at all obviously it's different in that uh people are taking children to school and bringing them home every day but there's a lot more people around and about traffic levels haven't really significantly uh for fallen and it generally feels um less less stringent having said that since last thursday um most members of the public are respecting the the new restrictions they're calling the police where they do have uh concerns and generally the public are very supportive of the police enforcing uh enforcing the new regulations however over the weekend there were a number of very significant contraventions a very large party about 60 people crowned into a very small flat in the centre of manchester the organizer of that was signed at 10 000 pounds large numbers of students trying to get into parties in the student accommodation campus at fowler fields that had to be responded to um most seriously of all i think the anti-lockdown protest in the center of manchester on sunday similar to those in merseyside and london and elsewhere this was a major disturbance the police try to do what they always do when they have intelligence that something of that sort being organized a protest of engaging with the organizers before and indeed during um the gathering in piccadilly gardens um explaining the guidance trying to um persuade people to comply with with the with the new restrictions and um i want to say unequivocally that this was a reckless and irresponsible event that shouldn't have happened and i do condemn it in the strongest possible terms at its peak there were 600 people present additional police had to be drafted in from the 10 districts of greater manchester in addition to the 50 that were deployed in any way in a from the first instance to this um to this event and when protesters began to move out of piccadilly gardens and walk through the streets of the city and when coach loads arrived from cumbria that's when the significant extra please had to be deployed several people were arrested on public order offences the organizer has been located a man from trafford and fined ten thousand pounds uh two dozen fixed penalty notices issued and several police officers were injured uh in their attempts to control that disturbance and we just want to make it clear you know that whilst protests themselves aren't banned and there was a lot of discussion about that nationally between the national police chiefs council and the government and pccs prior to the lockdown regulations being formulated whilst protests per se aren't banned the covid regulations do take precedence and that makes it illegal for more than two people to gather together if they're not from the same household and that legislation will be enforced and will be enforced strongly we don't have any specific intelligence that this is going to be repeated although i think there were claims by people uh in the protest on sunday that they they would be back and if they are police will act very swiftly now to disperse them to prevent large numbers of people gathering and to prevent the kind of disturbance we had we had on sunday because not only is that a significant risk to public health and we're talking here about you know wanting to see and seeing some indication the rates may be uh plateauing or in some instances actually coming down and it's these kind of events that will challenge further progress on that front but also as i've said it takes police officers away from what they should be doing which is serving the public in their local areas it's quite tricky for commanders on the ground you know they have to make decisions there and then but our general approach now and i'm telling people before the weekend is that the new regulations will be enforced very swiftly and very strongly thanks emily thanks very much indeed bev i just want to turn briefly if i can to the report that's been issued today by the northern health science alliance uh which confirms what we've been saying all year that the north of england has been hit harder uh from health and an economic point of view by covid19 and just wanted to draw out two of the slides that they've issued with their their report today which uh show that um and actually i think it's important to look at all cause of mortality uh so covid but also alongside um other conditions as well and clearly it shows that um north east and the northwest are are out in front as they would normally be but what the report is saying is that that has been accentuated by uh by the the pandemic um so that's a sobering finding and then if we might move on to the second table which shows the economic impact uh of um of the pandemic this is the percentage point uh point change in the claimant count um from march to april and as you can see the biggest increases have been experienced right across the north with the north registering largely red but but some amber as well and a very different picture elsewhere so it's important to keep it in the minds of people in whitehall that the north of england has been hit harder and is being hit harder by this virus than other parts of the country and therefore um the allocation of resources to to help people and help communities help businesses to cope with that um remains an ongoing concern and there are just two policy points that i want to pick up arising from that first is back on the discussion the debate we had with the government a few years ago about uh specific local support to help people and businesses through the ongoing pressure that they are facing you may recall when great manchester was in discussions with the government uh about support enter tier three it emerged after those discussions that a formula of 20 pounds per head was being used for areas entering tier 3. that has now been applied to local authorities across the country so when we went into national lockdown all local authorities have been allocated uh funding for business support uh on the basis of a 20 pound per head formula so to um to describe what's that what that means in practice is that that is greater managed 60 million pound grant um but it also means that every local authority now has got a fund similar and our understanding at the moment is there'll be no extra funding uh if areas come out of national lockdown into tier three compared to areas who were in tier one international lockdown and back into tier one the funding is the funding and that that is now uh set uh we think that will be uh well unfair number one but also impossible uh to deal with if if aries and we we don't know yet whether this is the case but if greater manchester is to go back into tier three or even tier two that will be a very challenging position for us to be in uh right throughout the winter and it begs the question well why is not extra support being offered to areas that are going to face greater challenges there still will be national support for businesses forced to close but of course the effect of being tier three has a much greater knock-on impact on people right across the economy and we're just raising that issue today just to make you aware of it that that is the current position that we've been informed of we think the tier system coming out of national lockdown won't work if that is how it is to be funded uh and we think that's an issue that needs to be looked at again similarly an issue that needs to be looked at again is the ongoing question of the people who've been left without any support at all since uh march um estimated to be around three million people we're talking of people who were new starters so unable to access furlough or people who were newly self-employed people who um would be p-a-y-e freelancers or who received their salary through dividends as a as a company director of us of a small enterprise um it remains the case that there are three million taxpayers here who've had nothing at all uh in terms of public support from the government and that cannot be right when we look at other groups employees or people who are self-employed rightly getting help and now recently been told that that help will continue through the second lockdown and into 2021 i think all it does for the group that are excluded it exacerbates the sense of unfairness so we just wanted to let you know that we will be continuing to support this group and myself and the mayor of the liverpool city region will be hosting a an event tomorrow night with some of the people affected from greater manchester and from the liverpool city region we think it's really important that we give a platform to the people in this position to let their voice be heard because they haven't been heard so far so we will be holding that event tomorrow evening with the excluded uk campaign group we want colleagues in the media to understand who is affected here and what impact it's had on their lives the pressures they're facing in the run-up to christmas uh we want them to be able to tell their stories but of course steve and i will be making some calls arising from that which we believe are necessary to resolve this matter um in a in a fair um fair and um uh respect respectful way given um what they have already contributed to the country for everything that they've they've done it's not right to leave so many people completely shut out of support and we would welcome colleagues in the media joining us tomorrow evening to hear about their stories and to hear how we're going to take this campaign in support of those excluded people forward so i will leave it there in terms of the um main presentations i'm going to hand over now to jimmy who will take us through your questions jimmy thank you andy um maybe we'll start on the northern health science alliance report and a question from nick statham at 2 15 the nhsa report on the disproportionate effect of kovid on the northern powerhouse says this is due to existing inequalities which left the region in a more vulnerable position to address this one of its recommendations is for the government to target clinically vulnerable and deprived communities in the northern powerhouse in the first phase of a rollout of the covet vaccine given greater manchester's experience of the pandemic how important is it that we are at the front of the queue when the vaccine is available and should more deprived areas in the conorbation be prioritized in your view or should it be a gm wide approach well thank you very much nick um so the first thing i would say in response to that is i would certainly encourage the government to to look at the uh report from the northern health science alliance today and particularly the recommendation that you're that you're pointing to now i've been in the position as health secretary where i have set the prioritization for a a vaccine in a pandemic and it has to be done extremely carefully and first it has to be done by a clinical priority uh with regard to the groups who are most likely to be at risk um from uh this particular virus and there was a different prioritization for swine flu uh than there will be for um for covid because as we've seen this year dif different uh people in different age groups are are affected so first and foremost it has to be by uh the groups that are most affected and there has to be equity of course across across the country but as ever in the nhs resources do need to be targeted to to greatest need and we of course would hope to work with the government to ensure that there were sufficient supplies particularly in the in the communities that will be uh be most uh most at risk so i think the prioritization will be set nationally and that will be according to patient groups but obviously there is a discussion to be had about the the speed with which vaccines are supplied which areas receive it first and this will be true within any within any part of the country and obviously areas where the risks are greatest you would want to see given a priority access as much as that is possible within a an equitable approach in all in all parts of the country it's a really difficult uh process i don't envy the government in um in in undertaking what will be a major logistical exercise it has to be done extremely carefully transparently um but yes we should be thinking how how to make maximum impact with the rollout of the of the vaccine and yes getting it to to the people in the areas in greatest need as quickly as we can thank you andy staying on the vaccine a question from tom dambach at hits radio at 206. following the announcement of the vaccine yesterday is it known how many doses will be allocated to greater manchester in the first batch ordered by the government or do you expect conversations to begin about what gm will receive i think you know those conversations are yet to be had tom i mean we are making arrangements um and leaders were updated yesterday on uh the state of readiness with regard to rolling out the vaccine i think it has to be fair to all people in all places all over the country i just want to re emphasize that point i don't think we can expect necessarily preferential treatment however if it would make sense to begin the rollout in certain areas first then of course those those things can be can be looked at within an overall framework as i say is is fair to all regions and all all people within them so a lot will depend of course on the delivery schedule from the uh from the manufacturer we also need to be careful not to rate ahead of ourselves you know there's there's still some further work to be done to confirm that this vaccine is is ready uh to go and it's safe um but hopefully um if all of those hurdles are passed you know we would want to work with the government on a on a roll out that we all agree is the fairest way is the fairest way to do it and we'll get first to those at greatest greatest risk so you know as i say we want to work with the government on on this we're not seeking preferential treatment but of course there are things that can be done uh to um to to speed up availability in the areas that most need it thank you andy excuse me one on testing from jen williams at the master even news at 213 gen writes i've been picking up considerable concern within the greater manchester system around the new lateral flow tests being rolled out by government so soon after the liverpool pilot has begun although greater manchester has signed up for the tests there are worries about their efficacy as well as the potential impact on contact tracing and the pillar one testing system if the process is not properly resourced and planned how optimistic are you about this rollout and do you share these concerns i think it's correct to say that there are uh concerns but not that so much that we would say well we you know we we think this is the wrong thing to do of course uh what's happening in in liverpool is is interesting and uh we're um certainly open uh to the idea of moving in a in a similar uh direction but we need to obviously have concerns fully uh fully thought through and i i would say that there are a couple of very significant concerns jen um alongside the ones that you've mentioned well one of one of the ones is one that you've mentioned it's not yet fully clear to us how the data collected through this testing will be used with regard to the national test and trace system and of course whether that system is able to cope with the number of um uh of positive cases that may be identified coming through and it's the issue of matching the resources to the extra demand that might be that might be created and of course if that in if that data isn't going into the national test and trade system that then raises a question about whether mass testing is being done in in the right way so this i think does need to be to be further worked out another concern uh and i hear this probably concern most is whether the approach to mass testing might obviously identify more cases in particular regions and then leave places in a position where they're in a higher tier and unable to exit from from a higher tier and whether a waiting will be created and a consideration given to the areas undertaking more mass testing to ensure that that doesn't mean that they are trapped in a tier without the necessary financial support as as i was saying earlier so i think this detail has been worked through uh a letter was sent out by the government this week offering a sort of variation on the liverpool approach which would be to provide mass testing for around 10 percent of local populations um and that being decided more locally i think that landed pretty well i think people can see the merits of that of that approach but even so there are still details to be worked out and some of the concerns that you've identified to be worked through thank you andy staying on testing a question from 230 uh stephen kingston at the salford star have you any news andy on operation moonshot in salford and beyond are there any figures on testing and success or failure i suppose you might mean moonshot figures as opposed to the figures from earlier in the presentation the honest answer is i don't and i'm sorry not to provide a a direct answer i don't want to um to talk off the top of my head and not be able to um to answer accurately so it's probably one for salford council stephen in this first instance and i would uh refer you there but the team could provide some written information if that would be useful to you thank you so staying on testing uh kevin fitzpatrick from bbc radio manchester at 226. andy can you tell us anything about how the new rapid tests will be targeted when they're introduced here and then a secondary question which bev may also which to answer is are you concerned that amid all the excitement around a vaccine and falling case numbers the public will start to relax in the middle of this second wave i think the second part of your question is certainly a concern and that crossed my mind more than once in the last uh couple of days uh kevin i think the um arrival of a vaccine if that is what is happening can i say if because there are further hurdles to be crossed uh here um obviously it will take time as i was just saying before once you prioritize the population and the groups who should receive it first you know you are talking uh a matter of months before that vaccine can be can be safely delivered and become effective so it doesn't alter the fact and it's really important for me to get this message over today it doesn't alter the fact that we're heading into perhaps the most difficult winter we've ever experienced in living memory in not just the nhs but in greater manchester as a whole in terms of the the pressure that's going to be on is on people and is going to be on all communities throughout this time and i think we mustn't uh lose lose sight of that we must keep our eye on the ball um the vaccine is encouraging but the effects of it would be felt in uh 2021 not in uh 2020 so uh you're rightly right to raise that question and we all need to remember to follow all of the advice and it's in following that advice as sir richard lee's was saying last week that we can take pressure off people who are exhausted on that nhs front line and need us they need us to to do what we're being asked to do so that we can in some ways make the winter manageable for them um so you know it's a it's an important uh question on the most optimistic scenario for the vaccine it still is not going to make um the difference in the nhs until the end of january and i think everyone needs to keep that absolutely forefront of um of their mind on your question uh about testing as i just said to jen williams the um the offer from the government to local authorities is that uh there may be mass testing capacity to cover about 10 percent of the population and that can be targeted and one obvious group would be university students and i think the government has uh has made an announcement or is about to about how mass testing might be used to allow students to return home for christmas so that's obviously one uh one obvious use of the um of the service another might be uh to promote the safety of care home visits and that's obviously an issue that we all want to see see progress on so the these decisions would be a matter for um local authorities to use that to use their discretion over i i think education settings university schools social care settings care homes and potentially domiciliary care staff will be high priorities for for that testing but more broadly it will be for local authorities to decide as i understand it thank you andy and the second part of the question to bev perhaps are you concerned bev that amid all the excitement around a vaccine and falling case numbers the public will start to relax in the middle of this second wave yes i agree with andy i mean i started my remarks a few minutes ago saying that i think most people feel that this lockdown has got a very kind of different feel about it than the first one and whilst most people are complying uh i think there is a real concern that that people will relax now uh because of the prospect of a vaccine and i have to say i think to some extent the messages coming from the deputy chief medical officer and so on i seem to be rushing rushing ahead to anticipating um that there will be a vaccine and it you know it will come very quickly and um i'm not i'm not sure that that's that's going to be the case but i think it's heightening the sense of anticipation and relief that people understandably feel um and possibly as a consequence of that they will drop their guard more so we have to keep the messages very very strong particularly for us here in greater manchester with the rates that we've got which although they may be slightly falling are still very high compared to other parts of the country so you know we just have to keep pressing on um with the measures all of the measures that we know if they're applied properly will actually make for a reduction and at a faster pace thank you bev and then another question for you from 226 this is james mutch at the bolton news do you know about how many coveted related incidents police were called out to in bolton over the weekend and fines that were handed out in bolton and have you any details about businesses in the town that have been fined i suppose could broaden it out if you had any data for the city region as a whole yeah thank you um thank you james i i in my report from the police um at the weekend there weren't any major incidents uh cited in bolton that doesn't mean there weren't any incidents at all it may be the local authority environment health teams were out it may be that that they um found some contraventions and took action but in terms of the very significant contraventions um bolton bolton wasn't cited um and again i haven't got disaggregated figures to hand in relation to fixed penalty notices important per se i can try and get those for you i know that now there's been just under a thousand um fixed penalty notices issued by greater manchester police um there were i think three businesses in the town that were very recently fined a thousand pounds each in the hospitality sector for contravening um the regulations by issuing what was said to be very large amounts of alcohol um without very much food uh in evidence and so they were they were fine for those contraventions um i think you'll have seen overall i'm not sure if this is the case in bolton but there have been an increasing number now of ten thousand pound fines um not just for for the protest but for wedding parties uh for household parties uh and other similar gatherings so increasingly the very highest level of fixed penalty notices has been issued over recent days thank you bev andy back to you and another question on testing this is 239 from josh halliday at the guardian josh asks greater manchester's mass testing expert group last week raised concerns about the lanp tests that the government proposes to use for nhs staff within weeks they found that these tests only identified positive cases half of the time are these concerns being raised within the government with the government and is the rollout of lamp testing going ahead in greater manchester hospitals thanks uh thanks josh um you're right um there was concern about the results that came out of the first um uh the first test that was uh conducted uh as i understand it uh there's going to be a rerun of the test um to see if we can uh get uh you know identify why why the results were as they were so um i wouldn't want to to say more without knowing fully um all of the details that lay behind some of the the results in the first round again what i can get for you is a clear explanation of uh what what happened and why a decision has been taken to re to rerun that test as i understand it the results have been different in in other places uh but but still yes there is a concern that um the results in the first round hence the the decision to um to rerun it i think if you compare the results of the tests of where it's been done in other parts of the country again there's some discrepancies so um it obviously needs to be to be to be worked through and that's what the mass testing expert group here are are doing they're working through those concerns thank you and staying on hospital as a question at 239 from joshi hermann at the mill for andy a high proportion of greater manchester's recent covered hospital deaths have taken place at the pennine acute trust which has the highest number of deaths in the country the data indicates the trust has a large and growing problem with quote probable healthcare-associated infections has there been one hospital outbreak within the trust or several and can you tell us more about the concerning level of deaths in that trust which accounts for more that for about a third of greater manchester deaths at the moment well certainly um we're aware of the the pressure on the um on the hospital at the moment on the trust uh and you are right um that um that there has been a higher number of deaths but we have had similar figures at different points in time of the hospital so obviously it's important not to at this stage overreact but we do uh we have um discussed this week within the group about extra support being provided to pennine uh acute from within the greater manchester uh system uh but if you go back a couple of weeks ago writing some wigan and lee was under intense pressure and still is under pressure so it's important not to any point in time uh see any one hospital in in isolation but certainly it has been um it has been recognized that the trusts uh the trust is under a great deal of pressure with regard to healthcare-associated infections i think what i've said to this briefing before that we are concerned about the number of uh patients who are testing positive once they're already in hospital and i i believe uh the figures i showed you earlier show that there's still a very high number of people who have not tested positive in the community but our testimonies once they are in hospital the issue there is whether or not they already have it as they're coming into hospital or whether they acquire it uh within the um within the the hospital setting and uh we have discussed trying to get a clearer breakdown as to which what group accounts for what percentage uh because obviously there would be concerns if if there was um transmission within the the hospital environment of course the more pressure that hospitals are under the more people are in hospital you know the the infection control uh certainly the front door of the hospital becomes harder but i don't want to jump to conclusions joshi beyond saying to you that we are aware of you know the pressure that the trust is under and obviously from a greater manchester system point of view trying to provide whatever support we can thank you andy this is a question at 2 33 and this relates to ambulances on monday the ambulance service was again exceptionally busy with staffing issues and a busy a e departments adding to the pressure do you think more needs to be done in terms of resources and staffing in the service to ensure this doesn't become a regular event over the winter and this is from charlotte cox at the men well thanks charlotte i mean certainly the ambulance service is under under intense pressure we saw the major incident of a week on monday ago uh but you're right there's the pressure continues even if it didn't quite hit that that level in answer to your question i would say it probably reflects more on the hospital system than it does necessarily the ambulance service it's a bit of both but what i think happens um once hospitals become uh become more full is that the trust the ambulance service finds it harder to hand over patients at a e and what you begin to get is that effect of ambulances um kind of cueing at a e trying to hand over patients and then that of course traps them there and then you get the kind of knock-on effect on ambulance response times across the system so it's often a reflection of the fact that hospitals are full and they're finding it hard to discharge patients and therefore a e becomes backed up and full and patients from a and e can't be admitted to the wards and then that pressure backs up again onto the ambulance service so i think this is a recognition of the pressure on not just the ambulance service but probably more on on hospitals and yes there's a huge amount of work going on with regards to staffing uh within the acute the acute system and what more can be done uh to manage pressures on staffing as i said before staff are exhausted um obviously some staff are self-isolating you know this is an extremely challenging situation for for everybody and the ambulance service obviously are picking up um some of the knock-on uh knock-on effects effects of that the um the issue is obviously the number of patients as i said before in non-icu beds the treat because of treatments that are available now it would appear that people are tending to spend longer in hospital if they have cobit and that is one of the things that is creating that extra pressure on on the system but um you know difficult as it is the system is is is coping uh with with the pressure um and with some of the figures that we've shown you today with regard to the change in the number of infections we're hoping that while the next two to three weeks we will be probably the period of most pressure on our hospitals and our ambulance service we might begin to see a a reduction in that pressure as we go into the early part of december so it remains a very challenging picture indeed uh and i'm sure uh colleagues in the ambulance service northwest ambulance service are doing everything they can to put on extra vehicles and extra extra paramedics but of course it's not just in the ambulance service that we need to do that i think the main pressure is on um is on hospitals and particularly on hospital discharge and ensuring the patients can can pass pass through the system and we don't see those cues developing at the at the front door at the a e thank you andy two connected questions on the tiers system now one is from andy bounds from the financial times at 242 who asks uh seven to fourteen days after greater manchester went into tier three cases fell and he cites october 30th to november sixth why do you think that tier three doesn't work and then a connected question from hannah miller at granada at 2 34. you think the tier system won't work from december the second what should happen instead so andy on your question i think in some ways you've answered it in the you know 17 to 14 days is is not long enough for uh the effect of the measures to be to be fully felt you know we're always talking of at least a two week plus um lag on on any measures to see this to see the effect of those uh effect of those measures that was certainly the case with the restrictions uh that came in in the summer so um i think all of the people here in our system would say any changes in our figures couldn't really be attributed to um to tier three um why do i think tier three won't work well it was what we were told when we were in discussions with the government on on tier three certainly that it wouldn't be certain uh to work um i i my view remains remains the same my worry would be that um we leave national lockdown with cases still uh still too high uh and we go into a tier three situation um that effectively again leaves us with um stubbornly high numbers of cases doesn't actually bring them down and um obviously if we're not fully funded as i said before with the arrangements that are emerging for life beyond national lockdown that creates a real a real concern that um uh that will be trapped in ongoing restrictions that won't be effective in bringing the cases down but but nor will the sufficient support be be provided so i mean i've argued you know for a a more decisive circuit break um to try and get the cases down obviously the government's mayday uh made a a different a different decision but i i do believe it's a difficult ask of the public just to put people in in effectively never-ending restrictions and i i do have concerns that we are uh setting up a situation where we'll see further economic damage without the reduction uh reduction in in cases we when we we saw no evidence presented to us when we were in discussions with the government that tier three in the way that it's currently constructed will have a decisive impact on bringing down the number of infections in terms of hannah miller's question jimmy um uh i say i think it won't work i i'm not saying i'm certain it won't hannah it's just saying that that we were told that it would be unlikely uh to have that decisive impact on on the number on reducing the number of infections and uh that remains uh remains a concern you know we will have to see won't we how the cases continue to um continue to develop over the rest of of november um and i i would be arguing to see if we can uh see a significant reduction to get us into a tier two situation um but i i have concerns that uh leaving great monster in tough restrictions all through the winter uh will be a very very tough ask of people indeed and it's why i'd said some time ago that i felt a more decisive national circuit break was needed thank you andy this is a question on homelessness at 2 45 from rachel lazzaro of bbc news online the mustard tree homelessness charity in manchester has said huge increase in family's contemporary accommodation and fears that they will run out of space in greater manchester in january how much has this virus put pressure on support for homeless people and families well thanks uh rachel i can give you some figures on that if they're of interest to you um in terms of the numbers in um statutory temporary accommodation at the moment we have across greater monster 1 300 single people uh in temporary accommodation uh and 2 285 family households so they are huge numbers of course uh and a big increase on what they were uh earlier in the year if you then add to that these are the latest figures that were given to me yesterday we have 480 people in a bed every night um accommodation which we've changed to make it covered safe but you know that is a high number and it will remain at that level throughout the winter i i'm guessing we have around 480 still in what we call the everyone in accommodation so that's people in the individual rooms that we were able to uh to provide earlier earlier this year there are still 480 additional people in those rooms and sadly there are 106 people sleeping rough in great manchester on the latest latest count now again that was higher this time last year you might remember the official count in november 2019 recorded 151 people sleeping rough but the figure is sadly creeping up again it came down lower earlier this year with the everyone in initiative and it is now creeping up the reason i give you all of those figures is because it's quite a precarious situation now when you look at the numbers in temporary accommodation the numbers in about every night the numbers still in everyone in i i met with the homelessness board in greater monster yesterday um i have asked that everything possible be done to try and offer something for everybody through this winter period particularly for those 106 people still out there that's sleeping rough um we are working hard to see if that can be done the government has recently said that extra funding will be released as part of its protect program and two of our boroughs will qualify for funding under that program manchester and salford so we hope that extra funding is is coming but you can see from the numbers that i've given that we are fully committed here we are supporting lots of people in um in temporary or emergency accommodation uh and if i refer back to the graph i showed before from the northern health science alliance you know the claimant count in the north of england says that more and more people are entering financial distress and um i think with the end of furlough last week even though the chancellor obviously made a late announcement about to change the furlough scheme i've picked up a lot of anecdotal evidence in the last week that people were made redundant nevertheless because the announcement came too late so people left employment on the 31st of october and there is now a doubt that they can be re re-employed so it's a very worrying situation i think the full effects of the economic crisis um maybe have not been felt yet and are about to be felt we welcome some of the moves that the chancellor has made in recent days particularly uh the extension of furlough at 80 right through to march which of course is something that greater monster campaign very vigorously for through our negotiations with the government we welcome uh self-employment support being set at at 80 percent and that continues till january i think uh question mark why january it seems to me to need to continue through to march but you know if i go back to that issue about three million people left with nothing you know their ability to carry on sustaining themselves with nothing coming in i think is only going to add to those numbers that i read out before in terms of people in temporary emergency accommodation or sleeping rough so this is a we're in a very precarious position i think when it comes to homelessness and rough sleeping in greater manchester there is a monumental effort still going on amongst our voluntary organizations some of our amazing organizations all of our councils the nhs everyone is doing everything that they can but it feels as though we are just about keeping our heads above water at the moment and the pressure is increasing all of the time try to give you an honest answer with the latest figures there rachel but i hope that that answers the question thank you there's just a question for some clarity as to an earlier answer that you gave andy from 254 from josh at the guardian can i double check andy's comments earlier that greater manchester saw the first week on week fall in cases since august the first slide showed gm's infection rate in the week ending 16 of the 10th was 405 for 100 000 that's lower than it is now [Music] well my notes uh josh said first week on wheat reduction since the 22nd of august um so if that isn't correct uh i will obviously have to uh to chase up that that stat um it may be um that there was a a week that people are discounting for some reason or another because of levels of testing or you know maybe it was linked to problems with testing capacity but i would have to if i can jimmy uh get you or somebody from the team to to look at those figures carefully and make sure we give uh a strictly accurate answer it might be that the period that you're the you're mentioning josh may have been a week that was affected by availability of testing and that is why it wasn't um kind of seen as a true as a true figure at the time but i would have to check that and come back to you thank you andy we can pick that up as well um a couple of um health questions then a couple of political questions andy and then we're done um the first health question is from jen williams at the men at 2 52 the director of public health at blackburn with darwin yesterday told mps that some people who need to self-isolate especially those in big multi-generational households on low incomes may need to be offered hotels as they are in southeast asia in order to be able to afford to safely do so do you agree i saw the suggestion i think it's an interesting suggestion and i i would certainly um say that if that was appropriate in those circumstances and it's the only way um it it could um prevent an infection going right through a household when clearly you would of course want to um to to help councils um provide that level of support and it could be linked of course to the self-isolation payment so if the self-isolation payment scheme could be used flexibly perhaps in that in that way obviously it's something that um uh that the director probably have clearly has experienced in in blackburn uh i i would imagine across all communities actually in greater manchester there will be there will be situations where people who are testing positive because of the nature of their housing situation will find it very very difficult uh to protect other members of the of the household so i would say certainly an idea to be looked at i noticed that dido harding this week again raised the issue of self-isolation support and the fact that the level of it isn't yet sufficient i don't think we've ever got this got this right what i don't want to see and this goes back to kevin fitzpatrick's question what i don't want to see is all of this talk of the vaccine almost becoming a bit of a you know a free pass away from all the issues with uh test traits and isolate it can't be you know we cannot make any assumptions yet that that's our sort of get out of jail card you know we must still keep focused on fixing test trace and isolate through through the winter and making it work as well as it can possibly work because we're entering the most dangerous time here um we need it to work not just to protect people but also to relieve pressure on on the nhs and all of the i you know these are the kind of ideas that we've been putting forward all year how do you help people self-isolate from a financial point of view but also uh from a safe point of view and i think the um the flexibility to create arrangements for people i think should be given to local councils so yes it's certainly an idea worth looking at thank you and then charlotte cox also at the men at 2 52. their reports andy from downing street that nightingale hospitals are to become mass immunization centers when a vaccine for cavities rolled out are you aware of this plan for manchester's nightingale hospital i'm i i'm aware charlotte that there is talk of having a a site within greater manchester where it may be a you know a center for mass delivery of of vaccination um but not necessarily the site that you that you mentioned so i think there are there is consideration being uh given uh at the moment to you know whether or not we have such a site and where it might be i i wasn't aware that it would be um combined with the uh with the nightingale hospital if i'm wrong about that i will i will double check and i will um and i will come and come come back to you on that um if can i just say something just briefly on a couple of the other questions jimmy um back to um to jen's question it just it just reminded me uh that colleagues in the nhs because obviously this issue of self-isolation is a concern that colleagues in the nhs have had and you may remember jenna earlier in the year we provided hospital hospital hotel rooms uh for nhs staff who might find it hard to self-isolate at home i'm certainly aware that that's a call that's coming out from parts of the nhs again there are kind of people feeling that you know the support that was sort of provided earlier in the year is not is in short supply right now but actually they feel they need it even more so it just reminds me to put a bit of a call out to some in our our business community to see if there is any of that unused uh hotel capacity out there because i certainly know that the nhs may well be uh may well be needing it over over the coming months certainly december and january so it was just a uh jen just reminded me with her question um and justin i've got an answer to the josh question jimmy as well if that if that helps um this week i think was the first week on week reduction since late august um figures have been growing week on weeks since late august so uh that's that's the answer that i've been given so uh you know we can clear up any any discrepancies afterwards but i'm yeah colleagues in our stats team are pretty confident this is the first week on week reduction thank you for clearing that up andy and just the final two questions and they're both political questions the first at 248 is from michael gaffney at heart and smooth would you be prepared andy to work with the northern research group of conservative mps to get a better deal for the north through the pandemic and coming out of it what do you make of the campaigning they've been doing so far yes i welcome the establishments of the northern uh research group um you know i think it's um important that there are voices within the conservative party who are reminding the government nationally that leveling up and leveling up the north was a was a core kind of mission of this uh government and you know while this year wasn't the year that they were expecting and you know it's it's obviously been extremely challenging the reality is as we've heard today from the northern health science alliance we've been leveled down this year so there's just no getting away from that i'm not necessarily blaming the government completely for that because obviously the the inequalities in our country are you know predated this current government and the vulnerability to covet was greater in in parts of the north and obviously we've seen that happen but the question is what happens from here um and what is done about the report that's been published today what is done uh about areas in the north that might have to go back into tier three uh in in december what is then done in 2021 when we might be looking at a recovery um and plans for that recovery of course leveling up then has to come back and come back strong i've made the argument in recent days about manchester airport indeed other regional airports you know we're not going to be in a position to to get on with recovery as quickly as we would like if we're still seeing redundancies being made in in regional airports like uh like manchester we're going to be delaying that recovery if we're not if we're not careful but more than that i think we need to be laying plans now to see strong growth coming out of this coming out of this pandemic i think just to add i i don't want to be a permanent loggerheads with the government i would rather get back to a position where we are talking about how to make leveling up a reality um but given that we have been going backwards in recent times of course i've had to use my voice about that but if that means kind of working more with conservative mps in greater manchester and across the north as a whole to get focus within the government back where it needs to be and on delivering their kind of top manifesto commitment to level up then i'm more than happy to to work with them so i welcome um what they're doing uh i certainly do have the odd conversation with with jake berry and we we've always got on got on well i think you know what we need to to do is is recognize that um the north has been harder hit and the north is going to need more help and any mps from any side who are willing to work with us here in greater manchester to move that forward then then um you know my door is absolutely open and i'll be willing to work with them on that thank you andy then the final question for today is from nigel barlow at about manchester at 2 49 and nigel asks how did you feel andy about the prime minister's responses to secure stamina's questions at prime minister's questions today when he batted away his responses by simply reciting hands face space slogans is this the way to treat such an important issue i didn't see um the exchanges at nigel so i apologize um uh if i'm not able to give you a full answer one thing i do know is kia stammer asked the prime minister about the people who've been been denied support this year and um as far as i can work out there wasn't a full answer given to to that so if i was one of those people if i was one of those three million you know i think the business secretary seemed to dismiss the concern yesterday uh whenever the chancellor talks about this issue he sometimes implies that they're all well-paid company directors which is certainly not the case from the people i've spoken to uh it feels as though there's a bit of denial in the government about the large number of freelancers uh of people who are self-employed um younger people who are um perhaps newly self-employed new starters who've been left with nothing this year and also the issue of company directors i mean these are bare in mind people are often running their own mobile hairdressing businesses or plumbing businesses i mean they're not you know company director doesn't tell the full story and i think some have used that phrase against them to to um to sort of almost deny public support for what for what they're saying i don't see how you can say that this group of taxpayers are entitled to a significant amount of support 80 percent of their earnings but this group are frozen out completely i don't see how that is possible i don't see how that's possible certainly not morally politically you could question it because i don't think it would be helpful uh in terms of winning votes but actually legally is it is it legally um justifiable that uh some people have just been frozen out with nothing so i don't know whether the government did in equality impact assessments on some of the support schemes that they introduce but what what i do know is um whether they did or they didn't they've certainly left a lot of people um in a pretty desperate situation and i do know from the people i speak to that we now have a mental health crisis uh amongst some of those people excluded um along alongside this this pandemic so without having seen the answers at pmq's at nigel if i could just say that you know i am looking to the prime minister and the chancellor to give to show that they properly understand the position that those people are in and actually provide a more meaningful answer to them as to how they're going to help them get through this winter thank you andy that's uh no more questions great well thanks for joining us everybody thanks for your questions and we will see you all next week and thanks bev for joining us thank you thank you andy thanks everyone you
