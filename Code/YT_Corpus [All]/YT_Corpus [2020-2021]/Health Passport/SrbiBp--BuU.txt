 my name is Michael McFaul I'm the director of  the Freeman spogli Institute for International   Studies welcome back to our Friday at 1 o'clock  seminar series that we've been hosting over the   last several weeks since COVID we call it "COVID  And" and each week we move around to a different   Center at FSI to host a discussion this week the  Europe Center will be in charge we're going to   talk about covid in Europe we have a fantastic  lineup of people both local and from afar and   I'm talking a little bit long on purpose because  the numbers I see are climbing up that's a great   to see our moderator today will be Professor Anna  Grzymala-Busse so who is professor of political   science senior fellow at the Freeman Spogli  Institute and the director of the Europe Center.   over to you thank you Mike and welcome everyone  as Mike mentioned today we'll be talking about   Europe and the corona virus a pandemic has been a  crisis of governance not just in the United States   but also in Europe questions of who assumes  responsibility and which level of government   making what decisions have been paramount and so  to put the experience in a comparative perspective   we have four fantastic experts to us about how  Europe has responded to the pandemic first up is   Scott Greer from the University of Michigan and  an expert on both public health and the opinion   Scott is a professor at the School of Public  Health at the University of Michigan and the   author of four books and numerous articles  on European governance EU health policy and   territorial politics next we'll have Julie Lynch  from the University of Pennsylvania Julie is an   associate professor of political science and she  specializes in European politics in the welfare   state and specifically investment in health she's  also an advisor to the World Health Organization   has been a very active providing expert advice  to numerous organizations during this crisis   her most recent book regimes of inequality was  published this year next up will be Jonathan   rodent who is a professor in the Department  of Political Science at Stanford and a senior   fellow at the Hoover Institution he's an expert  on federalism and decentralization and his work   focuses on the complex ways in which political  representation intersects with demographics his   fourth book isn't why cities lose and focuses on  this very dilemma and finally Catherine stoner   is the deputy director and senior fellow of the  Freeman spogli Institute here at Stanford she's   an expert on Russia and our regional governance  and is currently finishing up a book on Russia's   influence an international affair so each of our  experts will speak for about 10 minutes please   feel free to ask any questions in the Q&A box  and I will compile those and we'll take it from   there so Scott if you would mind leading yourself  thank you very much and I'm thanks for my trip to   sunny California it's so much better climate  here so if I could get the first slide please   I'm gonna start with the story that's on the  second slide which is a little piece of paper   that Donald Trump was waving it when he was just  discovering the joys of press conferences on the   subject of phobic 19 and it's a little world  map and it's a heat map and it's the kind of   map we're accustomed to where the North Atlantic  is in yellow and Russia's in orange and Africa's   right right in this case it is back one please  it is compared as what Trump is waving around   is a Johns Hopkins comparative analysis of who  was prepared for a global pandemic it came out   in January to their credit it's still on their  website and it says that the United States is   the best prepared country to face a pandemic  with honourable mentions to a couple of others   including Sweden in the United Kingdom that's  not really how the world looks as of May what   did Johns Hopkins the World Economic Forum Davos  get wrong that led to Donald Trump simultaneously   having supposedly the world's best capacity  the Swedes and the British having supposedly   the world's best science and such totally  undesirable outcomes well there's obviously   striking differences between and within United  States and EU responses in both cases there's   been a straw a really impressive level of weakness  by what you would call the federal government the   United States federal government has failed on  multiple levels and we're going to be reading   analyses of how that went wrong for the rest of  our lives probably the European Union by contrast   just seemed to be missing in action you had to be  a professional European Union watcher for most of   January March April May so far in order to even  process that there was a European Union than it   was frantically attempting to have a role so  why was this next slide please if we think in   terms of comparative federalism which is not  a silly way to think about the EU first of all   the EU is often more resembles the United States  than it resembles its own Member States it's got   the system of enumerated powers so it can only  do the things that the treaties allow it to do   and much of you politics as in any Federation is  about precisely fights over what these enumerated   powers allow the European you need to do it's  also an extraordinarily complex political system   riddled with veto points riddled with weird  little bodies whose rules can be manipulated   and as a consequence it has a strong reliance  on creativity to get anything done so just as   we have book upon book about the United States and  how getting anything achieved in our legislative   process depends on unorthodox lawmaking you also  have book upon book about how the European Union   requires creativity to accomplish things now you  compare the two federal systems u.s. communicable   disease control has a very simple role it permits  everybody else to under invest so states don't   have to run an epidemiological research stations  Indonesia they don't even have to run particularly   good labs or have particularly good advice ditto  local governments but that federal leadership   only works when the White House intervenes and  knocks heads together so the u.s. depends on   the federal government and the federal government  depends on the White House that's the essentially   the origin of the failures we're seeing in  the u.s. today by contrast European citizens   do not expect the European Union to save them  they expect their national governments to save   them they instinctively focus on their national  governments European Union powers in the area   which are found under primarily civil protection  and public health articles of the treaty basically   allow for win-win solutions so the basic model  of European civil protection is that you have   an unexpectedly large forest fire I have spare  firefighting equipment I will send you some of   my spare firefighting equipment it grew out of  international aid effectively so what they did   is they took the model in which Italy can send  a search-and-rescue team to somebody who had an   earthquake on the other side of the world and now  Italy is also free to send the search and rescue   team to Greece this is the absolute minimum that  the member states could agree in order to solve   problems that were win-win or that they couldn't  manage on their own now this is for human health   one of the interesting things about the EU is  that if Co bid 19 were responsible for the mass   death of pigs or cows you'd see a very different  and much more forceful creature with powers to do   things like order mass culling of animals or close  national borders entirely but once the disease   jumps over into human beings the European Union  becomes a very tame creature now the argument   in the European Union has been about how much  communicable disease control the EU should do and   there's an agency with 300 people in Stockholm the  European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention   whose name is an homage to the US CDC but those  300 people obviously were not intended to compete   with the CDC's five-figure employees let's  five-figure roster of employees because they're   just supposed to coordinate data gathering build  capacity produce publications gradually nudge   Member States towards some Europeanized model of  understanding diseases and reporting data what   are the advantages that Europeans and Americans  see in a strong central capacity there's a number   of them first of all by sharing the expenses you  can have much stronger resources so the CDC is the   world resource for all sorts of esoteric diseases  because in the context of the United States one   agency can certainly afford a hantavirus research  lab it produces equity between jurisdictions one   of the things you're seeing in the EU right now is  everybody every member state is relying strongly   on its own internal capacity for advice and this  unsurprisingly is producing inequity if you happen   to be a country with one or two universities and  no great tradition of microbiology it reduces   centralization reduces the effects of destructive  competition so that you're not trying cuts a putt   save money by cutting budgets with individual  lines out of them and doesn't need to be too   expensive and it easily will show its value when  something goes wrong the disadvantage I put Donald   Trump the disadvantage is that building any  kind of capacity as the johns-hopkins model   shows you only works if the capacity is then  well used in an actual crisis and the question   is what would you misuse of a capacity look  like probably in action next slide please next slide please so this is a standard trick  in EU health policy circles this is the public   health article the EU depends on exercise of  enumerated powers that are listed and here we   have what article 168 allows the European you  need to do in public health it is a lexicon   of how you make sure the European Union isn't  going to push Member States around it gives the   lie to the brexit ear myth but the european union  inexorably expands its powers simply because the   member states wrote language that means that you  can encourage cooperation and complement member   states and coordinator monks themselves in liaison  with the commission they deliberately wrote an   article that would mean that justify by public  health the European Union would do very little it   would act in other areas next slide please so what  now will the European Union perceive advantages to   coordinating now John mone famously said that  Europe will be forged in crises and will be the   some of the solutions adopted for those crises  and it's the standard theory of how anything   in the EU develops that it goes through crises  now a more subtle version of that is the Jones   Kelman and many argued that the EU fails forward  that they produce a lowest-common-denominator deal   between states with diverse preferences and to  shared problems which then fails to manage the   broader underlying issue even if it addresses a  short-term thing that led them to do something   and so they agree on a new one and you can see  this in financial regulation their case but   you can also see recurrently crises that forced  member states to recognize that their level of   integration demands some kind joined EU action  they then do the worst possible version of EU   action because their preferences are diverse and  they're often skeptical of the European Commission   in particular gets them over the hurdle into  something else now the Member States might decide   that as they attempt to reopen in particular that  they need more European coordination because just   as we have no idea what to do when some American  states are buzzing with disease and others aren't   we also don't have a particularly good idea how  to run a continent where six or eight percent of   GDP depends on tourism if everybody's afraid to  travel let alone strawberry pickers from Romania   showing up in Western Europe there's a lot of  reasons why mobility of people is already built   into the European Union and in the absence of  good therapeutics or a vaccine we're going to   have to manage regional lockdowns individual data  and that's going to depend on a level of trust in   your neighbors data and your neighbors Public  Health mechanisms it currently does not exist   it was now desired by Member States it is still  not desired by Member States but there's a strong   chance that they're going to have to go in for it  and improve European data collection and European   resources simply because that's the best way to  get themselves to a situation where they actually   trust their neighbors so the place to look  for a public health action is primarily going   to be in things like improved data collection  standardization and pushing Member States to be   able to say with confidence that they do or do not  have an outbreak and they are or are not managing   thank you thank you very much Scott Julie would  you like to go next okay so I'm gonna try in ten   minutes to talk about the country level responses  to cope at 19 in European countries primarily in   Western Europe I'm gonna first kind of outline  very quickly what the policy response has been   and take a few cracks at maybe why those are why  that policy responses varied across countries then   I'm gonna show you a little bit about the health  outcomes that have been occurring as a result of   the pandemic in different countries and then I'm  gonna see if we can kind of try to connect those   two and as you'll see I'm a little bit skeptical  at this point okay so what has the policy response   been so the first thing I want to say is that the  policy response to Coba 19 that we first think   about is usually social distancing and sort of  restrictions on public events and mobility but I   think it's really important to recognize that the  policy response to Coba 19 in Europe just as it is   here is actually much broader than that so I want  to think about the policy response in four areas   so the first is this sort of familiar restrictions  on social life secondly we need to think about   what governments have been doing differently  in terms of testing and contact tracing which   is really critical to controlling the spread  of the disease thirdly there's a response that   takes place in the medical care system that's  worth paying attention to and fourthly there's   a series of economic interventions aimed at both  individuals and firms that are trying to kind of   keep the economy afloat and all four of these  things are really important to understanding   how the pandemic plays out I have a lot of  slides and I'm gonna go through them really   really quickly I don't need you to look at most  of the slides but I but they're there and so if   you need them I can go back to them but don't  be don't be concerned at the number of slides   okay so I'm gathering the data here on the policy  response from two main sources the Oxford coded   nineteen government response tracker the CG RT  and the European Observatory on health systems   and policies which has a coab in nineteen health  system response monitor these are both really   beautiful sources of data and I highly recommend  them okay so first area we want to look at is   social restrictions and really the main thing  that I want to say about social restrictions this   is the government stringency index from from that  Oxford data set and basically what you can see is   that there's variation over time and across place  within Europe but by late March there are really   only two real outliers Sweden and the UK seem to  be doing things that are a little bit different   from what other countries are going through and by  the very end of March the UK has to update some of   their social restrictions as well so by the very  end of March we can see a continent that's really   quite restricted in terms of social gatherings  mobility etc with the notable exception of Sweden   what's happening in terms of testing the graph  on the left simply shows how little testing is   being done anywhere in Europe compared to East  Asia and the antipodean countries but there's   still substantial variation across countries and  how much testing is going on and part of this has   to do with what the testing policies are that's  on the right-hand panel the the peach countries   that make up most of the Western Europe are  testing people who have symptoms and key   groups of people usually medical providers the  countries in teal are are testing anyone with   symptoms and the countries that are in blue which  are interesting to pay attention to we're looking   at Poland and Iceland and I'm gonna discount  the data to the east of Catherine say something   about was actually being tested there but in the  Western European countries it's really sorry did I   say Portugal Poland I meant Portugal Portugal and  Iceland are the two countries in Western Europe   that are really testing extensively and they're  gonna come back contact tracing kind of similar   story a lot of variation you're starting to see  the contact tracing being rolled back now sort   of in the right-hand panel we're seeing that both  you know we're seeing roll backs and the extent of   contact tracing both in places like Germany and in  places like the UK it's worth noting as a sort of   interesting feature of the data that Germany and  the UK are probably rolling back contact tracing   for different reasons it's happening in Germany  because they feel like they have the pandemic   under control it's happening in the UK because  they don't have it under control and they're   simply way too many contacts to trace so as we  think about using these data for future analyses   I think it's really important to keep an eye on  these kinds of subtle differences right medical   care provision and access there are lots of  different ways that this takes place essentially   European governments made changes to how they fund  their healthcare systems it made changes and how   people have access to their healthcare systems  made changes in how they get healthcare systems   actually work and treat different kinds of cases  there's a lot of variation across countries and   how this occurs including in terms of what  pre-existing resources there were and the   character magnitude timing and duration of the  interventions we still don't really have a firm   grip on what the cross national variation looks  like here except to say that there's a lot of it   finally in the area of economic intervention  similarly there are lots of different kinds   of interventions their supports to individuals  including you know cash transfers and extensions   unemployment benefits things of that nature  also supports two firms wage insurance policies   lifting of obligations to pay Social Insurance  Contributions etc and also direct interventions   through public employment again a huge amount of  variation and how this stuff is happening which   hasn't been thoroughly worked through I'm happy  to tell you that Clara Bamburgh at University of   Newcastle and I are making our way through all  of these data and we will soon house something   very intelligent to say about the variation  however you know the big question is why does   the policy response vary and I think you know our  best preliminary answer is that if you think about   what's happening in both the healthcare system  changes and and the economic policy response   it's pretty easy to see that kind of pre coded  19:00 political economy welfare and health system   models explain a fair amount of that variation as  best we can tell what is not explained so well is   this the social restrictions and the testing  and tracing and so that's where there's a lot   of surprise people looking at the policy response  and saying hey this doesn't look like we expect it   to look I think if we knew more about pre-existing  public health regimes we would we would see that   they're not quite as many surprises as as we might  think but research in this area is really severely   underdeveloped especially compared to research  on comparative Social Policy and comparative   health policy so that I think should be a prior  priority area for future research and Scott you   know we have this book that we still to write  on that we also should I think be looking to   more contingent political factors including the  partisan composition of government to understand   you know some of these shorter term shorter  term interventions that aren't so governed   by by prior political economic arrangements and  obviously we should be looking at interactions   among these things so for example if you have a  conservative led government and Sweden it's gonna   interact with a big generous welfare state but  you're gonna see different kinds of parameters   developing okay how's the pandemic doing got a  lot of excess deaths so right now excess deaths   are the only decent source of data they're the  only source of data that you should believe on   how the pandemic is proceeding because deaths  are measured and an incidence of the disease   are measured so differently across countries that  it's really impossible to compare right now what's   happening through anything other than looking  at excess deaths excess deaths are the number of   deaths that are being experienced usually measured  on a weekly basis that are in excess of what you   would normally see at that same time of year in  that same place and so here you can see a map of   the excess deaths and the main thing that I want  you to take away from this is simply that you know   by early April lots of countries in Europe are  experiencing excess deaths and and heavy excess   deaths those the darkest blue these data are from  the European mortality monitoring exercise which   is also an excellent outfit whose data I trust  very much I'm gonna show you a little bit of   detail here just to make it easier to see what  some of the variation looks like so if we look   at the UK and Ireland the height of that bump  over to the right is the is the standardised of   excess death in each of these places and what we  can see is that if we look at differences across   the UK and Ireland it's really England that's  experiencing a very high and sustained level of   excess deaths similarly the Nordic countries are  doing pretty well except for Sweden Sweden is a   big outlier southern Europe Spain France and Italy  doing poorly as you would know if you're reading   the news but Portugal and Greece have experienced  very little excess death so what is going on   there Germany and Austria seem to be doing pretty  well but Belgium and the Netherlands experiencing   a lot of excess death if we look at those high  mortality countries I just want you to get a sense   of what's the magnitude relative to each other  we're hearing a lot about Sweden which is the   bottom the bottom graph there and yes it's true  that Sweden is doing much worse than the other   Nordic countries but compare it to England and it  sure looks a heck of a lot better than England so   I think it's worth keeping keeping some of these  comparisons in mind - okay is there a connection   between the policy response and the access deaths  this is what we all want to know and this is what   comparative you know public policy researchers are  gonna be studying for the next 20 years so from   what I can tell so far as if you look at any given  point in time the social restrictions index which   is what most people are thinking about is not  highly correlated with excess deaths even though   there are some really juicy tempting outliers  that might make us think that they are namely   the UK and Sweden which have been less restrictive  and have experienced greater than expected excess   deaths secondly I think there is probably a case  to be made that early testing may be related to   less excess mortality Portugal and Germany seem  to be examples of this and I think as we dig into   the data we may find that early testing really  really matters finally when it comes to medical   care interventions and the economic interventions  I think it's really too early to know so I'm gonna   end with a slide that talks about some lingering  inferential issues so why should we be cautious   about making connections between the policy  response and the mortality outcomes that I   showed you so one reason is that we don't know  what the right lag structure is in other words   we don't really know how long it should take these  policy interventions to produce an influence on   mortality for the social restrictions 14 days  seems like it might be the right lag but for   some of these others we really don't know  secondly I think it's a mistake to you all   countries in Europe as having equally having been  equally exposed to the treatment of the pandemic   we can't think about this as a quasi-experimental  situation countries have exposed to the pandemic   in different ways and to different extents and  also of course at different times thirdly I think   we need to be really careful about thinking about  intervening variables so certainly when it comes   to the social distancing stuff the behavioral  response to government restrictions may actually   look quite different on the ground from what the  restrictions look like in practice so for example   there's cell phone data that shows that Swedes on  average are not being a lot more socially mobile   than Germans even though the German restrictions  were somewhat more stringent than in Sweden and   finally I suspect that there are many elements of  the precoded 19 context that probably influenced   both the policies that were made and the health  outcomes so things like how much austerity there   was prior to the crisis what the organizational  culture within public health looks like and how   easily public health experts communicate  with with central government officials and   the levels of trust in government which may help  to determine things like the behavioral response   so I think there's a lot that we don't know about  the connection between policies and outputs and I   think you know we have to be really careful about  telling stories when we don't know what those   stories really are that sad I know this story  that's probably on most people's mind is Sweden   and I am willing to take a crack at Sweden in the  Q&A all right what what I'd like to talk about is   is the is making a broad comparison between ways  in which the Europe and the United States appear   to be different for people who know me it's not  surprising that I would want to make some maps   and talk a little bit about political geography so  that's what I'm gonna do here and I'm gonna talk   about the the the geography of the virus as well  as the underlying political geography and see if   that helps understand it helps us understand some  some broad differences in the way they think that   happened in different countries the question I  am going to try to answer or at least at least   introduce is why is the pandemic so partisan in  the United States why has it become wrapped up   in political into into a political you know the  polarization between two parties I don't think   I need to go into too much detail about this I  think people have been paying attention they've   probably seen some of these studies suggesting  that from the beginning in the United States   we've seen strong partisan differences in in  in survey response between people's level of   concern about the virus about support for various  mitigation policies and behavior so all of the   data on mobility from from cell phones suggests  a robust partisan difference even when we control   for a lot of things in Europe this is something  that you know I don't have nearly the same kind   of data and perhaps this is wrong and I'd love  what if people would try to correct me on this   my sense is that there's been a lot of partisan  bickering over the quality of the response so you   know in a place like Spain it is it is this is  a good issue for the partido popular to to use   against the Socialists in complaining that the  response was was insufficiently strong or wasn't   wasn't as effective as it should have been and  I think there's also a similar you know there's   less enthusiasm for shut down it's just as in the  United States in places where the virus has been   has where the spread has been limited that's  something that we see everywhere and I think   me a pro business interest groups and parties  have tried to lobby to to relax the shut downs   earlier that's kind of and the kind of really  extreme rhetoric about the virus being a hoax   is something that we see maybe on the fringes  of the far-right like the afte and Germany but   it seems to me that that we don't see I can't  think of a European country in which this deep   polarization about whether the virus is something  that is serious or not whether it's something that   should whether whether government has a role to  play and combating the virus the kind of the kind   of fights that we're having between the parties  in the United States about about mitigation it's   something I don't think we've seen on the same  scale and Europe and so that's not the question   that I'm trying to understand is why this why this  difference one possibility I want to lay out is   that there's been something kind of unique in the  United States about the intersection of the the   geography of the virus and partisan Geographic  polarization that of course preceded the virus   and the way there's overlays with the nature  of federalism and decentralization so this is   a graph of this is just from from yesterday's  data county-level graph in the United States on   the y-axis on the vertical axis we have coma 19  deaths per 100,000 people and on the horizontal   axis is the log of population density of the  county and so you can see that there is a very   strong correlation between population density and  the and the emergence of the virus and you know   the biggest and the sizes of these data markers  are the size of the population just to give you   a sense of that so obviously the virus emerged  in places like New York City and and the cases   and the deaths are overwhelming we are really  dominated by by New York but also we saw the   operatic in New York and I mean in New Orleans and  Wayne County Detroit in a few other places like   that and that really kind of shaped everyone's  understanding from the very beginning of the   virus it really emerged in the United States as an  urban problem just as just to give you the latest   though so that was just total I was in there the  total deaths up until May 14 what you might be   interested in knowing is what hap this happened  just in the last week like what's the most recent   this so this is really changing and you probably  read some things about this in the newspaper the   virus has spread in the United States from the  urban core to the suburbs and now starting to   move to rural areas so these are Cova deaths per  100,000 since May 6 so just basically in the last   week and you can see it's actually shifted to  rural places so a lot of the new outbreak now   it's not in the urban core but it's in rural  places but I want to just highlight that um if   you if you take a look at these counties and you  figure out what's going on in these places most   of these have a federal prison or a state prison  they have a meatpacking plant of some kind and   in there for the remainders the vast majority of  the deaths are in nursing homes so just kind of   keep that in mind as we as we go forward but you  know so anybody who's read my work on this kind   of thing knows this is kind of where I'm going  the correlation between population density and   voting in the United States is just incredibly  high this is something that is is you know we see   population we see this correlation in most places  but it's much stronger it's really quite quite   pronounced in United States and this correlations  been increasing ever since ever since the New Deal   it's been especially especially increasing since  the Reagan administration so partisanship and   population density are basically the same thing in  the United States this is an overwhelming cleavage   on which our party system is based so you put  that together with the urban incidence of the   virus and then you get something like this that  the correlation between between the Democratic   vote share and Cova deaths per 100,000 citizens  is is also it's also very strong correlation again   you know this is shifting so now in the last  week it's shifting to more Republican places   but still you know the overall relationship looks  like this and so I think a better way to look at   this is just taking the cumulative share of deaths  divided by different kinds of counties according   to their partisanship so this is from the very  beginning starting in March and then going up   to until yesterday and so much you can see here  in the blue line is that is that you know at the   beginning the deaths were overwhelmingly occurring  in places where the Democrat no chair was above   60% so this is Seattle New York and Detroit and  New Orleans and so forth but over time of course   that has fallen and the accumulative share of  deaths in more competitive places between 40   and 60% many of these are more suburban kinds of  areas now that is really increased and then sort   of leveled off but then the places that are very  Republican which is mainly rural places have been   pretty low and pretty flat there's not really  a very big increase there so it's just pretty   striking how how partisan has been the how the  how the geography of the of the virus has been   correlated with partisanship and I think that  has created a situation in which from the very   beginning you know that the Republican Party is  essentially a rural and exurban coalition in a   public health crisis emerged in cities and the  reaction of the you know essentially of rural   coalition to an urban public health crisis was  to let let the state and municipal officials   deal with it and so we ended up with this sort of  sort of decentralized patchwork response that has   kind of come to characterize the the US so I want  to see how this looks in Europe because I think   Americans have kind of we've got a cusp accustomed  to this idea that that you know virus and density   go together and it's really all about density and  some level that's there maybe there is truth to   that but when we start looking around the world  it's much more complicated so here's some data   I put together from the from the the Christ  level the county level in Germany and you can   see that the the cases per capita and desperate  capita are really concentrated in Bavaria and   Baden württemberg in the south of the country the  breakout in in Germany came from people returning   from ski trips in particular locations and you  can see that in the east and getting much of the   northern part of the country that still hasn't  been very much of a very much viral spread and   and you can probably also see anybody who knows  Bavaria knows these are not densely populated   places and so the correlation between density and  deaths per 100,000 is actually negative in Germany   and you know there's really not a very strong  correlation at all but to the extent there is have   been more deaths in more rural places now rural  Germany anybody who spent time in rural Germany   it's much more dense that people live in much more  dense conditions than they do in the rural United   States and that's true throughout Europe I mean in  small town your office and some in some settings   is is relatively dense and the same thing was true  in parts of Italy but you know Germany also does   have a correlation between density and voting this  is not unknown to Germany and so we can see here   there is a correlation between density and the  left vote share here I'm adding the SPD the greens   and the Left Party not quite as strong as in the  United States but there's certainly a relationship   there but you know but in Germany because because  the the virus really emerged in Bavaria and bottom   40 places that are really the where this where  the Union parties the Christian Democrats and the   Christian social Union are strong we see that the  the deaths are really are concentrated in places   where the laughter was less successful and so I  think it's important to note that you know we had   a grand coalition of the SPD and the Christian  Democrats at the federal level and in some ways   this might have been a fortuitous thing this is  really quite different than the United States   where we essentially have a rural coalition at  the federal level with the emergence of an almost   initially almost exclusively urban public health  crisis whereas in Germany you have a crisis as   much more diffuse it's not really concentrated  in the in its extended its concentrated assume   that in the actual of the largest party in the  governing coalition in their base is where the   where their virus emerges but you know they also  we have a grand coalition between these two major   parties so the whole idea of blame shifting and  all of the kind of you know the the desire to   kind of shift the blame and the responsibility  on to lower levels of government really didn't   emerge in the same way in Germany and all the  parties are represented in all the various long   governments the state level governments anyway and  so it's really very different political dynamic I   want to move on quickly and get to get to  get to Katherine but also just looking at   Italian provinces and I'd like to put together  some data from some additional countries and I   think we need to get the only data that to me are  very useful or at low levels of aggregation even   the US counties to me are really too big I'd like  to get Trax level data and and really explore the   question of population density that way but at the  province level which is the best I could do so far   in Italy again there's no real correlation I mean  if anything it's kind of medium density places the   virus in Europe by and large with the exception of  like Madrid is an exception even within Catalunya   Barcelona was not really the the worst hit  places even smaller towns in Catalunya this   American concept of you know concentrated deaths  in the urban core is probably driven a bit more   by the concentration of poverty in the urban core  in US cities and we just don't see that in Europe   until really it's not the case that the virus was  concentrated in plate you know in particular big   cities in Italy either and so it doesn't you know  it's it's concentrated in the north I think as   everyone knows and of course German Italy does  have an interesting kind of political division   recently it's interesting to to note that you  know in the place where the where the virus was   it really was emerged most strongly are the places  where the where the the center left and the center   right are really are really competing and so  at the moment of the emergence of the crisis   Thursday if there is a coalition between five star  and and the and the center left but but the center   right of course these parties especially you  know the sabe nice party the is is controlling   the regional governments in places like Lombardia  and Veneto and so I think again you don't have the   same kind of kind of stark divide and the same  incentives for blame shifting maybe you have a   little bit of that in Italy I'd like to hear more  from people who know more about it maybe Julie has   some thoughts on this but if anything the it's the  kind of the quality of the response in Veneto has   raised the political prospects of the president  of Veneto who is now perhaps in a position to   challenge salvini on the right who he's trying  to play this kind of anti-immigrant and anti-eu   card and it also trying to claim that the shutdown  has gone too far and it seems like that is not you   know that's not been a winning strategy for him  so I think these kinds of you know these kinds   of factors of course they vary from one country to  another these are just a couple I'd love to talk   more about Spain as well but the yeah I'm gonna  leave you with this thought here that that we   just didn't see the virus emerge in a way that  mapped on to McDonalds perfectly onto a strong   partisan divide in Europe that's just not the  way it emerged and in part because he just you   know multi-party systems with kind of complex  coalition dynamics you just don't have anything   like the American two-party polarize divide and  so in the u.s. it's the case that the devadutt   the virus kind of really kind of crashed into an  existing divide of this kind it's really I think   a big part of the story for why the US has looked  so different from from Europe in the nature of its   response and the reason why it's been so partisan  why it's so difficult for the u.s. to come up with   with it with a strategy to move forward I think  I will stop there great thank you very much   Jonathan and since we've talked about polarize  democracies and multi-party democracies it's   time to talk about non democracies so Katherine  can you talk about Russia please you can hear me   and see my screen great okay so right it leaves  me to talk about Russia and I'll try and do it   relatively quickly because I think there are a  few key questions and a few key parallels between   the previous cases and in between Russia although  in some ways Russia as can be the case off on its   own so I'm just starting with a quick picture  of mr. Putin picking up the handling Russia's   response in March to coronavirus theory of shaking  hands with the head doctor of one of the main   at that time main hospital handling coronavirus  patients notice not only is there no mass between   a on either of them no protective gear what so  long whatsoever so started out with a bit of a   Cavalier response Russia had relatively low rates  as we'll see things change by shoot now why are   my okay here we go alright so I thought it would  be useful to just take a quick look here at how   Russia compares to other countries you may have  seen in the New York Times or elsewhere that the   rankings every day in Russia is number two so in  a way it's at coronavirus superpower I suppose I   was regaining great power status that way but as  you can see it's a very very distance number two   to the United States in terms of total cases share  the population is one in five hundred and seventy   three that's also pretty low comparatively but if  you look in its neighborhood back into Europe the   actual total number of cases is is not terribly  different it's it's the I'd say share a population   not terribly different from Turkey which is not  far away obviously it's the death rate that is   what I think intrigues people why is Russia's  death rate comparatively low so low relative   to others and and so the typical answer if we  were live I would ask you and you would all say   oh well we get there under reporting there lying  that Putin he's an evil genius and here he goes   again well that's undoubtedly partially correct  he there's probably inaccurate reporting putting   it kindly but the one of the real reasons is the  way that it is reported and what is counted as a   CO vid caused death is different in different  countries so as it turns out so Russia is one   of the more can servitor places and you the  health ministry directive is that I read it   to you in the absence of clinical manifestations  and pathological changes sounds better in Russian   especially in the lungs so it is not Kovan counted  unless it is clear that that is the only cause of   death so that's different then elsewhere so if you  had leukemia or you know any other form of cancer   and you got Co vyd you wouldn't necessarily  in Russia be counted as as dying of the kovat   you'd be dying of your underlying disease by the  way that they classify deaths so that partially   accounts for the difference is I in a second I'll  show you give you a little tour of the world of   the world around Russia and see how it compares  but so that's that's part of it if we counted   mortality in the same way for example that we  do in the US and this has been calculated by   a couple of different people you you would have  about two hundred and thirty three percent more   cases death cases than Russia then then Russia is  reporting so really closer to the German rate or   Iran that is about seven thousand dead as opposed  to twenty three hundred and five that are reported   up there and that'll give you a closer to a to 2  to 3 percent death rate rather than what Russia   is reported of 0.09 so it's not all corruption  but it but that's certainly that could be part   of it in a second I'll explain Russian federalism  and the incentives to underreport are certainly   great but it's also it's also this style of  reporting the other thing is that they will   apparently change this in the next few weeks  and some regions have struck out on their own   and and changed the way they report it to make  it seem more in line with the rest of the world   so it's not just as is so often the case in  Russia it's not always what you think it is   or what you assume it is you know so this just  gives you a sense from early March through May the neighbors the neighborhood and how things  are going and Julie had mentioned I would try   and just get rid of this I can there we go Julie  had mentioned that I would I would show you this   quickly so I will there's this intriguing pattern  you may see the farther east you go the lower   seems mortality not entirely sure why that's  the case the virus came a little bit later to   Eastern Europe but look at this Kazakhstan this is  case fatality rate is low here's Russia and as I   mentioned 0.9% it would be the mortality rate  the way they're counting I think it's safe to   say in Central Asia they're using the same form  of counting and then as we start going west you   can see the numbers going up higher again coming  later than other parts of the world by Hungary   particularly high okay so here we are looking  a little more deeply into Russia Jonathan had   talked about population density and I'm going  to talk about that in a moment as well that's   undoubtedly another reason why we see perhaps  some variation in incentives of reporting but   the number of coronavirus cases in Russia really  started to kick up here and the first second week   of April and have gotten up to about the the 252  253 thousand number as of today what's intriguing   is the new cases that are reported is relatively  flat but it's about 10,000 a day right now so   they're not on a good trajectory unless they do  something radically different the initial state   response was as is noted here this non-working  period people were first given a week of paid   vacation and that's when we saw the most of  President Putin getting some good news as and you   can all go on vacation don't come back happen to  be around the Orthodox Easter period so Pew like   that and that was important in regions start going  into lockdown at about this period Putin goes into   what sort of lockdown himself in that he goes out  to his country home just outside Moscow and seems   to say there and begins to pass the responsibility  of handling the coronavirus down and this is where   we also bring up the theme of federalism just  just as it's been raised in some of the other   countries so this is just a quick map Russia is  the largest country in the world territorially   and it has lots of external borders 14 highest  number of external borders and so you would think   that would mean especially since we have a border  out here with China that you would see more cases   here in Eastern and the Far East of Russia we  don't really most of the cases are that I have   been reported are concentrated in in Moscow  Moscow the city of about nine million people   so that is really where they where everything  it's focused we have a few little random places   like Dagestan what Imams could that have idiocy  is kind of idiosyncratically high cases which   I can talk about later if anybody happens to  be interested why is it disproportionately in   Moscow Jonathan talked about population density  may or may not make a difference I think that's   probably what does make the difference here in  Moscow and also some not terrific initially as   that first picture that I showed you of Putin as  shaking hands with the doctor at the end of March   in the cogut Hospital so not good quarantine  practices initially but then then picking up   better practices as time goes on there's a huge  variation in Russia in wealth and capacity to   deal with the virus so Moscow I was listening in  on a talk yesterday at Columbia where there you   know she pointed out that the regional the  speaker pointed out that the regional gross   regional product in Moscow is you know roughly  equal to cutters whereas in Dagestan you know   it's equal to the Gambia's so it's these are this  tremendous variation in capacity and there's no   means-testing in most government response at this  point so Moscow will get as much as Dagestan what   is the state response well as I said Russia is  a huge country technically it's federal but it   has functioned more unitary in practice as of late  mr. Putin after that rather spectacular opening of   visiting the hospital I'll show you another shot  of that in a second devolved authority over coded   to Russia's regions they're about eighty nine of  those they sometimes they merge they go apart they   come back together he appointed a very capable  mayor of Moscow some Union the head of the co-ed   task force and so he's gotten to deliver all bad  news so far not Putin himself Putin delivered the   good news this week on Monday of opening the  country coming out of a crazy strict in many   places shelter in place where you could only  go 100 meters from your apartment building to   walk your dog in downtown Moscow for example and  regional governors have been tasked with Beijing   basically managing their own regions response so  we're getting kind of a you know a competition for   for PPE and that sort of thing but Moscow you saw  the disproportionate numbers there that is really   where the virus is hitting the hardest Putin has  not been appearing day to day except star you   come out of his little cave this week his first  national address is March 27th he just started as   I said to look more in charge he's actually in the  zoo meetings that have been shown he looks kind of   bored and a little restless although it's got a  great gym out there I'm sure he's fine everyone   there was some suspicion that he might have kovat  especially after that handshake that I opened   with he doesn't but the Prime Minister of Russia  whose name I bet nobody knows but a few of us here   Masood seen he is actually infected with Corona  as so it's dmitry peskov who is Putin's spokesman   longtime spokes and and three other members of the  Russian cabinet so it's it's hit pretty close to   him but we don't think it's hitting him yet or  and probably won't given where he is there has   been financial relief from the federal level but  it's been kind of selective and coincidentally   has been hitting people who are more likely  to be pro-regime than anti-regime so state and   public sector workers are getting the most help  if if they are losing their jobs or in danger of   losing their jobs they'll get paid until the end  of 2020 some very just because Anna's here on the   line sort of populist policies I think in terms  of trying to take care of people financially and   anticipate some of the economic issues banks are  giving repayment vacations on loans and mortgages   higher taxes for money sent out of the country  families with small children medium and small   businesses though are not getting as much help  so here he is getting a little more serious with   the state response and I don't know if we'll see  Donald Trump put on a full hazmat suit but this   is Vladimir Putin trying to encourage people and  press upon them how serious the virus is but then   leaves shaking hands with the doctor who brought  him in socio-economic effects so in a Levada poll   which is the reliable polling about 44% of the  population say life has not changed for them   this week or forty five percent of those polled  I should say 21 percent able to work from home   mainly 15 percent unpaid 1% fired so that's pretty  low for 4% have gone to part-time work and 8% are   on some sort of paid leave or forced vacation  time seventy percent of Russian families have   no more than six weeks of savings that's probably  pretty similar to the United States 735,000 have   registered as unemployed a third of the economy  stopped they may get up to about 10 percent   unemployment by the end of this year maybe more  real wages are most problematic because they are   going down another five percent and over the  last seven years or so this has been a problem   even though the economy the economy's come in and  out of recession before this started it had modest   really modest growth of you know maybe two three  percent but real wages were going down and they're   going to go down further so Putin actually really  depends on a certain segment of the population and   he's particularly dependent on them right now  because the context has been him trying to get   a referendum through that will enable him to  stay in power for another twelve years beyond   when this term ends so he would stay in power  until 2036 potentially if if this referendum on   constitutional changes went through so this could  be why they opened up the country it was really   popular he announced that personally 80% of people  are in favor of getting the country rolling again   and it may also explain why he didn't take  sole charge of the Kovach response which is   getting sort of tepid national embrace and his  approval has been going down so governors are   getting better ratings than federal authorities  and including Putin on handling Kovach probably   because people see them out and about and doing  things that they're not seeing him do that until   very recently thank you very much we're almost out  of time there are sort of two sets of questions   that kept coming up Sophie a minute advance the  first one and the Sweden and why what are the   projections for the Swedish trajectory second  question is for you Katherine which is about   not so if a very brief discussion of  Sweden and then the change in Russia   okay I'll say something about Sweden I can't  project what's gonna happen Sweden I really don't   know but I can tell you what I think happened so  I think the big question that people have is did   the relatively loose social distancing policies  in Sweden lead to the higher access death rates   and I think the answer to that is yes and no so  the government justified it's looser policies   by saying that it trusted its population to do  what it was recommended but didn't need to tell   them you know didn't need to make rules and  on average it seems that from cellphone data   seems that the population did comply the excess  deaths that Sweden experienced have been mainly   in nursing homes and so the question is like  what's the what's the common thread here the   common thread I think is that there was a group  of people in Sweden who didn't really comply   from what we can tell and who experience  much higher incidence of the disease and   that is non ethnic Swedes so racial and ethnic  minorities in Sweden have been much harder hit   by the disease they also are much more likely  to work in nursing homes so I think that the   answer to the swedish puzzle may in fact be  that it's a failure of social and economic   integration of racial and ethnic minorities  rather than the loose policies per se that   have created a higher death rates in Sweden  right Catherine Catherine you have 30 seconds you and you okay hopefully you can hear me so it's  actually not just Russia that does this other   countries do it too and I guess that you know I  don't know enough about medical statistics and   and how they are reported but Russia also has a  much higher rate for example of doing autopsies   than the rest of Europe so I know I think  it's Belgium that has a very very liberal   way of counting coronavirus cases and Russia's  on the more conservative and of counting them   they are allegedly going to bring the the  way they've they've done it into alignment   with with European area more international  standards and so we may see the mortality   rate go up there but it's still I think you  know population density is partially what's   driving things down but but I think it's not  just Russia that does this other places do   it too wonderful things and to all of you  for joining the conversation Mike doing I   have to say I finally know great wonderful  Nucky's thank you very much and stay safe
