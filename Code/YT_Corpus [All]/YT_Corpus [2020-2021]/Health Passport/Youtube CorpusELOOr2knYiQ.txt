 this morning the news that the uk has approved the fisa vaccine is being closely watched by americans many of them have questions many experts have concerns michael osterholm serves on president-elect biden's covet 19 advisory board i have a major fear many americans won't take them because of the fear that there are some safety issues with the vaccine with the uk preparing to roll out vaccines next week and the u.s close behind polling suggests 58 percent of americans are likely to get vaccinated but 42 percent of americans say they won't even some frontline medical workers are cautious a recent poll by the american nurses foundation says that a third of nurses say they'll get the vaccine a third say no the rest are unsure i think we're feeling a little reticent to step to the front of the line right now according to the who around 70 percent of the us need the covet vaccine to achieve community immunity but public opinion may not make that possible vaccines became a hot political topic because the vaccines were me and were developed incredibly fast the process of the speed did not compromise at all safety nor did it compromise scientific integrity so i really want to settle that concern that people have about that a pew research center poll found that this year saw a huge drop in vaccine confidence with doubts surrounding the influx of vaccine information differing results possible side effects concerns over being the first in line at this morning's news conference uk health officials reassuring the british public because those strict tests have been done and complied with and everyone can be absolutely confident that no corners whatsoever have been cut heidi larsen has spent decades understanding why some people hesitate and others oppose vaccinations i think we've created such polarization across society well beyond vaccines but vaccines have certainly been a victim of the polarization now she heads a cutting-edge team in london called the vaccine confidence project she says covet vaccines need to be explained to people there's been a lot of attention to fast fast fast warp speed but the reality is they're faster because we have new technologies and now is a time to be talking to people about these different things they aim to combat the influence of anti-vaccine groups active around the world and largely unregulated on social media a recent study found 31 million people following anti-vaccine groups on facebook 17 million on youtube heidi lawson also advises facebook on how to counteract growing vaccine misinformation online but she says the answer isn't simply closing accounts or confrontation you can't delete doubt you can't believe that yes i don't think conflict is is gonna resolve this i think it's going to aggravate it we do need a listening ear and if you are having doubts a good place to go the cdc website itself break there is a clear link there with lots of questions answered about vaccines craig hey kier you you mentioned a survey there in your story showing that one-third of nurses won't get the vaccine do we have any idea what's behind that hesitancy well it's a really great great question remember that the pharmaceutical companies are still publishing their data so i think many health workers are experts in a way and they're waiting to see the data before they can say that they are fully confident so those numbers may change meanwhile the ad council craig is about to spend 50 million dollars on a campaign to give people more information so we're going to see things shift people are hoping they shift a good deal as the vaccines roll out indeed you
