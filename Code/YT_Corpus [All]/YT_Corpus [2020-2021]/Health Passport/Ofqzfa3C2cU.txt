[Music] let me tell you a secret there was actually one cent that I liked the very most but it's a little more manly than I think I wanted it overall or the project they're working on so I went to my second favorite which by the way was pretty much everybody else's favorite since I mostly just like man smells apparently but it was my very second favorite so that was the one we picked which ultimately I'm super glad by it because every time I wear this they have sent me like an actual oil bottle that I wear all the time now and people freak out they just tell me I smell good they notice which is even more interesting because that tells me how good it is [Music] when is making her dish this might be the coolest thing I've ever done in my life her specific shade [Music] hey everybody it's been a wild and crazy' two weeks of travel to McKnight home starting first with me over Father's Day Mindy and the kids gave me probably the coolest gift I've ever been given except for you know

great time together but we had to leave early because we had to get back to our Airbnb down in LA we got up the next morning and went to breakfast and after that we drove down to UCLA where he watched UCLA play a college football game against San Diego State we had the lead partway through the end of that game to get across town in time to go watch the USC Trojans beat Stanford so another college football game in the same day and right before that on the jumbotron we watched BYU beat Tennessee in overtime so that was a pretty amazing day and then Sunday morning we woke up we went to church and after church we had waffles and chicken and then we drove over to the NFL game that was in town the San Diego Chargers had just moved to LA they didn't have a stadium so we went the galaxy soccer stadium where they were playing the Indianapolis Colts that was a really fun and exciting game it went to overtime but I had to leave before the fourth quarter because I had to get back to the airport
