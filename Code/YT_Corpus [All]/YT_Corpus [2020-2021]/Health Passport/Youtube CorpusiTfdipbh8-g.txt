thank you for getting up for us this morning we enjoyed uh talking with you thanks for the laugh all right if you're in need of a few laughs plus a little girl power we've got just the thing we sure do check out the new movie like a boss it's about two best friends who run a cosmetics company but the beauty business gets ugly when a makeup mogul tries to buy the company that's on the hike's role earlier we caught up with this terrific cast it was tiffany haddish rose byrne selba hayek jennifer coolidge and billy porter who gave us a sneak peek take a look oh oops action i'm clara luna i am going to invest 1.7 million dollars on you we would love a million dollars who is the bossiest boss in this crowd selma what the lighting is not right the lighting is making the shadows the makeup you need more cheeks more give does it surprise you that she's already come over and done our makeup you did that already okay that's what we're saying in the greatest maternal way it's bossy like your mama is boxing uh-huh what was your first job um i sang and danced six shows a day at a local amusement park i was the dessert girl at the hard side restaurant parked at a curry restaurant uh indian restaurant curryworld a legal job or like where i pay taxes or where i was paid under the first one whatever it was okay first job was babysitting straight up but then where i pay taxes doing bar and bought how was it it was amazing it was super fun the party was popping and people were shocked that i actually could speak hebrew wait let's can you [Laughter] we need to try something new let's judge it up a little bit did you just say jesh yeah what i loved about this movie too is it's about y'all's characters who make each other feel you're not perfect yeah but you make each other feel like you're enough well i think what's beautiful and you see it in the movie it's to have a support team of girls that inspire you in different ways i do have that i've been describing it as a buddy movie with women you know it's like this movie exists because of these boss ladies the best way to see it is to have a girls night out and go with a bunch of girls and that means you too though [Laughter] tell me your character is terrifying scary you are how did you this woman is nasty that is honestly the hair everything wait she's what did you say fear fierce listen to the word fierce fierce what is it saying to you i hear fear dean erst i made it up without knowing i actually said that's how you pronounce it and they just kept making fun of it and went with it wait wait firing you is not my idea hey witness my tragic moment that scene was pretty powerful like were you ever fired from a job did you know that feeling um i've been fired once so that's what i actually did draw from okay jennifer what is it about this role that was so much fun well i was the only character in the movie that was wearing old age makeup [Laughter] you know i did i had all these old age prosthetics and i think it was just sort of silly stuff rose we were just talking about kids actually two children too i was trying to figure out like sometimes we figure like how are we going to do it you know with our jobs and all that stuff have you figured out the kind of rosetta stone no this situation not at all we're not talking about you know juggling for any parent it's like you know and they couldn't care less if you're busy like no give me what i need now you know they're the boss really we have to talk about tiffany's sunday potluck and literally the first day this one was like you coming to sunday potluck you know and it was got this house and i and i just thought then it'd be cool to have everyone come over and you cook your favorite dish or bring your favorite thing and we all just spend time together because the movie is about friendship right it was so funny at the end of the movie you all break out in the present was that you all singing yeah [Music] welcome back next guest emmy award winner comedy star she's always ready she had us cracking up in a breakout movie girls trip and now tiffany haddish is taking on a very different role in the new drama of the kitchen she's playing a mob wife alongside melissa mccarthy and elizabeth moss we need to talk you're over jackie i'm gonna pretend i didn't hear that yeah say it louder i told you he wasn't going to do nothing tiffany good morning good morning so what's going on here we can't repeat any of it you can't repeat any of what was just going on no we can't but so tiffany when they said okay we want you to be in a mob movie play an irish mob wife what was your first okay here's the thing okay they didn't want okay they probably did want me but they didn't know that they wanted me until i showed it okay let me just put it like that i read the script i happened to come across the script and i was like this is great i need to be in this this is my type of life right here this is what i grew up in this environment and so um everybody's like oh you're a comedian we don't know and i was like oh no let me meet the director i need to meet andrea byrd office so then i had started like a campaign or a hunt if you make to get a hold of her and you were still with her yeah i was stalking her basically it to see you in this role was incredible but i i was thinking what was it like behind the scenes because it's a very serious movie how much joking was going on a lot off-camera we were playing a lot like it was so funny because we would be like cracking jokes and stuff and then they'd be like action and we'd be dancing right and like i was uh trying to get the girls to try all kind of new stuff like uh uh well it's not new to me but might be new to them like i like pickles with kool-aid with more pickles yeah you put you dipped you dipped the pickle in the kool-aid uh you know yeah it's delicious sweet and tart how did you discover that yeah you know that's some good stuff from when i was a kid you know you like got to make your own candy because we got clean here and kool-aid powder what can we do we can sell it for 10 cents in a bag anyway what was it like working you know melissa mccarthy elizabeth moss what was it like working with them it was so much fun working with them and it was also like a crash course in like the upper echelons of acting you know those women are super dope actresses it develops their character so tough and i always think like yeah i know my character's backstory and everything but we would have these conversations about it and i'm just like oh this is how you act okay like so i was learning so much from both of them also about online shopping we did a lot of that are we are we witnessing the evolution of tiffany haddish by that i mean i came to know you years ago i was a huge deaf comedy jam fan and i saw you on different i was like she is and so we've seen this tiffany addis issues absolutely hilarious and in this role not to give away too much this is not the tiffany haddish we've come to know is this are you are you turning uh first off i'm [Music] range multi-faceted in and throughout here okay i'm like a onion peel back a layer new flavor you
