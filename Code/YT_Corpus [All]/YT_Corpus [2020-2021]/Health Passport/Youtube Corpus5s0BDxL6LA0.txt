 turning now to our series across the platforms of nbc news focused on a race for a vaccine so from the very start bill gates has devoted not only his time but also his money to finding a solution that's right as someone who has been involved in health initiatives around the world for years now gates foundation has now contributed 450 million dollars to the global covet 19 response he famously warned about a global pandemic back in 2015 in a ted talk we first sat down back in april when we were just weeks into the pandemic and still figuring it out well now with at least one vaccine approved in the uk already and hopefully several green lights to come here in the u.s we spoke again about where things stand and where they're going it feels like we're in that dreaded second wave we're in that dark winter how are you looking at how we're handling this well it's a paradoxical situation because things are getting worse right now and so the next four or five months actually look pretty grim unless we can really double down on our behavior uh but the tools both treatment tools like antibodies and some of these amazing vaccines will start to roll out and by the spring those numbers will be big enough that it that certainly in the united states it'll start to change the numbers dramatically and you know we'll be headed headed back to normal it's the classic it's always darkest before the dawn but we have it in our power to make it less dark what would be your message to people well the most impactful thing is associating people less you know wearing a mask uh wherever you might be exposed to someone outside your household uh you know the projections show that we could save of the several hundred thousand lives that are projected to be lost in these months ahead 50 000 of those would be saved if we had high mass compliance the obvious bright spot here is the race for the vaccine obviously pfizer just had approval in the uk it's seeming to be on the verge of approval here in the u.s moderna another vaccine hot on its heels if someone had told you in a year we would have a vaccine for a virus we didn't even know existed a year ago what would you have thought it's unheard of and even when we saw the antibody results for these vaccines we didn't know how effective they would be it looks like almost all the vaccines are going to succeed it is a great science uh great industrial uh manufacturing great great cooperation even across countries so you know this is a war where we're all in it together when you saw that 90 percent plus effective rate did your jaw drop no that was phenomenal uh that was absolutely at the high end of expectations this is a a a great vaccine so that's great for covid and it's great for other vaccines as well as exciting and promising as it is do you have any hesitance or reservations about the way some of this information is rolling out well the we are moving quickly but the fda has a very uh clear review process and i would say they uh avoided being pressured to cut corners on that some of the earlier things you know where they approved hydroxychloroquine or the way that the plasma stuff went wasn't uh them at their best with the vaccine here uh they they've been super strong do you have faith in our government's ability to immunize americans on this scale well it's going to be tricky and it's kind of weird that the cdc throughout this epidemic uh hasn't had the visible role that you would have expected a lot of these things delegated to the states the execution will not be what it should be but overall i do think we'll get it out it just the the federal government has abdicated on many things during this pandemic you're not one for politics but and that's a pretty serious indictment the federal government has abdicated on some of its fundamental responsibilities in a public health crisis yeah the federal government has way more resources than the states punting it to the states means it won't be perfect that it'll get done would you have expected the us to have done better in a pandemic dramatically do you blame the president for that i think the administration overall uh as we do the post-mortem there'll be a lot of things like confused messaging lack of leadership uh that will fall uh on the executive branch and we'll hope that the next time we do a lot better lieutenant general paul ostrowski who is in charge of some of the distribution says that by the end of june 100 percent of americans who want a coveted vaccine will have it does that timeline seem doable or overly optimistic i know i'd say that if things if we handle the logistics and messaging well that should be achievable are you worried about widespread skepticism or reluctance to get the vaccine well this was like measles and we had to get up to like 95 percent i'd be very worried uh as it is we only have to get up to probably 70 percent of people inoculated yeah yeah with the being treated with the vaccine to drop the numbers down dramatically and so i'm hopeful that even people who are initially reluctant that will get to 70 as people see uh you know they'll have more data uh that that says hey look uh people are having a good experience and it is uh helping them not not die will you personally get the first vaccine that's offered to you as soon as you can get it yeah whatever my place in line uh rightly is i will immediately step up and take the vaccine do you have a preference not that you'll get a choice but do you have a preference about which vaccine i won't be picky individually they're all good vaccines do you feel hopeful that there's a new administration do you feel like you'll have a a better partner there to work with in terms of the the immunization and the efforts that are needed going forward yeah i think there'll be less denial uh i think we'll have a more consistent message that hey we're here to even if the news is bad we're going to be frank with you about what's going on this fall you lost your father who was very very special to you to lose him at this time when the country is feeling such loss how are you reflecting on that and how how have you been dealing with that yeah my dad was very special uh a role model that i'll i'll never uh match he got the foundation started when i was still full time at microsoft so when i move over in 2008 it's already going very well uh based on his work his approach of jumping in thinking broadly uh you know it inspired us and uh you know i'm sure he would have loved to see this this ability of that team uh to pitch in and help with this pandemic yeah his father was very instrumental in the gates foundation which has been working on infectious disease all this time now we all have had an education in it but they've been doing this work a long time you know but on masks he said something really interesting he said if we thought of them as a if the masks are the miracle intervention in terms of their effectiveness in terms of bringing down uh the infectiousness and the transmission and the numbers the miracle is here it's a mask you know which is an interesting way to think about it but to hear him say that 50 000 lives could be saved by by just that yeah yeah a lot of researchers say that at least 50 000 lives uh he also said that this work that's been done on the vaccine which is incredible by all accounts and we've never had a vaccine come anywhere close to this fast that it has relevance to other vaccines and other treatments so what we're learning now that's the silver lining the silver alignings what we're learning now has great relevance and great impact in the future for other public healthcare i like how he thought by june everyone who wants a vaccine could have a vaccine if we do it right we do it right if we do it right that's a fascinating concentration fascinating conversation we should also mention by the way there's more of our network wide series on the race for vaccine on a special hour-long edition of dateline tonight ten o'clock eastern nine o'clock central including lester holt's exclusive conversations with top executives at pfizer moderna and johnson johnson you
