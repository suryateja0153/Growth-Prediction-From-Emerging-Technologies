 GABE GUTIERREZ IN NEW YORK CITY TODAY. GABE, THANKS SO MUCH. DR. SELINE G OUCHLTOUNDER IS INFECTIOUS DISEASE SPECIALTY AND A MEMBER OF PRESIDENT-ELECT JOE BIDEN’S COVID-19 ADVISORY BOARD. DOCTOR, GOOD MORNING TO YOU. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. LET’S DIVE RIGHT IN. WE ARE JUST COMING OFF OF THE THANKSGIVING HOLIDAY AND IT WILL TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS FOR US TO KNOW WHAT THE EXACT WILL BE IN TERMS OF INCREASING COVID CASES. AS WE HEAD INTO CHRISTMAS, WHAT WORRIES YOU MOST?  WELL, I AM WORRIED ABOUT WHAT’S BEEN HAPPENING OVER THE THANKSGIVING HOLIDAY WITH RESPECT TO CORONAVIRUS TRANSMISSION. WE KNOW THAT IT TAKES UP TO 14 DAYS FOR PEOPLE TO DEVELOP SYMPTOMS AFTER AN EXPOSURE AND IT CAN TAKE ANOTHER WEEK OR TWO BEFORE THEY GET SICK ENOUGH TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL AND ANOTHER COUPLE OF WEEKS AFTER THAT BEFORE YOU START TO SEE DEATHS. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THAT TIMELINE, THAT MEANS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE CELEBRATING THANKSGIVING PERHAPS NOT SOCIALLY DISTANCED, OUTSIDE THEIR HOUSEHOLD BUBBLE, WILL BE IN THE HOSPITAL, UNFORTUNATELY, CELEBRATING CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR’S IN THE ICU THIS YEAR.  DR. GOUNDER, THE CRISIS IS BAD BUT NO MORE ACUTE THAN IN THE ICUs OR HOSPITALS THAT ARE AT OR OVER CAPACITY. WE KEEP HEARING FROM HEALTH CARE WORKERS WHO ARE BASICALLY AT THEIR LIMITS. WHAT IS YOUR PLAN WITH THE NEW ADMINISTRATION ON DAY ONE TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS THAT HOSPITALS ARE FACING?  WELL, ONE CHALLENGE IS THAT IT’S NOT REALLY FOR ANY ADMINISTRATION TO MANUFACTURE HEALTH CARE WORKERS. THAT’S JUST NOT SOMETHING ANYBODY CAN DO. IT TAKES MANY YEARS OF TRAINING TO HAVE NEW DOCTORS AND NURSES. SO THAT, UNFORTUNATELY, IS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE. IN CONTRAST TO THE SURGE WE HAD IN MARCH AND APRIL IN NEW YORK CITY WHEN ONLY CERTAIN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY WERE REALLY BEING HIT HARD, AT THAT TIME WE COULD PULL DOCTORS AND NURSES FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY TO HELP. BUT NOW THAT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY IS EXPERIENCING A SURGE, IT’S REALLY GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO PULL HEALTH CARE WORKERS FROM ONE AREA TO HELP IN ANOTHER.  DR. GOUNDER, YOU, THE BIDEN TRANSITION TEAM, HAS JUST STARTED TO COORDINATE WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AFTER A DELAY. ARE YOU CONFIDENT THAT YOU’RE BACK ON TRACK AND THAT YOU WILL BE ON TRACK TO DISTRIBUTE A VACCINE ON DAY ONE IN OFFICE?  LOOK, WE’RE WORKING VERY, VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ON TRACK TO START DISTRIBUTING VACCINES. I THINK YOU WILL ACTUALLY SEE THE BEGINNINGS OF VACCINE DISTRIBUTION EVEN BEFORE JANUARY 20th AND THAT’S A GOOD THING. WE REALLY DO WANT TO SEE HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND PERSONS WHO ARE AT RISK OF SEVERE DISEASE, WHETHER THEY’RE THE ELDERLY OR PEOPLE WITH UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITIONS OR COMMUNITIES ARE COLOR, WE REALLY WANT TO SEE THE VACCINE GET TO PEOPLE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO WE CAN START TO BENEFIT FROM SOME OF THESE
