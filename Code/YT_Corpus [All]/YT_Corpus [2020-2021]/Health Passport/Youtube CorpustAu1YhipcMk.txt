 dr ashford a stanford clinical professor affiliate published an enticing paper in the american journal of medicine suggesting quote the measles mmr vaccine may mitigate covert 19 spread and severity that there could be a relationship between the measles the mumps and the rubella mmr vaccine and the occurrence of of the covet virus in his publication he points to countries in asia and africa having low coveted 19 cases that there were measles eradication efforts that had been made in the specific countries where there was very few cases what makes you think that the mmr vaccine may protect against covet 19 symptoms so when antibodies are developed to this to the surface proteins of the attenuated measles mumps and rubella viruses we think that may help the body to better manage the covid19 infection his publication also suggests those who recently got the mmr vaccine react differently to covet and of the 50 individuals who were young enough to have had an mmr vaccine there was there were fewer symptoms than those who had had a high mumps tire that's what we found infectious disease specialist dr phil grant says these findings are intriguing it's a reasonable idea in that the immune system can get turned on by mmr uh and also so just by turning on the non-specific immune system it could protect us from other viruses grant suggests more research is necessary both doctors agree people should get the covet 19 vaccine instead of relying only on the possibility of the mmr vaccine we think that this is something should be considered i definitely don't want to say that people shouldn't get one of the vaccines when it comes out
