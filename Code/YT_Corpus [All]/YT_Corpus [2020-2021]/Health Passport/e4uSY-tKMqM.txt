the 30th we're honored to be here on the territory of the lung and speaking people of the sangees and the esquimalt first nations tomorrow friday july 31st we'll be refining a statement with case counts and other relevant information at around three o'clock tomorrow our next briefing will be next tuesday after the canada day weekend so let's see this august 1st 2nd 3rd 4th uh the bc day weekend right so bc day weekend i'm almost right i'm almost right it's the bc day weekend it's august next week in fact which seems incredible so our next briefing after this will be next tuesday and then we'll be doing briefings in person next tuesday and next thursday of next week with written briefings on wednesday and on friday and with that it's my honor to introduce dr bonnie henry thank you and good afternoon so today for our update we have 29 new cases to report bringing the total number of people with covet 19 in bc to 3591. that includes 1076 people in the vancouver coastal health region 1865 people in the fraser health region 143 people in the vancouver island health region 360 people in interior health 86 people in the northern health region and 61 are people who reside outside of canada we have 242 active cases today of those five are in hospital and two of whom are in critical care or icu we have no new deaths to report today and our total remains at 194 people who have died from covet 19 in bc additionally we have 3155 people who have recovered from covet 19. we have no new health care facility outbreaks so that leaves us with two active outbreaks in our health care system one long-term care facility and one acute care facility and there's no change in the number of people who have been affected in in those long and in those healthcare system outbreaks so we remain at 664 people in long-term care assisted living or acute care we have no new community outbreaks and no new cases in haida gwaii the community outbreak in the north and so that's very good news we continue to monitor however and there are a number of people who remain within the incubation period so new cases are certainly possible there are now 59 cases associated with the phrase fraser valley packers and that again reflects the ongoing um investigation in that setting um there are and again there are many people who are in who are contacts who are self-isolating and we continue to monitor and fraser health is working with the facility to make sure that all of the appropriate infection control precautions are in place i will remind people that there are no health concerns related to the consumption of fruit and vegetables and from a location where people have been confirmed to have coveted 19 and that is something that we we are fairly confident of now having had a number of outbreaks around the world but i will also remind you that it's important to wash fruit and vegetables carefully before eating them particularly if you're going to eat them raw and whether while it's not an issue for um for kova 19 we do also have an outbreak of salmonella going on here in the province and it's one that is under investigation by the bccdc and it reminds of us of the importance of washing fruit and vegetables and produce prior to consuming them we all know that in recent weeks bc has faced an increase in new cases and new outbreaks of covet 19 and that has been reflected in the numbers that we've seen over the past few days much of the surge can be connected to canada day activities in and around the central okanagan and particularly around the city of kelowna and what we saw is that when our groups are too big and we have too many people outside of our household bubble getting together particularly when people are coming from different parts and they bring their risk with them whether it's different parts of bc or different parts of canada or some people who are coming here from other countries we know that the potential for the virus to spread increases and we've seen the impact of that thankfully we have not had to date much spillover into older people or into healthcare settings and other settings where we know the risk is higher that people are going to have severe disease or to die from this however when we brought this up and voiced our concerns to people in british columbia we now know that they listened and i would like to thank people for that thank you for resetting and rejoining our efforts to push our coven 19 curve down and keep it low and slow in bc so that we can manage this outbreak and continue to open up our society to have those important social connections that we need as well as to increase our economic activities i want to especially to thank the young people who have taken this to heart i know it is an anxiety provoking time it has been a challenge for young people whether it's teens or people in their 20s and 30s where we don't know how long this is going to last where many of the the transitions and rituals that we have around graduation and starting jobs in university have been really rent us under this summer and i know that people particularly around the canada day weekend really had the need to get together to have that joy of being together and that is what we need to do for the rest of the summer but we can do it safely and we need to do it safely and we show that we can many things may be different than where what they were six months ago but let's not forget that rise across ppvc people have risen to the challenge and we've done an incredible job so let's keep this effort going this weekend and every weekend this summer we probably all know somebody who has bent the rules to make it work for them and that's not a surprise i think until it hits home we think we are immune to many of the effects of things like this virus if you see them again help them get back on track help them join the rest of us remind them that it is easy and possible to have fun to socialize and to socialize safely to do this let's keep our groups small let's keep a safe distance from others who aren't in our small groups or our bubbles no matter where they may be although we may be physically distant we do need to continue to have our strong social connections and that is something that we have been able to do in really innovative ways across the province we saw that with graduation ceremonies we see that with people getting together to celebrate births to celebrate marriages and i'm particularly impressed by the many young people and teens who have shown how to do this and how to do this well until we have an effective vaccine we all need to find that balance of reducing our risks and increasing our social connectedness across the province it's not too difficult to do but it does require all of us to be involved and all of our effort all of the time and it is the things that we do that protect our families our communities our seniors and elders who we value so much so we will get through this this is going to be our coveted summer an unusual summer summer of doing things differently but we know how to do it and we will do it together and this is how we can play safe and stay safe let's make this long weekend a different one than what we saw in early july whether you are 15 25 or 55 celebrate our incredible province by socializing safely the actions you take do make a difference and we have seen that in the last few weeks what you do today and this weekend will determine how we are going to be able to manage in the weeks and months ahead so let's all do the right thing it's how we care for our community for our seniors and elders for our families and friends and this is how we can continue to be kind and to be calm and to be safe thank you very much dr henry and obviously today we're conscious and grateful that no one has passed away from cloven 19 in the past 24 hours we're also grateful that there are only five people in hospital with covet 19 which i think is the lowest number uh since the the middle of march which is a significant uh improvement uh minus one from yesterday and of course minus 144 from the height at the beginning of april that only two people are in critical care i wanted to i'm going to make a couple of the reports that i uh make on thursday now one on surgery and one on visitations and both of these areas and dr henry talked about uh maybe a different bc day than a canada day weekend in terms of bending the curve but i understand that the the successes we have the fact that we can at least in a limited way have visits in long-term care the fact that we are resuming surgeries to the extent that we are is dependent entirely on what we do as a community to bend the curve on covet 19 all of us can take satisfaction in the numbers of surgeries that i'm about to report but we need to succeed if we're to succeed in this as we have been succeeded in succeeding going from stage two to stage three in terms of our economic renewal nbc as we've succeeded in other health care measures and as we will succeed in education all of that ultimately is dependent on all of our efforts to do the things to follow the guidance of public health and the relatively small number but critical rules established by the provincial health officers to to fight covet 19. on march 16 2020 as you know we postpone non-urgent scheduled surgeries to ensure that hospitals could meet covet 19 patient needs on may 7th we released our commitment to surgical renewal in british columbia and started calling patients to see if they were ready to reschedule their surgeries on may 18th we resumed non-urgent scheduled surgeries the surgery renewal commitment to patients and the significant changes it require saw achievement in june of the commitment to get back to the approximately 6000 surgeries a week that were performed pre-covet 19. these changes will also allow us to keep up with new demands for surgeries and complete the surgeries lost to covet 19 within approximately 15 to 22 months two months earlier than initially projected the progress shown in our weekly reports on our first monthly report released on july 21st is encouraging the work is complex brings challenges and it continues health authorities are doing the work necessary to extend to our days and in the future openors on saturdays and sundays and of course as you know to reduce the typical summer slowdown significantly by 52 our commitment to surgical renewal is a massive undertaking our ongoing progress will continue to value the efforts cooperation and leadership of doctors nurses nurses anesthetists healthcare workers and all the health professionals involved in surgeries health sciences professionals in particular in continuing the excellent work being done to ensure patients get the surgery they need and with that here's our 13th weekly update on surgical renewal under our surgical renewal commitment between may 18th and july 26 we completed 60 563 surgeries 46 606 were scheduled surgeries and 13 957 were unscheduled or emergency surgeries that's eleven thousand two hundred fifty three in interior help sixteen thousand eight hundred and seventy five in fraser health thirteen thousand eight hundred ninety three in vancouver coastal health twelve thousand five hundred and eleven in vancouver island health 3521 in northern health and 2510 in the provincial health services authority last week we reported 6496 surgeries completed as health authorities verify their their data after the initial reporting cut off for our weekly report we update the previous week's volumes and report the verified totals the following week this means there were an additional 163 surgeries completed between july 13th and 19th for a total that week of 6 659 surgeries performed this week we are reporting 6 379 surgeries have been completed as well the number of patients contacted about their surgeries continues to increase and now stands at seventy thousand five hundred and seventy nine this is an increase of three thousand eight hundred and ninety one from july 19th i would note that in this process almost five thousand patients have been removed from the surgical wait list one thousand six hundred and ninety five have for the moment asked to continue to postpone their surgery for cleveland 19 related reasons this is significant progress and i again want to express my gratitude to everybody who's delivering on the surgical renewal commitment it is a true team effort and as i noted our progress will continue to count on each of us everyone listening and everyone else in bc the work each of us to stop the spread made it safe to launch surgical renewal and is key to the continued progress i also want to update on on visits in long-term care as you'll know on june 30th we announced the easing of restrictions for visitors at long-term care facilities and seniors assisted living facility residences i've been reporting each week on the number of facilities that have a written safety plan in place and that have started to welcome visitors last week we reported 465 facilities with safety plans in place this week i can report that 513 facilities now have safety plans in place we have 584 long-term care and assisted living facilities so that's an increase of 68 from last week's 445 that means 88 of locations now have safety plans in place i think it is reasonable to ask and i certainly have asked these questions about the remaining 71 disproportionately they are assisted living facilities which have a different circumstance and and standard than long-term care where people have significantly more uh freedom to leave the facility and so on and have uh throughout the pandemic but i would also say this that it's my expectation and that expectation has been delivered to health authorities that every single care home and assisted living home vc will have a safety plan in place by next week i have heard some people who have who have not yet been able to have their first visits with their loved ones and i hear what you're saying and i know the challenges and these rules have been put in place by the provincial government and by on with the guidance of dr henry but it's our expectation that 100 percent that i'll be reporting next week one hundred percent of care homes and assisted living residences in bc will have safety plans in place and visits happening consistent with those safety plans in the days weeks and months ahead we need to remember this well bc travel is a welcome break from the local places we know it is not a holiday from the skills that we've been taught to stop the spread we must remember to pack our covet sense and to use our covet sense no matter where we are in bc and right now whether at home in our community or as we travel to someone else's we need to be even more dedicated to the actions we've taken to stop the spread no matter where our travels take us over the bc day-long weekend and through the summer and into the fall physical distancing must always be our closest travel companion physical distancing saves lives as we celebrate bc know what bc stands for we know it's british columbia day it should also stand this weekend but for battle coved weekend it should also stand for break the chain it should also stand for bend the curve that would be a bc day weekend to remember staying 100 all in in our commitment to renew the fight to stop the spread will make this bc day-long weekend safe and fun and memorable for all the right reasons positive thank you very much we're happy to take your questions thank you minister as a reminder to everybody on the phone please press star when to enter the queue you are limited to one question and one follow-up only please also take yourselves off mute you will not be audible until i call your name first question is from von palmer vancouver son good day dr henry i when the restart program our plan was announced for the schools uh you told us you have quote a great deal of confidence that this plan will be safe for the schools do you still stand by that station in spite of the objections that have been raised by the bc teachers federation absolutely and you know i'm really grateful for the input that the bctf has had in all of the planning that we've done and i know that they are committed to having doing the best that we can to ensure that our children have what they need and that educators have what they need in the school system coming up but yes this plan and the details will be worked out on an individual basis but the framework and the the bones of it are what we need to have in place to make sure that it's safe for children and it's safe for educators and safer staff and you know that's the whole aim here we have a long history in public health of working with our schools and working through um all of the different things that we can be faced with whether it's measles outbreaks or meningitis outbreaks whether it's the pandemic of influenza we had or now covet and these are the the important things that we have in place to keep everybody safe and we know we can do that we've looked at all of the other essential workers that we've had working over the past number of months whether it's healthcare workers whether it's our police services our fire services we have found ways to work safely and i expect that will happen in schools as well and we've had a good practice run in in june where we've learned a lot about what things can work and and what things aren't going to work and that's been what has helped us to develop this framework as well as learning from other school settings from around the world do you have a follow-up fun yes please the number of flights that have been flagged because uh there were exposures on them continues to grow i think more than two dozen now we've seen disclosure exposure alerts from the center for disease control [Music] you've referred dr henry to the difficulty contact tracing people on these flights because there isn't effective information provided by the airlines um i i guess have you gotten anywhere in getting the message through to the airlines that this is difficult and why are are you able to use the powers that you have as provincial health officer to compel them to make more details available so contract contact tracing can proceed uh i wish i had that power um yes and no i mean i certainly can but the reality of how their systems work the booking systems and the the systems that capture the the flight manifests they're only kept for a certain period of time and what's actually in the booking system and the flight manifests don't always line up and don't always provide us with useful information so yes we do get the flight manifest but it often takes days to get them and they may not have usable information that allows us to effectively contact an individual so somebody booked through one of the online like online booking systems or from a travel agent what shows up on the flight manifest is a name but not always how we can get in contact with them quickly so that is something that we have expressed our concern about a number of many times over many years and we've expressed it recently to the ministry of transport again federally it is a an important piece that i believe is part of how we keep air travel safe as we we need to eventually open up air travel for business for some essential travel for moving people and eventually hopefully um we'll get to travel for for pleasure again something that i would absolutely be looking forward to so those are some of the things that i think are really important we were actively trying to find people early on in this in this pandemic and it was a challenging thing and this is not unique to bc it's across the country it's in many countries and we were able to work with canadian border service agencies citizenship immigration the public health agency you can tell how complex it is to try and match things like people's passport information to their their name so that we could have it more effective information but again that takes time and was undone under the order that we had in place when we put on a blanket quarantine order that anybody coming into the country had to quarantine it became less important that we were able to identify people individually because we knew that everybody would be self-isolating as we're moving into this next phase it becomes again more important to be able to connect with people and ensure that those particularly those arrayed around a person who is identified as as having covet are aware of their risk it is still a relatively low risk but it is definitely a risk that we would prefer to be able to notify people if we could do that in an efficient way next question is from shannon patterson ctv oh hi uh first for minister dix today the federal government finally acted on the alaska loophole what's your response to that and do you think more still needs to be done when it comes to our land and air crossing i'm going to turn it to him but i will say one one thing and i think it's great i think that's a really helpful step and it is something that we that i'm thankful that has put been put in place i will also remind people who have traveled whether you're canadians who've come back to bc from traveling in the us or anywhere outside of canada that you are even if you are an essential worker you still must obey um our concerns around making sure that you obey the quarantine order and self-isolation so a healthcare worker who has traveled to visit somebody who comes back must self-isolate whether it's under the federal quarantine order or the provincial orders and i i'm saying this quite emphatically today because it's become i've become aware of people who have traveled to the us and are not um do not believe that they were subject to the um the requirements to self-isolate when they came back and that is not correct you are the exemptions to the quarantine order me the federal quarantine order mean that you are allowed to come back into the country it does not mean you are relieved from the obligation of of taking the precautions that we need so that you not exposing your family in your community potentially well i'm tempted to answer what dr henry said but uh but i'll add to that that of course we're delighted with that the federal government's take that's the step that uh you'll know that the premier has been a strong advocate for such action he's he regularly communicates that directly to the prime minister both in their bilateral discussions and at discussions amongst uh premiers and the prime minister so we're pleased with that what more could be done i i want to join dr henry in uh delivering the message particularly for people traveling within canada it is not appropriate ever to get on a plane and travel sick right now it's just not appropriate ever and uh well there are there can be issues and discussions with the airlines about manifests and so on that is an individual responsibility the screening on the at the airport we would hope that the screening that takes place on flights from say toronto to vancouver would would also reinforce that but practically speaking we want to deliver that message that is also true for people who visit us by car from other provinces say from alberta to i don't know salmon arm or kelowna or vancouver that again it is not appropriate in these times to travel sick and it is absolutely necessary when you're visiting our province just as it is for british columbians who might visit other provinces to to follow the rules that you ought to follow at home but in any event follow the rules we have in british columbia i think we obviously have to continue as you would understand to extend uh limits on visits uh the current limits to essential to essential workers between canada and the united states that i would hope that that would continue to be extended and that we would continue uh to make the make the case and to ensure that people traveling within canada are aware of their responsibilities with respect to travel because it's critically important for all of us for every province this is a world pandemic and it's a canadian pandemic and we have to act that way and act respectfully and we as british columbians of course we expect to be gracious hosts but we also expect people to come here uh to follow the rules and regulations of british columbia do you have a follow-up shannon yeah for dr henry i know you've spoken about this before but with with translink estimating less than half of people wearing masks um despite recommendations and with back to school coming and other places like toronto and calgary making math squaring on transit a requirement why isn't bc moving to mandatory maps on transit why not say it is mandatory even if it's not legally enforced because that would convince some people who are on the fence fence to actually put that mask on yeah and you know that's an option that transit can do and i think that's a a particularly good option and we also know that other retailers and and stores have put that in place to protect their employees and to ensure particularly if their spaces are ones where you can't maintain that distance that that is a measure that they've required in those settings and and i would also say that we need to obey those and that i would encourage everybody to use masks in those settings where it uh it's not always possible to maintain your safe distance next question is from richard sussman global news dr henry we've been hearing as i'm sure you have a lot of feedback from people about the school plan announced yesterday one of the scenarios that keeps coming up is this idea of parents with multiple kids in schools some cases there are teachers who live in the household and so they're adding up the cohorts 60 for one class 60 for another 120 for another in some cases you now have what is in essence a cohort of 300. are you concerned about these sort of circumstances and what is your advice around before and after school care and how should that work when that could in essence be an entirely different cohort with kids from many other cohorts yeah so this is the challenge that we all need to think of it so when we're talking about the the learning groups that we're creating in schools it doesn't mean that it's the same as your household bubble where you hug your mom and your kids and your your sisters and brothers it's about maintaining physical distance as much as you can but recognizing that there's not it's not always possible in those situations and that you want to have your potential exposure group to be much smaller than an entire school so for most schools and we we know the size of schools it'll be one or two classrooms that'll be together so it won't be 60 but the maximum is 60. and for for older children we know that they're able better able to maintain their distances and we need to have a bit more flexibility in the types of classes that they need to take to be able to fulfill their dreams and their needs around education so because they're able to to maintain their safe distances to wear masks in appropriate times to maintain the hand hygiene and other important things there's a little bit more leeway in those people that you maximum number of people that you might contact over the period of a term or a year so this is a way of managing what could be large numbers of kids that are intermixing and mingling similar to what we're seeing with social interactions where you maintain your physical distance but you your contact group is much smaller than it might be if you had two or three hundred people at a party so it is consistent with that concept of how we're doing this and it will be look a little bit different in different schools and with different age groups but it doesn't negate the physical distancing if what it says is we know that we we can't always maintain physical distance at all times in schools so we're going to make sure that the risk periods are are small and only with a small number of groups a small number of other students so that we're not potentially exposing many many others in different areas of the school so that's the concept behind it it will it's it takes a while to figure that through and yes it means that for certain families that'll mean different children will have different contact groups but we also have to balance the risks that we are trying to minimize in those settings with the very real risks that we know that children are experiencing now from being out of in classroom settings and that is um that is something that we haven't maybe not paid enough attention to whether it's mental health issues whether it's food security issues whether it's ability to have a safe home to to go home to there are many different needs over and above the educational needs that children have where in classroom settings are incredibly important so it will be working things out and each individual family will have to work it out based on their own situation and that's something that we've known from the very beginning of this that it affects different people differently so in terms of after care again those are things that we're going to have to look at and every family will have to make some decisions for themselves and some of that will be who else is in the household bubbles you know the people that you do have consistent close contact with and how do you minimize the the interactions for people who might be at risk so that might mean that there aren't after school certain act after school activities that are with another group of people so those are things that we will work out and every individual school and school district is looking at those things now do you have a follow-up richard i do uh you know parents are still getting used to this plan but we're hearing from some already that are just worried about sending their kids back in this situation for various different reasons do you foresee any way that there will be any type of virtual learning in the fall for those parents who decide they're not comfortable with the plan and we're hearing in some cases that it's you know vulnerable kids and you know compromised kids those that are worried about underlying health conditions that won't go and advocates are are saying that if they miss half a year or full year school they'll never be able to catch up absolutely and you know that's why we have this plan in place there are options we're not saying that every child has to be in there that that is not what the plan says the plan says the aim is to support every child in a classroom setting as much as we can we know that there will be hybrid situations needed in some situations and we know that there's access to online and other forms of of education but you know those are questions for the ministry of education the details of those i will tell you that we're all anxious about this none of us have been through a pandemic like this before and we are looking at things carefully and thoughtfully and doing the best that we can to try and balance the risks of children not having in school learning and all of the social and emotional and other factors that go with the positive effects of being an in classroom setting and having those interactions with their teachers and their instructors and the admin staff and we are also balancing what we know is a virus that has very little effect on children for the most part but does have effect on older people and so how do we you know we're finding our way in that and we've been doing it in the healthcare setting we're doing it in long-term care where we know the risks are great we've been doing it in making sure that business and essential services keep going in our communities and our grocery stores and you know all of those other settings and we will do it in this setting as well it's an important setting it's critical to the future of our children and our communities and this is why it is we've been spent so much time making sure we're trying to find that balance and the options are open to people but i will also say and this was a point that was made by one of the the people yesterday is that we have always had risks in our school there is no such thing as no risk and there's risks of measles there's risk of influenza there's risks of of norovirus we've seen run through schools we've seen pertussis we've seen meningitis so you know these are things that we can deal with and we've always had immunocompromised teachers we've had immunocompromised children that we've accommodated in our school system and we will be doing that again to make sure that we're doing everything we can to protect people but recognizing that we we have many risks in our community in our homes right now as well and what we all need to do in bc and have been doing really well is keeping our community transmission low because that protects us all and allows us to make sure that our children are getting what they need next question is from lindsey kinds times colonist hi minister dick i was just wondering are you still planning to reinstate the waiting period for msp and also to end temporary coverage for um foreign workers with less than six uh six months permits and if so why are you doing that when cases are surging uh thanks uh for the question lindsay so we made a series of changes around april first with respect to the medical services plan to make it easier in a time when one it was very difficult to get other forms of insurance there was challenges with the federal government renewing permits and other changes so what have what have we done and what will happen and those changes were made for a temporary basis until july 31st 2020. so what we're doing now for people in the following categories if you have expired temporary worker study permits and this was in response to some of the concerns that we heard from people you may be provided temporary msp coverage if you're currently living in bc of course you've applied for a new permit implied status you're previously enrolled in msp as a deemed resident and your msp coverage has expired in those cases people need to contact health insurance bc to request this temporary coverage and this temporary coverage will be valid until october 31st to allow and ensure people can deal with the federal government and possible delays there so we made that change to assist that group of workers with respect to the wait period for msp so i just wanted to put that in context because i think it's an important issue on on or around april 1st we made the change to not have the wait period because of all of the difficulties people remember what the circumstances were like at that time we have what's called a 90-day rule which means that say you're working in california or you're working somewhere in our canadian you return to british columbia for the first 90 days you have to provide your own health coverage and then you applied msp the maximum of 90 days i should say two months plus the remainder of the month in which you apply you have to provide your own medical health coverage what this does is allows us to to ensure that the public health care system that we have is able to provide services for people in british columbia so we have a 90 day rule which means people cannot just come back come here and on first day get health care and get that health care at the cost of everyone in bc that there's a 90-day wait period we did that we for practical reasons we waived that and that 90-day rule at the height of the pandemic but the 90-day rule will be put in place again and it will be put in place as to august 1st it's a necessary rule in public healthcare systems and and it ensures in fact that people in bc can get adequate coverage and adequate medical health services it's fundamental to the way that we run our public health care system in bc and the circumstances that uh the circumstances that led us to put these changes in place on a temporary basis are not there any any longer so the 90-day period will be reinstated but for people on temporary on temporary permits whose permits may have expired and are having challenges getting them renewed at the federal level we're extending uh those changes through august october 31st do you have a follow-up lindsay yeah and just uh just with regard to the foreign workers with permits less than six months i i take it their coverage is coming to an end and why are you proceeding with that uh in fact that category of worker we had very very little uptake on that on that change to allow that coverage to exist for temporary foreign workers under six months so that's something we'll continue to review but the reason that's coming to an end is the same reason as the other things that it was difficult for some people to ensure uh ensure appropriate coverage in that period in the april first period it's clear to us as a result of of the evidence over the last number of months that people do in fact have coverage there was very little take-up of that so we're just going back to what it was uh prior to april 1st in that case next question is from rob buffum ctv vancouver island oh i think this question is probably from minister dix uh and it relates to what you're speaking like speaking about earlier i spoke to two families today who have a loved one at a care home in duncan and they're frustrated because a month ago the government announced that uh visits would be starting soon and they've yet to be able to see their loved ones in both cases the uh the men have dementia and are declining quickly um i spoke to the care home who said who attributed the delay to the fact they haven't got funding from the government yet to hire more staff to to make it safe so i guess i'm wondering what's your message to the families but more importantly what's your message to the care home well it's our expectation that people will provide safety safety plans uh uh to the government and that uh we you'll recall we're now at the bc day long weekend or we were at the canada day long weekend and provide safety plans uh to their local health authority in that case it would be island health and uh and so uh this isn't uh people pointing at other people it's my expectation that 100 of care homes and assisted living homes will have safety plans in place by next thursday and that's the circumstance uh and so uh and i i want to say that i think that there has been extraordinary work by care homes and by health authorities and to allow our visits our visitation policy to go forward and of course many care homes often they have weekly visits people have had three visits already or or more at certain care homes in bc and so that it's possible and that the plan we put forward is prudent is is demonstrated by the fact that currently we have for example only one outbreak at a care home in bc it's a serious one and it's that holy family so the reason we have started slow with visits with one designated visitor per resident in a care home is for this very reason because we wanted to ensure that it would be easy for people to apply the rules it's our expectation and it's our expectation uh in the coming months to further to have more visits and more possibility visits in consultation with obviously care providers and others so we've committed enormously to the process care homes received retroactive for the retroactive period from april 1st to june 30 26.5 a million dollars across the sector in support we're providing more money as we look forward to building out our visitation policy that number is 160 million dollars which is a very significant amount of money there have been 165 million dollars made available to put in place the single site provision so all of those are significant changes and it's our it's our hope and expectation that the modest start allows care homes to act and in any event it will be our expectation to see those policies next week and i think care homes all of them are are doing their absolute best and i think everyone needs to understand as well that the one designated visitor per resident that was a decision that we've made at a provincial level so there's some people are expressing their concerns to care homes about that limit and the reason we put those limits at a provincial level is the same reason we've taken all the other steps we have we're going to be methodical we're going to start slow and we're going to get it right rob do you have a follow-up i mean i just wanted to clarify in this instance i gather from the care home they and from island health for that matter uh they have submitted a um a plan a safety plan that has been approved um so do i understand when you say that you expect by next week 100 of the uh care homes in the province to have safety plans you know in place does that also mean that you expect by next week 100 of the care homes to be offering uh in-person visits i'd expect given given and this all of this work has been done together with the nominational health association obviously with health authorities with the bc care for providers but i'd i would expect that that people should be receiving visits obviously it's not the visits that everybody wants frequently it's a short visit on a weekly basis and care homes that have had that have had for a number of weeks visits in place but it's it's our expectation that uh that plans will be in place it's the reason we started slow one resident one visitor one designated visitor always the same visitor per resident to make it possible to do and it reflected uh the resources people have and obviously working with all of the people in the sector we hope to expand that out in a safe way in the coming months but we have to do it slowly and surely and uh the my the money well it's the i've described to you the very significant resources that have been put in place to support this i'm very proud and pleased of the involvement of the hospital employees union of the bc government employees union of the bc care providers and denominational health so it's my expectation yes that people people should be getting visits and will be people wish to contact the ministry of health around these questions we can we can work through uh work through the issues and we will we have time for one more question for any reporters that didn't get to ask a question this afternoon there will be a statement released shortly for recommendations on protecting families and communities and for access to provincial guidance on coven 19 visit bccdc.ca and for non-medical questions about the province's covet 19 response visit gov dot bc dot ca forward slash covet 19. last question is from marchella bernardo news 11 30. hi dr henry and health minister dix uh i'm not sure who can best answer this i'm hoping it's dr henry but do you have any confirmed cases linked in british columbia to someone that was actually exposed to kobit 19 on a flight with someone who was sick on the plane and also if you have any cases of tourists that were exposing others like you mentioned earlier you're concerned about people not quarantining so do we have any cases directly linked to that uh not an easy question to answer unfortunately we have had many exposures over the period since january when we started having people come from other places particularly early on from china and then iran and then many other countries from the u.s there have been people who have been sick who have been exposed on an airplane but they've also had other exposures so it's very hard to tell which is the exposure that led to their illness so it is it is a low but very real risk and the more people that you have the force of infection we see this in many different settings so the more people who are traveling from areas where there's in illness and are on airplanes and are close together for longer periods of time the risk increases so we we have had people we've had people who've arrived ill and who've developed illness how do i say this yeah so there's people come from countries where there's been a lot of um a lot of circulating covid and they've all been on a plane together they may have been next to somebody who was ill may have developed illness once they arrived here but it's hard to know if they brought it with them from the country of origin or whether it was acquired on the airplane martella do you have a follow-up i do um the there's been a poster circulating in vancouver now that's advertising uh what i expect will be a large beach party at third beach where we had the drum circle last week what are you expecting local authorities to do to make sure that this event does not have more than 50 people and from what i understand it's not permitted so i guess what's your message to anyone who might be thinking about heading down to third beach tomorrow night for a party that is or is not sanctioned well i i know it's not sanctioned and i i can say that i i understand it was effective to put stern pictures of me up there scaring people away um but but this is something that uh the park board vancouver coastal health um the bylaw enforcement officers and environmental health officers have been uh working on over the last uh little while across the province actually and we've been doing compliance checks and beaches and resorts and other places in conjunction with other bylaw officers with local municipal officers that and public health and work safe bc and in some cases rcmp or other police so i do expect that there will be compliance checks and that people will be reminded of the importance of physical distancing and it may be that you know if people are in small groups separated appropriately that they can enjoy being outside enjoying music enjoying the drum circles and it can all be done safely uh thanks marcel and at a risk of channeling the premier i think people do need to give their head a shake a little bit here um but the things that we're most concerned about other things we've seen in other places which are indoor parties which are less likely although i understand some places have air conditioning less likely in this period but on this hot weekend but indoor close parties if people are being invited to those parties or they don't know people who are there and they're joining in those things i think i would just say to them this is not the weekend for that now next weekend isn't either and the one after that isn't either but i think people have to look at those situations look at parties particularly indoor parties which may happen on a bc day-long weekend or on any friday and saturday night or other nights that they should look at that look at those kind of events and not go and if there are events where everybody's invited of course somebody at the event needs to take the responsibility for potential contract facing purposes of identifying and writing down everyone who's at the event so i i think this weekend we can do this we can absolutely do this and it's not just a question of someone putting up a poster or whether it's on permitted we all have the responsibility it seems to me uh to look at that situation to understand we're a pandemic to look around at the people we know and love and to make the right decision thank you very much merci beaucoup thank you you
