 I’ve been to Japan three times now in the past three years. With each visit, I discover something new about the country, the people, and myself. As a photographer, it’s my job to find order in the discord. I love the hustle and bustle of Tokyo, but I also seek out the temples and gardens as an island oasis in this dynamic sea of light and sound. Whether it’s the sun splashing on the brilliant colors of Buddhist temples, or autumn leaves bursting like fireworks, the color yellow embodies new meaning as the day transforms. My favorite spot in Kyoto is the Fushimi-Inari shrine, where you can walk through endless torii gates. In Tokyo, the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden has a quiet greenhouse where you can walk above a pond of lily pads. Here, nature is celebrated at every turn and respected by all. For me, yellow is the color of autumn and the spark of creativity. I seek out these bright moments and capture them forever. I’m Michael George. This is what yellow means to me.
