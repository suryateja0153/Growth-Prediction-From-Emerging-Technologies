 with an energy that contradicts his exhausting four-day ordeal stuart b walked off the cargo ship that returned him safely to land b thanking the sailors who'd rescued him from the atlantic ocean on sunday nearly 86 miles off the florida coast crew members on a cargo ship spotted the 62 year old boater barely visible clinging desperately to the bow of his capsized boat for a minute they're always thinking this is very bad there's no one around i'm trying to think of what i could do what i could do to get help bee had departed port canaveral florida on friday afternoon i was out there star gazing it was beautiful but then as he hit the fast-moving gulf stream his engine stalled b decided to bunk down for the night but awoke to an unfolding disaster fellas fell asleep and the water kept gushing in pushed me out to the front i took in a little bit of water but i opened the hatch on the front and got out that way the crew of the cargo ship angeles incredibly spotted a suspicious looking speck in the ocean it was stuart b we just rescue one person from uh capsizing both the entire crew had this sense of joy that they had found me and for me though i it went from a major concern to suddenly a feeling of relief calmness you know just relief this is over on facebook a sailor who first welcomed him on the ship and then spent hours with him in the galley writing i saw his teary eyes as he made sign of the cross he was drifted in the open sea for days maintaining his stance at the top of his capsized boat to not make any single move as it may trigger his yacht to sink fully the cargo ship turned rescue vessel arrived in delaware tuesday the crew and the former truck driver now bonded for life these guys are just the nicest people ever kept feeding me i said i don't eat that much i'm good we're all good friends now carrie we needed that story today all right so let us know how does stewart plan to celebrate once he gets back home well he says when he gets back here to florida he's going to celebrate with a peanut butter and banana sandwich now you may have noticed on the side of that cargo ship it says chiquita so the bananas absolutely make sense and for all those who wonder whether that's superstition about having bananas at sea or bad luck for sailors this would absolutely prove otherwise and by the way he says being on that cargo ship was better than being on a cruise ship i think we can all understand why oh yeah one thing he made some lifelong friends i knew nothing about the whole banana thing was that they can carry the bananas and what yup it goes back to the 1700s bananas on boats are considered bad luck so the next time you go out with your friends do not bring bananas carrie sanders is a wealthy yes you
