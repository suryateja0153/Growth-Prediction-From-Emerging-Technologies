 welcome my name is Professor kshitij Kapoor and this is episode two of life after coronavirus the expert view today our topic is the end to isolation what is it going to take join me as I discuss modeling and the public health imperatives the introduction of this new tracing and tracking app and its acceptance by Australians the role of government and who is looking over government with three of the world leading experts located right here at the University of Melbourne we are currently living through one of the most extraordinary scenarios of voluntary lockdown of billions of people nothing like this has ever been done before but what happens once we lift these restrictions what kind of world will be faced what does this mean for the future of health for the future of economics of the future of politics and the future of society that is what we are here to talk about and what we're seeking are experts who know the evidence and we are fortunate at the University of Melbourne to have a rich pool from which to choose from so let me turn to them and I'm pleased to be joined by Professor Jody McFarlane she's the director of Epidemiology at the Doherty Institute she's a medical doctor with specialty in pediatrics and public health and vaccinology no doubt she has been a key adviser to the government through kovat 19 professor Adrian stone is a lawyer a Redmond Barry distinguished professor and director of the Center for comparative constitutional studies she researches constitutional law and constitutional theory and Professor Simon Dennis is the director of the complex human data hub in the Melbourne School of psychological sciences the hub's main aim is to understand human behavior using computational methods with big data so turning to them Jody you're a clinician and public health perspective end to isolation what's it gonna take so it's going to take time the idea of going back to life as normal as we knew it before this virus is going to take some substantive medical breakthroughs that would mean that we have therapies or vaccines to prevent us catching this virus or to reduce our risk of severe outcomes and death in the meantime we have to learn to adapt to living with it so we'll come back and see how we adapt to that but one part of that adaptation is going to be perhaps an increasing role of data now Simon you study data you study human behavior end to isolation what will it mean from a data perspective watching these we're going to have to continue to do we're gonna have to monitor people's behavior and see to what extent they're moving to the guidelines and how that's interacting with now now Simon you're a scientist you love data you love monitoring but of course monitoring comes close to surveillance and a lot of us get worried about that so professor Adrian stone - a lawyer and a constitutional expert what does all of this mean to you end to isolation what worries you so as we come out of isolation and we deal with the public health crisis and the economic crisis we're going to need government like we've never needed it before and it's really important then that we make sure that government continues to act lawfully and fairly and with proper scrutiny right so look you've laid out a beautiful perspective of what we will need but let me turn to you Jody first do the data that we have on how we are doing in Australia at present if we could just see the graphic and this is the curve that everyone has been watching it's the curve of how the cases are going up and down Jody walk us through this what do you see when you look at this curve so I think the first thing we need to appreciate is that that rising cases really wasn't about an epidemic in Australia it was about an epidemic in the rest of the world the vast majority of the cases that we've seen here were important about a third of those imported cases came from cruise ships yes which we're all well aware of as a risk now but underneath that there were concerns early particularly in March with this rise in imported cases of community transmission and there's been many active public health and border measures taken to reduce those risks and to get the disease under control and we've been aiming for suppression and I think we've all been really pleasantly delighted to see how effectively that has worked and over the past week we've had reported case numbers in the teens I mean like that that's amazing and and speaking to colleagues around the world some of them are quite envious or what Australia has been able to achieve and two terms are now coming up in discussions one is the idea of elimination and the other idea is what you call controlled suppression or controlled adaptation help us understand the difference as to these two terms and what they mean so I think the difference is what our target is in the disease control measures so suppression is recognizing that this is in a difficult infection to control but it's about reducing the numbers of cases as far as possible while learning to adapt and live with the virus but to keep that within the scope of our public health system and our clinical services to respond to ensure that Australians have access to medical care for kovat but all the other things that they need access to care for the elimination strategy takes a more proactive goal focused purely on covert 19 to get those levels down to a very low level and and that means more time potentially in lock down as we've seen in New Zealand although they're now easing their restrictions but that's explicit focus is on sort of stamping every last infection out and this is last infection within the country there could still be external introductions that one might indeed so we live in a connected world world and and we know that you know there are raging epidemics all around us we are never going to eradicate this infection the question is what do we do and how long do we try to keep ourselves pristine right what are our border measures what are our other measures to stop inevitable reinforce you know I think that's an important term that you used here so eradication technically means stamping out the virus all over the globe indeed as we did with smallpox as we did with smallpox so let's start with the eradication mm-hmm do you think that's even feasible anymore I think we're well past the horses bolted that's it so we cannot eradicate it across the world the only hope might be to eliminate it within a jurisdiction in day and then you've got to protect that jurisdiction from the rest of the world that's right so New Zealand's trying to do that what what do you think of that New Zealand is trying to do that and I think that the challenge with elimination is is defining what the endgame is so to keep case numbers down to a very low level is clearly desirable seeing that is a way of being able to open up social and economic activity would be attractive but the challenge is then making sure that new cases don't come in and and many who were in favor of elimination you know are looking for a fun effective vaccine which would be a definitive solution to controlling this virus the challenges we've not had a corona virus vaccine before and we don't know if we will get one so all hail so the efforts globally to to race towards a vaccine and there are many many candidates under development which is really exciting and important and testament to our reputation as a species but if we don't get a vaccine then then what next right but but so there is clearly in both of these strategy is going to be a period it could be months it might even be years when we either have the infection eliminated or quite likely have the infection at a very low level so life will they be able to resume but it won't go back to normal as we knew it they'll have to be much more testing and tracing and I think tracings been in the news lately and there's been talk about this app The Cove it's safe so first just full disclosure how many of us actually have the cove it's safe on their phones now Simon you have it you have it Adrian that's a yes I should disclose myself I do have a Galaxy 10 it's one of the new phones I have tried to download it twice it says there is some Android compatibility so let's call it 3.5 3.5 out of the four of us have the app on the phone now Simon you study these apps tell us about it how does the app actually work okay so what happens is every two hours once you do so do every two hours a toad random code is thank you or vampire and then that code is linked to other phones around you through bluetooth so if you're in contact with someone for more than 15 years the phones will connect and your random code will be simple another foe and our Ellis there kind of gets updated again but you ring home if someone kicks positive then they will have a set of codes that are on their phone and with their consent their health health professional will be our downloaded those codes and that will give them the ability to contact the people that they come in contact with and five little boys playing so Simon you raised a very important point because I was speaking to some other lay people like myself and they said that your phone connects with the other phone almost suggesting that the phones identity is known to the other phone but what you're saying is that there is a random central code that comes to you so it's not your identity that's tracked by the other phone it is that code that is tracked by the other phone is that correct so my phone number it's not as if my phone number is being recorded on the other phone no so okay so it's a code and that code is only known centrally by this server where is this server all over the world but became location within the asia-pacific region and actually the names gonna change so and and who oversees that server will be [Music] the edited Bay okay and so in the end through the server until you test positive nothing happens is that correct well you all right and once you test positive until you give consent nothing changes is that correct and what happens once you do give consent [Music] everybody right so Jodi now help us with this contact tracing business in the real world before apps contact tracing has been going on it's been going on you know perhaps for 700 years in one way or the other how was it being done before the apps came around it was done by people being detectives so I you know someone is a case go back in time tell me you know who's in your household who else have you seen we have a definition of a close contact there's a certain amount of time that you spend with a person it's 15 minutes and face-to-face contact 15 cumulative minutes so you might have seen them for five minutes here and five minutes okay so that's that's quite important and and we're really relying on human recall as to who you saw over the last 24 or 48 hours depending on how far back you go and how far back do you usually go so we've recently increased that from 24 to 48 hours so you only have to worry about 48 hours you don't have to worry about two weeks well that's about as well as people can do and that that relies on the fact that that we think that cases are likely to be infectious for potentially up to two days right before they get disease right but we all come in contact particularly as we move through society more with familiar strangers as a transport commuter there were always people on my train that I recognized every morning I have no idea who they are right and I would have no way of telling anybody else who they were but I might have exposed them so an app can actually augment the public health effort people are still going to be talking to public health units but this can identify other contacts who they might not have been able to name and people they might not have been aware that they had exposed so let's say you would go in where we look at people click there and then we ask them later where they wear it on and so from that though studies we know that people are incorrect about a third of the time but that's the kind of level at which they've been traditionally incorrect about a third of our time of where I have been in the last 48 hours so in the last two weeks I'm incorrect a third of the time yeah that's that's easy to see how that would be the case I'm surprised it's as good as that but but look all of this requires at some level for people to comply because for this to work not only do I need to have it on my phone the other party needs to have it on on their phone so so if I'm holier than thou and the first person in the country who has it that doesn't really help me at all frankly doesn't help anyone until they also get it on their phone so the number of people in a community that have it on their phone of course matters what is the acceptance of all of this by the Australian community today now you've been looking at this so you perhaps some data you could share with us very much the government has really another scenario was the government working with telecommunication companies to relocate people in order to establish contact and then another one was a very decentralized mobile base of people approach and very high level for the expanding population I'm not sure if we have a graphic there yeah we we do have the graphic we'll bring it up right now and this is where you've not only looked at Australia you've also looked at the other countries and so walk us through this what are the big trends that you see here approaches and with the five countries debate by the one Australia the UK Germany and us and the green bars are related to an axe approach and the purple bars are related to a telephoto tracking of no I will stay in line points like that is Australians were remarkably prepared to allow the government to interact with occupation company so you choose pack them through so if a approach was taken 93 percent of people said that they would be so yes this okay and all they were doing doing right and then that cancels out 87 way so remarkably really do that and much more willing doing Alec listing country so yeah well the numbers are a lot lower in the UK Germany and you may but Simon what I was surprised by is that our numbers look a bit closer to those at Taiwan then they do to say the US yeah help me understand that the way that this is a weighted responsibility and I think the crow eliminated government has really affected people willing to talk in the telecommunications strategy like them to be more effective than the anti strategy and the the threat level very high on all right so um but I think it's one thing responding in surveys and and saying yes I'll do it it's quite another thing doing it and and I think an interesting example here would be Singapore because our new the app that we're using now is some you know it's one it's been obtained from the Singapore method we've all thought that Singapore was the poster child of all of this and it got there first and it put out the app first and we have this general stereotype that it's a very compliant society people listen to government they don't even throw chewing gum on their Road and yet in the end only 17% do I have that number right well one in five less than one in five people actually downloaded the app isn't a person is that number correct and how do we explain the discrepancy determine how many people download the app and that survey was indicating around 70% and that's the random at the same level that we saw the Australian population in our survey that's down dropped down to that 64 percent and second survey so there could be a very large gap between people's intentions and what behaviors actually all right and of course looks some of that is is driven by concern its concern about what is this app going to mean what does it do to my personal freedoms and how will the government to use the data and our governments try to assure us but let me turn to Adrian Adrian when you look at all of this this is a new technology inserted into all of us the Australian community seems to be outwardly very positive but what concerns you about these things I think they've got some reason to be positive but there are some concerns when you look at the way this is regulated and and that's my basic position of downloaded the app but I'm going to be keeping a pretty close eye on the way that it's regulated um at present what we have is a determination issued by the Minister for health now the content of that determination is very significant it's really designed to make sure that the app is voluntary that it can't be made a disadvantage to you either directly or indirectly in any way not to have it on your fine and it very tightly circumscribes the way in which the data is used so what what does it tell us about how the data can be here well it can only be released to officials who are engaged in the tracing process okay and it must be held in as prescribed in in in the server describe described in Australia otherwise and only release for a specified purpose now now that we should contrast this to put it in perspective from the way it was used in China because in China as we understand the the health code I think or whatever the app was called became a requirement you couldn't enter certain zones until your app you had the app and the app was showing green tell us is is that going to be an issue in in Australia well the determination specifically says that you may not require that a person not just the government any person may not require that the app be present on a phone in order for example to enter premises or to participate in an activity employers cannot take what action under the Fair Work Act on the basis of whether or not an employee has the app on their phone and so there's quite an extensive way in which the determination seeks to make it really truly voluntary you keep using this word determination it's significant and and it's sorry to be loyally but it is actually significant so what we have is a regulation that's been issued by the Minister for health on the 18th of March there was the declaration of a human biosecurity emergency in Australia and that gave them the minister for health powers to make do all kinds of things including to make this determination now that's fine but my concern as a lawyer is that these restrictions need ultimately to be legislated and they need to be legislative for two reasons as a determination they can be changed by the Minister for Health they need actually to be more secure than that and the parliamentary process will give the nature of the restrictions proper scrutiny through a the process of lawmaking and we haven't had either of those two things so I'm only comfortable with the determination as a temporary measure and I hope and expect that this will ultimately be legislated all right well so now that is just one of the elements of what has been a huge societal change you know we've asked people not to go out we put fines on on people and and all of that has been done in a hurry and from your point of view has it received the right amount of scrutiny in you know sometimes these are local state laws some what's your sense about all of that so my sense is that for understandable reasons we acted fairly quickly and outside of normal processes and we actually have laws that are designed to allow governments to do that but it is important and we're not quite there yet that we now start to reintroduce the kinds of scrutiny and lawmaking processes that we have so I am a very big critic of the fact that the Parliament has not sat much during this process I think why and by the way has Parliament not sit well I think that the view has been taken that it would be unsafe for it to do so but I actually think that we should push back a little bit on that that it's possible to sit virtually I'm confident the Constitution can cope with that yeah it has been it'd be unsafe for the Parliament to sit even remotely why would that be the case we're having all our zoom webinars it's like 500 of us who can get together and discuss wiris modelling why can't be there you're upset there's no lack of safety in a virtual model well of course that's a very new idea but I'm confident the Constitution can cope with it the other way to go is in fact how I think the Parliament did see it for just one day in April to pass some of the measures need to back the economic response and that is to sit with a sort of proportionate reduction of members now I think that those two methods can be used and they might even be used in combination just like we are here today some people are here in the studio and some are on skype there are ways to do this and I think it's important in fact that Parliament said in law having said that I think another very positive development however was the creation of a special Senate committee the Senate Committee on covered 19 to oversee all aspects of the government's response and that is one on which there are both crossbenchers opposition and government has very significant powers it can citrus it remotely it can require ministers to attend and ask some questions and that's a very important scrutiny mechanism and we need to make sure that that's done at the federal level and at the state level in in my view now all of this of course presupposes that we're moving towards some kind of recovery and and pretty soon you will have some resumption of our life back and and very critical to all of this has been the announcement of all this testing you know Victoria announced on something like hundred thousand tests in the next two weeks and just this morning in some of the newspapers I saw that Andrew Forrest also known as Twiggy two people has found ten million tests interestingly enough coming from China to help us Jodie tell us how much testing do we actually need we've done about what half a million tests by now I haven't got the latest care I think I'm like five hundred thirty thousand or so very few positive ones so I think look at first of all a test is not a test is not a test there are many different tests that are being talked about here so there are our diagnostic laboratory PCR tests that are looking for the virus that are the gold standard for diagnosing an individual with covert nineteen in Australia these other tests these point-of-care tests that are coming out on a large scale might be used to test for virus antigens might be used to test for antibody responses to the virus which only come up late so they're not useful in acutely diagnosing an infection and there has been a flood of these tests on the market they're being evaluated in Australia to see whether they are appropriate for use but they are not a panacea and they are not a way of making sure we're safe to walk out the door right so so I think the first good point that you're making is that there are two kinds of tests there are tests that diagnose whether you have the disease and there's another set of tests that diagnose whether you now have the immunity because you might have had the disease and the first ones are a bit more standardized at the moment and the second just coming out but the second ones are lately all the news because people are giving these so-called immunity tests to lots of people yes and the results at least as far as an outsider could see are a bit all over the place because I think there was one from santa clara county in in in california done by stanford that said that there are eighty times as many people who have immunity than the number of people what do you think of that so every test needs quality assurance evaluation we talk about the sensitivity and the specificity of a test so is it sensitive will it pick up all the cases that are real is it specific will it give us false positives and tell us that people might have been infected who weren't so all tests need to be evaluated with those in mind the issue then of what that immunity means is very uncertain so we've seen some longitudinal studies of individuals who've had Kover 19 we've seen that they make antibody responses we then see that those responses start to fall off quite quickly also you could get immunity and it can go away so we don't know how robust that immunity will be there are anecdotal reports of individuals having second infections and that's clearly very concerning and something that needs to be very carefully evaluated and we just don't know whether that protection will last over time so without that it's not clear this this notion of an immunity passport i've had the infection now I'm free to roam about society that could be a false confidence that could be actually very dangerous right but but your is this interesting point about specificity and false positives and and help us understand the numbers because some of these tests say that there are 95 percent specific or 98 percent specific look numbers in the 90s look good to me but people like you are not always impressed by even numbers in the 90s well let's just say that manufacturers may have an interest in reporting those kinds of numbers but we might wish to seek independent validation first and obviously since you know poor sensitivity is a problem if we miss a case but poor specificity can lead to all sorts of other problems it can lead to overreactions it can lead to fear and stigma of an outbreak that hasn't occurred and for all tests that we do we have to be equally concerned about those false positives as we are about the false negatives that's an important caution it's it's it's interesting that you know this business of tests and data and apps is all very new just last night I I got a report from someone in India the government of india and i actually saw their notice has actually sent a notice to all of its civil servants and the government india has a lot of civil servants that they must download the app and they should look at their app every morning and if they have potentially come in contact with someone which is determined by the server in the air they're required not to go to work but actually go to get themselves tested or go to a health facility and and then in some countries I think Chile is one of that is the idea that your immunity passport will be on your app so we're going to a whole new brave world here which is mixing testing strategies what is the evidence that all of this makes a difference but what is the evidence if I'm got really tough and said manual contract tracing has been a standard part of managing epidemics we know how to do it well we call people on the phone we keep careful records and we know how to do it without violating privacy because we've done it means we're throwing it at all these interesting new mechanisms if one were to be really hard nosed and say what is the evidence that this changes the course of an epidemic and let me start with a counter example Singapore was the poster child of all of this Singapore had the best tracing mechanism well I'm not saying those went wrong but I'm just saying that having that has hardly done them any good because their cases were low they were low they were low and suddenly for the last month that single city country has more cases by a factor of two than all of Australia so what is the hard evidence so in bringing the a pin in Australia as I say it's a it's a it's augmented the existing Public Health tracing capacity and there's already discussion about evaluating that right so we do need as we roll it out we need to see how many extra contacts are we finding of those contacts how many are infected I'm very taken with studies in Iceland that of use whole genome sequencing to actually say of the contacts that we think linked cases we can we can actually look at the genetics of the virus and say actually there really were linked all they weren't right and that's an another layer of evidence and I think there are you know we need studies just to actually say that I understand what you're saying is that if one really deeply studied not whether just a person was positive or not but exactly precise which version of the virus they have we can start making a tree or who got it in half right yeah and in Iceland the really nice thing that was done which I think is interesting as we reopen society was to say where were these infections acquired were they at home were they in the work place you know at that stage it was still about international travel and transport in other places and that helped to actually separate out really where the risks were in society and I think that kind of approach is very very interesting and the sorts of things we need to think about moving forward but that's the only evidence that we'll have that the at per se augments what we do I think the Singapore story is a very important one of the way this virus exposes the deep inequalities in our society and really reinforces the importance of protecting the vulnerable of ensuring equity of access to services and ensuring that the reach of our measures is extended to all of our communities know that you're quite right because you know these data technologies are not uniformly spread across society it could be that it's the sort of well off protecting the well off and and the rest either through access or or not feeling comfortable are not apart that and that that would be rather sad if we if we came to that but Adrian from your point of view this is this rapid in some sense unstudied convergence of biological data ìit data impinging upon the way we run society now I have to say that I personally think that up to now Australia's come through all of this in flying colors so it's it's not critical of where we've been it's actually looking away we should be going what are the safeguards that we need in place so there's a range of them we need Parliament to sit properly according to its regular schedule we need the Committees of the Parliament to continue their important scrutiny work we need the courts to become involved they have not been a big part of the story yet they tends to come later but we really do need the courts people to be willing to litigate the limits of this if they feel that their rights have been infringed upon we need a very active free media we need civil society involved so we need institutions like universities like we are here today to be taking a critical look at what's going on and in fact we actually need everybody to be engaged in a critical response I think Australians have been remarkably remarkably cooperative so forth and that's been a good thing but I want it to be a watchful cooperation rather than a mindless cooperation I think that's what as a society we want all of our governing institutions and our population to be to be aiming to do I think your terms watchful cooperation rather than a mindless one I think that these will become slogans we should use keeping in mind that that I think we can all be proud that as a community we pulled together rather well you know you look around countries and I don't need to name them you you can imagine who else we are talking about where despite all the technology despite all the healthcare expenditure despite the very best of science and presumably despite very similar scientists giving pretty much similar advice it has come to very different outcomes and you've also raised the interesting issue of ulnar ability I think Singapore is one example and perhaps Jody you could tell us a little bit more about what turned out to be the really onerous in Singapore well obviously the migrant workers living in densely packed housing and those those conditions where lockdown social distancing are things we find you know tiresome at this particular point in time but they're luxuries we can afford to live in spacious accommodation and clearly many across Australia have been doing it very tough I feel very fortunate to be a middle-class white woman with a nice house who can keep working through this and I'm aware that's not been every Australians experience but overcrowding and and the risk of infection spread among those migrant workers has just meant that when outbreaks occurred overrun rampant right so what I wanted to say that I think one thing that human rights lawyers all over the world are looking at and rightly so is the position of incarcerated people who are very vulnerable and in Australia of course that includes not only criminal incarceration but those who are detained for immigration reasons are very vulnerable to the virus and there needs to be a careful look at them I also think we need to think not just about the way in which the virus exposes vulnerabilities but some of our responses will as well and one thing to be I think what fall about is the way in which social distancing measures might be deployed in uneven ways against minority communities in ways that infringe upon for example their freedom of religion or their freedom of speech or the freedom of association now there's inevitably going to be some impacts there but we need to watch very carefully how those are used and in fact you're raising a good point because I just read this morning that in the u.s. some of those communities are actually taking the government to court precisely on on the grounds that that's infringing upon their rights that are guaranteed under the Constitution now we haven't had any high profile cases as yet have we no we haven't and I think that's partly because of the difference in our society and the earlier kind of stage where it in this but I do want to say that for example I don't think that the limits on political protest can continue indefinitely yes I think that there I mean there are some remarkable ways in which I've seen activists adapt to social difference you know there was this sort of wonderful vision of a protest in central Tel Aviv with protestors standing in a very regular distance to be returned and I think that we have to make sure that political protests which is a really vital part of our society is able to to go ahead among other kinds of activity right I'd be very interested how do you police that 1.5 meters that may take some thinking but these are very difficult yes Simon from a data point of view who are the one herbal in a society that becomes very tech obsessed is that randomly distributed across society or are I are there good socio-economic sort of correlates of that and then of course geography I'm in a country as vast as ours you know the distribution of IT is not equitable all across and I think a very special element that we haven't talked about and perhaps we should return in some detail are the specific vulnerabilities of our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and I think we have a long history of where pandemics and epidemics have affected them adversely it would be fair to say that this time around partly because of their early cooperation and involvement we're doing all right but I think this is something we'll have to do to watch out a lot now look this is something that will change society and I think Jody you said right in the opening were not going back to anything that looked like the old normal and and I'm reminded in many ways of you know 911 travel was never the same after 9/11 and now we've just gotten used to it we just compare relative things though you know that airports a bit faster than this Airport but we just recognize we'll stand in long lines and go through that ritual all the time so our society will change in many ways and I can see quite a few ways in which it'll be less palatable there'll be more restrictions but I'm hoping that out of this will come some positives you know you look back to the Second World War all the Western societies got their public health care system sometime after the Second World War with NHS and everything so my question to you is what good can you see coming out of this what would be the good lasting legacy of this covent experience any of you and all of you who's gonna go first for me I hope it helps us to look a little closer to home in a good way I think for many people this has slowed us down a little it's brought us closer to the people that we live with for those who do live with others and it's made us be more purposive and creative about the way we connect with each other so I think that's been something that hopefully we can take away is the importance of caring for and looking after each other and if we recognize this is going to go on for a while we we just have to be more adaptive and creative about the ways we do that and he'll help each other through well that's wonderful well two things from a governance perspective one is that I think there's a big story here around the success of the national cabinet process yes it has been really quite remarkable and I think it would be worth thinking about what has made that so successful and what could be deployed into the future the second thing that I have found very reassuring and hope and made me somewhat hopeful for the future in this process is that Australia is still a place where the facts matter where science is accepted in our political discourse and we absolutely need to hold on to that because we've seen what happens when that breaks down in other places and we're going to need it quite frankly for addressing climate change among other things mm-hmm that's another one of those global larger-than-life issues that no country can solve for itself and and I think we've done I have to say that you know after the bush fires it'd be fair to say we were all a bit despondent as to first of course what happened secondly how we were seen as Australia around the world and and thirdly many of us also wondered what had told us about our governments and how we work together but it has to be said what a difference three months can make and one looks back and one can feel positive about all of this though I've yet to figure out exactly what good came out of it but let's hold on to that Simon what good what lasting legacy would you like to see off the covert experience people have already downloaded because of the population need a lot more than that but I think the surveys we've been doing keep me is just the level of support that when the just get down the Australian population is willing to which of each other into their politicians and famously we've seen you know what was a very exacting and I think responsible approach for politicians I think all of that I'm always well afraid ability to get out of this particular situations and also I think it's a help well that's very good I knew you would find some hope and data and numbers and I do like that 2 million Australians have downloaded the app but you know I'm reminded when you look at things like Facebook and Twitter 20 million Australians have downloaded that app so we look forward to where we end on this one but I fear we have to bring our panel to an end today and there will be life after kovat I think we've begun smoking about speaking about it and I hope this gives you some glimpse of some of the challenges we will face as we get there so please join me in thanking our wonderful experts and let me thank you for your interest and if you're interested in this issue yesterday Australia's leading
