 ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED WITH OUR AFTERNOON SESSION. IS DR. PARK ON THE LINE?  YES, I AM, THANK YOU.  LET ME MAKE OUR INTRODUCTION AND WE'LL GET GOING. OUR NEXT SESSION IS EXPERIENCES FROM THE FIELD, HAWAII'S VACCINE REQUIREMENTS FOR SCHOOL ENTRY. IN THIS PRESENTATION, WE'LL HEAR ABOUT HAWAII'S EXPERIENCE DEVELOPING, PASSING, REQUIREMENTS FOR SCHOOL ENTRY AND PROCESS WORKING WITH HESITANT PARENTS, USING SOCIAL MEDIA TO ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS. DR. SARAH PARK, STATE EPIDEMIOLOGIST FROM HAWAII WILL PRESENT ON THE PHONE. TAKE IT AWAY.  I INTEND TO GIVE A BRIEF PRESENTATION AND OPEN UP TO QUESTIONS BECAUSE I THINK DIALOGUE IS PROBABLY MORE HELPFUL TO YOU ALL. SO AS YOU'VE SEEN IN THE TITLE, FINALLY TWO STEPS FORWARD, IT'S BEEN A VERY, VERY LONG PROCESS TO GET WHETHER WE ARE. HOWEVER, EVEN AS WE'VE MADE THIS ONE GREAT SUCCESS, WE'RE ALSO ENCOUNTERING AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE A LOT OF ROAD BLOCKS BEING PUT IN OUR WAY. AND WE'RE ANTICIPATING MORE ISSUES COMING UP. SO NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO, THIS NEXT SLIDE REALLY GIVES YOU THE VERY SMALL VERY SMALL NUTSHELL OF THE PROCESS WHICH AS YOU CAN SEE IT STARTED WITH ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THIS, OUR RULES REGARDING THE IMMUNIZATION REQUIREMENTS, WERE LAST AMENDED IN 2001. IN THE STATE OF HAWAII, RULES WILL DESCRIBE IMMUNIZATION REQUIREMENTS FOR CHILDREN IN SCHOOL. STATUTE SAYS THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE THAT CHILDREN AND STUDENTS IN GENERAL, SO SECONDARY SCHOOLS AS WELL, NEED TO MUST BE IMMUNIZED TO BE IN SCHOOL. BUT THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SETS THE RULES IN TERMS OF HOW THOSE REQUIREMENTS ARE ACTUALLY DESCRIBED, WHAT THEY ARE, AND THE INTERVALS, ET CETERA, AND ALL THAT. SO IT'S SOMEWHAT UNIQUE FROM SOME OTHER STATES WHERE OTHER STATES HAVE TO BASICALLY GO TO THEIR STATUTE AND CHANGE STATUTE TO ENACT CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS, WHEREAS OUR CHANGES ARE ENACTED VIA THE RULES BECAUSE STATUTE ALREADY EXISTS THAT REQUIRES CHILDREN SHOULD BE VACCINATED. THE RULES PROVIDE THE MEAT OR DETAIL, IF YOU WILL. SO THOSE RULES WHY LAST AMENDED IN 2001. AND BASICALLY WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON UPDATING OUR HEALTH REQUIREMENTS FOR PRESCHOOL, SCHOOL, POST SECONDARY SCHOOL ATTENDANCE, WITH INPUT FROM MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS, PRIMARILY SCHOOLS BUT ALSO PEDIATRICIANS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS SUPPORTIVE OF VACCINATION, AND LISTENING TO THOSE WHO VOICE OBJECTIONS TO IMMUNIZATION REQUIREMENTS. NOW, AS FAR AS, YOU KNOW, AGAIN, THE LAST TIME THESE WERE AMENDED WAS 2001, SO I'M SURE THAT YOU'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE FACT THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF CHANGES TO OUR IMMUNIZATION ACIP RECOMMENDATIONS. I SAY WE IN HAWAII CAN MAKE CHANGES TO OUR REQUIREMENTS, LIST OF VACCINES, IF YOU WILL, THERE ARE STEPS THAT NEED TO BE THAT WE NEED TO GO THROUGH AND THAT REQUIRES LEGAL REVIEW, REQUIRES STAKEHOLDERS INPUT, SO GOES BACK AND FORTH. I WOULD SAY PROBABLY THE BIGGEST HOLDUP WAS LEGAL REVIEW WITH OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL. EVERY TIME WE MADE CHANGES WE HAD TO SEND CHANGES INTO THE DOCUMENT BACK TO THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO REVIEW EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. AND I WOULD SAY REALLY WE STARTED THIS PROCESS BACK IN ABOUT 2005 OR SO, FRANKLY AROUND WHEN I STARTED WITH THE STATE BECAUSE MY BACKGROUND IS I'M A PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASE SPECIALIST. I GOT HERE, I WAS A LITTLE BIT APPALLED TO FIND OUR IMMUNIZATION RULES DID NOT INCLUDE PNEUMOCOCCAL CONJUGAL VACCINE FOR REQUIREMENTS, AND YET IT HAD BEEN ON RECOMMENDATIONS FROM ACIP FROM EARLY 2000s. SO THAT'S WHAT STARTED THE PROCESS, WE REALIZED THERE WERE MORE AND FOUND MORE VACCINES BEING RECOMMENDED BY ACIP, WE HAD TO INCLUDE THOSE. THIS, LIKE I SAID, THIS SLIDE SIMPLIFIES THE PROCESSE WE UPDATED, SIGNED BY OUR GOVERNOR IN AUGUST OF LAST YEAR. NOW IMMUNIZATION REQUIREMENTS ALIGN WITH ACIP. THE OTHER STICKLER FOR US IN THE STATE OF HAWAII WAS THE FACT THAT THE WE COULDN'T DIRECTLY ADOPT THE ACIP GUIDELINES AS IS. WE ACTUALLY TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS BACK IN I BELIEVE 2015 WHERE WE ACTUALLY HAD TO GET A BILL PASSED BY OUR LEGISLATURE TO ALLOW US IN THE STATE OF HAWAII TO ADOPT THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES BECAUSE THERE'S A STATUTE IN THE BOOKS THAT PRECLUDES THE STATE FROM AUTOMATICALLY ADAPTING ANOTHER ENTITY, EVEN A FEDERAL ENTITY OR STANDARD MEDICAL PRACTICE, WE COULD NOT OUTRIGHT ADOPT ANOTHER GROUP'S OR COMMITTEE'S OR STANDARDS RECOMMENDATION, SO WE ACTUALLY HAD TO GO THROUGH ADDITIONAL PROCESS OF CHANGING OR ADDING THAT INTO OUR STATUTE. SO WE CAN NOW REFER TO THAT, THAT'S WHY WE WERE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD ON OUR RULES AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE NOW. SO IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE THAT'S JUST A FILLER SLIDE TO BASICALLY ALLOW FOR JUST SAYING, YOU KNOW, THIS WAS A LONG PROCESS, IT WAS A LOT OF GOING BACK AND FORTH WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS BECAUSE WITH EACH ADDITION AS WE WENT THROUGH THE LONG PROCESS, EVERY TIME WE THOUGHT WE HAD IT, WE WERE FINISHED, THERE WOULD BE A NEW VACCINATION THAT WOULD BE ADDED TO THE ACIP GUIDELINES, AND THEN WE WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK TO THIS DRAWING BOARD AND GOING BACK AND FORTH WITH OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL, AND, YOU KNOW, BASICALLY UNTIL WE GOT TO THAT POINT WHERE WE COULD ACTUALLY ADOPT OUTRIGHT THE ACIP GUIDELINES WE WERE GOING AROUND AND AROUND IN CIRCLES. EVEN THEN IT TOOK US SEVERAL MORE YEARS TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE COULD ACTUALLY ESTABLISH THE RULES. THERE WERE, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, QUITE A LOT OF VOCAL PROTEST FROM ANTI VAXERS QUARTERS. WE HEARD THEM OUT IN PUBLIC HEARING AS REQUIRED BY LAW BEFORE RULES WERE ENACTED. THERE WERE PUBLIC HEARINGS IN EACH COUNTY. THEY WERE QUITE VOCAL PROTESTS AND ALSO QUITE A FEW SUPPORTERS. AND THAT WAS IT WAS YOU KNOW, FOR MY STAFF I'D SAY THEY WERE GRATEFUL TO HEAR FROM THE SUPPORTERS BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN SUCH A LONG PROCESS. NEXT SLIDE, I'LL GO OVER QUICKLY WHAT OUR QUOTE/UNQUOTE NEW VACCINATION REQUIREMENTS ARE AND BY THIS YOU CAN SEE WHERE WE NEEDED WORK AND THE UPDATES WERE REALLY, REALLY REQUIRED ESSENTIALLY FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. SO THE NEW VACCINATION REQUIREMENTS WHICH WILL BE EFFECTIVE AS OF COMING SCHOOL YEAR, SO WE'RE GIVING BASICALLY EVEN THOUGH CAME INTO IT WAS MADE EFFECTIVE I SHOULD SAY SIGNED BY OUR GOVERNOR AS OF LAST YEAR, IT WON'T ACTUALLY BE ENFORCED OR IMPLEMENTED AS OF THE COMING SCHOOL YEAR TO GIVE SCHOOLS AND PARENTS TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE AWARE, FULLY AWARE OF THE REQUIREMENTS AND IF THERE ARE STUDENTS WHO HAVEN'T CONFORMED TO THE GUIDELINES THAT THEY HAVE THAT TIME TO MAKE SURE THEY DO CONFORM TO THE GUIDELINES. THE NEW VACCINATION REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CHILD CARE FACILITY, PRESCHOOLS, BASICALLY ADDS PCV VACCINE AND HEPATITIS A VACCINE. K 6 FOLKS, KIDS, ADDING HEPATITIS A VACCINE. NEXT SLIDE. FOR 7th GRADERS, THE CRITICAL ONE I THINK, PROBABLY THE BIGGEST CHANGE HONESTLY FOR MOST KIDS, OR AT LEAST THE ONES WHO GIVE THEM NOTICE AND THEIR PARENTS NOTICE AS WELL AS SCHOOLS IS THE HPV VACCINE, PRIMARILY, BUT ALSO MENINGOCOCCAL AND TDAP, AND 7th THROUGH 12th GRADERS. FOR 7th THROUGH 12th GRADERS IT'S GOING TO BE ENFORCED FOR NEW STUDENTS INTO THE SCHOOL SYSTEM, SO THOSE STUDENTS WHO ALREADY EXIST IN THE SYSTEM, THAT ALSO GOES THROUGH K 6, THOSE KIDS ALREADY EXISTING WILL THE GRANDFATHERED IN SO TO SPEAK. THEY WILL NOT BE DIRECTLY HELD TO THE NEW SEVENTH GRADE REQUIREMENT, FOR EXAMPLE, FOR 7 12 OR NEW K 6 REQUIREMENT AT LEAST UNTIL THOSE K 6 AGE OUT AND GO TO 7th GRADE. SO IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, I CAN EXPLAIN THAT AFTER THIS. BUT IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE YOU'LL SEE THE POSTSECONDARY SCHOOL REQUIREMENTS, YOU'LL SEE NOW WE'VE ADDED TO OUR REQUIREMENTS, I MEAN, AGAIN, THIS SHOWS WHERE THE GAPS WERE IN OUR PREVIOUS RULES. AND THEY WERE HORRIBLE GAPS THAT EXISTED UP UNTIL THE RULES WERE UPDATED AS OF LAST YEAR. AND THESE WILL BE, AS I SAID, ENFORCED IN THE COMING SCHOOL YEAR. SO THE PROPOSED SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS WE HAVE VARICELLA, TDAP, MCV, THE CRITICAL ONE. IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE, SO OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE ALL OUR CLINICIANS ARE WELL AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON, THAT THEY HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION THEY NEED SO THEY CAN TALK TO STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS. SO WE SENT OUT SUMMARY GUIDE, WE SEND OUT ABRIDGED COPY OF OUR RULES. YOU CAN ACCESS IF YOU'RE INTERESTED THE FULL DOCUMENT, THE URL THAT'S ON THE SLIDE. WE'VE PROVIDED THE COPY OF THE ACIP GUIDELINES. AND THEN MEDICAL EXEMPTION FORM FOR OUR PHYSICIANS, REVAMPED, YOU'LL SEE IN THE NEXT FEW SLIDES, COMING LATER HOW WE REVAMPED. AND WE'VE PROVIDED THEM BACK TO SCHOOL CAMPAIGN POSTER TO HELP THEM BY POSTING IT IN THEIR WAITING ROOMS SO THEY CAN INFORM THEIR PATIENTS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION FORM PREVIOUSLY OUR QUOTE/UNQUOTE MEDICAL EXEMPTION FORM WAS A LETTER FROM CLINICIANS WHO JUST NEED TO CERTIFY THEY ARE A PHYSICIAN OR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER, LICENSED HEALTH CARE PROVIDER, AND THEY FELT IN THEIR MEDICAL OPINION THAT SOMEONE WAS PRECLUDED FROM CERTAIN VACCINE. AND SO THAT WAS THE PREVIOUS. BUT NOW WE BASICALLY UPDATED, SINCE WE WERE UPDATED OUR RULES WE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO UPDATE OUR MEDICAL EXEMPTION FORM TO ALIGN WITH WHAT ACIP HAS RECOMMENDED FOR MEDICAL WHAT IS ALLOWABLE FOR MEDICAL EXEMPTION AND LOOKED TO MULTIPLE OTHER STATES TO ADOPT, YOU KNOW, FORMATS FROM OTHER STATES. AND SO AS YOU CAN SEE, FROM THE SLIDE, AT LEAST, THESE ARE SORT OF THE BULLET POINTS. AND WE BASICALLY SAID THE STUDENT, PARENT OR GUARDIANS NEEDS TO GIVE THE FORM, BE GIVEN THE FORM BY THE CLINICIAN AND A COPY NEEDS TO BE SENT TO OUR IMMUNIZATION BRANCH WHICH BY THE WAY WE'RE ALREADY ENCOUNTERING ISSUES WITH ANTI VAXERS, ARGUING THAT BECAUSE OF HRSA WE SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED INFORMATION, INTERESTING, HEALTH ASPECTS, AT ANY RATE THAT'S AN ASIDE. NEXT SLIDE. YOU CAN SEE I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO READ THIS, BUT YOU CAN SEE THE NEW MEDICAL EXEMPTION FORM IS QUITE THE POINT SHOWING YOU THIS IT'S QUITE FORMAL NOW, AND IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT IT, YOU SEE IT DOES AS I SAID CONFORM TO THE ACIP RECOMMENDATIONS IN TERMS OF WHO SHOULD BE EXEMPTED FOR MEDICAL REASONS, FROM CERTAIN VACCINES. NEXT SLIDE. THIS GIVES THE SECOND PAGE OF THAT FORM. SO, AGAIN, WE ADAPTED THIS FROM LOOKING AT OTHER STATES' FORMS, SO IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO, IF YOU LOOKED AT LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, NORTH CAROLINA, WASHINGTON STATE, SOME OF THE OTHER STATES' FORMS. WE WANTED TO TRY AND STANDARDIZE TO MAKE IT EASY FOR CLINICIANS TO BE ABLE TO CHECK OFF A BOX AND BE INFORMED AS TO WHAT IS THE SORT OF RECOGNIZED STANDARD MEDICAL PRACTICE. NEXT PAGE. OR NEXT SLIDE. SO THIS IS JUST TO SHOW YOU A COPY OF OUR MEDICAL I'M SORRY, OF OUR CAMPAIGN. AND IT'S JUST TO SHOW YOU LIKE THAT HOW WE'RE WE'VE LAUNCHED IN OCTOBER, MY SLIDES ARE GIVING ME TROUBLE HERE. WE LAUNCHED OUR CAMPAIGN LAST OCTOBER. WE'RE TARGETING PARENTS, SPECIFICALLY 7th GRADERS, RISING 7th GRADERS, BECAUSE AS I SAID THAT'S WHERE I THINK WE'LL SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE TAKEN ABACK BECAUSE OF COURSE WE'VE HAD FOLKS HAVE NOT BEEN THIS FAMILIAR WITH THE HPV VACCINE, EVEN POTENTIALLY MCV, HOPEFULLY NOT TDAP BUT WE SUSPECT THIS WILL BE NEW FOR SOME PARENTS, HOPEFULLY ENCOURAGING AND ALLOWING THEM TO GET INFORMED. WE'RE GOING AN ALL OUT CAMPAIGN WITH PERIODIC ADS ON THE RADIO AND TV, PRINT ADS AS WELL. AND POSTERS AND FLYERS. NEXT SLIDE SHOWS YOU OUR ACTUAL CAMPAIGN POSTER THAT WE'RE DISTRIBUTING TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND OTHERS. THE LAST COUPLE SLIDES I SHOW YOU THE IN HAWAII WE HAVE ALLOWANCES, MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS, ALLOWANCE FOR CLINICAL RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION. WE TECHNICALLY DO NOT HAVE PHILOSOPHICAL EXEMPTION ALLOWANCE. HOWEVER, I WOULD SAY THAT THE RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION BASICALLY PARENTS JUST HAVE TO WRITE IN THAT IT'S AGAINST THEIR PERSONAL BELIEFS, THEY DO NOT ACTUALLY HAVE TO STATE WHAT THEIR PERSONAL BELIEF IS, WHAT THEIR RELIGION IS, OR SHOW PROOF OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THEY JUST NEED TO SAY IT'S AGAINST THEIR PERSONAL BELIEF. SO AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE, PROBABLY USING THE RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION AS SUBSTITUTE FOR PHILOSOPHICAL EXEMPTION. YOU CAN SEE SPLIT BY COUNTIES, DIFFERENT COLORED LINES, OVER TIME FROM THE 2004 2005 SCHOOL YEAR ALL THE WAY TO THE 2016 2017 SCHOOL YEAR AND PROPORTION OF STUDENTS THAT HAVE REQUESTED SUCH EXEMPTION HAS BEEN STEADILY RISING, AND THAT HAWAII COUNTY BEING THE LEADER, SO TO SPEAK, OUR SMALLEST COUNTY, HAWAII COUNTY GEOGRAPHICALLY IS OUR BIGGEST, AND OUR MOST RURAL COUNTY, BUT IT'S NOT NEARLY AS POPULOUS AS THE OAHU OR HONOLULU COUNTY, OAHU ISLAND WHERE HONOLULU PRESIDES, 70% OF POPULATION IS CONSIDERED THE URBAN ISLAND, WHERE THE OTHER ISLANDS ARE RURAL ISLANDS. AND THEN YOU CAN SEE THE BLACK LINE SHOWS YOU JUST THE SLOW STEADY RISE. PERCENTAGE WISE YOU COULD ARGUE IT'S A SMALL PERCENTAGE BUT IT'S CONCERNING THAT HERE, LIKE ELSEWHERE, WE'RE CONTINUING TO SEE THAT RISE. THE NEXT SLIDE, AS OF THE LAST SCHOOL YEAR, WE ACTUALLY STARTED MAPPING THESE DATA, AND IT'S AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE. AND FOR PUBLIC VIEW. AND WE'RE JUST BASICALLY MAPPING OUT. THIS IS THE THE CAVEAT IS THESE ARE BY SCHOOLS, OR SCHOOL DISTRICTS, SO TO SPEAK, AS OPPOSED TO BY ACTUAL AN INDICATION OF THE ACTUAL PERSON'S RESIDENCE, SO THERE'S SOME CAVEATS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IF THERE'S A PRIVATE SCHOOL, PRIVATE SCHOOLS COULD BE DRAWING FROM, YOU KNOW, MULTIPLE LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT AN ISLAND. BUT HAVING SAID THAT, WE FEEL THAT THIS IS PROBABLY MAPPING OUT TO WHERE WE PROBABLY DO HAVE FOCUS, FOCI OF VACCINE ANTI VAX COMMUNITIES. THERE'S A BILL IN OUR LEGISLATURE GOING THROUGH THE ROUNDS WHERE THE ANTI VAXERS ARE TRYING TO INTRODUCE NOW, A FORMAL CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR EXEMPTION. INTERESTING THING, AND FRANKLY A BIT OF A HEADACHE FOR US, IT'S BEING PASSING THROUGH THE VARIOUS COMMITTEES BUT BEING GUTTED. SO IT'S BEEN BY THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THIS TIME IN OUR HOUSE, AND IT'S APPARENTLY BEEN GUTTED COMPLETELY, GIVEN CURRENT CONCERNS ABOUT NOVEL CORONAVIRUS, AND NOW LOOKS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT, MUCH TO THE DISMAY OF THE ANTI VAXERS, ALSO I CAN'T SAY WE'RE VERY HAPPY ABOUT IT BECAUSE NOW IT'S A STUDY OF HOW STATE OF HAWAII WILL VACCINATE THE PUBLIC SHOULD THERE BE A VACCINE AVAILABLE AGAINST CERTAIN THREATS LIKE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS, AS WELL AS ACCOUNT FOR POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS AND OTHER ISSUES. NOT CLEAR YET HOW THAT BILL WILL EVENTUALLY PLAY OUT, BUT WE'RE WATCHING THAT CLOSELY AS LONG AS THAT STAYS ALIVE THERE'S POTENTIAL ORIGINALLY WORDS OF THE BILL, WHICH WAS AGAIN ALLOWING FOR CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS WILL GET REINSERTED. WE'RE WATCHING CLOSELY, AS ARE PARTNERS WHO ARE SUPPORTIVE OF VACCINES. I'M GOING TO END THERE. YOU SEE A PICTURE OF MY SON. HE'S DEFINITELY ONE OF MY BIG REASONS WHY I DO THE THINGS I DO. SO ANY QUESTIONS?  ANY  QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IN THE ROOM? MARY ANNE?  THANK YOU, DR. PARK. WHAT IS THE STATUS OF ACCESS TO VACCINES IN THROUGHOUT THE STATE? IS THERE GOOD ACCESSIBILITY? AND ARE THERE ANY BARRIERS TO OBTAINING VACCINES NOW GIVEN THE MANDATES?  YEAH, SURE. SO AS FAR AS ACCESS TO VACCINES, JUST LIKE OTHER STATES, WE'RE RECIPIENTS OF THE VACCINES THROUGH THE VACCINES FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM. THROUGH THAT PROGRAM THAT HAS MADE GREAT INROADS TO PROVIDING ACCESS TO VACCINES FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT. AND SO, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A NUMBER OF BASICALLY OUR PEDIATRICIANS ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM AS WELL AS SOME FAMILY PHYSICIANS AND INTERNISTS AND THROUGH THAT PROGRAM WE BELIEVE THAT KIDS ARE GETTING VACCINATED THAT NEED ACCESS TO THAT VACCINE, TO VACCINES THAT ARE REQUIRED. THE HEALTH PLANS HERE ARE AWARE OF OUR VACCINE REQUIREMENTS, AND BASICALLY HAVE SAID THEY WILL COVER ANYTHING THAT IS REQUIRED UNDER THE STATE LAW, SO THAT HAS NOT BEEN A PROBLEM. ACTUALLY HAS BEEN TO MY, YOU KNOW, DELIGHT, FRANKLY, WHEN WE'VE HAD OUTBREAKS AND WE'VE HAD TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON VACCINES AND CHECK WITH THE HEALTH VACCINATIONS AND CHECK WITH THE HEALTH PLANS, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN WE HAD OUR BIG OUTBREAK AND RECOMMENDED MMR, HEALTH PLANS DID COME FORWARD AND SAY THEY WOULD COVER THAT OUTBREAK DOSE. SO WE HAVE GOOD RELATIONSHIPS HERE IN THE STATE OF HAWAII. AND SO WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE VACCINE ACCESS IS GOOD. RELATIVELY GOOD. HOWEVER, WE DO CONSTANTLY EVALUATE THE SITUATION TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER ISSUES, ANY ISSUES THAT WE CAN ADDRESS. AND, FOR EXAMPLE, WE DO HAVE I BELIEVE WE'RE THE ONLY STATE IN THE NATION THAT CONTINUES TO HAVE A STATEWIDE SCHOOL LOCATED FLU VACCINATION PROGRAM. FLU VACCINES ARE NOT A REQUIREMENT UNDER STATE RULES, WE DO BELIEVE IT'S AN IMPORTANT VACCINE AND WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S ACCESSIBLE TO THOSE THAT MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO OTHERWISE ACCESS IT. WE TARGET PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT HAVE AT LEAST 40% OF THEIR KIDS ON THE SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM, AND THEN ALL OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS ON THE NEIGHBOR ISLANDS. FIRST IS TARGETING PUBLIC SCHOOLS ON OAHU, URBAN ISLAND, SHALL I SAY, AND WE TARGET ALL THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS ON NEIGHBOR ISLAND THROUGH THAT PROGRAM. WE DO A LOT TRYING TO MAKE SURE ACCESS IS THERE.  ROBERT?  THANKS FOR THE PRESENTATION. REGARDING YOUR SCHOOL FOOD PROGRAM, CONGRATULATIONS ON SUSTAINING THAT. WONDERFUL EXAMPLE. AND WONDERING IF YOU'RE ENVISIONING SCHOOLS AS A SOURCE FOR CATCHING KIDS UP, AHEAD OF THE SCHOOL YEAR, EVEN THOUGH THE TIMING WOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM YOUR FALL FLU CAMPAIGN?  I'M SORRY, CAN YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION? I WAS DISTRACTED. WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON HERE IN HAWAII RIGHT NOW AS YOU CAN IMAGINE. I'M TRYING TO MULTI TASK TO CALM DOWN FIRES. CAN YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION?  SURE. DO YOU IMAGINE YOUR PRIMARY CARE, YOUR MEDICAL HOMES WILL BE ADEQUATE FOR DELIVERING ALL THE CATCH UP VACCINES? ARE YOU GOING TO RECRUIT OR ENLIST SCHOOLS TO HELP OUT OR SPECIAL EVENTS TO HELP OUT WITH CATCH UP?  YES, THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. SO OUR BELIEF IN TALKING WITH PEDIATRICIANS IS THAT MAYBE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HPV WE BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY MANY PEDIATRICIANS SAY THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN ADMINISTRATION HEP A VACCINATION, AND SO FOR INSTANCE THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE AN ISSUE. TDAP OF COURSE THEY HAVE BEEN ADMINISTRATION, MCV. THE ONLY ISSUE IS THE HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS VACCINE, BUT THE PEDIATRICIANS HAVE BEEN ORDERING THOSE VACCINES AND THESE VACCINES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE AS I SAID THROUGH THE VFC PROGRAM. WE DON'T ENVISION MUCH NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SORT OF VACCINE SUPPLIES AND SUCH, AND CERTAINLY HAVE NOT BEEN HEARING ANYTHING FROM OUR PROVIDER PARTNERS OUT THERE. SO WE THINK IT WILL BE IT WILL BE FINE. ACTUALLY WE'VE BEEN ARGUING THAT ALL WE'RE DOING WITH OUR IMMUNIZATION RULES IS ALIGNING WITH ACIP GUIDELINES, WHICH THE PEDIATRICIANS ALSO ONE OF THE THINGS THEY HAVE BEEN ABIDING BY THAT SO IT MAKES IT EASIER. ONE OF THE ISSUES WITH OUR IMMUNIZATION RULES WAS THE OLD SORT OF RULES, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE WE COULDN'T OUTRIGHT BEFORE ADOPT ACIP GUIDELINES, BASICALLY THE OLD RULES HAD LIKE A SCHEDULE THAT WAS ACCORDING TO INTERVALS BY MONTHS. EXAMPLE, ONE PROBLEM PROVIDERS ENCOUNTERED BECAUSE OF THAT AND PATIENTS AS WELL AND HEALTH PLANS WAS THAT HEPATITIS B VACCINE AS YOU KNOW IS THE INTERVALS ARE BY WEEKS. BUT THE OLD INTERVALS WERE BY MONTHS SO IT WAS VERY POSSIBLE A CHILD COULD BE VACCINATED QUOTE/UNQUOTE EARLY BY OUR IMMUNIZATION RULES, BUT BECAUSE OF THE RULES THEY WOULD HAVE TO GET AN EXTRA HEP B DOSE, WHICH WAS A PROBLEM BECAUSE THE HEALTH PLANS DIDN'T WANT TO COVER THAT EXTRA DOSE, IT WASN'T MEDICALLY NECESSARY, AND OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO TALK TO PARENTS ABOUT WHY THE CHILD NEEDS AN EXTRA DOSE, IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF NOT MEDICAL REASONS BUT BECAUSE OF THE LAW. SO WE THINK ACTUALLY OUR BY ALIGNING WITH ACIP IT'S MAKING IT EASIER FOR PARENTS AS OPPOSED TO HARDER.  AND MOLLY? THANK YOU, DR. PARK FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. I WAS CURIOUS WHAT HAWAII'S CURRENT HPV VACCINATION RATES ARE IN ADOLESCENTS, AND SECOND QUESTION WHETHER YOU'VE HEARD FROM STATE LEGISLATORS ABOUT ADDING REQUIREMENTS THROUGH RULES, AND IF YOU HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT YOUR LEGISLATURE TAKING THAT AUTHORITY AWAY FROM YOU AND REQUIRING LEGISLATION IN THE FUTURE?  YEAH, SO AS FAR AS THE VACCINATION, WE DON'T YET HAVE A UNIVERSAL VACCINE REGISTRY. AND, YOU KNOW, SO WE DON'T HAVE LIKE QUITE ACCURATE NUMBERS. WE HAVE TO REFER TO THE BRFSS SURVEY, THE CEC SURVEY. I'M NOT ACTUALLY I DON'T THINK OUR VACCINATION UPTAKE FOR EXAMPLE FOR HPV IS ANYWHERE AS GOOD AS ANYONE ELSE'S, UNFORTUNATELY. SO IT IS GOING TO BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHERE THAT FALLS. I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME. I CAN GET BACK TO YOU IF YOU'D LIKE THAT INFORMATION, JUST LET ME KNOW. AS FAR AS OUR CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT WILL BE ALLOWED TO DO OR NOT ALLOWED TO DO IN THE FUTURE, THAT'S ALWAYS A CONCERN. WE'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH LEGISLATORS NOW AND EDUCATE THEM ABOUT THE NEED FOR VACCINATIONS TO MAKE SURE THEY UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS IMPORTANT. IT IS INTERESTING THAT AS I MENTIONED THE BILL THAT IS CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH OUR LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW IT'S CLEAR THERE ARE LEGISLATORS MINDFUL OF THE IMPORTANCE OF VACCINATIONS. IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT SITUATION WITH THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS. SO, WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT MEANS WE HAVE SUPPORTERS AMONG THE LEGISLATORS, WE KNOW FOR CERTAIN WE DO BUT WE ALSO KNOW THERE ARE LEGISLATORS UNFORTUNATELY THAT ARE ALSO SWAYED BY ANTI VAXERS. SO IT'S AN ONGOING BATTLE I THINK THAT WE CANNOT REST, WE'RE ARE NOT RESTING AT THIS POINT. THIS IS A SUCCESS IN OUR IMMUNIZATION RULES BUT BY NO MEANS OVER IN TERMS OF OUR CONTINUED FIGHT TO MAKE SURE CHILDREN AND OUR COMMUNITY ARE PROTECTED.  DR. PARK, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. YOU'VE GOT A ROUND OF APPLAUSE COMING FROM THE ROOM HERE. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE]  TAKE CARE OF THAT LITTLE ONE, MAHALA.  THANK YOU, BYE BYE.  NEXT PANEL IS SUCCESSFUL SHARING OF STORIES, IN THIS PANEL I'D LIKE TO INVITE THE PANELISTS TO PLEASE COME TO THE STAGE. IN THIS PANEL THE PRESENTERS WILL SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT STORY TELLING AND HOW TO UTILIZE IT TO ENCOURAGE TIMELY VACCINATION. WE'LL START OFF WITH DR. DAVID ROBERT GRIMES FROM OXFORD, SHARING HIS WORK USING STORIES TO ENCOURAGE HPV VACCINATION PRESENTING OVER THE PHONE. FOLLOWED BY TAMIKA FELDER FROM CERVIVOR, SHARING INFORMATION ON USING STORIES TO REDUCE STIGMA. SERESE MAROTTA FROM FAMILIES FIGHTING FLU WILL SHARE BEST PRACTICES FOR USING PERSONAL STORIES. ZAHRA BARNES FROM SELF MAGAZINE WILL HIGHLIGHT WAYS TO CREATE VIBRANT EDITORIAL CONTENT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION TODAY. DR. GRIMES, ARE YOU ON THE LINE?  I AM INDEED.  THE FLOOR IS YOURS, SIR.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'VE NEVER PROMOTED NEVER PRESENTED REMOTELY SO THIS SHOULD BE A FIRST. I'M ALSO IRISH. I MIGHT SPEAK FAST SO PLEASE DO JUMP IN IF I'M UNINTELLIGIBLE. I'M GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT TODAY ABOUT COMBATING VACCINATION HESITANCY AND DISINFORMATION WITH LESSONS FROM IRELAND ON THE HPV VACCINE. IF WE COULD MOVE TO SLIDE 2 PLEASE. THE FIRST THING TO REALIZE IS THAT ANTI VACCINE ACTIVISM IS NOT A NEW PROBLEM. THERE'S BEEN ANTI VACCINE SENTIMENT SINCE THE 1700s, SINCE THE FIRST IMMUNIZATIONS. IT'S CHIEFLY ROOTED AROUND IDEOLOGICAL OPPOSITION BASED ON MODE OF REASONING, IT IS NOT NECESSARILY ONE THAT HAS A HIGH COMMITMENT TO INTELLECTUAL VERACITY OR FACT. THAT MAKES IT MALLEABLE. AND IT MAKES IT VERY PRONE TO GO FOR MORE EXTREME POSITIONS, SOME OLD CARTOONS YOU CAN SEE WITH THE FRIGHTENING IMAGES AREN'T THAT SHOCKING NOW BUT THEY ARE SOME OF THEM OVER 100 YEARS OLD. I THINK THE W.H.O. SAID IT VERY WELL IF WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE, SLIDE 3 PLEASE. AND IN 2008, THEY SAID HOW ONE ADDRESSES THE ANTI VACCINE MOVEMENT HAS BEEN A PROBLEM SINCE THE TIME OF JENNER, THE BEST WAY IS TO REFUTE WRONG ALLEGATIONS AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY BY PROVIDING SCIENTIFICALLY VALID DATA. THOSE WORDS REMAIN VALID TODAY. SINCE 2008 WE'VE HAD A NEW EMERGENT DISRUPTIVE FORCE, IN THE FORM OF SOCIAL MEDIA. SOMEHOW WE'VE BECOME EVEN MORE SUSCEPTIBLE THAN EVER BEFORE. NEXT SLIDE, SLIDE 4. WE GET A LITTLE TASTE OF THAT. YOU CAN SEE THESE VERY FRIGHTENING MEMES THAT PERPETUATE ACROSS SOCIAL MEDIA, LIKE VACCINES HAVE NEVER BEEN STUDY FOR SAFETY AND PHARMA IS POISONING US, VACCINES HAVE DANGEROUS, ALL TOXIC WASTE. THIS KIND OF SENTIMENT IS NOT EVEN NOVEL, IT'S JUST SO COMMON. REALLY SOMETHING WE HAVE TO REALIZE IS THE INTERNET TRULY HAS BEEN WEAPONIZED. THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY SURPRISING. EVEN IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE INTERNET, THE ACADEMICS WERE LOOKING AT THIS FOUND THAT ANTI VACCINE PROPAGANDA WAS FLOURISHING BEFORE SOCIAL MEDIA, THEY WERE COLONIZING THE INTERNET VERY EARLY ON. WE SEE EXTREME CLAIMS ABOUT VACCINES ACROSS SOCIAL MEDIA, INVARIABLY FALSE OR MISLEADING. EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE EASILY DEBUNKED THEY STILL SURVIVE AND SPREAD. PEOPLE BECOME AFRAID OF VACCINATIONS. THEY MAYBE REASONABLY ASSUME WHY WOULD THIS BE SPREAD IF PEOPLE DIDN'T REALLY BELIEVE THIS AND IT CREATES FEAR. THAT FEAR CREATES A SLOWDOWN IN VACCINE UPTAKE. WHY ARE THESE MEMES AND CLAIMS SO EFFECTIVE GIVEN IT'S SO MENDACIOUS? THEY ARE VISCERAL AND POWERFUL DESPITE THEY LACK COMMITMENT TO OBJECTIVE REALITY. WHY DO THE SCORES SCARE PEOPLE? GO TO SLIDE 5 PLEASE. THE FIRST THING TO TALK ABOUT IS AVAILABILITY HUERISTIC. WE ASCRIBE MORE WEIGHT TO THINGS WE CAN EASILY REMEMBER. WE THINK IF WE CAN REMEMBER IT EASILY OR IF IT STICKS IN OUR MIND, IT HAS TO BE IMPORTANT. THAT KIND OF SKEWS IT A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE IT MAKES US MORE BIASED TOWARDS EXTREME EXAMPLES OR VERY FRIGHTENING CLAIMS. IT'S NOT ACTUALLY A FILTER FOR HOW ACCURATE OR HOW TRUE OR REPRESENTATIVE THOSE CLAIMS ARE. ONLY HOW MUCH THEY STICK IN MEMORY. THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE ARE HUMAN. WE ARE SLAVES TO ANECDOTE. WE ARE SOCIAL CREATURES, THRIVE ON STORIES WE SHARE WITH EACH OTHER. BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS FALLACY ANECDOTAL INCLINATION, VERY FRIGHTENING STORIES CAPTURE OUR ATTENTION, BIAS OUR SENSE OF DANGER. WE GO, OH, I HEARD ABOUT THE VACCINE, I READ IT KILLED SOMEONE ON FACEBOOK. THAT STICKS IN OUR MIND. WHAT DOESN'T STICK IN OUR MIND IS REAMS OF DATA SHOWING EFFICACY. AFTER CLEAN WATER AND SANITATION THERE'S NOTHING THAT SAVED MORE LIVES THAN VACCINATION, BUT THAT'S DRY AND ACADEMIC. THAT DOESN'T STICK IN OUR MINDS THE WAY A FRIGHTENING MEME DOES, THIS BIAS TO EXTREME CLAIMS REGARDLESS OF MERIT. SECOND FACTOR TO CONSIDER, SLIDE 6, ILLUSORY TRUTH EFFECT, TENDENCY TO BELIEVE INFORMATION WILL BE CORRECT BECAUSE WE'VE HEARD IT IN REPEATED FASHION. IF WE CONSTANTLY HEAR CLAIMS WE GIVE THEM WEIGHT. THIS REPETITION CAN SOMETIMES SWAY US TO ACCEPT SOMETHING THAT'S WRONG EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW BETTER, ON AN INTELLECTUAL LEVEL WE KNOW IT TO BE WRONG, WE'RE MORE INCLINED TO BELIEVE SOMETHING BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN BAMBOOZLED WITH IT. THIS IS THE PRINCIPAL BEHIND JOSEPH GOEBEL'S BIG LIE, AND OFTEN, PEOPLE WILL COME TO BELIEVE IT. NAPOLEON SAID REPETITION IS WORTH A DAMN, IT PRIMES US TO BELIEVE THINGS. IF WE LOOK AT ANTI VACCINE SENTIMENT ON SOCIAL MEDIA, IT'S UNRELENTING, MULTI CHANNEL, CONSTANTLY VECTORED OUT THERE. BECAUSE OF THAT VECTORIZATION, THAT EXTREME AGGRESSIVENESS AND PROMOTION, IT IS VASTLY OUTNUMBERING RELIABLE SOURCES. AND WITH MORE FRIGHTENING CLAIMS. THAT PUTS US IN A STRANGE POSITION. AGAIN, THIS PROCESS IS SUBCONSCIOUS. WE ACCEPT THIS THROUGH REPETITION. WE'RE NOT SITTING HERE WEIGHING UP LOGICALLY. THIS IS EXPLOITATION OF HUMAN BIAS. NOW, LET'S MOVE TO THE NEXT SLIDE, SLIDE 7. OTHER FACTORS COME INTO PLAY. FOR EXAMPLE, WE KNOW THAT EMOTIONAL CONTENT, THINGS THAT MAKE US REACT WITH DISGUST OR FEAR ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE SHARED. WE'VE SEEN THAT WITH CONSPIRACY THEORIES AS WELL. THE MORE FRIGHTENING, EXTREME, SCARE MONGERING, MORE ATTRACTION I GET. TO THE AUDIENCE, THAT'S WEAPONIZED FOR ANTI VACCINE SENTIMENT BECAUSE CLAIMS ARE FRIGHTENING. OTHER THING TO CONSIDER IS THE RUSSIAN FIRE HOSE FALSEHOOD MODEL DESCRIBED BY RAND CORPORATION IN 2016. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE ANY CONSISTENCY OR COMMITMENT TO OBJECTIVE REALITY. THAT'S NOT A REQUISITE. IT'S ABOUT HAVING SCARY STORIES CONSTANTLY. BECAUSE THAT PLAYS TO OUR PSYCHOLOGICAL BIAS OF IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S INCONSISTENT OR IF ONE DAY THEY CLAIM VACCINE CAUSES AUTISM AND ANOTHER DAY CLAIMING IT CAUSES AUTOIMMUNE CONDITIONS. IT DOESN'T MATTER. ALL THAT MATTERS IS THERE'S LOTS OF IT. THIS SO CALLED MODEL OF FIRE HOSE OF FALSEHOOD IS BECAUSE IT'S LIKE TRYING TO STEM A FIRE HOSE, LOADS AND LOADS OF WATER COMING AT YOU VERY FAST. AND TRYING TO REFUTE IT CAN BE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT BECAUSE WHEN OUR HANDS ARE TIED BY HAVING TO BE COMMITTED TO SCIENCE AND FACT, AND MEDICINE, PEOPLE WHO ARE PERPETUATING FALSE HOODS HAVE NO SUCH COMPUNCTION. THAT'S SOME OF THE ISSUE HERE. WE HAVE SEEN THAT IN RECENT ANALYSIS IN "SCIENCE" IN 2018, WHEN YOU LOOK AT NEWS STORIES AND POPULAR SOCIAL MEDIA STORIES, 126,000 OF THEM, OVER SEVERAL YEARS, AND FOUND FALSEHOOD PERPETUATED MUCH FURTHER AND MUCH FASTER THAN FACTS. AND WE SEE THIS IN POLITICS TO MEDICINE. VACCINATION IS PERHAPS THE MOST STARK EXAMPLE OF THE PERILS OF DISINFORMATION. THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE TO CONSIDER, SLIDE 8 PLEASE. THAT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE THIS STATEMENT BEFORE WE CONTINUE ON. WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT VACCINE HESITANCY IS A SPECTRUM. IT'S NOT SIMPLY ANTI VAX AND PRO VAX. A LOT OF PEOPLE DWELL IN BETWEEN, NOT SURE, DON'T KNOW THE DRAWBACKS OF VACCINATION. WHAT YOU TEND TO GET IS A VERY ACTIVE SMALL BUT VOCAL COHORT OF ANTI VACCINE ACTIVISTS, THE PEOPLE WHO DO PERPETUATE FALSE HOODS, DON'T CARE IF THEY ARE LYING OR NOT BUT TEND TO SCARE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE WHO DON'T HAVE STRONG OPINIONS EITHER WAY. IF YOU'RE A NEW PARENT, FOR EXAMPLE, AND THERE'S SOMEONE AGGRESSIVELY TARGETING YOU WITH CARE STORIES ABOUT A VACCINE, IT'S NOT UNSURPRISING THAT YOU BECOME HESITANT. YOU BECOME A BIT AFRAID BECAUSE, AGAIN, WE'RE SOCIAL ANIMALS, STORIES MATTER. THE PARENTS I FEEL WHO ARE RENDERED HESITANT BY ANTI VACCINE ACTIVISTS I WOULD VIEW AS VICTIMS THEMSELVES OF DISINFORMATION. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO ASK WHAT ARE MOTIVATIONS FOR PEOPLE BEING ANTI VACCINE? THERE'S BEEN PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH DONE IN THIS. THERE'S A DIFFERENT FACTORS PUT FORWARD, RELIANCE ON ANECDOTE OVER DATA, LOW CAUSE OF COMPLEXITY, RELIANCE ON CONSPIRATORILY THINKING. ONE OF THE BIGGEST FACTORS PUSHING THE EXTREME PROPAGATORS IS NARCISSISM. THEY MAY KNOW NOTHING BUT YOU CAN PUT THEM IN A ROOM WITH IMMUNOLOGIST, PEDIATRICIAN OR SCIENTIST, THEY CAN FEEL LIKE THEY KNOW A LOT. THAT'S A VERY ALLURING IDEA. PARTICULARLY AS PEOPLE WHO FEEL THEY ARE LOW POWER FOR WHATEVER OTHER REASON. WHATEVER THE MOTIVATION, WE KNOW IT DOES EXTREME DAMAGE, ANTI VACCINE SENTIMENT PUSHES HESITANCY, AND REDUCES VACCINATION RATES. WE'RE SEEING A DARK RENAISSANCE TOWARDS VIRTUALLY CONQUERED DISEASES, MEASLES ON A SHOCKING LEVEL. I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE HPV VACCINE, SLIDE 9 PLEASE. I'M SURE THE AUDIENCE KNOW THIS, A QUICK RECAP, THE HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS, THE LAST SPEAKER WAS TALKING ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT. HPV IS A COMMON VIRUS. IN FACT, IT'S A FAMILY OF OVER 179 VIRUSES, MOST OF US IN OUR LIFETIME WILL HAVE AT LEAST ONE STRAIN, PROBABLY SEVERAL. ESTIMATE IS AROUND 80% OF US HAVE AN INFECTION IN A LIFETIME. OTHER ESTIMATES PUT IT MUCH HIGHER. SPREAD VERY EASILY BY SKIN TO SKIN CONTACT. SOME FORMS OF HPV ARE ONCOGENIC, CANCER RESEARCHER THIS INTERESTS ME. ONCOGENIC STRAIN ARE 16 AND 18, RESPONSIBLE BETWEEN THEM FOR VAST MAJORITY OF CERVICAL CANCERS. WHEN MOST PEOPLE GET A HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS INFECTION, THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEM WILL CLEAR IT IN A YEAR OR TWO, THEY WON'T BE AWARE THEY ARE AFFECTED. FOR A SMALL COHORT, IT WON'T CLEAR, INFECTION WILL BECOME ENDEMIC, AND CELLS DAMAGED BY THIS WILL MUTATE AND PERPETUATE OUT OF CONTROL WHICH CAN EVENTUALLY LEAD TO CANCER. YOU CAN SEE FROM THE BOTTOM GRAPHIC THERE HOW MANY CANCERS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO HPV INFECTION, NOT JUST CERVICAL, ANAL, PENILE, HEAD AND NECK CANCERS. ABOUT 270,000 WOMEN WORLDWIDE DIED FROM CERVICAL CANCER IN THE YEAR 2012 ALONE. OKAY? NOW, THE OTHER TYPES ARE 6 AND 11 WHICH CAUSE GENITAL WARTS, NOT ONCOGENIC BUT UNPLEASANT. WE'VE HAD HPV VACCINE FOR A DECADE, PREVENTS INFECTION WITH ONCOGENIC STRAINS, PARTICULARLY 16 AND 18 AND NOW 33 AND SO ON. AND IT'S BEEN AN EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS. I HAVE A GRAPH OF GENITAL WARTS IN AUSTRALIA, AUSTRALIA INVENTED UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND, ONE OF THE FIRST TO BRING IN A FULL PROGRAM, SET TO ELIMINATE CERVICAL CANCER BY THE YEAR 2028. INCIDENCES OF GENITAL WARTS IN INFECTED YOUNG PEOPLE, YOUNG PEOPLE, HAVE PLUMMETED SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE VACCINE. FOR OTHER REASONS YOU'LL SEE IN A FEW MINUTES I HAVE THE IRISH FIGURES, WE ESTIMATE 420 CANCERS A YEAR IN IRELAND, A SMALL COUNTRY OF 4 MILLION PEOPLE, CAUSED BY HPV INFECTION, 103 DEATHS, YOU SEE A TINY FRACTION OF HEALTH BODIES WHO ENDORSE, W.H.O., CDC IN THE STATES, CANCER RESEARCH U.K. IN THE U.K., HSC IN IRELAND, IRISH CANCER SOCIETY, I COULD NAME SEVERAL MORE. THIS IS NOT SCIENTIFICALLY CONTROVERSIAL. HOWEVER, IF WE'RE GOING TO SLIDE 11 PLEASE, IF YOU WENT ON LINE YOU MIGHT ENCOUNTER SHOCKING STORIES LIKE THIS. I DON'T WANT TO GIVE THEM THE AIR OF PUBLISHTY OR VENEER OF PUBLICITY, CLAIMS IT'S CAUSING IMMUNE FAILURE, KILLING PEOPLE, A DANGEROUS VACCINE, A COVER UP, THERE'S A CONSPIRACY, IT'S CAUSING PROBLEMS, BEING COVERED BY THE GOVERNMENT, A NEBULOUS CONCEPT, OR BIG PHARMA, NOT SPECIFIC BUT VAGUE. THESE CONSPIRACY THEORIES HAVE SERIOUS IMPACT. LET'S MOVE TO SLIDE 12, AND LOOK AT THE WORLD IMPACT STARTING IN JAPAN. IN 2013, DISINFORMATION ABOUT THE VACCINE LED TO A CONFIDENCE CRISIS IN JAPAN. YOU CAN SEE FROM THE TOP GRAPHIC THERE, THE UPTAKE IN 2013 OF THE HPV VACCINE WAS 70%. AFTER A YEAR ARE SCARE MONGERING THAT GOT MASSIVE MEDIA TRACTION COVERAGE DROPPED TO LESS THAN 1%. TO THIS DAY, IT STILL HASN'T RECOVERED. A PAPER IN THE "LANCET" LAST WEEK ESTIMATES THAT JAPAN'S POLITICAL FAILURE AS MUCH AS ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT THE HPV VACCINE WILL LEAD TO 11,000 PREVENTIBLE CANCER DEATHS. IF NOTHING IS DONE. AT THIS STAGE THAT'S PROBABLY VERY DIFFICULT TO REVERSE BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT THEY HAVE NOT RECOVERED THEIR VACCINATION RATE WHICH IS QUITE WORRYING. I'LL MOVE TO SLIDE 13 PLEASE. A YEAR LATER, THE SAME PROBLEM EMERGED IN DENMARK. SO IN 2014, A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT HPV VACCINE DAMAGE AIRED ON DANISH TELEVISION. NOW, THE DOCUMENTARY ITSELF WAS INCREDIBLY NAIVE, HAD ITS OWN ISSUES, WAS ESSENTIALLY FICTITIOUS. A LOT OF PEOPLE CLAIMED THEY HAD BEEN DAMAGED BY THE VACCINE, WHEN THIS WAS INVESTIGATED WAS NOT SUBSTANTIATED. HOWEVER, IT GOT MAINSTREAM COVERAGE SIMILAR TO JAPAN. WITHIN ROUGHLY A YEAR, THEIR VACCINATION RATES HAD GONE FROM 79% UPTAKE TO 17%. YOU CAN SEE THE TOP RIGHT HAND CORNER, THE RED LINE IS NORDIC COUNTRIES AND VACCINE UPTAKE, RED LINE ON THE GRAPH IS HOW DENMARK PLUMMETED. IT'S SHOCKING IF YOU LOOK AT THAT FIGURE. NONE OF THESE CLAIMS HAD VERACITY. THEY WERE FICTIONS BUT DID ENOUGH DAMAGE. SLIDE 14 PLEASE. IN 2015, A SIMILAR PANIC CAME TO IRELAND. IT STARTED ORGANICALLY WITH LOCAL PRESSURE GROUPS WHO HAD A LONG ESTABLISHED ANTI VACCINE HISTORY, MAKING CLAIMS ABOUT THE VACCINE. THE PROBLEM WAS A DOCUMENTARY SIMILAR TO THE DANISH INDICATION UNCRITICAL DOCUMENTARY AIRED IN 2015 ON IRISH TELEVISION, ENOUGH TO CREATE NATIONAL DISCUSSION AND PANIC. DESPITE THE FACT MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY WERE TRYING TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS, UNCRITICAL MEDIA COVERAGE ALLOWED IT TO PERPETUATE. IN A YEAR WE FELL FROM 87% UPTAKE TO 50%. UNLIKE OTHER COUNTRIES AFFECTED, SOMETHING DIFFERENT OCCURRED IN IRELAND. WE'LL MOVE TO SLIDE 15 PLEASE. IN IRELAND THERE WAS A RAPID RESPONSE TO HPV VACCINATION CRISIS. SO ALLIANCE FORMED OF MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS, PARENTS, PARENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, SCIENTISTS AND GOVERNMENT MINISTERS WHO CAME FORWARD TO SAY THIS VACCINE PREVENTS CANCERS. IT CAN PREVENT 5% OF ALL CANCERS WORLDWIDE. THEY ARE THE FACTS. WE ALSO IN TANDEM, FACTUAL INFORMATION WAS DISSEMINATED, GREAT INITIATIVE IN MAKING SURE THEY WERE READY TO COMBAT THIS. MULTIPLE RESPECTED ORGANIZATIONS JOINED THE INITIATIVE. BY 2017 IRELAND WAS STARTING TO SEE RECOVERY, SOMETHING NOT HAPPENING IN DENMARK OR JAPAN. BUT THE MOST EFFECTIVE COMPONENT WAS A PERSONAL STORY, A VITAL ONE. I'D LIKE TO MOVE TO SLIDE 16 PLEASE. THIS WOMAN HERE IS LAURA BRENNAN, A WOMAN IN IRELAND WHO AT THE AGE OF 25 RECEIVED TERMINAL CERVICAL CANCER DIAGNOSIS. AND AS SHE BECAME MORE INTERESTED, SHE FOUND OUT THERE WAS A VACCINE THAT COULD HAVE PREVENTED THE CANCER THAT SHE HAD. THE CANCER THAT WAS TO CLAIM HER LIFE. AND SHE DID SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY. SHE CONTACTED THE HEALTH SERVICE EXECUTIVE AND SAID, I WOULD LIKE TO VOLUNTEER WHATEVER I CAN TO COMBAT THIS. SO PEOPLE GET VACCINATED. AND HER CONTRIBUTION WAS EXTRAORDINARY. SHE WAS ABLE TO GIVE HER PERSONAL ACCOUNT. IN DOING SO, SHE REFRAMED THE NARRATIVE. SUDDENLY SHE WAS TELLING PEOPLE, I AM THE REALITY OF AN UNVACCINATED GIRL. NO LONGER WERE PEOPLE CONCENTRATING ON PHANTOM SIDE EFFECTS BUT SEEING WHAT THE VACCINE PREVENTED. THE AGONY AND TRAGEDY THAT COULD BE AVOIDED FROM ALL THIS. IT WAS A SELFLESS ACT. NEXT SLIDE, SLIDE 17, I'D LIKE TO PLAY A VIDEO IF IT WORKS. THIS IS LAURA IN TANDEM WITH W.H.O. DOING AWARENESS VIDEO RELEASED IN FEBRUARY LAST YEAR. I'M NOT SURE IF THIS WILL WORK. DO YOU WANT TO TRY AND PLAY IT FROM THERE?  MY NAME IS LAURA. I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CERVICAL CANCER 2D IN DECEMBER 2016. NO LONGER CURABLE UNFORTUNATELY. I WAKE UP EVERY MORNING, I PUT ON MY MAKEUP AN BIG, NOT TRYING TO HIDE I HAVE CANCER. I LOOK BACK IN THE MIRROR, THAT PERSON IS ME, THE PERSON I WAS BEFORE I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER. I WAS A SALES MANAGER AT THE TIME. I COVERED HALF OF IRELAND. IF I HAVE THE VACCINE I WOULDN'T BE IN THIS TODAY BECAUSE THE VACCINE PROTECTS AGAINST HPV 16 AND HPV 16 CAUSED MY CANCER.  I HAD GIVEN THEM ALL THE VACCINES, NEVER HEARD OF THE HPV VACCINE. IF I HAD COME INTO THE SCHOOLS WHEN LAURA WAS IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS.  WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE VACCINE, LOVE TO HAVE GIVEN IT TO LAURA.  I WAS ORIGINALLY DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER, I REMEMBER SITTING DOWN WITH MY MOTHER, SHE SAID, I WISH THIS HAD HAPPENED TO ME AND NOT YOU. SHE COULDN'T PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING TO ME. THAT'S WHAT HURT HER SO MUCH.  PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE. PREVENTION DEFINITELY IS BETTER THAN NO CURE. UNFORTUNATELY, IN OUR CASE, THERE ISN'T A CURE.  I GO FOR TREATMENT EVERY THREE WEEKS. THAT'S HOPEFULLY GOING TO KEEP MY CANCER AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. I'M SO LUCKY TO HAVE SUCH A FANTASTIC MEDICAL TEAM. WHEN I GOT MY DIAGNOSIS, I DECIDED THAT I WOULD DO ANYTHING TO STOP THIS FROM HAPPENING TO ANYONE ELSE. SOMETIMES WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT CERVICAL CANCER, YOU DON'T THINK THAT COULD BE MY DAUGHTER, OR MY FRIEND. I'M JUST YOUR AVERAGE 25 YEAR OLD GIRL, IT DID HAPPEN TO ME. SO WHAT I WANT TO SAY TO PARENTS IS MAKE SURE YOU'RE GETTING YOUR INFORMATION FROM REPUTABLE SOURCES. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WEBSITES ARE REPUTABLE AND SPEAK TO MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS IF THEY HAVE ANY QUERIES.  ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE SAY THE VACCINE IS SAFE AND PREVENTS A DIFFICULT TO TREAT FORM OF CANCER. PLEASE LISTEN TO LAURA'S STORY, GET THE FACTS, GET THE VACCINE.  I LIVE MY LIFE DAY BY DAY. I NEVER WANT TO BE LOOKING AT A SICK GIRL IN THE MIRROR BECAUSE THAT ISN'T ME IN THE INSIDE. I'M NOT GOING TO LET CANCER CHANGE THAT. AS LONG AS I'M LUCKY TO BE HERE, I WILL CONTINUE TO SHARE THE MESSAGE, TO ANYONE THAT WILL LISTEN. THE HPV VACCINE IS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE. IT IS THE BEST WE HAVE TO PREVENT THIS CANCER FROM HAPPENING.  SO I'D LIKE TO END, THAT SEEMED TO HAVE WORKED. I'D LIKE TO MOVE TO SLIDE 18 PLEASE, THE NEXT ONE. I WAS INCREDIBLY HONORED AND PRIVILEGED TO CALL LAURA A CLOSE FRIEND. A MONTH AFTER THAT VIDEO AIRED, THE W.H.O. LAST YEAR, LAURA PASSED AWAY AGED ONLY 26. AFTER THAT THERE WAS A HUGE OUTPOURING OF PUBLIC GRIEF. BUT IT LAID BARE THE AGONY AND TRAGEDY THE VACCINE CAN PREVENT, LED TO A SURGE IN VACCINATION. UNLIKE THE OTHER COUNTRIES AFFECTED BY THESE CONFIDENCE CRISES, IRELAND HAS SHOWN RECOVERY. WE'RE WELCOME BACK INTO THE HIGH 70s, JAPAN FLOUNDERS AT LESS THAN 1%. I WAS LUCKY TO HEAR HER WORDS. SHE SAID THE VACCINE SAVES LIVES. IT COULD HAVE SAVED MINE. I THINK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT, MOVE TO SLIDE 19, LAST SLIDE PLEASE. THIS IS SOMETHING I WROTE ABOUT RECENTLY. I TALKED A LOT ABOUT LAURA'S LEGACY. I THINK A QUOTE THAT CAME UP WAS THIS, CHANGING MINDS IS VITAL, HEARTS MATTER EVERY BIT AS MUCH. WE ARE NOT INTELLECTUAL AUTOMATONS BUT EMOTIONAL CREATURES WHO FEEL FIRST AND THINK LATER. ALL THE FACTS AND ARGUMENTS AND LOGIC IN THE WORLD ARE FOR NOTHING IF WE CANNOT CONNECT ON AN EMOTIONAL LEVEL. HER STORY SAVED MORE LIVES THAN JOURNAL ARTICLES COULD. THAT'S TRUTH. BY MELDING LAURA'S STORY WITH FACT, SHE FRAMED THE NARRATIVE A DIFFERENT WAY. IT SHOWCASED THE VERY REAL TRAGEDY VACCINATION COULD PREVENT. AND THIS IS CRUCIAL. ALL THE FACTS IN THE WORLD ARE IRRELEVANT IF WE CAN'T SHOW PEOPLE WHY SOMETHING MATTERS. PERSONAL STORIES ARE CENTRAL TO DOING THIS. WE HAVE TO SHOW WITH HUMAN REFERENCE WHY VACCINATION MATTERS, WHY WE CARE SO MUCH ABOUT IT. AND THIS IS A REAL VITAL COMPONENT OF COMBATING THE FICTIONS SO COMMON ABOUT VACCINATION. WE HAVE TO REMIND THE PUBLIC WHY IT MATTERS SO MUCH AND CONSEQUENCES OF US BECOMING COMPLACENT. I'VE PROBABLY GONE FAR OVER TIME. WE'LL LEAVE FOR NOW AND TAKE QUESTIONS, IF THAT HELPS.  THANK YOU, DR. GRIMES. WE'RE GOING TO HOLD QUESTIONS TILL THE END OF THE PANEL AND CALL MISS TAMIKA FELDER TO THE STAGE, OR TO THE PODIUM.  HELLO. THANK YOU ALL FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. I'M TAMIKA FELDER, AND I KNEW LAURA PERSONALLY. AND SHE WAS AN INCREDIBLE YOUNG WOMAN. AND HER LEGACY WILL SURELY LIVE ON, AND AS WE'VE SAID ALL ACROSS THE WORLD, THANK YOU, LAURA. SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT AFTER SEEING HER AND JUST MISSING HER, BEING A PART OF THIS, BUT SHE STILL IS BECAUSE THANKFULLY WE HAVE CAPTURED HER STORY IN VIDEO AND BLOG POSTS AND OTHER PLACES. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE POWER OF PATIENT STORIES LIKE LAURA'S, FOR ME, I WAS DIAGNOSED AT THE AGE OF 25. A YOUNG GIRL GROWING UP THINKING WHAT I WANTED TO DO WITH MY LIFE, HOW I WANTED TO LIVE, CERVICAL CANCER WAS NOT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WROTE IN MY DIARY AS A YOUNG GIRL. I WAS HERE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. WORKING AS A TELEVISION PRODUCER, AND LITERALLY LIVING OUT ALL OF MY HOPES, WISHES AND DREAMS, AND LIFE WAS REALLY GOOD. WHAT I WASN'T DOING BECAUSE I WAS A FREELANCE JOURNALIST WAS I WASN'T GETTING SCREENED FOR CERVICAL CANCER. AT 25, IT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT I THOUGHT ABOUT. IT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT I WORRIED ABOUT. IT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT I THOUGHT MAYBE THIS SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT I WAS DOING. I WAS LIVING MY LIFE. AND THINGS WERE WONDERFUL UNTIL THEY WEREN'T. SO IN 2001, I WENT IN FOR ROUTINE SCREENING AFTER GETTING A NEW JOB THAT OFFERED HEALTH BENEFITS. AND UNFORTUNATELY I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CERVICAL CANCER. TO DATE IT'S ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS I'VE EVER DEALT WITH IN MY LIFE. FORTUNATELY FOR ME I STILL HAVE MY LIFE BUT I DEAL WITH THE SECONDARY EFFECTS OF A CANCER DIAGNOSIS. I LOST MY FERTILITY. SO I AM UNABLE TO CARRY A CHILD, WHICH BRINGS ON EMOTIONAL PAIN THAT EVEN OVER A DECADE LATER IS STILL VERY HARD FOR ME. WHEN I WAS DIAGNOSED, I DID NOT THINK THAT I WOULD GO INTO THIS BECOMING A CANCER ADVOCATE. SO THOSE IN THE ROOM WHO KNOW MY STORY AND THE WORK I DO, IT'S IRONIC BECAUSE I TALK ABOUT THIS CONSTANTLY. AGAIN, IT WAS NOT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THOUGHT GROWING UP I WOULD DO. BUT WHAT I LEARNED ALONG THE WAY IS THAT MAKING MY SURVIVORSHIP COUNT IS HOW I LIVE MY LIFE BEYOND CANCER, BECAUSE AS I SURVIVED, WHAT I REALIZED WAS THAT EVERY DAY THE CANCER STILL HAD HOLD OF MY LIFE, WHEN YOU ARE IF YOU'RE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HEAR THOSE WORDS, NO EVIDENCE OF DISEASE, WE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED CANCER FIRST HAND HAVE TAKEN CARE OF A CAREGIVER, WE KNOW THAT IT DOESN'T END AT TREATMENT. THERE IS YOU KNOW, I LIKEN IT TO IF YOU'RE INTO PUZZLES, YOU PUT PUZZLES TOGETHER, THE PIECES GET WORN, THEY DON'T FIT THE SAME WAY AGAIN. OR AS ONE OF MY SURVIVOR SISTERS ELOQUENTLY SAID, THAT SHE WAS LIKE A SNOW GLOBE THAT'S SHAKEN, SHAKEN, SHAKEN, SHAKEN, AND AS SOON AS THE SNOW FALLS AGAIN IT'S SHAKEN UP AGAIN. THAT'S WHAT LIFE BEYOND CANCER CAN BE LIKE. AND FOR ME, STARTING TO SHARE MY STORY, HOW I HEALED MYSELF, BECAUSE LEARNING THAT CERVICAL CANCER IS LINKED TO THE HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS COMES WITH A DARK CLOUD. I REMEMBER THINKING, WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS CANCER? AND AS A TELEVISION PRODUCER, RESEARCH IS A BIG PART OF WHAT I DO. AND THE MORE THAT I LEARNED ABOUT CERVICAL CANCER, I LEARNED THAT, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS AN HPV VACCINE BEING FDA APPROVED AFTER MY DIAGNOSIS IN 2001. A VACCINE WAS COMING, I KNEW WE HAD TO BE PART OF THAT IN SOME WAY. SO THE BIGGEST PART OF THE WAY THAT I MAKE MY SURVIVORSHIP COUNT IS BY THE ORGANIZATION THAT I RUN, CERVIVOR, WHERE WE HELP NOT ONLY CERVICAL CANCER PATIENTS BUT ANYONE WHO WANTS TO HELP US IN CERVICAL CANCER BECAUSE UNLIKE OTHER CANCERS, WE KNOW THAT WE CAN. THESE ARE SOME OF THE WOMEN WHO ARE PART OF OUR ORGANIZATION. WHEN I STARTED SHARING THIS I THOUGHT, I CREATE A WEBSITE, AGAIN YOU HAVE TO THINK IN 2003 WE DIDN'T HAVE FACEBOOK. WE KNOW THAT THE HPV VACCINE IS OLDER THAN NOT ONLY THE iPHONE BUT FACEBOOK AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS. AND I LIKE TO SHARE THAT, WHEN PEOPLE SAY IT HASN'T BEEN AROUND LONG ENOUGH OR THIS HASN'T HAPPENED. BUT WHEN I STARTED SHARING MY STORY I THOUGHT YOU BUILD IT, THEY WILL COME. AND NO ONE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IT. NO ONE WANTED TO BE THE FACE OF CERVICAL CANCER. AND WHEN WE STARTED SHARING THE STORIES, WE STARTED WITH SIX STORIES THAT INCLUDED MINE. AS TIME WENT ON, MORE AND MORE PEOPLE CAME, THEY WANTED TO SHARE THEIR STORY BEHIND THE SCENES BUT NOT PUBLICLY BE THE FACE. WE STARTED HOLDING SURVIVOR SCHOOLS, EDUCATIONAL, WHICH ARE PART EDUCATIONAL RETREAT, PART ADVOCACY TRAINING, AND SLOWLY BUT SURELY THESE WOMEN STARTED JOINING AND THEY REALLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT MEANT TO BE INFORMED, EMPOWERED, ALIVE, ALSO UNDERSTANDING THAT UNLIKE OTHER CANCERS WHERE WE'RE STILL TRYING TO WIN THE WAR ON CANCER WHICH IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT, WITH CERVICAL CANCER AND NOW THESE OTHER HPV RELATED CANCERS WE CAN DO SOMETHING RIGHT NOW. AS WE STARTED DOING THAT, AND PEOPLE STARTED SEEING PEOPLE LIKE LAURA, MYSELF, MICHELLE WHITTLOCK AND MANY OTHER WOMEN SHARE STORIES, THEY WANT TO SHARE STORIES TOO. THAT'S WHERE THE WEBSITE, WE HAVE OVER 100 WOMEN WHO HAVE UPLOADED THEIR STORIES, AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT CANCER IN GENERAL YOU MAY THINK A HUNDRED DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A LOT. BUT FOR A CANCER LIKE CERVICAL CANCER, IT IS A LOT. WE SHARE OUR STORIES, WE SHARE OUR FACE, WE SHARE WHAT STATE OUR COUNTRY WE'RE FROM. WE SHARE HOW CANCER IMPACTED US, AND WHAT IT'S DONE TO US BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HEARD A LOT WAS, WELL, CERVICAL CANCER IS AN EASY CANCER. I KNOW WORKING HERE WHEN I WAS COVERING A STORY AND THE HPV VACCINE HAD JUST COME OUT, THERE WAS A LEGISLATOR WHO WAS VERY ANTI HPV VACCINE BECAUSE A LOT OF FAKE NEWS AND OTHER THINGS THAT WE HEAR, THE MISINFORMATION THAT'S OUT THERE. AND SHE SAID TO ME, SHE SAID, WELL, YOU SEEM LIKE YOU'RE DOING FINE SINCE YOUR CANCER DIAGNOSIS. AND IT OCCURRED TO ME THEN, WHAT IT DID WAS LIGHT A FIRE IN ME. SHE SAID, WE CAN WAIT TILL YOUNG WOMEN, BECAUSE AT THE TIME THE HPV VACCINE WAS ONLY APPROVED FOR WOMEN, WE CAN WAIT TILL WOMEN ARE OLD ENOUGH AND MAKE A DECISION. I REALIZED, SHE DIDN'T GET IT. HERE I AM, NOT A DOCTOR, NOT A MEDICAL PERSON. BUT I KNEW IT WASN'T ABOUT DIAGNOSING THE CANCER, LETTING THE CANCER RUN ITS COURSE, AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY YOU ONLY LOSE YOUR FERTILITY. BUT IT WAS ABOUT PREVENTING IT. THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO BE A PART OF. SO AT CERVIVOR WE WANT TO BE A PART OF PREVENTING CERVICAL CANCER. PREVENTING HPV CANCERS. BECAUSE WE KNOW WE CAN. WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ASIDE MANY OF YOU WHO ARE HERE TODAY WHO ARE LISTENING AND WATCHING ONLINE, YOU'VE DONE INCREDIBLE WORK. BUT WE'RE THE ONES THAT MAKE IT REAL. I HAD A WOMAN JUST THIS WEEK WHO I THOUGHT SHE WAS READY TO SHARE HER STORY. AND I WAS GOING TO SHARE IT THIS WEEK. SHE TOLD ME, I'M NOT READY YET. I RESPECT THAT BECAUSE THE SHAME IS REAL. THE ANTI VAXERS WHO COME AFTER US ARE REAL. BUT I AM PROUD OF EVERY SINGLE WOMAN AND MAN WHO SHARES THEIR HPV STORIES BECAUSE WE'RE DOING OUR PART TO HELP YOU. WE KNOW THE RESEARCH IS THERE. WE KNOW WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. THESE ARE THREE SURVIVORS. THERE'S BECKY, WHO IS THE ONE WITH NO HAIR. THERE IS CAROL, WHO IS IN THE MIDDLE, A DOUBLE OSTOMY. THERE IS ANNA, ON THE END, WHO DEALS WITH MASSIVE EFFECTS OF RADIATION DAMAGE. THEY ARE ALL SMILING BECAUSE WE'RE ALL STILL HERE. BUT BECKY'S CANCER HAS BEEN DEEMED INCURABLE. SHE'S CURRENTLY FIGHTING AS HARD AS SHE CAN. SHE HOSTED THIS EVENT LAST SUNDAY. THIS WAS AT HER HOUSE. SO ONE OF THE MESSAGES SHE RECEIVED ONCE HOSTING IT WAS FROM A MOM WHO SAID THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME. I HAVE BEEN VERY WORRIED ABOUT THAT SHOT FOR A COUPLE YEARS NOW. AFTER HEARING YOUR STORIES, THREE STORIES OF THE WOMEN FEATURED THERE, I AM DEFINITELY GETTING IT FOR RILEY. YOU'RE SO BRAVE, ALWAYS IN MY PRAYERS. SHE RECEIVED ANOTHER MESSAGE AFTER THAT FROM A WOMAN WHO HADN'T BEEN SCREENED FOR CERVICAL CANCER AND I FORGET HOW MANY YEARS, BUT SHE SENT BECKY A SCREEN SHOT OF HER AND HER OB/GYN'S OFFICE. IN HER PAPER GOWN GETTING HER EXAM. WHAT WE KNOW IS STORIES ARE POWERFUL. WHEN IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE ONLY PUSHING THE NEEDLE, THINGS LIKE THIS COME ALONG AND REMIND US TO KEEP GOING BECAUSE THIS IS HARD WORK. ESPECIALLY FOR US BEING PATIENTS, WHO LOSE OUR COMRADES EVERY SINGLE DAY. AS A TELEVISION PRODUCER EVERYTHING I DO IN CERVIVOR IS DOCUMENTED, TO THE CHAGRIN OF THE WOMEN. THEY KNOW I'M GOING TO HAVE A MICROPHONE OR CAMERA OR PHOTOGRAPHER IN THEIR FACE. WE WANT TO MAKE IT KNOWN YOU CAN'T NECESSARILY SEE EFFECTS CERVICAL CANCER WHEN I WALK BY BUT IT'S REAL. CERVICAL CANCER IS A DIFFICULT DISEASE THAT IS NOT ONLY PHYSICALLY HARD BUT EMOTIONALLY AND SPIRITUALLY. IN 2017 WE HELD SURVIVOR SCHOOL IN DELRAY BEACH, FLORIDA, I MET A YOUNG WOMAN, LISA, TERMINAL WHEN SHE CAME, NORMALLY SURVIVOR SCHOOL IS NOT FOR TERMINAL WOMEN BUT WHAT WE LEARNED, HOW LAURA BRENNAN FROM IRELAND GOT TO SURVIVOR SCHOOL IN 2016, THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE TERMINAL, THEY MATTER. THEIR STORIES MATTER. WHAT LISA SAID TO ME UPON LEAVING SCHOOL WHEN SHE COULDN'T MAKE IT HOME BECAUSE CANCER WAS RAVAGING HER BODY, SHE WANTED PEOPLE TO KNOW WHAT CERVICAL CANCER HAS DONE TO ME, I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW WHY THEY SHOULD GET AN HPV SHOT FOR THEM OR THEIR CHILDREN.  I'M 30 YEARS OLD. I LIVE IN SOUTH BEND, INDIANA. I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH STAGE 1B 1 ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE CERVIX AT 26. TUBES ARE NOT FUN. SIDE EFFECTS ARE NOT FUN. IF SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS PREVENTIBLE I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO PREVENT IT. IF THERE'S A LEUKEMIA VACCINE OR BREAST CANCER, OR PROSTATE CANCER OR ANYTHING NOT RELATED TO SEX, THERE'S REALLY NO QUESTION. CANCER SUCKS. IT TAKES AND TAKES AND TAKES. AND MAJORITY OF THE TIME, IT TAKES EVERYTHING AND KILLS YOU. IF I CAN HELP SOMEBODY ELSE NOT GO THROUGH THIS, THAT'S PROBABLY THE BEST THING I CAN OFFER AT THIS POINTS.  SADLY LISA LOST HER FIGHT WITH CERVICAL CANCER BUT HER STORY HAS BEEN SEEN AROUND THE WORLD. I'M ALWAYS HAPPY TO SEND HER PARENTS AN E MAIL AND LET THEM KNOW EVERY COUNTRY, EVERY PLACE HER STORY HAS BEEN SHARED. OOPS. THESE ARE A FEW OF THE WOMEN IN OUR CERVIVOR COMMUNITY WE LOST, YOU SEE LAURA BRENNAN ON THE END. WE COULD NOT FIT EVERYONE INTO ONE SLIDE. THAT WAS DEEPLY TROUBLING TO ME. I KNOW THAT WE CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN, DESPITE THE ANTI VAX MOVEMENT. I KNOW WORKING TOGETHER, THAT WE'RE STRONGER TOGETHER, AND WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. WE HAVE TO. I KNOW THAT I COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN THERE. SO FOR ME THAT IS WHY I SHARE MY STORY. THAT IS WHY I CONTINUE TO DO THIS WORK, BECAUSE IT COULD HAVE BEEN ME. SO I'M A SURVIVOR. AND I WILL CONTINUE TO SHARE MY STORY AND WORK WITH EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT WE END HPV CANCERS. REACH OUT TO ME ANYTIME YOU WANT. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF M CERVIVOR STORY AND SISTERS.  MISS MAROTTA?  I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT ALONG THE SAME LINES OF WHAT TAMIKA WAS TALKING ABOUT, ADDRESSING VACCINE HESITANCY WITH STORY TELLING. WE KNOW THAT VACCINE HESITANCY, ANTI VACCINATION SENTIMENT, IS A PROBLEM. THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION HAS IDENTIFIED IT AS ONE OF THE TOP TEN GLOBAL THREATS. SO WHAT CAN WE DO WHEN WE'RE HAVING TO DEAL WITH THIS TYPE OF THING AND GET PEOPLE THE RIGHT INFORMATION AND ADDRESS THE MISINFORMATION THAT'S OUT THERE. I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THREE MAIN THINGS TODAY. COMMUNICATION PANELS THAT WE USE AS ORGANIZATION I'M AFFILIATED WITH, FAMILIES FIGHTING FLU, I WILL GIVE YOU OUR OBSERVATION AT THE ORGANIZATION ON OUR DOs AND DON'Ts. WHAT HAS WORKED FOR US OVER THE YEARS COMMUNICATING WITH PEOPLE, ALONG THAT SPECTRUM OF VACCINE HESITANCY, WHAT HASN'T WORKED. AND THEN ALSO SIMILAR TO TAMIKA, HIGHLIGHTING IMPORTANCE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF SHARING PERSONAL STORIES. ONE COMMON THEME I SEEM TO SEE EVERYWHERE, I'M A SCIENTIST, I LOVE FACTS AND DATA AND STATISTICS AND THEY HAVE A PLACE IN THE CONVERSATION BUT I THINK CONTINUALLY WHAT IS LACKING IS THAT PRO VACCINATION PATIENT VOICE. SO JUST VERY BRIEFLY FAMILIES FLIGHTING FLU IS A NON PROFIT ORGANIZATION AROUND FOR 15 YEARS, WE FOCUS ON EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY. A LOT OF FAMILIES HAVE PERSONAL STORIES THAT SHARE THOSE STORIES WITH US, AND THAT WE WEAVE INTO A LOT OF EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGNS AND INITIATIVES. THIS IS MY STORY. I JUST WANT TO TAKE A COUPLE MOMENTS AND TELL YOU ABOUT MY JOSEPH. IN OCTOBER 2009, MY JOSEPH WAS A HEALTHY 5 YEAR OLD BOY. HE WAS ATTENDING KINDERGARTEN. HE WAS FUN. HE WAS LOVING. HE LIKES "STAR WARS" AND TRANSFORMERS. HE LOVED RIDING THE SCHOOL BUS. I'VE NEVER SEEN A KID SO HAPPY TO GET ON A SCHOOL BUS AND GO TO SCHOOL, BUT HE JUST WAS SO EXCITED EVERY DAY TO GET ON THE SCHOOL BUS. HIS ILLNESS STARTED INNOCENTLY ENOUGH. HE CAME DOWN WITH FLU. WE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS FLU IN THE BEGINNING. HE WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL, AFTER FALLING ILL, WE TOOK HIM TO URGENT CARE, THE HOSPITAL DIAGNOSED HIM PNEUMONIA, FINALLY INFLUENZA. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN PRO IMMUNIZATION. I HAVE ALWAYS DONE AS ANY PARENT WOULD THE VERY BEST THAT I COULD TO PROTECT MY CHILDREN FROM WHAT I THOUGHT THE MAJOR THREATS WERE TO THEM. SO JOSEPH WAS IN THE HOSPITAL FOR A TOTAL OF TEN DAYS. THEY WERE TREATING HIM, WHEN WE GOT THE DIAGNOSIS OF PNEUMONIA WE'RE IN THE HOSPITAL, WE'LL DEAL WITH THIS. WE GOT THE DIAGNOSIS OF FLEW, WE GOT DIAGNOSIS OF H1N1 DOCTORS SAID IT'S JUST THE FLU. I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WAS UNDER CONTROL. WE WERE IN A CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL DOING YOUR DUE DILIGENCE, HE WAS UNDER GOOD CARE. MY HUSBAND AND I WERE THERE, TALKING TO THE NURSES AND DOCTORS. HE WAS RELATIVELY STABLE, HAD BEEN DOWNGRADED FROM ICU. SEVERAL DAYS INTO HIS HOSPITAL STAY WE WERE TALKING ABOUT DISCHARGE, FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES I THOUGHT I WAS LEAVING THAT HOSPITAL WITH MY SON. DAY 9, HIS BLOOD PRESSURE PLUMMETED. THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHY. WE WENT BACK TO THE ICU. RUNNING ALL KINDS OF TESTS. AND I WILL TELL YOU IN ALL HONESTY, I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WAS OKAY UNTIL THAT EVENING, THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME IT OCCURRED TO ME, WAIT A MINUTE, SOMETHING IS NOT ADDING UP, SOMETHING IS WRONG. THEY WERE RUNNING ALL KINDS OF TESTS, EVERYTHING WAS COMING BACK NORMAL. WE WERE SO COMFORTABLE IN HIS CARE THAT MY HUSBAND LEFT WITH OUR 7 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND TOOK HER HOME AND SAID I'LL BE BACK IN THE MORNING. ALL NIGHT LONG THEY WERE DOING TESTING, THE NEXT MORNING THEY CAME TO ME AND SAID BECAUSE HIS RESPIRATION, HEART RATE IS HIGH, WE WANT TO PUT HIM ON A VENTILATORS TO MAKE HIM COMFORTABLE, NOT A BIG DEAL. I CALMLY TOLD MY HUSBAND TO COME TO THE HOSPITAL. I WAS TALKING TO JOSEPH WHO HAD BEEN AWAKE, AND RATHER GRUMPY ABOUT ALL THE TESTING ALL NIGHT LONG. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HALLOWEEN COSTUMES. IT WAS OCTOBER 18. HE CODED, THEY CAME IN, AND THEY WERE WORKING ON HIM, AND I THINK STILL MY MOMMY BRAIN WAS LIKE, THEY ARE GOING TO FIX THIS. THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE THIS RIGHT. AND I WAS STANDING OUTSIDE HIS ROOM, THEY BROUGHT ME IN, AND THEY WERE CONTINUING TO WORK ON HIM. I KNEW THINGS WERE SERIOUS. I STEPPED OUT OF THE ROOM. MY HUSBAND COMES IN, IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS CHAOS. AND AT ONE POINT THE ATTENDING DOCTOR CAME OUT AND SHE WAS SOBBING. SHE SAID, I NEED YOU TO COME IN THE ROOM WITH ME. AT THAT POINT THEY HAD BEEN WORKING ON JOSEPH FOR OVER 35 MINUTES. SHE TOOK MY HAND. SHE LED ME INTO THAT ROOM. I SAW MY SON. MY HEALTHY 5 YEAR OLD SON LAYING ON THE TABLE. WITH A NURSE GIVING HIM CHEST COMPRESSION. LISTENING TO THE DOCTOR. AFTER 35 MINUTES, THE DOCTOR TURNED TO ME AND SAID I AM SO SORRY. I LEFT THAT DAY, THAT HOSPITAL, WITHOUT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT REASONS FOR MY LIVING. AND I HAD NO IDEA, NONE, THAT HEALTHY CHILDREN OR ADULTS DIED FROM INFLUENZA. OR OTHER VACCINE PREVENTIBLE DISEASES. I DON'T REMEMBER EVER HEARING THOSE STORIES. SO VERY SOON AFTER JOSEPHS HAD PASSED AWAY, I HAD TO SHARE JOSEPH'S STORY, LET PEOPLE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO US IN THE HOPES OF MAKING SOMETHING GOOD COME OUT OF MY TRAGEDY. WE ARE TRYING TO HELP PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING TO OTHER FAMILIES. SO THE 2019 2020 FLU BURDEN RIGHT KNOW, THIS MORNING 92 PEDIATRIC DEATHS, ACCORDING TO THE PRELIMINARY BURDEN ESTIMATE FROM CDC ALREADY UP WARDS OF 36,000 DEATHS. ON A GLOBAL SCALE, APPROXIMATELY 650,000 DEATHS ACCORDING INFLUENZA RELATED. ONE THING THAT I TALK ABOUT WHEN I TALK ABOUT JOSEPH'S STORY IS I DON'T KNOW WHO HIS PATIENT ZERO WAS. HE DIED DURING THE PANDEMIC THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A STRANGE FLU YEAR, OBVIOUSLY, BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. HE HAD HIS SEASONAL FLU VACCINE. HOWEVER, WE KNOW H1N1 PANDEMIC STRAIN WAS NOT IN THE VACCINE THAT YEAR. I DON'T DWELL ON IT BUT DO OFTEN THINK WHO IS JOSEPH'S PATIENT ZERO. WAS IT SOMEONE IN HIS KINDERGARTEN CLASS? WAS IT SOMEONE AT THE SUPERMARKET? THAT, FOR ME, IS VERY MOTIVATING BECAUSE WHEN I GET VACCINATED, I DON'T DO IT JUST TO PROTECT MYSELF. I ALSO DO IT TO PROTECT MY FAMILY, I DO IT TO PROTECT OTHER PEOPLE I COME INTO CONTACT WITH, WITHIN MY COMMUNITY, SO FOR ME I ALWAYS TRY TO RELATE THAT TO PEOPLE AND GET THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT US AND OUR INDIVIDUAL HEALTH. I WILL SAY I HAVE GONE AROUND AND SHARED JOSEPH'S STORY AT A LOT OF PLACES, CONFERENCES, SYMPOSIA, MEETINGS, TALKED WITH PEOPLE IN THE GROCERY LINE, AT THE SUPERMARKET, AND IT ALWAYS ASTOUNDS ME HOW MANY MINDS I HAVE CHANGED. THERE'S PROBABLY SO MANY THAT I DON'T KNOW OF BUT EVERY TIME I'VE GONE AND SPOKEN, SOMEONE ALWAYS USUALLY SNEAKS UP TO ME AFTERWARDS AND SAYS, YOU KNOW, I KNOW THE DATA, I KNOW THE STATISTICS, I KNOW RECOMMENDATION FOR FLU VACCINATION, BUT IT'S BECAUSE OF YOUR STORY TODAY THAT I'M GOING TO GO HOME AND I'M GOING TO GET VACCINATED AND GET MY KIDS VACCINATED. SO I CAN'T SIMILAR TO TAMIKA PERSONAL STORIES RESONATE WITH PEOPLE. THEY HAVE SUCH POWER. I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE RELATABLE. PEOPLE LOOK AT ME THEY THINK, GOSH, I COULD BE HER, THAT COULD BE MY CHILD, UNCLE, SISTER, BROTHER. THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT SHARING YOUR STORY PUBLICLY IS THAT SOMETIMES YOU DO END UP IN THE BULLS EYE OF FOLKS WHO ARE ANTI VACCINATION, AND FOR THOSE BRAVE ENOUGH TO SHARE OUR STORIES WE KNOW THAT'S A RISK. BUT WE DO IT ANYWAYS FOR THE GREATER GOOD. SO WHEN I HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE ABOUT FLU AND VACCINATION, THESE ARE MY THREE TENETS, IF YOU WILL. I THINK IN MY BRAIN THIS INNER DIALOGUE IS GOING ON, HOW CAN I GET THEM TO CARE ABOUT THIS? WHY SHOULD IT BE IMPORTANT TO THEM? AND THEN I TRY TO CONVEY TO THEM WHAT ARE THE REAL RISKS TO THEM, RIGHT? WE DO TEND TO BE A LITTLE SELF CENTERED. SO I TRY TO EXPLAIN TO THEM, THIS IS A REAL RISK. FLU IS A RISK. DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE. AND THEN THIRDLY, PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE, I ARM THEM WITH KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION THEY NEED SO THAT THEY FEEL EMPOWERED TO MAKE THAT INFORMED DECISION ABOUT VACCINATION. SO OUR COMMUNICATION STRATEGY HERE AT THE ORGANIZATION IS WE TRY TO REALLY MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE. WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT? THERE'S A LOT OF COMMUNICATION GOING ON OUT THERE. I THINK WE'VE HEARD OVER THE PAST TWO DAYS JUST HOW MUCH AND WE I THINK AS A SOCIETY ARE SO OVERWHELMED WITH INFORMATION. BUT THESE ARE THE CHANNELS THAT WE TRY TO REALLY STAY ACTIVE ON. SOCIAL MEDIA IS A BIG ONE. SEVERAL PRESENTATIONS TALKED ABOUT IMPORTANCE OF SOCIAL MEDIA. MAKING SURE THAT YOU ARE ON MULTIPLE CHANNELS, REACHING PEOPLE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SPENDING THEIR TIME ON DIFFERENT PLATFORMS. DIGITAL MEDIA, OUR WEBSITE. EARNED MEDIA IS ANOTHER BIG ONE FOR US. MEDIA CAN BE FICKLE BUT OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS WE HAVE REACHED MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THROUGH MEDIA OPPORTUNITIES. WHEN MY PHONE RINGS THEY WANT TO TALK TO US AND REMEMBER WE HAVE A PANEL OF MEDICAL EXPERTS WE OFFER TO THEM AS WELL, NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN THEY WANT TO TALK TO A FAMILY, ANOTHER IMPORTANT COMMUNICATION CHANNEL WE USE EVERY FLU SEASON. OBVIOUSLY JUST THROUGH STAKEHOLDERS NETWORKS AND STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS. WE HAVE TO THINK WHO AM I TRYING TO COMMUNICATE WITH, WHERE ARE THEY GETTING THEIR INFORMATION, SO IT'S REALLY NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL WHEN IT COMES TO COMMUNICATING TO FOLKS. SO SOCIAL MEDIA IS A CRITICAL CHANNEL. THESE DATA ARE FROM THE PEW RESEARCH CENTER. I JOKINGLY ALWAYS SAY FOR ME BECAUSE I'M A 47 YEAR OLD MOM, I GET MY INFORMATION FROM FACEBOOK, AND FREQUENTLY MY HUSBAND WILL SAY, OH, DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS? I'M LIKE, WAS IT ON FACEBOOK? IF IT WASN'T, YOU KNOW, BUT IT GOES TO SHOW THAT, YOU KNOW, IT CAN BE AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF INFORMATION. YOU KNOW, THESE STATISTICS INDICATE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GETTING THEIR INFORMATION FROM SOCIAL MEDIA. AND THAT'S DANGEROUS SOMETIMES, RIGHT? BECAUSE OF THAT MISINFORMATION. THE FACT SO MUCH OF THAT INFORMATION IS NOT REGULATED. IT'S REALLY UP TO US AS CONSUMERS AND PATIENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE SEEKING OUT REPUTABLE SOURCES. AND THAT'S WHAT WE MESSAGE ON AT THE ORGANIZATION. HERE IS OUR COMMUNICATION DOs, BASED ON WHAT WE'VE DONE OVER THE YEARS. OBVIOUSLY WE ARE AN ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION. WE UNDERSTAND THAT OUR MODE OF COMMUNICATION AND WHAT WE COMMUNICATE ON IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT FROM OTHER FOLKS. WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE SAME GUARD RAILS THAT OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE. CERTAINLY WE ALWAYS TRY TO BE EVIDENCE BASED IN OUR MESSAGING. USING MULTIPLE CHANNELS, CONNECTING WITH THEM, WE'RE IF I HAVE ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER, LINKED IN, YouTube, INSTAGRAM. BREAK DOWN, IT'S NOT THE SAME PEOPLE. WE TRY TO THINK ABOUT WHO WE ARE MESSAGING, WHO TIME OF MESSAGES RESONATE, WHAT CONTENT DO THEY NEED TO HEAR. WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION CAN WE PUT IN FRONT OF THEM. REALLY THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF ENGAGEMENT AND DIALOGUE IS HAPPENING. WE DO MORE THAN OUR FAIR SHARE OF COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT. BUT THAT IS SOMETIMES WHERE THE CONVERSATION IS HAPPENING. SO THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE SPENDING OUR TIME. ONE IMPORTANT THING I WANT TO POINT OUT TOO IS, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE DIALOGUING ON LET'S SAY FACEBOOK YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT SILENT OBSERVERS, PEOPLE WHO AREN'T DIRECTLY ENGAGING ON THAT PARTICULAR POST OR THREAD BUT LET ME TELL YOU THERE'S PEOPLE STALKING THAT INFORMATION. SO WHEN I MIGHT BE RESPONDING TO ONE INDIVIDUAL, I'M THINKING WHO ELSE IS GOING TO SEE THIS, SOMETHING WE KEEP IN OUR MIND. BEING CONSISTENT IN OUR MESSAGING, BEING THE TRUSTED RESOURCE. I HEARD TRUST A LOT, IT HITS THE NAIL ON THE HEAD. PEOPLE WILL NOT BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING UNLESS YOU EARN THEIR TRUST. WE TRY TO USE THAT PEER TO PEER INFLUENCE AS PARENTS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE LIKE YOU, TRYING TO HELP PROTECT OUR KIDS AND FAMILIES. WE TRY TO BE TIMELY IN OUR INFORMATION, WHETHER TALKING ABOUT FLU SURVEILLANCE, RESEARCH, WHAT HAVE YOU. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE VIEWING US AS A REPUTABLE SOURCE THAT'S KEEPING THEM UP TO DATE ON FLU RELATED ISSUES. BEING CREATIVE IS KEY. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALWAYS STRUGGLE WITH EVERY YEAR IS HOW DO WE SAY GET VACCINATED IN A CREATED WAY EVERY YEAR, RIGHT? YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT AUDIENCE FATIGUE, SOMETHING WE'RE CONSCIOUS ABOUT, WE DON'T WE WANT TO KEEP IT FRESH, NEW AND ENGAGING. WE ARE EVIDENCE BASED, RELY ON SCIENCE. WE TALK ABOUT FACTS AND STATISTICS, IMPORTANT FOR SURE, KNOWING YOUR AUDIENCE LIKE I JUST SAID, IDENTIFYING WITH THEM, KEEPING THE CONVERSATIONS RESPECTFUL AND COMPASSIONATE. I WILL TELL YOU I HAVE RECEIVED DEATH THREATS, I HAVE BEEN CALLED EVERY NAME IN THE BOOK. I'M SURE A LOT OF US IN THIS ROOM HAVE BEEN. BUT I ALWAYS HOLD MYSELF TO A STANDARD THAT I REMAIN RESPECTFUL AND COMPASSIONATE. WHEN I CAN'T DO THAT I EXIT THE CONVERSATION. AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE OUR COMMUNICATIONS ARE SIMPLE AND TRANSPARENT TOO. SHARING RELATABLE PERSONAL STORIES, IT'S AMAZING WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR SOCIAL MEDIA METRICS AND THE TYPE OF CONTENT WE'RE PUTTING OUT THERE, TIME AND TIME AGAIN THE ENGAGEMENT OF PERSONAL STORIES GOES THROUGH THE ROOF. YOUR GOAL IS TO ENGAGE AUDIENCE, HELP THEM MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS. WHEN I SHARE JOSEPH'S STORY WITH SOMEONE, I DON'T SHOVE IT DOWN THEIR THROAT. I MEAN I SHARE IT IN A COMPASSIONATE WAY AND SAY, THIS IS JUST ANOTHER PIECE OF INFORMATION. THIS IS ANOTHER DATA POINT FOR YOU TO CONSIDER. AND I THINK, AGAIN, HOPEFULLY LEADING THEM TO BELIEVE THAT I'M EMPOWERING THAT EMPOWERING THEM WITH EDUCATION. I'M NOT MAKING THEM FEEL LIKE I'M BEING JUDGMENTAL OR TAKING ANYTHING AWAY. STORYING TELLING IS IMPORTANT. WE HAD A BEHAVIORAL SCIENTIST ON THE PANEL EARLIER, BRILLIANT, AND I'M NOT A BEHAVIORAL SCIENTIST BUT THERE'S THEORIES. WE CALL OUR STORY TELLING NARRATIVE COMMUNICATION. THERE'S SEVERAL THEORIES WE CAN RELY ON TO TRY TO INFLUENCE PEOPLE'S HEALTH RELATED BEHAVIOR. MOST OF OURS PROBABLY FALLS INTO THE HEALTH BELIEF MODEL BECAUSE WHEN WE'RE SHARING PERSONAL STORIES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SUSCEPTIBILITY, SEVERITY, THAT TYPE OF THING. SO THIS IS THE STATISTIC ABOUT A STATISTIC WHICH I ALWAYS FIND FUNNY BUT THIS WAS FROM A PSYCHOLOGIST BY THE NAME OF JEROME BRUNER. I SAW THIS PROBABLY A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. IT STRUCK ME, I PULLED IT OUT. BUT STORIES ARE 22 TIMES MORE MEMORABLE THAN STATISTICS. AGAIN, IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T AGREE WHOLEHEARTEDLY THAT DATA AND STATISTICS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE NARRATIVE BUT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO REMEMBER THOSE PERSONAL STORIES BECAUSE THEY ARE RELATABLE. SO JUST QUICKLY, SOME OF OUR COMMUNICATION DON'TS, DON'T BE JUDGMENTAL, I THINK THAT'S REALLY HARD SOMETIMES ESPECIALLY FOR ME BECAUSE I AM SO EMOTIONALLY INVESTED AND CLOSE TO IT THAT WHEN I SEE SOMEONE WHO IS IN THAT ANTI VACCINATION GROUP, SAY SOMETHING NASTY, I HAVE TO HAVE THAT INNER DIALOGUE WITH MYSELF AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GOING TO THINK AND BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE JUST TRYING TO DO THE BEST THEY CAN WITH THE INFORMATION THAT THEY HAVE. THEIR OBJECTIVE IS SAME AS MINE, THAT'S TO HELP PROTECT THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. AVOID AUDIENCE FATIGUE, KEEPING IT CREATIVE, AS FAR AS MESSAGING, I THINK MAKING SURE THAT THE INFORMATION IS NOT TECHNICAL. PEOPLE'S EYES WILL GLAZE OVER. WE DISTILL TO CONVEY INFORMATION IN A WAY THAT IS EASILY UNDERSTANDABLE. PUTTING EVERYTHING INTO CONTEXT IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT. WHEN I SAY DON'T ASSUME AUTHORITATIVE POSITION I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT PRESUMPTIVE APPROACH WITH HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS, I BELIEVE THAT'S SOMETHING ALL HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS SHOULD TAKE AND USE, THIS MORE RELATES TO BEING JUDGMENTAL. PEOPLE DON'T LIKE PEOPLE BEING TOLD THEIR WRONG OTHER MADE TO FEEL LIKE THEY KNOW LESS. WE TRY TO KEEP THAT IN MIND WHEN MESSAGING WITH PEOPLE. FEAR MONGERING IS NOT SOMETHING WE DO. THAT'S A DELICATE KIND OF BALANCE SHARING PERSONAL STORIES, WE HAVE PERSONAL STORIES OF LOSS, OF SURVIVORSHIP. THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO IS HAVE IT APPEAR WE'RE USING STORIES IN A MALICIOUS WAY TO SCARE PEOPLE. PRESENTATION IS EVERYTHING. THE WAY WE SHARE THOSE STORIES IS VERY IMPORTANT. WE WANT IT TO BE DONE IN A COMPASSIONATE WAY, NOT A FEAR MONGERING WAY. WHAT WE DO IS ALIGN OUR MESSAGING. I THINK THE MORE UNITED WE ALL ARE IN WHAT OUR MESSAGING IS, THE BETTER. IT LEADS BACK TO THE CONSISTENCY AGAIN. SO THIS PICTURE HERE IS A PICTURE OF MADDIE ELLEN, ONE OF OUR FAMILIES. I FREQUENTLY SAY IF I SAID NOTHING ELSE AND PUT THIS PICTURE UP AND SAID THIS IS WHAT FLU CAN DO, THIS PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS. SHE WAS HOSPITALIZED FOR 93 DAYS, GIVEN 1% CHANCE TO LIVE. MIRACULOUSLY SHE DID LIVE. SHE HAS SERIOUS LIFELONG MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS AS A RESULT OF THE ILLNESS BUT AGAIN WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE USING THESE PATIENT STORIES IN THEIR CONVERSATIONS WITH PATIENTS. IF YOU'RE A HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL, WE USE THEM ON SOCIAL MEDIA, LIKE I MENTIONED. DIGITAL MEDIA. WE HAVE I BELIEVE OVER 50 STORIES, FAMILY STORIES, ACROSS THE LIFESPAN, NOT JUST CHILDREN. OF PEOPLE WHO HAD PERSONAL EXPERIENCES WITH FLU. AGAIN, SOME LOST, SOME SURVIVORS, IN EARNED MEDIA. AGAIN, IT COMES BACK TO THE RELATABLE CONTENT. ONE THING THAT WE'VE REALLY MADE A CONCERTED EFFORT TO DO AT THE ORGANIZATION IS TO DIVERSIFY OUR FAMILY STORIES BECAUSE PEOPLE RELATE TO PEOPLE THAT THEY IDENTIFY WITH SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AGE, GENDER, ETHNICITY, SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO OUR VERY BEST TO SHARE SOME OF THAT RELATED CONTENT AS PART OF OUR MESSAGING. SO I'LL END WITH THIS SLIDE. THIS IS JUST A LITTLE COLLAGE BY NO MEANS THESE PICTURES DO NOT REPRESENT ALL OF OUR FAMILY STORIES. BUT WE PUT A FACE ON THE FLU. THIS IS MOST SIMPLE TERMS, WHAT WE DO. GOAL IS TO SAVE LIVES. AND I KNOW I SHARED EARLIER WHAT MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN, WHERE EVERY TIME SOMEONE SNEAKS UP TO ME AFTERWARDS AND SAYS I'M GOING TO GET VACCINATED AFTER I HEARD YOUR STORY, OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS GO AND SPEAK EVERYWHERE, THEY HAVE THE SAME STORIES, THEY COME HOME WITH. OH MY GOSH, I CHANGED SOMEBODY'S MIND TODAY. I DON'T HAVE A SURVEY AND METRICS BUT IT'S SOMETHING WE EXPERIENCE ON A DAILY BASIS. YESTERDAY THERE WERE SCIENTIFIC PRESENTATIONS ABOUT UNIVERSAL FLU VACCINE, THAT'S WONDERFUL, THE VACCINES SAVE LIVES. THERE'S NO QUESTION. THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THEY ARE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE. IT'S LOVELY WE'RE DOING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS TO HAVE A BETTER FLU VACCINE. WHERE I COME FROM WE STILL IT'S NOT THE END ALL, BE ALL, FIX ALL. WE HAVE TO COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE AND LET THEM KNOW FLU IS A RISK TO THEM. WE STILL HAVE TO FIND WAYS TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM BECAUSE HAVING A VACCINE ON THE SHELF DOESN'T DO US ANY GOOD. WE NEED TO GET IT IN PEOPLE'S ARMS. SO LASTLY I WILL JUST LEAVE YOU WITH THE SENTIMENT THAT I CAN'T CHANGE MY STORY. I CAN'T CHANGE JOSEPH'S STORY OR CHANGE THE STORIES OF THESE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE FACES THAT YOU SEE IN FRONT OF YOU. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE CAN HONOR THEM AND WE CAN USE THESE STORIES AGAIN IN A COMPASSIONATE PALATABLE WAY TO CHANGE VACCINATION BEHAVIOR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. [APPLAUSE]  THANK YOU. MISS BARNES?   HI, EVERYONE. I'M ZAHRA BARNES, HEALTH DIRECTOR AT SELF MAGAZINE. AND I'M INCREDIBLY EXCITED TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT WE CARE ABOUT A LOT AS A BRAND BUT THAT I ALSO CARE ABOUT A TON AS JUST A HUMAN WHO IS SO MOVED BY THE TYPES OF STORIES HE ALL HAVE SHARED TODAY. SO, FOR A BIT OF BACKGROUND ABOUT SELF, WE'RE FOUNDED IN 1979, AND HAVE SINCE THEN BECOME A TRUSTED WOMEN'S HEALTH MEDIA BRAND. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT GUIDES US IN OUR ULTIMATE MISSION TO HELP PEOPLE FEEL BETTER IS A SET OF REALLY IMPORTANT CORE VALUES THAT BASICALLY UNDERGIRD OUR STORY TELLING NO MATTER WHERE FORMAT THAT STORY TELLING IS IN. SO THE FIRST VALUE YOU'LL SEE IS EMPATHY. MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE, WE KEEP THAT IN MIND. NEXT UP, ACCURACY, BIG ONE FOR US. IF YOU'RE NOT GIVING PEOPLE THE CORRECT INFORMATION, THERE'S NO WAY FOR THEM TO REALLY SHAPE THEIR LIVES AND ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS IN THE WAY THEY ARE INTENDING. WE ALSO HAVE INCLUSIVITY, WHICH IS MAJOR, ESPECIALLY WHEN AS YOU WERE SAYING PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO SEE THEMSELVES REFLECTED IN STORIES. PEOPLE AREN'T NECESSARILY GOING TO WANT TO USE OUR INFORMATION, VISIT US, VIEW US AS AN AUTHORITATIVE TRUSTED SOURCE, IF THEY DON'T EVEN FEEL WELCOME WHEN THEY ARE COMING TO OUR WEBSITE. FINALLY, BODILY AUTONOMY, OF COURSE SUCH A HUGE PART OF THE CONVERSATION WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VACCINATION. WE BELIEVE ULTIMATELY THAT EVERYONE KNOWS THEIR BODY BEST. AND OUR GOAL IS REAL TO PROVIDE PEOPLE WITH THE INFORMATION AND MOST COMPELLING WAY POSSIBLE TO MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR BODIES. SO WHY VACCINE SAVE LIVES? HOW THE OF MANY PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS OUT THERE, WHY WOULD WE DECIDE TO FOCUS ON THIS ONE? AND YOU ALL HAVE HEARD A LOT OF WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY, BUT TO KIND OF SHOW WHAT YOU WE WERE THINKING FROM AN EDITORIAL STANDPOINT WHEN MAKING THIS DECISION, HERE ARE A COUPLE THINGS WE HAD IN MIND. WE KNOW THAT VACCINATION PREVENTS BETWEEN 2 AND 3 MILLION DEATHS WORLDWIDE EVERY SINGLE YEAR. WHICH AS SOMEONE WHO IS DAY IN AND DAY OUT DIGGING THROUGH STATISTICS EVEN I RECOGNIZE THIS IS A WHOPPING NUMBER, CLEARLY VACCINES ARE INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE. UNFORTUNATELY, WE ALSO KNOW THAT VACCINE HESITANCY WAS NAMED ONE OF THE TOP TEN THREATS. WE KNOW CERTAIN VACCINE PREVENTIBLE DISEASES ARE ON THE RISE BOTH HERE AND THE UNITED STATES, AND ELSEWHERE. BEYOND THAT WE KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE VACCINE HESITANT AREN'T NECESSARILY ANTI VACCINE AS WE SAW IN THE GREAT SPECTRUM EARLIER TODAY. WE SIMPLY ARE NOT CONVINCED BENEFITS OF VACCINATION OUTWEIGH THE RISKS. OF COURSE, A LOT IS BECAUSE OF THE MISINFORMATION WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING HERE TODAY. IT WAS HONESTLY MIND BOGGLING AND FRANKLY SCARY AS A HEALTH EDITOR WHEN I WAS LOOKING THROUGH ALL THIS MISINFORMATION WHEN BRAINSTORMING HOW WE WANTED TO TACKLE THE PACKAGE, A LOT CAN SEEM CONVINCING IF YOU DON'T HAVE FACT IT'S AND STORY TELLING. WE HAD TO KEEP THAT AT THE FOREFRONT OF OUR MINDS WITH EVERYTHING WE DID WITH THIS PACKAGE. EVEN DEBUNKS VACCINE MISINFORMATION DOES NOT WORK. WE HEARD PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO HEAR STATEMENTS HEARD REPEATEDLY EVEN IF YOU'RE EXPLAINING WHY THE STATEMENTS ARE FALSE. IT'S COMPLEX. I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT THE HUMAN BRAIN WOULD WORK THAT WAY BUT WE ARE COMPLICATED CREATURES, SO I GUESS IT MAKES SENSE. SO OUR MISSION WITH VACCINES SAVES LIVES WAS TO KEEP ALL OF THAT IN MIND AND ULTIMATELY COMBAT THIS PERVASIVE PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT INSTEAD OF ACCIDENTALLY CONTRIBUTING TO IT. WE DID THAT WITH A MIX OF TOPICS. SO WE USED STORY TELLING, VERY VIGOROUS REPORTING, AND CREATIVE IMAGERY TO SHOW WHY VACCINES WERE VITAL TO THEM, THEIR LOVED ONES AND COMMUNITIES AT LARGE. WE WANT TO HELP PEOPLE FEEL BETTER, THAT'S OUR MISSION. BUT WE ALSO WANT TO HELP PEOPLE BE RESPONSIBLE CITIZENS IN THE FACE OF THE REALLY DANGEROUS GLOBAL HEALTH THREAT. SO I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU THROUGH THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS WE HAD IN THIS EDITORIAL PROJECT. THE FIRST VERY DEAR TO MY HEART BECAUSE AS HEALTH DIRECTOR AT "SELF" I KNOW THAT OUR MISSION IS TO CONSISTENTLY PROVIDE ACTIONABLE REALISTIC ADVICE PEOPLE CAN USE TO BETTER THEIR LIVES. SERVICE JOURNALISM THAT WAS GIVING PEOPLE INFORMATION THEY COULD IMMEDIATELY ACT ON OR IMMEDIATELY SHARE WAS A MUST. HERE ARE A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF THE STORIES WE INCLUDED. FOR INSTANCE WE DID WHAT IS HERD IMMUNITY AND WHY DOES IT MATTER? BREAKING IT DOWN INTO REALLY DIGESTIBLE INFORMATION THAT MAKES THIS HIGHLY TECHNICAL WORLD A LITTLE BIT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO WALK AWAY AND FEEL LIKE THEY KNOW WHY VACCINATION IS SO IMPORTANT. ANOTHER ONE I LOVED, HERE ARE VACCINES YOU NEED AS AN ADULT. THAT CAN BE VERY CONFUSING. IT CAN FEEL LIKE A MYSTERY WORLD, EVEN SORTING THROUGH INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET IS TOO MUCH SO WHY JUST DEAL WITH IT, WE WANTED TO PACKAGE THAT REALLY NICELY FOR PEOPLE TO HELP THEM STAY SAFE. COMPELLING PERSONAL ESSAYS AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HERE, YOU KNOW, STATISTICS ARE WONDERFUL, DEAR TO MY HEART, LOVE DIGGING THROUGH SCIENCE. BUT DEBUNKING VACCINE MISINFORMATION DOESN'T WORK. STATISTICS ARE SOMETIMES EASILY FORGETTABLE. WE HAD TO INCLUDE BEAUTIFUL MOVING EMOTIONAL COMPELLING PERSONAL ESSAYS TO PUT A HUMAN FACE TO THE TOPIC. A COUPLE REALLY LOVELY EXAMPLES, MY CHILD CAN'T GET VACCINATED, HERE IS WHAT LIFE IS LIKE FOR US. A MOM TALKS ABOUT HOW HER CHILD HAD A HEART TRANSPLANT AS A BABY AND IS NOW IMMUNOCOMPROMISED. SHE CANNOT RECEIVE VACCINES OR LIVE VACCINES, RATHER. AND SHE IS ESSENTIALLY MAKING A PLEA TO ALL READERS TO GET VACCINATED IN ORDER TO HELP KEEP HER CHILD AND OTHER IMMUNOCOMPROMISED PEOPLE SAFE. THAT'S THE TYPE OF VERY RELATABLE LOVE BASED HUMAN BASED STORY THAT CAN CHANGE PEOPLE'S MINDS. ANOTHER ONE THAT GOT A GREAT REACTION, I USED TO BE AN ANTI VAXER. HERE IS WHAT CHANGED MY MIND. WE HAD TO EMPHASIZE WITH THIS PACKAGE WE HAVE NOT VIEWING THIS AS US VERSUS VACCINE HESITANT PEOPLE OR US VERSUS ANTI VAXERS. OUR GOAL WAS TO SHOW PEOPLE THAT NO MATTER WHERE YOU FALL ON THE SPECTRUM WE ALL HAVE A MISSION OF STAYING SAFE AND KEEPING OUR LOVED ONES SAFE. AND THERE ARE LOTS OF REASONS WHY PEOPLE MIGHT FALL ON DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SPECTRUM AND WE WANTED TO SHOW PEOPLE WHY SOMEONE WHO USED TO BE ON THE ANTI VAXER SIDE REALIZED VACCINATIONS ARE ACTUALLY KEY IN HELPING HER ACHIEVE HER GOAL OF KEEPING HERSELF AND HER LOVED ONES SAFE. FINALLY, CREATE A DATABASE OF POSITIVE VACCINE IMAGERY. SOMEONE WHO IS CONSTANTLY WORKING WITH WORDS, AND USUALLY DEEP IN THE WEEDS WITH DRAFTS OF STORIES, I FOUND THIS PART OF THE PROJECT PARTICULARLY DELIGHTFUL. SO WE DECIDED TO SOLVE A PROBLEM THAT WE HEARD ABOUT AGAIN AND AGAIN FROM MEMBERS OF THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY WHICH WAS THERE WAS A LACK OF POSITIVE ACCURATE REALISTIC VACCINE IMAGERY, AS WE SAW EARLIER, YOU'LL SEE IMAGES OF BABIES WAILING IN PAIN WITH TONS OF NEEDLES STICKING OUT OF THEM, NO PARENT TO BE FOUND. CLEARLY THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS. WE PARTNERED WITH AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS, AND PRIMARY CARE SERVICE ONE MEDICAL, TO PRODUCE THIS REALLY STUNNING I'M BIASED, BUT REALLY STUNNING PHOTO SHOOT OF NOT FEAR MONGERING, ACCURATE REALISTIC REAL LIFE VACCINE SCENARIOS. THESE EVEN INCLUDE REAL DOCTORS. IT WAS THE REAL DEAL. WORKED CLOSELY WITH SOCIAL MEDIA PARTNERS TO ENSURE BRAND AND STAFF SAFETY. WE KNEW THAT EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A VERY WORTHY AND GREAT PROJECT TO TAKE ON, WE WERE ALSO UNFORTUNATELY OPENING OURSELVES UP TO POTENTIAL BACKLASH. SO WE WORKED WITH THE VARIOUS SOCIAL MEDIA SITES, TO PROTECT NOT ONLY OUR BRAND'S CHANNEL AND GIVE STAFF MEMBERS INFORMATION TO PROTECT THEIR OWN CHANNELS AND WORKED WITH OUR CORPORATION DO MAKE SURE OUR WEBSITE WOULD BE EXTRA SECURE AGAINST CYBER SECURITY ATTACKS SINCE UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAD TO CONSIDER. THAT'S ONE OF OUR INSTAGRAM POSTS. ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT THIS WAS THAT WE ACTUALLY CLOSED THE COMMENTS ON OUR INSTAGRAM POSTS ABOUT THE PROJECT BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE A PLATFORM FOR PEOPLE TO DISSEMINATE VACCINE MISINFORMATION. OF COURSE, EVEN IF WE IMMEDIATELY JUMPED IN WITH THE ACCURATE INFORMATION, AS WE'VE DESCRIBED IT, IT IS DAMAGING WHEN PEOPLE SEE THESE MYTHS REPEATED. AND NORMALLY WE ARE TOTALLY ON BOARD WITH, YOU KNOW, UPLIFTING AND ELEVATING PEOPLE'S DIFFERENT OPINIONS BUT WE KNEW IN THIS CASE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE NOT GIVE A PLATFORM FOR THAT. SO, WE NOTIFIED HEALTH EXPERTS, MEDIA AND ORGANIZATIONS, AFTER WE HAD PUT ALL OF THIS WORK INTO VARIOUS MOVING PARTS OF THE PROJECT, WE DECIDED, OKAY, WE DO NOT ONLY WANT TO BE SPREADING THIS ON OUR PLATFORM. WE HAVE A BUILT IN AUDIENCE. IT'S GREAT. FOUNDED IN 1979. WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME BUILDING IT UP. BUT THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE THAT WE REALLY WANTED TO GO BEYOND THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO NEED TO HEAR IT. SO WE SPREAD THE WORD TO DOCTORS. WE SPREAD THE WORD TO DIFFERENT HEALTH WEBSITES. WE CREATED A SPECIAL NEWSLETTER WITH THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS. WE LET EVERYONE KNOW THAT THOSE INCREDIBLE PHOTOS YOU SAW COMPLETELY FREE TO USE FOR ANYONE, AND WE THEN LET IT OUT THERE AND SAID, OKAY, IF YOU ALL FIND THIS PROJECT COMPELLING, AND WORTHWHILE, PLEASE, YOU KNOW, SPREAD THE WORD. LUCKILY WE WERE VERY SUCCESSFUL IN THIS PROJECT. WE REALIZED WE HAD REALLY SPARKED A LARGER CONVERSATION. NEWS OUTLETS AND BLOGS PRETTY MUCH IMMEDIATELY STARTED USING THE PHOTOS WHICH IS REALLY WONDERFUL TO SEE. WE ALSO GOT A LOT OF FEEDBACK FROM MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS, AND PEOPLE IN THE MEDIA WHO WERE SAYING, OKAY, WE HAVE BEEN CRAVING IMAGES LIKE THIS, THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING A FREE RESOURCE THAT WE CAN USE TO ILLUSTRATE THE REALITIES OF VACCINATION. AND WE GOT A LOT OF SOCIAL CHATTER, COVERAGE FROM EVERYONE FROM THE "NEW YORK TIMES" TO AD WEEK, A LOT OF PEOPLE REACHING OUT TO US PERSONALLY TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PUTTING YOUR EDITORIAL PLATFORM BEHIND SOMETHING SO IMPORTANT AND UNFORTUNATELY MISUNDERSTOOD. THE MORE OF US TO SPREAD THE MESSAGE, THE BETTER. AND WE WERE GLAD TO BE PART OF IT. THANK YOU.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MISS BARNES. LET'S HAVE A ROUNDS OF APPLAUSE FOR ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THE PANEL. [APPLAUSE] UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE RUNNING SHORT ON TIME SO I'M GOING TO TAKE THE CHAIR'S PREROGATIVE AND WE WILL NOT HAVE COMMENTS TO AUDIENCE, FROM THE AUDIENCE AT THIS POINT. I WANT TO CERTAINLY THANK DR. GRIMES, MISS FELDER, MISS MAROTTA AND MISS BARNES FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS, WE'LL MOVE TO THE LAST SESSION FOR THE DAY. NEXT PRESENTER IS ZAK HOCHSTETLER, HE WILL TALK ABOUT VACCINE COUNSELING CODING CHANGES FOR 2021, HE'S FROM THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, HE'S GOING TO DISCUSS NEW CPT CODES, 99201 TO 99215. REMEMBER THOSE. DEVELOPED FOR USE IN 2021 TO REVIEWS ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN AND ENSURE PAYMENT FOR TOTAL TIME OF VACCINATION COUNSELING AND ADMINISTRATION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME  AND PRESENTATION.  THANKS. I CAN I'LL GO THROUGH THE SLIDES QUICKLY AND I THINK YOU'VE ALL HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THE SLIDES BUT WE'LL ALSO HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL DETAILS, POTENTIALLY AT A LATER DATE AS WELL SINCE A LOT OF WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS COMING IN THE FUTURE AND WE CAN CERTAINLY COME BACK, I CAN COME BACK OR WE CAN WORK WITH THE SUMMIT TO STATE SOME ADDITIONAL ACTIONS THAT WE'VE HAD. AGAIN, CPT EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT OFFICE VISITS, THEY HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR QUITE A WHILE BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF TOTAL VOLUME WITHIN MEDICARE SPEND, A QUARTER OF ALL PART B MEDICINE, PAYMENTS OUT OF MEDICARE. SO AGAIN THESE ARE 10E AND M CODES, ONE QUARTER, AND ALL OTHER CPT CODES ROUGHLY 10,000, REPRESENT THE THREE QUARTERS, SMALL CONCENTRATION OF OFFICE VISITS REPRESENT A LOT OF SPEND WITHIN MEDICARE. THE LAST TIME THEY WERE UPDATED WAS NEARLY 30 YEARS AGO. AND WHAT'S HAPPENED IS RISE OF E.M.Rs, UPCODING, TEN YEARS AGO LEVEL 3 WAS PREDOMINANTLY USED CODE BUT NOW HAVE YOU LEVEL 4 AND 5 RISING THAT ISN'T DUE TO ANYTHING RELATED TO FRAUD BUT MORE SO AROUND THE EASE OF CHECKING BOXES AND CLICKING THROUGH YOUR EMR HAS LED TO THAT. AMA HAS BEEN WANTING TO LAST 10 TO 15 YEARS MAKE REVISIONS TO THE OFFICE GUIDELINES BUT THERE'S BEEN OPPOSITION AND ANYTIME THERE'S A CHANGE, EVEN IF IT'S IN A POSITIVE OR FORWARD MOVEMENT IT'S STILL DIFFICULT. HOWEVER, WHEN CMS PROPOSED THEIR CHANGES IN 2019 AND GALVANIZED THE PHYSICIAN COMMUNITY, AND SO I'M NOT GOING TO READ ALL THOSE BUT UPDATING, PROPOSED REALLY MONUMENTAL CHANGES TO OFFICE VISITS. AMA WE SEE OURSELVES AS A CONVENER, BECAUSE WE HAVE DEDICATION TO REMOVING OBSTACLES THAT INTERFERE WITH PATIENT CARE AND A LOT OF CONNECTION WITH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PAYERS BUT ALSO THEN FINALLY CPT EDITORIAL PANEL WHICH HAS SOLE AUTHORSHIP OF THE CODE SETS, THEY WERE ABLE TO USE DATA DRIVEN PROCESS, UTILIZING THE INPUT FROM HUNDREDS OF CLINICAL EXPERTS. SO WHAT WE DID HERE, AMA, WE HAD A JOINT WORK GROUP ON THE E AND M. WE DIDN'T WANT A GROUP OF 17 INDIVIDUALS TO MAKE ALL DECISIONS ALONE SO THEY GOT INPUT FROM HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF CLINICIANS TO GET THESE CHANGES RIGHT. AGAIN, WORK GROUP PROCESS WAS FOCUSED ON TRANSPARENCY AND INCLUSION, SO REALLY IT WAS AROUND SIMPLIFYING THE WORK OF OFFICE VISITS AND ALSO BUT IN TANDEM IMPROVING HEALTH OF THE PATIENT, YOU'LL SEE GUIDE BE PRINCIPLES THERE. BUT THEY ARE STERNED AROUND CENTERED AROUND ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN, CREEPED IN OVER 20 YEARS IT'S BEEN AROUND. ONE THING I WANT TO MAKE SURE, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT E AND M OFFICE VISITS, I'LL GET TO SPECIFICS ABOUT VACCINE IN A BIT. ACTIVE IN 2021, JANUARY 1, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FUTURE CHANGES, SO AS CODING STANDS TODAY NOTHING HAS CHANGED BUT WILL FOR JANUARY 2, 2021. HERE IS A QUICK SUMMARY OF THE OFFICE VISIT REVISIONS. AGAIN, JUST EXTENSIVE GUIDELINE ADDITION REVISION AND RESTRUCTURING. I WON'T GET INTO THAT. I WANT TO FOCUS ON HOW IT MIGHT CHANGE OR IMPROVE EVEN VACCINE COUNSELING. BUT THERE WAS A DELETION, LOWEST LEVEL OFFICE VISIT. THAT WAS JUST TO ALIGN NEW PATIENT AND ESTABLISHED PATIENT AS WELL AS CREATING SHORTER 15 MINUTE PROLONG SERVICES CODE WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT. TO SIMPLIFY, NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE A HISTORY AND EXAM, JUST MEDICALLY APPROPRIATE, REDUCING SOME OF THE CHECK BOXING THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS AS WELL AS YOU CAN CHOOSE YOUR PATHWAYS OR TIME, AND TIME IS GOING TO BE THE KEY DRIVER TO A LOT OF CHANGES WE'RE GOING TO SEE IN VACCINE COUNSELING OR LIKELY TO SEE IN THE FUTURE. HERE'S HIGHLIGHTS OF WHAT WE'RE REVISING. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING ISN'T GOING TO AFFECT SORT OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS GROUP. THERE WAS WE KEPT THE SIMILAR FRAMEWORK THERE BUT THERE WAS EXTENSIVE CLARIFICATION MADE, THE IMPROVEMENTS WERE BETTER DEFINITION OF EXISTING CONCEPTS. WITH TIME THOUGH THIS IS WHAT'S REALLY CHANGED THEN IS THAT IT'S THE TOTAL TIME ON DATE OF THE ENCOUNTER, NOT FACE TO FACE ANYMORE, YOU SEE IT INCLUDES NON FACE TO FACE CARE, COULD BE MORNING OR AFTER, BUT DOES HAVE TO BE 24 HOURS MORNING OR NIGHT OF THE ENCOUNTER. AGAIN WE TRY TO CLARIFY THAT TIME RANGES, SO YOU'LL SEE HERE TERMINOLOGY MEDICALLY APPROPRIATE HISTORY AND EXAM, AND THEN THIS IS A LEVEL 5 ESTABLISHED PATIENT. YOU'LL SEE TIME RANGES AS WELL. FOR THEIR CLEARLY DISTINCT 48 TO 54 MINUTES, AND WITH REFERENCE AT THE BOTTOM THAT YOU CAN USE FOR 55 MINUTES OR LONGER, YOU CAN SEE USE THE NEW PROLONGED SERVICES CODE. PROLONGED SERVICES CODE HAS XXX, WE HAVEN'T ASSIGNED A NUMBER, TALKING ABOUT CHANGES EARLY. WE WON'T ASSIGN A NUMBER UNTIL AUGUST TIME FRAME. HERE IS THE CLEAR FOCUS ON PATIENT CARE, BURDEN REDUCTION. YOU'LL SEE AGAIN A LOT OF THINGS THAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT. WHAT I WANTED TO DO WAS PAUSE HERE AND TALK FOR A COUPLE MINUTES AND TALK ABOUT SOME FUTURE WORK WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING AND HOPEFULLY REPORT BACK TO YOU. AGAIN AS RELATES TO VACCINE COUNSELING, WE WANT TO FOCUS ON CHANGES TO TIME. YOU HAVE CREATION OF SHORTER PROLONGED CODE, 15 MINUTES. CURRENT CODE IS AN HOUR. THERE WAS A LARGE GAP BETWEEN WHEN YOU COULD START TO REPORT ADDITIONAL TIME SPENT WITH A PATIENT. WHAT THE IDEA AROUND THIS WAS REALLY WHAT THE WORK GROUP CALLED THE WORRIED WELL PATIENT. SOMEONE WHO HAS DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH, GOOGLED A LOT OF INFORMATION, COMES IN WITH A STACK OF PAPER AND JUST TAKES LONGER TO COUNSEL THE PERSON. OR THE PATIENT. AGAIN, THERE'S NOW ABILITY TO BILL ADDITIONAL BILL FOR TIME SPENT IN A LOT OF LONGER CASES. THIS ISN'T YOUR TYPICAL PATIENTS BUT PATIENT THAT TAKE MORE TIME IN THE CLINIC. AND THERE IS NOW GOING TO BE A MECHANISM FOR MORE GRANULARITY AROUND PAYMENT. AGAIN, CURRENT WAIT TIME REPORTED, YOU CAN ONLY DO IT WHEN COUNSELING OR COORDINATION OF CARE IS GREATER THAN 50%. USE MEDICAL DECISION MAKING, OR TIME? WE HAVE GOTTEN QUESTIONS AROUND THE POTENTIAL GAMING OF JUST THE USE OF TIME BUT FRANKLY IF YOU USE MEDICAL DECISION MAKING ON A PER MINUTE OR PER VISIT BASIS IT'S LIKELY TO GET PAID MORE THROUGH MEDICAL DECISION MAKING ANYWAY. THE BENEFIT HERE IS JUST THAT FOR THOSE WHAT WE CALL WORRIED WELL PATIENTS, MEDICAL DECISION MAKING IS LOW BUT TIME SPENT IS HIGH, THERE'S NOW INCREASED AVENUES FOR PAYMENT. AGAIN, REMINDER THESE ARE OFFICE VISIT ONLY, NOT GOING TO AFFECT PREVENTIVE COUNSELING CODES, A LOT OF VACCINES GIVEN THROUGH AS WELL. WHAT'S IMPORTANT, WHAT I DON'T HAVE LISTED HERE BECAUSE WE'RE STILL WORKING WITH THE SUMMIT, IMMUNIZATION SUMMIT, THE AMA IS WORKING WITH A LOT OF MEDICAL SPECIALTIES WHO WORKED WITH THE E AND M WORKING GROUP. FIRST QUESTION IS SHOW ME THESE CASE STUDIES. WE WANT TO SHOW YOU EXAMPLES OF HOW YOU MAY HAVE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED OFFICE VISITS, USING VACCINE COUNSELING, HOW IT MIGHT BENEFIT OR BE REVISED THROUGH THE REVISIONS, WE'LL BE ABLE TO COME BACK AND PRESENT CLEAR CASES, IT WILL SHOW WHAT I BELIEVE ARE IMPROVEMENTS IN THAT AREA ALSO CONTINUE A DIALOGUE TO SEE, I KNOW HAVE YOU CERTAIN INITIATIVES AROUND CODING FOR THOSE. I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH THE WEBSITE THAT WE HAVE. AMA EDUCATIONAL WEBSITE INCLUDES EVERYTHING RELATED TO E AND M OFFICE VISITS, MODULES, IT'S SIMPLE. WHAT I HOPE IS THAT THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF A DIALOGUE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE. YOU'VE HAD MY SLIDES FOR A LITTLE BIT OF TIME. I CAN CONTINUE TO CHECK IN AND I THINK THE REAL VALUE IS COMING WHICH IS THE USE OF THE CASE STUDIES, NETWORK WITH SUMMIT, WHO ARE DOING SOME REALLY GOOD WORK AND I THINK THE AMA PARTNERING WITH THEM IS A REALLY GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO NOT ONLY PROMOTE THE BENEFITS OF THE E AND M OFFICE VISITS WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL BE BENEFICIAL TO PATIENT CARE BUT ALSO I THINK BENEFICIAL OF SOME OF THE WORK THAT THE GROUP IS DOING AS WELL. I CAN STICK AROUND SO I DON'T NEED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ON THE DAIS. THANK YOU.  THANK YOU, ZACH. APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION. [APPLAUSE] ALL RIGHT. WE HAVE REACHED THE CLOSE OF OUR FORMAL PRESENTATIONS. IT IS NOW TIME FOR US TO TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT. OPERATOR, FIRST OF ALL, IF THERE ARE THOSE IN THE ROOM TO MAKE PUBLIC COMMENT WE HAVE A MICROPHONE TO MY LEFT. WOULD ANY THAT WANT TO MAKE PUBLIC COMMENT IN THE ROOM PLEASE MAKE THEIR WAY TO THE MICROPHONE. DO WE HAVE REQUESTS FOR PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE PHONE, OPERATOR?  WE DO. ONE MOMENT.  OKAY. I'LL REMIND WHILE WE'RE COMING TO THE PUBLIC COMMENT, OUR PUBLIC COMMENTS ARE LIMITED TO THREE MINUTES, VERBAL COMMENTS. IF PEOPLE WISH TO SUBMIT WRITTEN COMMENTS THEY CAN BE SENT TO NVAC@HHS.GOV.  THIS IS TERESA; EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR NATIONAL VACCINE INFORMATION CENTER. OUR ORGANIZATION EMBRACED INFORMED CONSENT AND WORKED WITH CONGRESS TO DRAFT AND PASS NAGS CHILD AT VACCINE INJURY ACT OF 1986. SINCE THAT TIME VACCINE INFORMING REQUIREMENTS UNDER FEDERAL LAW HAVE BEEN WATERED DOWN. PHYSICIAN COMMITTEE REPORTS FROM NATIONAL ACADEMIES OF SCIENCE THAT INFORM THE COMPENSATION PROGRAM  HAVE CONTINUED TO GRADE SCIENCE AS INADEQUATE. THIS CREATES HEAVY BURN FOR THE INJURED TO BE COMPENSATED AND CONTINUES TO SUFFER FROM PUBLIC LACK OF AWARENESS OF THE PROGRAM. REFERRING TO PARENTS OF ANTI VACCINE AS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE, NOT SAYING ABOLISH. BUT RESPECT THE RIGHT TO INFORMED CONSENT INCLUDING RIGHT TO REFUSE VACCINATION. TODAY THE PARENTS CONCERNED ABOUT CAR SEATS RECENTLY FAILED AGAINST SIDE IMPACTS ARE NOT BEING REFERRED TO AS ANTI CAR SEATS. DEMEANING PARENTS WITH VACCINE CONCERNS, MANY ARE LEGITIMATE, WILL NOT INSPIRE TRUST OR CHANGE MINDS. IT'S (INDISCERNIBLE) PUNITIVE MEASURES THAT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST MINORITY THAT CHOOSE NOT TO USE ONE OR ALL VACCINES. TRUST IS ALSO LIMITED IN LIMITED SUPPLY FOR DOCTORS, PERHAPS MEDICINE (INDISCERNIBLE) REPORTS FOR BEING REFUSED WELL CARE FOR ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT VACCINATION, OR EXERCISING THEIR RIGHT TO REFUSE UNDER THE INFORMED CONSENT ETHIC. THE IMPACT IN BUILDING TRUST NOT ENCOURAGING STATE MANDATES THAT DO NOT INCORPORATE FLEXIBLE EXEMPTION. NVAC COULD RECOMMEND RESEARCH TO CLOSE THE DEFICITS NOTED BY THE INSTITUTES OF MEDICINE AND BEING MORE INCLUSIVE OF HESITANCY (INDISCERNIBLE) AND RECOMMENDATION PROCESSES. PUBLIC HEALTH WOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO BUILD TRUST, TALKING ABOUT VACCINE FAILURES RATHER THAN VACCINE SUCCESS. REGISTRIES SHOULD BE OPT IN. AS THEY ARE A PRIVACY CONCERN HELD BY MANY PARENTS. CLEAR COMMUNICATIONS ABOUT DISEASE AND CONTACT TO THE U.S. VERSUS AFRICA FOR EXAMPLE TALKING ABOUT MEASLES WOULD ALSO BE HELPFUL.  MA'AM, WE'VE REACHED THE END OF OUR THREE MINUTE COMMENT PERIOD. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS ON THE LINE?  I'M SHOWING NO OTHER COMMENTS AT THIS TIME.  WE HAVE NO COMMENTS IN THE ROOM. I WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE, THOSE THAT HAVE ATTENDED IN PERSONAL, AND THOSE THAT HAVE ATTENDED ONLINE FOR PARTICIPATING IN OUR MEETING. THIS ENDS OUR FEBRUARY 13 14 NATIONAL VACCINE ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEETING. LOOK FORWARD TO INTERACTING WITH YOU AGAIN AT OUR JUNE MEETING. THE MEETING IS NOW ADJOURNED.
