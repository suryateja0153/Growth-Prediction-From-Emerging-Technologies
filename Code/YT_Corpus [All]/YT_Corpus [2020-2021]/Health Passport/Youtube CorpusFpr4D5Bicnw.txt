 [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you well good afternoon everybody thank you for joining today's briefing on covert 19 in North Carolina as of today North Carolina has 15,000 346 lab confirmed cases 475 people in the hospital and sadly 577 deaths our thoughts are with everyone suffering from this disease as well as the families of those who've died North Carolina has been in phase one of our restrictions since Friday our state has seen more stores and businesses open as long as they meet rules for cleaning and screening employees I think more people got out this past weekend but most North Carolinians kept their distance with some exceptions the virus is likely to be with us for a while regardless of what phase of easing restrictions that we are in will continue to look out for ourselves and each other and in each phase we need to remember the importance of the three w's wear a face cover wash your hands wait six feet apart from other people face coverings are important to prevent spread of the virus to other people in case you have it and these three w's will become even more important as we hopefully move through the phases and more people are out and about particularly when we're indoors and I want to talk today about how we're expanding testing in North Carolina as we laid out last month more testing is a critical part of our ability to ease restrictions and still keep people protected testing goes hand in hand with tracing when someone comes up positive our enhanced tracing workforce will find known contacts of that person so people can be tested and if they have covered 19 then they should isolate if they don't they still need to look out for any symptoms that they might have successful tracing builds on itself and obviously requires more and more tests to be performed to interface one as we did last week we doubled our testing to between five and seven thousand tests a day and we've been maintaining that but we have to keep pushing for more we needed to be easy and safe to get tested we have many retail partners including Walgreens Walmart and Harris Teeter that are opening up testing sites for the public because these sites are federally funded it doesn't cost the person to get tested they're more testing at hospital systems and doctors offices is coming online every day in order to help North Carolinians know where to get tested the Department of Health and Human Services will begin posting a list of testing locations on the kovat website later this week this list will change from day to day as certain pop-up sites open and close or move locations but it'll help people who need a test to find a site another essential part of beating this virus is giving health care workers and first responders the personal protective equipment or PPE that they need more PPE is also important in our ability to do more testing as lab techs and nurses need PPE to collect the sample from people being tested we've been fighting for more PPE and manufacturing task force is identifying North Carolina businesses that can help us several local manufacturers have shifted their production lines to make this important equipment now our state has a rich history of being a leader in manufacturing and an innovation and I'm proud that businesses in our state are leading the way to make this personal protective equipment right here at home I want to take a moment to recognize them sob Barracuda in Lillington usually produces camouflage netting for the military an apple Rock headquartered in Greensboro specializes in trade show displays now they're both making isolation gowns this is a critical piece of medical equipment that has been in short supply we also have three firms including ASI signage of Holly Springs Calero of Pittsburgh and Brightview Technologies of Durham they're now all producing face shields we've already received several shipments from some of these companies with more expected in the coming weeks thank you to the men and women working at these North Carolina companies and the many others who are finding ways to pitch in donate equipment or find another way for their workers to help in this fight and this is exactly what I mean when I say North Carolina will get through this pandemic by working together I look forward to more innovation creativity and team spirit that has always defined our state with me today our Secretary of Health and Human Services dr. Mandy Cohen our Secretary of Public Safety Eric Cooke's an emergency management director Mike Sprayberry Lee Williamson and Monica McGee are our sign language interpreters and behind the scenes Jackie and Jasmine the tip motive ear our our Spanish language interpreters I'll first recognize dr. Cohen dr. Cohen Thank You governor may is mental health awareness month and it's an important reminder that we need to be thinking about whole person health not just physical health as we continue to confront this pandemic we've all done a great job protecting our families and neighbors and slowing the spread of kovin 19 but in taking those important steps we've had to change the way we live significantly in ways that are were just hard to imagine even just a few months ago we've had to stay physically apart from one another stop many of the activities that may have brought us joy some of us are newly out of work and others have lost family members or friends to this virus not to mention that that pandemic itself can prompt fear and depression and anxiety one way to navigate this challenging time is to find new or in some cases old ways to connect with other people call or use video chats to connect with your friends and loved ones get outside exercise if you can in Phase one we're seeing more parks open which is a great opportunity to enjoy a hike or a bike ride and although remember if you're going to be around other people make sure to wear a face covering for those that may need help managing their mental health please contact your mental health provider or an expert if you don't have one start by reaching out to your primary care doctor as a first step there are additional resources on the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services website at kovat nineteen NC DHHS gov including some resources for our Medicaid beneficiaries and those without health insurance the National Child traumatic stress Network also offers advice on how to communicate with kids of all ages about Kovan 19 what to watch for in reactions from our kids how to offer them help and tips on approaching periods of social distancing we also have important help lines like hope for NC which you can dial at one eight five five five eight seven three four six three it connects North Carolinians to additional mental health and resilience support that help them cope and build resilience during this time of crisis it's now available to everyone in North Carolina's 100 counties 24 hours a day seven days a week with a live person to speak through throughout this crisis thanks to all seven of our state's mental health managed care organizations rlm emc OS and the real crisis intervention incorporated in Greenville for their partnership on that initiative importantly if you know someone who is experiencing severe distress help is always available by contacting the national suicide prevention hotline at 1-877-456-1156 from FEMA and quickly turned those around the fill request sourcing and procurement continue to be a major priority for the state emergency response team the North Carolina National Guard has more than nine hundred and thirty men and women supporting the kovat 19 response they've helped deliver a hundred and sixteen thousand school lunches and counties like Bladen Buncombe Jackson Madison Orange Robinson and Wake County's and in their support for food banks more than 90 thousand meals were delivered just yesterday other soldiers conducted cybersecurity training for 25 local governments on how to protect their computing infrastructure in the Cova 19 environment very important work we thank these soldiers and airmen for their service to the state during this critical time remember to wear a cloth face covering wait at least 6 feet apart and wash your hands often that's where weight and wash and as always don't forget to look out for your family friends and neighbors give them a call they'll appreciate it with kindness and cooperation we'll all get through this together as one team one mission and one family Thank You governor thank you Mike and Mandy and then what we'll take media questions and if you can identify yourself and the media organization we would appreciate it and we can take the first question our first question will be from Kenny Beckwith wXII governor good afternoon thank you for taking my question at this point we're at a place where over the last week or so the number of tests average per day is right around 6,000 and over about the last two weeks the percentage of positive tests has been at or below 10 percent every single day does a scenario exist in your opinion where the state of North Carolina could enter phase 2 early prior to what looks like right now would be May 22nd originally announced as early as possible date two weeks after phase one is there any scenario where we center phase two ahead of time as things continue to trend in a positive direction thanks for the question we need to look at all of our indicators and benchmarks over a 14 day period and we've talked about the fact that none of these indicators by themselves can give us the signal about when we need to move into Phase two but taking all of them together and looking at where we are over a 14 day period is what we need to be doing to get a true read on what's happening so I don't think that it can happen any earlier because we need that whole period of time to determine how we're doing and we are pleased at North Carolina's numbers I think the people of North Carolina deserve a lot of credit for that but understand that we are now just into phase one we're only what four days into Phase one so we have to make sure that people continue to stay at home as much as polished as possible continue this three double use of wearing waiting and washing and doing those things to protect each other Thanks next question please Bill McGinty WC NC hey there Governor Bill McGinty from WC n see Charlotte here appreciate you taking my question my question has to do with with unemployment you know my email is a consumer reporter over here is absolutely full of frustrated people they can't get into the system when they do get in online or on the phone they get kicked out or or they're on hold for hours so what technology are you all using will upgrades be coming to this system and what do you want to say to some of these people who are just at their wit's end right now first we know that families need help right now and every single claim that is filed is important because it represents a family in trouble and I think everybody over there working knows that I am pushing employment security to go faster this is a nationwide problem because you're talking about a system in North Carolina that was handling 12,000 claims has over a million claims now but what they have done is this we have now about a half a million people about 500,000 people are now receiving unemployment benefits and we have about 360 1,000 people who haven't received benefits yet and they know at that department that they need to do more and that they need to move faster and I am pushing them to move faster things they're doing they are continuing to increase the number of people who are answering calls and as you can imagine there's a lot of training that has to go on for someone to be able to answer a call but they're putting more and more people on it there is now a chat function on the website and they're able to answer people's questions regarding the chat function but they are working hard to get the rest of those 361,000 people the benefits that they have filed for and we have people continually filing now there's there are over a million claims but some people have to file twice because under the law they have to be denied one kind of unemployment insurance before they can be granted another kind of unemployment insurance and that's why you see over a million claims that have been filed but actually that represents 861 thousand people about half a million of those are now receiving claims they know they need to do more and to work harder and they've opened their hours - into the evening and on to the weekend to be able to take phone calls and they're being pushed and they're working hard to try to make sure that they respond to these and it's something that we have to do as quickly as possible thanks for that question next question please Michael Highland CBS 17 hi governor this is Michael Highland from CBS 17 we're going to be hosting a town hall later this evening with several members of the state's congressional delegation I want to ask you at this point what do you believe are the most critical needs that the state has for the federal government thank you thanks for that we we've had three bills that have been passed by the federal government we're grateful for those they have helped us in our kovat response in education and testing and tracing in health care and we need to do more of all of those things but we also know that state governments and local governments are responsible for health care for first-line responders for law enforcement and many of these local governments and state governments across the country are going to be in the hole because of this significant hit that this virus has caused to our economy and we're pushing our members of Congress to pass legislation that does help states and local governments deal with their significant budget shortfalls if that's not dealt with then state government and local governments are going to have to make significant cuts in core services like law enforcement like education like transportation I don't think the people want that and I think that many members of Congress believe that they need to step up I know that I've mentioned this and other governors have mentioned this on almost every call that we have with the White House and Michael maybe you can tell the congressional delegation tonight this is something that we really need Thanks next question please the Richard Kramer winston-salem Journal you know this is Richard Kramer with one personal journal uh governor and secretary Cohen I have a couple questions one maybe for each of you first question is we had a increase in Prasad County over the last day of about 50 cases and they're trying to do the contract tracing to figure out what those 50 came from they're just trying to get a sense that they all have any preliminary idea of relaxing since parati if there's been any kind of significant increase in cases and then the second question is government you've been having some pushback in the last week or so since you relaxed with phase one to accelerate to Phase two and as want to see if you have any reaction to that political pressure that you're getting from the legislature and from other words thank you Richard as the answer to the question second question you have is we are going to rely on the science the data and the facts that we have set out in order to tell us when we go into Phase two we know we need to boost the economy and just one of the reasons why we set up these phases but you can't boost the economy until people have confidence in their safety we want to make sure that people when they do go out and visit these businesses that they are safe and secure and that they know the numbers are right and that they rely on us to make those decisions we get an input from businesses and from other elected leaders about how we should shape these phases and we appreciate that input but the science and the data are what's going to drive us and the health experts and their opinions is what's going to drive us as to win we make these decisions and I'll let dr. Cohen answer if she knows what's going on with Weston Salem's issue hi Richard thanks for the question so in terms of looking at our overall statewide numbers they've been largely stable in our day over day new cases have been relatively stable and we noticed today we actually had one of our a day that was on the lower side for North Carolina in terms of a during the week day over day number I think we had a little over 300 new cases today as far as what's going on in Forsyth I'm happy to reach out to the local health department there and make sure that they have the resources there to trace the 50 new contacts because you're exactly right we want to make sure that anyone that was newly positive that we trace all of their contacts that any contacts get right in for a test whether or not they're having symptoms and then as the governor mentioned earlier in his remarks to repeat that cycle so if anyone is positive trace them again get more people into testing and if you are sick and found to be positive kovin 19 to get folks into isolation for 14 days I think these are the actions coupled with these slowing the spread actions like the three W is the wearing the face covering the washing your hands and waiting succeed apart these are the tools that are going to allow us to stay stable in this phase one and allow us to move into Phase two it is a collective effort across this whole state and if we can act together that's what's going to allow us to make it through these these next couple weeks looking at stabilized numbers and keep looking at those metrics and trends and then be able to move forward so I'll make sure to reach out to Forsyth and make sure they have what they they need to be able to respond to those new cases thank you Thanks next question please Tony said it could WSOC good afternoon this is Tony so Deacon was WSSC in Charlotte thank you for taking my question my question is for dr. Cohen so some health experts are suggesting that staying at home for several weeks could lead to weaker immune system because the more stress loneliness things like that first of all I wanted to get your thoughts on that dr. Cohen and do you believe that people might be more susceptible to kill now that people are slowly starting to go out of check well thanks for that question and as I shared in my earlier remarks it is really important to think about someone's overall health that's their physical and their mental health now we don't see any evidence that's staying at home weakens your immune system in any way but we know your mental health is a big part of you being overall healthy as we and as we ease through these restrictions and move forward we want to take advantage of going outside and getting a walk and making sure that folks are taking advantage of the mental health resources that we have across our state to be well and remember with kovat 19 we know it's folks with chronic diseases that are not well controlled that really puts you at risk at forque Ovid 19 of getting more severe illness so if you have diabetes if you have high blood pressure make sure you're reaching out to your doctor or other clinician right now don't put off any of your preventive visits make sure you're staying healthy but staying home does not weaken your immune system and in it of itself what we want you to do is make sure that you get the preventive care that you need that you're getting your chronic diseases under control with medicine but you're also taking care of your mental health and getting outside taking a walk connecting with your loved ones or reaching out to mental health professionals to get the help that you need thanks for that one good thing about entering into phase one is that I think people and the medical profession are taking more steps to care about people's other physical ailments rather than just kovat 19 cases it's really important for people to get treatment for their chronic diseases it's important for people to get their preventive health care I think we have the personal protective equipment in place now where doctors can begin seeing people Dennis can begin seeing people and you get that kind of preventive medical treatment that you need to stay healthy all the way around and that's something that we want to encourage during during this time thanks a bunch next question please Jonathan Alexander News & Observer hi governor goober this is Jonathan Alexander with News & Observer have you or anyone else in the administration in their cabinet been asked by anyone connected with nursing homes or their ownership or with meatpacking plants or their ownership not to report case numbers or testing numbers from those facilities I'm not aware of that I know that the department is posting the names of nursing homes that have had outbreaks and one of the things that the Department of Health and Human Services is doing is providing help to anyone that is having problems in a place of employment or long-term care because we know that these congregate settings are important to deal with the spread immediately because we see it significantly there but I'll let dr. Cohen respond to that as well thank you thank you got it exactly right governor we at the department and our division of public health as well as a local health department want to be sure that we're working with with anyone on how they can slow the spread of the virus whether that's in some of the places that we do regulate like a nursing home and we work very closely with them given our regulatory role or a meat processing plant that's regulated by agriculture but we know we want to help make sure that we're protecting workers as well as slowing the spread of the virus so we are encouraging folks to get in touch with us so that we can help them with implementing some of these public health measures that help not just their workers and and and to keep their their their businesses running but also help our communities so that's what we're encouraging folks to do thank you next question please tenseness wre oh so the Cupra thanks for taking my call this a question about testing DNA just change the testing guidelines in April 20th to open it up to many more people what was not changed publicly announced at that time and the website was just updated within the past 24 hours of the latest guidance records show the testing didn't go over 5,000 till almost two weeks after that testing open up but their reason that information wasn't discovered widely at that time and did we miss an opportunity to test more people starting more than three weeks ago one of the reasons that the testing was more restrictive earlier in the process is that nobody in the country really had enough tests nor enough personal protective equipment to administer those tests so the criteria was more restrictive on who could get tests as we move forward and gain more ability to test more capacity tests we've gotten more personal protective equipment and realizing that we want to try to begin reigniting the economy and setting up phases to open more and more businesses that we need to be doing a lot more testing so now that we've ramped up getting more personal protective equipment and testing capacity we want to do more and have loosened those guidelines significantly and I'll let dr. Cohen address how that gets out to the public sure thank you you're exactly right governor is that we've been working as this virus has evolved that so has the guidance and every time we change the guidance we are sure to blast that out very far and wide to all of the clinicians across our state posted on our website I've brought it up multiple times that these kinds of press availabilities so and we want to make sure folks know if particularly right now if you need a test we want you to get that test that means someone who may have symptoms of at 19 a fever a cough change in taste or smell call your primary care doctor and if you don't have one call your local health department or a federally qualified health center they can help direct you to one of the testing sites as the governor mentioned we're hoping to have a list for you up on our website so you'd be able to access that more easily we also as we were talking about the tracing effort we know that we want anyone who's been exposed to kovat 19 to also get a test so we're working on making sure all of that can happen so that as we move through these phases and ease restrictions that that can be an important tool to continue to slow the spread of the virus thank you Thanks next question please Gary Robertson Associated Press hi governor it's Gary Robertson with a hey governor I want to ask you about church services and your phase one order I know that you had sent that Lee Lily had sent to some legislators some information about clarifying what your order means and I think there's still a lot of frustration among lawmakers but also church leaders about being unable to hold indoor services more frequently or it not being just a rare exception and I just wanted to get your sense of why you believe this is the right path to go to to basically prohibit indoor services you know given that there are some exceptions yeah thank you thank you Gary I miss in-person church services very much myself this Sunday I listened to my church service online and it's something that we've been having to do over the last few weeks in order to protect each other in order to care about your neighbor because we know that inside it is much more likely that you're going to transmit this virus particularly when you are sitting or standing in one place for a long period of time and this is across the board and some people are trying to compare this with retail there's a big difference with retail people are moving around and you don't have as much a chance to spread the virus a significantly greater chance when people are sitting or standing in doors and close together we are aware of First Amendment rights and want to protect those and it is one of the reasons why permission has been given for outside services of more than 10 people if there is appropriate social distancing what we're hoping is that ministers in church leaders will put the health of their congregations at the head of their thinking here in consideration of each other realizing that it is still dangerous to hold indoor services when people more than 10 people are there and those people are closer together and we want to make sure that that the people across this state are protected I'll let dr. Cohen also to add to that I think you did a great job governor and describing the fact that we look we we know that this is challenging but we tried in phase 1 to focus on activities that were lower risk of spreading the virus and if we look at the things that are the lowest risk and are things that are outdoors and walking around the things that are the highest risk or things that are indoors and sitting down and the reasons are far several one when you're indoors you don't have the same air circulation you have more surfaces that you touch doorknobs pews etc and also when you're sitting down it is that contact it is more than 10 minutes within 6 feet that is when the virus is most transmitted so if you think about that as the highest risk and the lowest risk being outside and walking around we're trying to start as we do this reopening with with the activities that are the lower risk let's get used to our 3w as we do those lower risk activities and then we'll step through this once we are getting used to the wearing washing waiting parts of the three WS then we'll do the higher risk activities but I will say I hope everyone thinks about their own personal risk and risk to their family we know that folks who are over 65 and have chronic diseases are more at risk for for getting severe illness from kovat 19 so even as we ease up restrictions I would encourage folks to think about their own personal risk here and their families risk maybe it's not you who are over 65 but someone in your household so think about that and making your own judgments even as we go and ease restrictions as we move through this but we want to make sure that that folks are as safe as possible we know this virus will be with us again until we have a vaccine so this is a matter of how do we get used to living with this virus being amongst us thank you next question please our final question today will be from will Michael W UNC Mike governor will Michael sat W UNC I just had a question and another question regarding some of the criticisms that you've been getting specifically a letter that was sent by the six Republicans in the Council of states today calling for a special meeting of the Council of state and saying quote we need clarity as to why you aren't allowing specific industries to open as our neighboring states have done then they will go on to list things like restaurants salons and church services can I get your reaction to that and and ask whether you plan to as they are asking convene a special session pandemics cannot be partisan I've been on the phone with the White House every week I've signed a unanimous pandemic budget we're going to rely on the science and the facts to tell us when we need to reopen I know that people are hurting because of this virus and I know that our economy is hurting because of this virus but the health of our people and the health of our economy go hand at hand at our last council of state meeting last week we offered to have a briefing and a meeting on the Kovach crisis and told them that we would set it up and we look forward to doing that thank you all for joining us today and we'll be on again later on this week and probably dr. Cohen will be on tomorrow so thank you and stay safe out there [Music] [Music]
