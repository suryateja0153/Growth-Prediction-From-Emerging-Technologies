 Inspector, arrest him. No inspector.. I was the one who stole the jewellery. A-Actually, I kept this jewellery in Abhisek's bag. Do you even know where do we keep the jewellery? I kept the jewellery. - They all are lying, Inspector. I had kept the jewellery. - Their family drama begins! Inspector, you can sit here and be surprised. I'll find out who the thief is. And my assistant will be.. Certainly. Amol. - Me? Amol, please come with me. - I'll assist her. Come with me. - Come, this way. Hey, how can Amol help her? But what are you waiting for? - Right, act surprised. She told you so, right. But, sir, this jewellery. - Son, forget jewellery. We're finding the thief now. Amol, you want to jump from here, right? Yes, but they never allowed me to jump. But I will jump. You go downstairs. - All right. Inspector, record my statement. Why are you recording a video? It's the duty of the police to collect the evidence. Your duty is to stop the crime. Son, but what is the need to stop her now? She is willing to jump. Hey, Ms. Rasilal, jump! Keep quite duffer. What do you mean by jump? We'll be in prison if she jumps. Mahendra, she is just giving us false threats. She won't jump. How many times have I threatened you before that I'll go to Rajkot. Did I ever leave? Ms. Urmila, she is not giving false threats. She is about to jump. N-No.. No aunt.. No aunt.. not like this. Get the leg out first. Like this.. Hey, sit quietly you idiot. - Did you hit me? Ms. Rasila, I'm also coming up. We both will jump together. A-Amol.. - Brother-in-law Amol, stop! Mother-in-law, don't create a scene please. Yes, I'm only the problematic person here, right? If I jump, I and problems both will end. Inspector.. I am solely responsible for my death! Enough, Mom! I told you.. yes, I stole the jewellery. Even I stole the passport last time. Even I stole the passport last time. Because I don't want to go anywhere with you. Abhishek! Just for the sake of not going to Newzealand you did all this? You didn't even think for once your name would've been added in to police records. It might've raised questions to your character. Inspector.. now will you record this emotional scene too? - No. I had told you before because of you my children.. You just go. There is no place for you in this house now. Go! Why do we do this, Abhishek? Why? Aunt Rasila.. please come down. It's time for us to leave. Where? - New Zealand. - You're not going anywhere. What are you talking? The one who isn't loyal to his father how will he be loyal to me? New Zealand? You don't deserve to live anywhere in this world. Abhishek and Gayatri, let's go. Come on. 'That's enough! I need to end this right now' 'and go to New Zealand.' Brother-in-law, Prabhakar, Sister-in-law, Bharti how are you both? Oh, my.. We are fine. And you're looking really pretty. Simply.. Beautiful! Hey, how come the gesture for beautiful be this? Ms. Rekha the lead actress in the movie 'Khoobsurat' she dances so beautifully. So, this was her gesture. What a beautiful gesture! Okay tell me, father-in-law is at home? Yes. - I'll be right back. Wait.. Greetings. - Greetings. Does this shop belongs to Mr. Balkrishna Gokhale? Yes, and I'm his eldest son. We are from health department. And we need to ask you that is your shop clean? No.. our shop is a trash. There are lots of cockroaches in here. We charge Rs. 50 ticket to show cockroaches to people. Cockroach eating Bhakarwadi! Window.. You're joking. Come.. come out. Kehsav, come out.. Father-in-law, what happened? Gayatri, I had prepared and kept the fillings to make Bhakarwadi and had told him to ask Amol to do the rest of the work but.. Yes...New Zealand. My biological mother is in New Zealand. Yes, I have a temporary mother in India too... And your permanent father is standing right here. Idiot.. Scoundrel.. Catch him.. catch him from there Gayatri. I'll teach him a lesson today. Stop! What are you doing dad? Father-in-law, you come over here. Come here.. Brother-in-law Keshav why do you want to go to New Zealand? I'll call you back. - Idiot. Gayatri, what will you and Abhishek do without me in New Zealand? Have you seen the condition of this house? It can collapse any moment. If three of us collectively do something only then the condition of this house will improve. Look at him.. He is always roaming around with his stick. He never praises me for my good work. Praise you? Come over here. I'll give you everything. Everything? - Idiot! These Bhakarwadi's which you have fried.. hey, don't eat them.. What have you used to fry these? - Oil. I fried them. - Please tell us in which oil did you fry these. In this oil! Hair oil. I brought 10 to 12 bottles of this oil. Hair oil! But why did you fry Bhakarwadi in hair oil? Because it was written in it.. Fragrance oil. By the use of it you'll get long and thick hair. So, you should have used it in your hair. Why did you fry Bhakarwadi in this? Why? The customer who came the other day had asked you whether there are hair in this Bhakarwadi? And you said to him, 'No, there are a lot of hairs in this.' So much hair that you can make a bun out of it. So, I thought you need hair in this Bhakarwadi too to make a bun. That's why I used this oil. Oh god! What should I do about them, Gayatri? They are my biological children. After Abhishek leaves, I want to hand over the responsibility to them but they aren't even capable of taking responsibility of their own. How will they take Abhsihek's responsibility? Oh, my... Oh, my... Look the Marathi machine gun is here. Now she'll ask, what should I make for lunch? Oh, my... What's the use of cooking if everyone is getting hit by stick. Sister-in-law Bharti, why are you here? Oh yes. Father-in-law... Mandar's dad made a huge mistake at the shop. So you are called immediately. Oh god, what next now! Come out... - No, listen to me.. - Come out. Hold on.. One minute, Sir. What happened? Where are you taking my son? - Police station. What? Why? - He is playing with the health of the public. He is saying that we've cockroaches in our shop. And they have names too. Like Margaret, Anvesha, Rosy, etc.. People come to buy cockroaches and not Bhakarwadi. Prabhakar. You said all of this for our shop? Dad..I've learned all this from you only. If someone asks you a unerect question answer him in that manner only. Sir, we asked you a direct question that, is your shop clean or not? No, our shop is trash. - What are you saying? No, your question is absolutely right. Prabhakar, after giving such an unerect answer you should laugh like this. So that the person knows that you are just kidding. Or else you could've said, 'No, this isn't a shop.' 'It's a beauty parlour.' Like this. Understood? Forgive him please. He is learning. Our shop is unequaled. Cleaner than ever. You can ask anyone here. A-Ask him.. Ganesh, please tell him.. - Their shop is clean 100 percent. - Yes, sir. And it's the ritual of our shop that even if a single piece of Bhakarwadi falls on floor, we don't sell it. Okay.. If all of you say so, we'll leave him. But, Mr. Prabhakar.. - Yes. Be careful next time. We'll get your shop sealed. No.. - Be alert! We'll be careful. Dad.. I understood. 'If the shop is not clean, it can get closed..' 'If there a pothole on the road, it is closed..' 'So, shop and road are the same.' 'Dog's ear and London's ducks are the same.' Wow! Oh, my... What happened, father-in-law? Why are you laughing? What should I do if not laughing? Is there anything left to cry for? This idiot..he is still singing his song. If the shop would've gone closed.. When you reach towards the pinnacle of pain all you can do is laugh. 'Father-in-law has become alone without Abhishek.' 'What will happens after he leaves?' Urmila.. Abhishek has made an amazing plan. He told me by himself that he is going to trick Mr. Balkrishna. No, not trick him he is going to fool him. No.. not even fool him he is going to confine him. Let's say he is going to confine him. No.. not to confine him. He is going to make Mr. Balkrishna speak his words, this is what Abhishek has told you. Let's keep this final. Okay. What Abhishek told me you are the one who will finalise it and tell me now? Ms. Rajkot! I don't want to talk to you. No.. - Mahendra. - Shut up. Mahendra.. Oh, my Mahendra.. For the sake of my love. My juvenility is questioning you Mahendra. Please talk to me. Talk to and tell me Mahendra. Keep quite. - Tell me what did Abhishek told you. I'm telling you. Abhishek is going to say to Mr. Balkrishna.. Abhishek. Wait Mr. Balkrishna. Viju.. - Yes, Mam. - Get me matchsticks. Matchsticks? Oh god, are you planning to burn me alive? I-I just came to bid.. last goodbye as promised. and brought Bhakarwadi along with me for you. Look.. They aren't poisoned. I'll prove it by tasting it for you. Wow! - Mr. Balkrishna.. I asked for matchsticks to lighten the lamp. You didn't trick evem for once today. So, I'll welcome you by venerating today. Oh, that's what it is for. Okay, you light the lamp till then I'll entertain you all. I have started mimicking these days. Mr. Balkrishna, let it be. I've heard voices of all animals. No, not the animals, it old fashioned now. I have started mimicking the instruments of music. You also must'nt have listened to it. The taal.. The clarinet.. Harmonium.. The tanpura.. Mr. Balkrishna.. That's enough. A-Actually there are various types of musical instruments so it will take a long time. We'll arrange a whole day for it. First I'll perform your veneration and welcome you after that you give the gift you've brought for me and then.. - Dad.. I want to ask for a gift from you. Ask son, ask whatever you want to except you don't want to go to New Zealand you can ask anything you want. Yes.. you're right. I want to open a branch of Gokhale Bandhu in New Zealand called 'Modern Bhakarwadi Center' where I can sell 'Pizza Bhakarwadi' 'Tacos Bhakarwadi'. Will you permit me for it? This is really an amazing trick. Mr. Balkrishna will never agree to this. This isn't the only thing. Abhishek is going to keep more conditions in front of Mr. Balkrishna. Tell me, Dad! Why are you quite? Wow, Mr. Balkrishna. Wow! What did I do? I am standing here quietly. Yes, Mother-in-law. Abhishek has asked for this gift. Yes dear, that's why I am performing his veneration. I'm looking what values has he given to my son? But what trick did I play, Mom? Oh son, you're so innocent. Everyone knows.. Mr. Balkrishna will not allow anyone to open a branch of Gokhale Bandhu in India. He will not open it so the question of letting you open a branch in New Zealand has no value. This is not possible. How should I permit you for this? You know it very well that I prepare the masala for the Bhakarwadi at Gokhale Bandhu by myself. How can you ask such a thing.. - Dad, I just want the gift I asked for. I won't leave Pune until I get what I want. This is my final decision. Mr. Balkrishna won't agree. - Yes.. This is what Abhishek's plan is. Abhishek will say, 'You didn't stood up to your promise so' ' I won't go to New Zealand.' - Wow, Mahendra! It will be fun! - Yes.. But what if he agrees to it? You've a rubbish thinking. Duffer! He'll die but will never say 'Yes' to this. Mark my words. Take it from me. - Take it from me. Viju.. - Yes, mam. - Bring poison and rope. Oh god, Rasila, so many equipment for killing? Which equipment are you going to use for each of us? Mr. Balkrishna, these are not for you. These are for me. Okay.. First, I'll have poison and then I'll hang myself. No.. that's enough. - No.. I can do it Mr. Balkrishna. Mother-in-law.. now you are unnecessarily.. What unnecessarily? - Doing drama! Son, am I the one doing drama? You all are the one doing drama. It's your plan. I know everything. Mother-in-law, please. Don't drag him in it. Madam.. Yes, give it to me. - What all have you brought? Idiot! Have you lost your mind? So what should I do, Mr. Balkrishna? Tell me. You've left me with no option. You won't allow anyone to open a branch of Gokhale Bandhu. So I give it! I permit you to open a branch of Gokhale Bandhu. There you can make and sell varieties such as 'Pizza Bhakarwadi, Tacos, Nachos, like his father, sells 'Dhokla Bhakrwadi', 'Chocolate Bhkarwadi' the way you like. But in New Zealand people are non-vegetarian so.. So can I sell 'Chicken Bhakarwadi'.. Abhishek. Now you're demanding. Let him do whatever he wants to. You want to make 'Chicken Bhakarwadi' now Mr. Balkrishna will permit you then you'll say 'No, I want to make 'Rasila Bhakarwadi' then you'll cut me, add masala in it and then fry it. Right son? Done! I permit you for this also. Mr. Balkrishna, you wish to kill me? No..not you. The non-vegetarian ones. Mutton.. fish.. duck, whatever. Whichever Bhakarwadi you want to make you can make it. I've promised and I won't turn it back. I permit you to sell 'Alcohol Bhakarwadi' too. Okay? Hail lord ram!
