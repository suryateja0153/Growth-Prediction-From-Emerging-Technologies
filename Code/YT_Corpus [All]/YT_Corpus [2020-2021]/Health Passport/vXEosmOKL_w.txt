 TESTING LOCATION HAD A RECORD NUMBER OF TESTS THIS WEEK.         YORK HOSPITAL SAW MORE THAN 400 PEOPLE IN THEIR DRIVE THROUGH TESTING, THAT BEAT A NEW RECORD SET ON FRIDAY HEADING INTO THE HOLIDAY WEEK. AND ERICH FOGG WHO RUNS THAT TEST CENTER SAYS THAT A NEGATIVE TEST IS NOT A FREE PASS TO A "NORMAL" THANKSGIVING. 6:48 IT IS NOT AN IMMUNITY PASSPORT BY ANY MEANS ERICH FOGG RUNS YORK HOSPITAL'S COVID-19 TESTING SITE ON ROUTE 1 WHERE THIS PAST MONDAY THEY COMPLETED A RECORD 420 COVID- 19 TESTS. :54 IT'S HARD TO IGNORE THAT HOLIDAY TRAVELERS ARE SEEKING TESTING FOGG SAYS SOME OF THE INCREASE IS DRIVEN BY STUDENTS COMING HOME FROM THE FALL SEMESTER, AN UPTICK IN CASES IN YORK COUNTY SO PEOPLE WITH SYMPTOMS OR POSSIBLE CONTACTS LOOKING TO BE TESTED--- COMBINED WITH THOSE HOLIDAY TRAVELERS. 5:49 DON'T LET A NEGATIVE TEST ALLOW YOU TO LOWER YOUR GUARD NOT WEAR YOUR MASK NO DISTANCE THAT WOULD BE A VERY IRRESPONSIBLE STRATEGY GOING INTO THE HOLIDAYS FOGG SAYS ONE OF THE BIGGEST MISCONCEPTIONS IS THAT A COVID TEST IS A SNAPSHOT IN TIME-- -AND IF IT COMES BACK NEGATIVE IT MEANT THE SAMPLE COLLECTED AT THAT TIME DIDN'T HAVE THE VIRUS.

AND THE INCREASE IN TESTS MEANS MORE FOR LABS TO PROCESS--- 3:51 IT HASN'T BEEN SIGNIFICANT BUT WE ARE CERTAINLY PUSHING THE LAB NOW BECAUSE OF THE INCREASE IT'S INEVITABLE THAT WILL SLOW DOWN A LITTLE BIT ((MC ON CAM)) DRIVING HOME THAT A NEGATIVE TEST ISN'
