 Hi guys, it's great to see you again And welcome to Bali! First, we'll go to watch Kecak - the Balinese traditional dance Before getting in, we'll be handled a waist scarf like this to show respect to Balinese culture Let's go Kecak is a form of dance and music drama which was written and developed based on the Hindu's epic - Ramayana The story is about Prince Rama's quest to rescue his wife - Sita who was abducted by Ravana while Rama was on the hunt of the golden deer With the help of a monkeys army, Rama defeated Ravana and rescued his wife The show lasts for nearly 2 hours, it starts at sunset and ends at the beginning of the night The most awaited moment of the show is its ending All the performers start to dance on the fire in the middle of the stage The dance and act barefoot on the fire with the full costumes without being burnt The success of Kecak dance doesn't come from the costumes or story It's the unique performing technique that makes Kecak famous worldwide The show is amazing! I was hooked and didn't want it to end This is Tegalalang rice terrace, a must-come destination in Bali The terrace looks similar to the ones in Vietnam The people here call it "stairway to heaven" for the stunning landscape The view may be russet but it will look stunning on photos It's time for me to find a corner and take some photos Do I look like a local now? Coming to Bali without visiting this Tegalalang rice terrace means we're missing half of the beauty of this land Can you resist the charming terrace scenes combined with the cool breezes and fresh air? All of these elements will be a poetic and stunning background for your photos You can also get some thrills by trying these giant swings Or some other activities like taking photos with the "bird nest", riding bikes in the air You'll definitely have tons of stunning photos in this place The scene here is like a combination of Vietnam's Southern countryside and Northern rice terraces And if you take time to walk around, there's a chance that you'll discover another stunning corner And that's what I'm going to do now, that corner is amazing Did you hear her scream? This is "Bali Swing", the most popular check-in location in Bali I believe you've seen breathtaking photos of this place before There are small swings for personal use and bigger ones for couples Moreover, there are some "bird nests" that we can sit in for romantic photos And it'll cost us about 400,000 VND for a swing ride Pura Tirta Empul Temple is one of the most sacred temples in Bali The temple is surrounded by a lovely spring Water from the spring bubble up into a large, crystal-clear pool within the temple then gush out through many waterspouts into the two sacred purification pools Balinese believe the water in this temple has the power of purification and can bring them health and luck This would be a remarkable traditional experience for the tourists coming here The purification ritual is called "melukat" Participants or "bathers" will offer flowers and incenses After praying in the temple, incenses are lit and flowers are left on the waterspouts The bathers then have holy water pour onto their heads 2 times and drink it on the third time For the wishes to come true, each bather should wish for only 1 thing This is the famous Pura Tirta Empul Temple, people come here for worshiping and... bathing I didn't prepare for bathing so I may only wash my hands and my face with the so-called holy water The water here is said to have the power to cleanse out the bad luck and purify ourselves We are now at Tanjung Benoa, and today, we'll go diving with the guidance from professional divers These pros will help us to get used to diving technique then we'll go the deeper area later You've just seen a traditional play of Indonesia It's really lucky of me to observe another cultural feature of this country Honestly, I didn't really understand the play, but the performance was amazing and I can learn some about Indonesian culture In each video, I try to give you a note or two from my traveling experience And in this video, I'll share with you some tips about learning English From my personal experience, and I think probably yours, too English is the most common way to communicate with the locals One of my methods of learning English is using this app called "ELSA Speak" I believe that most of us feel like lacking of confidence while speaking English or tired of going to English schools , another reason can be the fear of not good enough to learn the language This app can help you overcome such problems The interface design is quite friendly and easy to use The planets on the main screen represent a group of vowels We can also check the daily progress, or check our pronunciation with the dictionary feature Moreover, there are many topics with sample sentences and vocabularies, we can choose a topic we like and practice by ourselves Back to the planets on the main screen, you can see there are groups of similar vowels Each planet will have 10 lessons for us to practice For instance, today I come to this Cultural Park And I think I have a problem with pronouncing the word "cultural", so let's see if I can get it right It shows that my pronunciation is only 47% correct The app will point out which part we mispronounced and correct it Let me try again This time, I got 55% correct, that's a good sign And my third time is only 50% correct, I still need to practice more I think studying with this app is more convenient than joining a course and arrange the learning schedule People who travel a lot like me will find this app extremely helpful as it's installed on our phones I think learning with this app is more relaxing and less pressure, it's just like talking to our phones This is Blue Point Beach, one of the most bustle and crowded place in Bali The food is also really good You've seen many aspects of Bali such as its culture, temples, and local people But for the youngsters or those who like... Sightseeing, Those who love sightseeing can come tho Blue Point as this place has stunning view, and people, for you to enjoy I love the idea of walking from the top up there to this balcony and on the way here, there are bars and shops for us to stop by - And you have something else to watch, right? - Yeah, the boys here are stunning Alright, boys for you and clothes for me
