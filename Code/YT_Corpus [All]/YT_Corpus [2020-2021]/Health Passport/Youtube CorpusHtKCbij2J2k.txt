 2019 was..... was tough in 2019 I made some major decisions that consequently led to changing my life 180 degrees looking back at what I was doing before he left everything behind and just went on traveling all I remember is me getting caught up in that hamster's wheel routine I did the exact same things every single day over and over again that freaked me out I knew exactly where I'll be what I'll be doing two and three months later because it was all scheduled everything was just there I knew exactly that I'll be doing the same things that I'm doing today on this Monday ten Mondays later that... that was too much I knew I needed some change and..... and... and so I did but... you know that.. you knew there was a BUT, there is always a BUT (one T tho) it wasn't all easy it wasn't all those Instagram selfies with those mind-blowing views it wasn't it really wasn't traveling full time that's that's a bit hard traveling and working that's hard traveling and working with a yemeni passport let's let's say that's nearly impossible you may have heard about the ongoing conflict in Yemen and powers have taken sides among the warring parties and thousands have been killed in the chaos the UN describes as the world's worst humanitarian crisis the United Nations has called for an end to what it says is a catastrophic aid blockade on Yemen as well blockade imposed by Saudi Arabia traveling with a Yemeni passport or travel documents if if you will all um it's like you're tied up to something and this thing is so damn heavy it drags you all the way down but well you travel anyways because you kind of get used to it you kind of get used to being rejected all that rage and weird pattern of heartbeats you've experienced before when you got rejected just because of your nationality it's kind of just fading away you're getting used to it you're getting used to the fact that you're not very welcomed just just because you're holding this small notebook or book if you will that says you're from a certain region and that's it that defines all of your qualities and all of your intentions pretty much everything and that's it if there is one take or one thing that I learned from all the things I have been through during the past year it's that this hardship this difficulty I have been whining about the whole time it's exactly what makes everything special and unique we would never have been able to appreciate the good if there was no bad we would have never enjoyed the sweet if there was no bitter or the bitter there was no sweet for coffee lovers you gotta love it there is this quote in the Chinese classic Tao Te Ching that I really loved it goes what is and what isn't make each other difficult and easy complement each other tall and short shape each other first and last follow each other high and low rest on each other voice and tone blend with each other it all comes down to the big question what is next for me well the answer is the answer is actually very simple I I really don't know am i excited yes perhaps am i terrified a little can't hide it do I regret anything absolutely not
