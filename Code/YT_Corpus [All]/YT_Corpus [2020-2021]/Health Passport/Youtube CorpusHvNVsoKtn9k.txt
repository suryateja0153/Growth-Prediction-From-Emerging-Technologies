 fellow explorers thailand is reopening tourism to wealthy travelers first what i mean by wealthy travelers well the thai government recently announced a new visa program for tourism but to apply for it you have to provide bank statements for the last six months that show you've had at least 500 000 thai bot in your bank account for each of those months that's the equivalent of about 17 000 u.s dollars in addition to that you'll need to provide proof of a hundred thousand dollars of covet 19 medical related insurance you'll need to take a covet 19 test three days before you go you'll need to take a covet 19 test when you get there assuming you're negative on most of those tests you will have to quarantine in a state approved hotel for 14 days in bangkok that runs about two thousand dollars if you want to stay at the westin one person full room and board now if you test positive you'll have to go quarantine in a hospital instead of the hotel but i'm curious who's going to thailand under this definitely not the broke backpackers
