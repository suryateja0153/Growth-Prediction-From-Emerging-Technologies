 “Mrs. Charalampaki, the rapid test result we did, is negative.” Thanks to a new application, Mrs. Charalampaki can now save on her mobile phone all the information she may need for the COVID-19 test she just performed. The pandemic has changed everything. A key sector that has been affected is transportation. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has already talked about a digital health passport. A new startup from Thessaloniki, responded very quickly to this need. They have already created their own digital health passport, which depending on the circumstances can also function as a digital passport. ComeTogether launched its new application “Emergency Help”, hoping to provide a useful tool. ComeTogether is a technology startup company from Thessaloniki, our purpose is the issuance of digital tickets for events and during the coronavirus health crisis that we are currently going through, and with the events market being almost non existent, we used our technology as a basis in order to create digital health passports for Covid-19. The start-up took advantage of the innovation it had developed to combat the black market for event tickets. This technology ensures that digital health passports can not be forged and their data remain private. A user with this application can store their health history, easily access it in a secure and private way and get notifications about their future vaccinations, Moreover public authorities have health data analytics. The third benefit is the functionality of the health passports. In collaboration with a specific health service provider, the application accepts RT-PCR and rapid test data as well as antibody tests, while recording when and if the user has been vaccinated for coronavirus. This functionality can be used in sensitive or crowded areas for example nursing homes, hospitals, airlines and airports, ferry boats and even events that are our initial object.
