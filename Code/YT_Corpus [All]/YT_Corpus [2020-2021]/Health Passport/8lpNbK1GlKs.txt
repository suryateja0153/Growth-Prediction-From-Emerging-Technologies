 Hello everyone Welcome back to Quang Vinh's Official Youtube channel Vinh is in Phu Quoc once again An island that Vinh loves the most in Vietnam This vacation of Vinh would be really special. Because Vinh chooses a resort called La Veranda. a European-style resort in Vietnam I hope today you will have pieces of information about resort La Veranda For you to have a dream vacation in Phu Quoc. Now, Let's come with Vinh. Everyone can see that the road to Vinh's villa is beautiful. There are many trees like tropical forests Tropical paradise This is Vinh's villa on the right-hand side I opened the door of the villa to show everyone Right in my room, I have a beautiful blue sea view My bed will be arranged close to the garden Here there are sofas so that people can relax and observe the sea The special thing about this resort is that the villa is not too much Everything here is private There are only about 3-4 villas And, they are all close to the beach. From outside, you will see the sea The sand beach, then the beautiful flower garden And here, there will be a sofa and then the bed This is a whole combo you can choose any mean of relaxing This is a villa called Ocean Villa, which is the best room in the resort The price is 7 million Vietnam Dong per night But I think it is totally worthy Because I extremely love this design. It is not like any designs of resorts that Vinh has visited Vinh always likes to visit Phu Quoc Because Vinh thinks Phu Quoc is a paradise for everyone When you want to go to the beach Because Phu Quoc has very nice weather all year round Every season, everyone can go to the beach in Phu Quoc. You should note that if you travel the south of Phu Quoc Island. We're now in the south of the island. If there is no wave in the south, there will be big waves in the north and vice versa If there is no wave in the north, there will be big waves in the south I advise you to choose a time depending on your preference. If you want to go to a calm beach or a sea with big waves You can ask for more detail to book the resort accordingly Every detail here is beautiful. From the outside of the garden to the bedroom, even the bathroom These designs are not like any other resorts, so this makes Vinh extremely fascinated. When Vinh goes to each place, there will be different decorative styles. Vinh entered a small alley with two rows of trees around Making everyone feels like you are walking into a beautiful forest. This resort has existed for more than 10 years, so the trees grew already. The trees here are carefully cared to have beautiful surrounding for tourists Rooms are divided into many areas not too large This resort has a villa right on the beach and other villas with a garden view. On the left side of Vinh, after the reception, Vinh will head to the main hall Vinh feels like going to the Mediterranean Sea. This is a common living space for everyone in the resort. In this area, we have a small boutique, which looks really pretty. Vinh will move into the bar. How do you feel about the atmosphere of this bar? Can you guess the design style of this bar? It is designed in French Colonial style. This is a European style It is a feature if you search on Google, you will see the style of this bar is truly designed in French Colonial style If Vinh only mentions the design, it will not be enough Because when people visit here, you will find beautiful areas. Vinh does not need to talk about beauty Obviously, It is too beautiful But one thing that Vinh would recommend to everyone is the cuisine of this resort Vinh has stayed at this resort for 2 days, then Vinh finds the cuisine is delicious. The chef here is named Sin, he is a character in the top 3 top chefs of Vietnam The cuisine at this resort is very suitable for Vinh's taste This is a restaurant called The Pepper Tree Vinh feels like I lost in a country in Europe, unlike in Vietnam A feature of La Veranda is The Pepper Tree restaurant Now Vinh will show everyone how special the meal here is I would like to introduce Mr. Sin, who is the chef of Pepper Tree restaurant. [Sin]: Now I will cook a dish called shrimp with tamarind sauce, a normal dish that anyone can make [Sin]: However, today, the chef of Pepper Tree restaurant will give Vinh a different way of cooking this dish.

[Vinh]: Vinh sits here and feels very hungry [Sin]: The way I cook the dishes is still European techniques and ingredients [Sin]: However, for the Vietnamese tourist or Mr. Vinh [Sin]: Vietnamese people still feel the taste of Vietnam cuisines [Sin]: When they are away from the country or have little chance to enjoy Vietnamese food every day. [Vinh]: OK [Vinh]: I find eating also need to understand the food, from the ingredients to how it is prepared [Vinh]: As well as the chef's service [Vinh]: Although Vinh doesn't try it, I guess this dish is definitely delicious [Vinh]: It is not about the resort prepares a special thing for Vinh today [Vinh]: When you visit the Pepper Tree restaurant and order a certain dish more than 480,000 VND [VInh]: You will have the chef's service right at the table [Vinh]: Mr Sin jokes that his price is only 480,000VND [Vinh]: You already can get him making food in front of us [Vinh]: The price of the dishes at the restaurant ranges from 200,000 to 1,600,000 VND [Vinh]: The most expensive is BEEF [Vinh]: I will give more information, so everyone can dine here [Vinh]: I have stayed at this resort for 2 days and every dish is delicious [Vinh]: I really love the way chef Sin cooks Vietnamese dishes [Vinh]: Vietnamese sour soup and stew fish [Vinh[: The chef Sin makes 8 different seafood dishes [Vinh]: I'm ready to eat now [Sin]: I will let Mr Vinh try and tell how this dish is [Vinh]: I will eat the rice first [Sin]: Yes, you will need to eat the rice first [Sin]: After that, you will eat a piece of shrimp meat, sauce, and a piece of the soft bean [Sin]: You should eat slowly to feel the taste [Vinh]: Ok [Vinh]: It's flavorful, not too salty [Vinh]: It has a gentle taste [Vinh]: It has the aroma of fatty butter [Vinh]: It will be suitable for each customer. [Vinh]: If you cook according to the taste of Vietnam, that dish will have a deepen flavor [Vinh]: The dishes with strong salty, sweet, and sour flavors will not be suitable for foreigners [Vinh]: This rice is cooked with special crispy rice. [Sin]: Apart from rice processing, in addition to the color [Sin]: we will feel the rice has a crispness like a grain [Sin]: There is a type of rice that you let dry [Sin]: then take it out to fry and then mix it with steamed rice [Vinh]: Thank you, Mr. Sin. What a nice dish. [Sin]: Hope you enjoy the meal. And, perhaps I have to serve the next guests [Vinh]: OK [Sin]: Thank you, Mr. Vinh. [Vinh]: You're welcome [Vinh]: I feel this dish is very satisfying, no need to add spices No need to add salt and pepper because it tastes good Vinh eats this meal for lunch, which is just enough and delicious OK Let's talk a little bit about Ocean Villa that Vinh chose. There will be other family rooms if you travel in a large group. There are nearby connecting rooms with doorways. If your family has 4 people, you will choose a garden room Because two garden rooms have a connecting doorway Today, Vinh is on vacation alone, so I only choose Ocean Villa I will show you This is Bai Sao that people often mention. If you follow Vinh regularly, every time Vinh goes to Phu Quoc, Vinh always checks in Bai Sao Because for Vinh, Bai Sao is the most beautiful beach in Phu Quoc This site is located in the south of Phu Quoc Island. Everyone can see that the beach is beautiful. Vinh loves the coconut trees and swings here You can take pictures. How beautiful is this place! To take pictures with the swing, you have to pay 20,000 VND per person. You can take pictures in any situation and there is no time limitation. If you are a guest of the resort La Veranda, you will have a connection with this restaurant You don't need to pay the beach umbrella rental fee The beach umbrella rental fee costs 50,000 VND per person If you are a guest of La veranda resort, I don't need to pay for this service. At this place, people play a lot of games in addition to shooting activities From afar, Vinh sees everyone playing jet skiing. The sea today has a few big waves. Normally, Vinh travels to Bai Sao, which has a clear sea and we can go offshore. The sea is very shallow. But for today, the waves are big But it's still very beautiful. I have come to the Rach Vem - Ganh Dau The sea here is clear and beautiful This place is famous for its beautiful starfishes. You can take pictures, have lunch, and swim here. You can see that the sea today is gorgeous At noon, Vinh will have lunch right on the fish raft In this area, you will find fish rafts built along the beach You can eat seafood and have meals right on it Currently, Vinh sees a lot of starfishes at the foot of the bridge. Under the clear water, I can see it right now. Starfish density will depend on the season. If you travel during the starfish season Starfish will grow on the sandy beaches along the coast, so you can take pictures The fish rafts in this area have the same food. You just have to choose the sight that you like Vinh comes here and orders "herring" Salad, a speciality of Phu Quoc. This gonna be so delicious There are fish, onion, coconut, and vegetables The rice paper is very soft and big. My previous roll is huge One thing I like is that eating at the raft is almost fresh seafood. Things around Vinh are fishing nets with fresh grouper, shrimp, and seafood It's like the market at table This is a large plate fried of squid, priced at 225,000 VND per half a kilogram. This dish is served with white rice. Vinh ordered a "grouper" about more than 1 kilogram T make two more dishes: Vietnamese sour soup and braised grouper. eat with white rice Grouper in this raft is priced at 500,000 VND per kilogram. [Man]: Give two bottles of Sai Gon beer to table number 3, please [Vinh]: You now have general information on food prices here At this place, you can find starfishes Starfishes appear mostly from November to May each year. It is the starfishes season In the rainy season, starfishes are more likely to live under the sea than on the coast During the peak season in which people travel, there are hundreds of starfishes I can see one, two, three starfishes Vinh encourages everyone to watch the starfish, don't touch it because it is sensitive Touching the starfish might kill it. We just look and take a picture, don't touch it [Man]: Tinh Wellness Spa with the philosophy of the connecting body-mind - wisdom for customers [Man]: Because based on such philosophy, from space design, equipment [Man]: All equipment can help customers return to their life in the most balanced way.

[Man]: There is an infrared sauna here, an extremely modern equipment [Vinh]: this room is so mysterious [Vinh]: let's come in here and sit [Vinh]: the surrounding room is made of wood very beautiful [Vinh]: This room is the kind of sauna, right? [Man]: Exactly, this room is used as a sauna, but it is used with infrared rays [Man]: It helps us destroy the bacteria around our body [Man]: Besides, it will promote blood vessel circulation under the skin [It will help me relieve stress after going to the steam for about 30 minutes [Man]: Then, It will have us through treatments to balance the energy sources inside our body [Man]: According to Vietnamese traditional medicine treatments [Man]: There are always yin and yang in our body [Man]: in which five elements are corresponding to our five internal organs [Man]: Also, in which the five internal organs correspond to five positive emotions and five negative emotions [Man]; When we balance our internal functions [Man]: It helps our organs to function properly again [Man]: It both balances energy sources and promotes positive energies [Vinh]: hmm... [Vinh]: It feels like very profound [Vinh]: People can find elsewhere merely relaxing massages [Vinh]: we only go couples or families [Vinh]: But Vinh finds here more in-depth relaxation [Man]: That's true [Vinh]: This is a full-service package [Vinh]: Not only beauty and massage but also with the kind of food and drink we like [Man]: Exactly [Vinh]: Everything is prepared in a package. [Man]: All the things... [Vinh]: A journey that balances our body [Man]: A balanced journey that enables Vinh to regain internal balance within your body [Man]: For every human body, it always has a balance [Man]: It consists of three elements It includes three factors: body - purpose, desire - wisdom to help us develop ourselves better [Man]: it is because we always have too limited desires We take too much material seriously Generally, we forget to take care of our bodies [Man]: The human body is like daily machinery, which reports to us daily [Man]: But we never read that report, we just follow the dream of the future. [Man]: When we have problems, we look back to the past without ever paying attention to the present [Man]: Present is what we can do, we can change. [Man]: It can make our future better or worse, All determined by the present, not in the past It is also not in the future delusion. [Vinh]: Thank you very much for sharing knowledge that Vinh does not know [Vinh]: I hope the audience will have lots of useful information If you really want to experience this journey In addition to relaxation and fresh food at the resort Tourists can also try this package or other programs If you want to take care of your body and soul [Vinh]: This is an infrared sauna. This is the first time Vinh experiences In this room, the temperature is 44 degrees Celsius right now. [Vinh]: Vinh doesn't feel very hot, but normally, wet or dry sauna are quite popular already But this is the frist time I know infrared method [Man]: For this room, we can increase the maximum temperature to 70 degrees [Man]: But for the ability to withstand human body heat we should only choose the temperature that's right for our body [Man]: The first thing I can help the body to balance the amount of water in the body It pushes the water out, making the blood vessels circulate better. After we are in such a harsh environment That will be a challenge for our body At that time, we will have internal struggles: Should I continue or go out here? [Man]: I have enough heatings, so let's go outside Every time we fight internally, we could think a little bit more That is when we push negative emotions out of our bodies. We can push it up so that we'll move into the therapy to make our brain more secure calmer We feel more comfortable with massage therapy to balance the energy in our body it will also promote positive energy sources for the body [Vinh]: Vinh feels the temperature is getting hotter, but it's very comfortable No discomfort like steam or dry The panel control is 15 minutes, 43 degrees [Vinh]: It depends on the temperature tolerance of each human body [Vinh]: If we raise the temperature up, it will be better [Man]: That's true [Vinh]: Also, the time adjustment A normal steam bath takes only 3 to 4 minutes. But let Vinh try this method for 15 minutes. It's quite interesting!!! Thank you for watching Vinh's entire journey Vinh thinks that you probably saw a lot of activities in Phu Quoc Vinh went to Phu Quoc many times already However, each time there are many new things to film for the audience On this trip, Vinh went from the North to the South of the island The whole Phu Quoc island has many interesting experiences.
